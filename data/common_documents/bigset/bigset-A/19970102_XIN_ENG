<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Holds New Year Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Association for
Celebrating Hong Kong's Return to China held a grand cocktail
party here today to celebrate the coming of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 local celebrities including Chief Executive
designate of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) Tung Chee Hwa attended the party.
</P>
<P>
Tung said when addressing the party that the year 1997 is quite
special, because it marks the beginning of a new era. This is the
time Hong Kong people should celebrate and be happy about.
</P>
<P>
He said there are many things to celebrate in the year: the
great step forward in the country's unification, the prosperity of
the Chinese nation, an even better future for Hong Kong, the
ending of colonial rule in Hong Kong and her return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
He also told the press that the organizing of the SAR
government will be carried out step by step on the basis of broad
consultation. In the past few days, he has met with a number of
senior civil servants to seek their advice.
</P>
<P>
"Everything should be carried out in favor of Hong Kong's
smooth transition, this is the most important point," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Association Henry Fok Ying-tung also delivered
a speech at the party.
</P>
<P>
The association has had 1,500 members and has so far raised a
fund of some 70 million Hong Kong dollars (8.97 million US
dollars). It will organize a series of major activities to
celebrate the handover of Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Minister on Challenges Facing Govt in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa said the government's biggest challenge in 1997
is to reduce the high unemployment rate, indigenise the economy
and redress the land imbalance.
</P>
<P>
At a New Year's Eve party, Murerwa called on indigenous groups
to work together for the indigenous programme to work, the
Zimbabwe National News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Indigenisation is going to be the government's priority in
1997," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said the Zimbabwean government is committed to the
indigenisation program but cannot do it alone. "There is a need
for networking among indigenous groups. We must have a national
outlook to indigenisation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the blacks and whites in Zimbabwe
should work together towards indigenising the economy.
</P>
<P>
Other challenges the government will be facing include job
creation and the land issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's unemployment rate currently stood at 50 percent,
which was worsened by more than 300,000 school leavers entering
the job market each year when only 20,000 jobs are created
annually.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa said 1996 was a "momentous year" because of good rains
which contributed to an economic growth of 8 percent and the
reduction of inflation from 26 percent to 13 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Debt Service Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's external debt service
ratio had declined to 21 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (gdp) by the end of November 1996, down from 56 percent
of the same period in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
This was achieved despite the withdrawal of balance of payment
support by some donor countries who were not pleased with
political developments in the country, according to the Ministry
of Finance and Economic Development today.
</P>
<P>
It signifies the government's adherence to the policy of debt
reduction to a manageable ratio so as to depend less on donors.
</P>
<P>
Zambia spend 153 million U.S. Dollars on debt service between
January and October 1996, according to the latest issue of
"Zambia Fortnightly Statistics" published by the Bank of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The country's external debt has grown from 654 million U.S.
Dollars in 1970 to 7.2 billion U.S. Dollars in 1991 and then
declined to 6.6 billion U.S. Dollars in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The National Railways of
Zimbabwe (NRZ) has increased its passenger fares by between
20-40 percent with effect from today to offset ever
increasing running costs.
</P>
<P>
NRZ spokesman Gamaliel Rungani confirmed that the decision to
include bedding charges for first and second class travelers in
the new fares is to make it more convenient for travelers who
currently were required to buy traveling and bedding tickets
separately.
</P>
<P>
But other officials said the bedding facility was being
under-utilised as most travelers opted to bring their own
blankets and the decision to include bedding charges in the new
fares is a way of marketing the facility.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Begins 'Door-to-door' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian exporters from today
can deliver their goods directly to the Israelis without
unloading them to be checked near the borders.
</P>
<P>
The "door-to-door" arranmgement, which took effect today, was
signed last November by Jordan and Israel to replace a
"back-to-back" system under which all Jordanian goods entering
Israel had to be offloaded on the Jordan's side of the border
crossings and reloaded after Israeli inspections onto Israeli
vehicles on the other side.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Transport Nasser Lawzi has said that
the "door-to-door" arrangement allows the direct transport of
goods across the Jordan Valley and the Wadi Arab crossings all
week days except Fridays and Saturdays, Jordan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, large vehicles will be issued
extendible three-day entry permission at the crossing points. If
the driver of the vehicle could not return to his country on the
same day, he should call the nearest police station to register
his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
The driver should also hold a valid license, passport and
entry visa.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement was worked out after persistent efforts by
the Jordanian government following complaints by exporters that
the "back-to-back" arrangement caused undue delays and
expenses. In many cases, goods were damaged or became rotten in
the process.
</P>
<P>
The "door-to-door" arrangement is limited to Jordanian exports
to Israel now and will be applied to the flow of goods between
Jordan and the Palestinian territories at a later stage, Jordan
Times said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Israel has agreed to allow Jordanian trucks
carrying cement to the Palestinian territories to be covered
under the new arrangement. Oil shipments are also permitted, but
the actual flow of such items is expected later.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel in 1994 signed a peace agreement in which a
transport accord was also included. But Israel did not fully
implement the agreement. In the past two years, it had always
been criticized by Jordan for delaying the Jordanian exports to
Israel on purpose.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Cabinet Due To Be Reshuffled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's two-year-old military
cabinet at the head of state General Sani Abacha's beck and call
is likely to be reshuffled earlier this year, the local
"Guardian" newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Less than half of all the 36 cabinet ministers could remain
their posts, the report quoted presidential sources as saying,
adding that ministers who have introduced reforms to make
government more popular are expected to retain.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, few ministers will be retained on
their current posts, some will be reassigned and many dropped.
</P>
<P>
It would be the second reshuffle by Abacha since he took
office on November 17, 1993. The first took place in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The move is said to aim to strengthen the federal
"administrative machinery as the transition program gets to its
critical stage."
</P>
<P>
However, the time table is still undecided, partly because the
1997 state budget is yet to be made public, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The military government reappointed all the 30 state
administrators in August, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Five opposition parties registered in last October called, in
a statement late December, on Abacha to curb official
meddlesomeness in state politics.

<HEADLINE> New York State Hospitals Start Open Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Hospitals in New York State
will start open competition under a new law which takes effect as
of today.
</P>
<P>
The new law lifts price controls on hospitals and forces them
to compete in an increasingly cutthroat health care market,
according to a New York Times report today.
</P>
<P>
The report described the change in the medical system as one of
"the most turbulent ever." "No state has ever undergone this level
of deregulation before," an expert said.
</P>
<P>
For the last 15 years, state regulators have fixed what
hospitals could charge the insurers and health maintenance
organizations that send them patients, a system that critics said
removed the incentives for hospitals to hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, every hospital and insurer in New York is
free to negotiate their own deals. For hospitals and insurers
accustomed to the security of fixed rates, it has been a bit like
learning to swim by being dumped into strange swirling seas, the
newspaper commented.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is for insurance rates to come down and for hospitals
to be healthier and more self-reliant," Dr. Barbara DeBuono, the
New York State Commissioner of Health, was quoted as saying. "I
think this will be a much healthier industry in the long run. But
I'm frank about there being bumps in the road at the beginning,"
DeBuono added.

<HEADLINE> US Denounces Israeli Soldier's Shootings in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
expressed shock at an Israeli soldier's shootings in the West
Bank, and a White House spokeswoman said President Bill Clinton
called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to express condolences.
</P>
<P>
"The president is outraged and saddened by this morning's
incident in Hebron," according to an AP report quoting deputy
White House press secretary Mary Ellen Glynn at Hilton Head
Island, South Carolina state.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an Israeli soldier armed with an M16
automatic rifle opened fire on Palestinians in Hebron's
marketplace, during which at least 11 Palestinians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman noted President Clinton called Arafat, but did
not speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She said
the U.S. envoy in the region, Dennis Ross, had met with Netanyahu
after the shooting and was expected to meet with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was briefed on the West Bank shootings before he left
the beach home on Hilton Head Island.
</P>
<P>
"The president condemns this cowardly act, which was clearly
designed to make it more difficult to conclude an agreement on
Israeli deployment from Hebron," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"The best answer to this action would be for the two sides to
close the remaining gaps and move forward with the hard work of
forging a durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Condemns Terrorist Shooting, Calling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- To offset repercussions of
the terrorist shooting today, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu strongly condemned the incident while calling for calm
and continuation of peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today after an Israeli soldier shot and wounded 6
Palestinians in a central Hebron market, Netanyahu phoned
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat to express
his regrets and condemnation of the "criminal act."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Netanyahu once again clearly
condemned this terrorist attack. "We condemn it, we repudiate it
completely this despicable crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called on both Israelis and Palestinians to act
with restraint and responsibility to avoid escalating the
tension. He said Israel was doing whatever possible to restore
the law and order in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Hebron is running high today and dozens of
Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers near the hospital
in Hebron where the wounded received treatment. Israel feared
the retaliation by Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing those who attempted to derail Israeli troop
pullback from Hebron, Netanyahu reiterated the importance of
securing speedy conclusion of a Hebron agreement. "No crime can
stop us from doing so," he said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day, Netanyahu has held several consulations
with cabinet ministers and security heads on offsetting the
negative effects of today's shooting on the nearly-concluded
Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli Defense Minister Mordechai and Army Chief of
Staff Lipkin Shahak today toured Hebron, which has been under
curfew imposed by Israeli troops. Mordechai also met with
Palestinian Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natsche to discuss the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai promised Israel would continue talks with the PA to
wrap up the Hebron agreement. "I hope, in a very short time, we
will complete the negotiations, and after we signed the
agreement, the army will be redeployed in a very short time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Fearing the Palestinian side could tough its demand in Hebron
talks after the terrorist incident, the Israeli government also
made it clear that it would make no new concessions. One
remaining dispute blocking a deal was Israel's objection to
Palestinian demand for joint security patrols near the Tomb of
Patriachs, the holy shrine for both Jews and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office said Netanyahu had told Arafat
that terrorist crimes were committed by both Israelis and
Palestinians, so the PA should not use this as excuse to force
Israel to make more concessions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross today conveyed a message from
U.S. President Bill Clinton to express shock and dismay over the
terrorist act and call on both sides to push forward the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross went to Gaza to meet with Arafat late today after
holding consulations with Netanyahu and other Israeli officials
in a bid to find ways to conclude the much-waited Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ross is striving to arrange an Arafat-Netanyahu summit to
initial the Hebron deal. Meanwhile, Palestinian negotiators
delayed today's talks on Hebron due to the shooting, but they
said the negotiations could possibly resume tonight.

<HEADLINE> UK Engineering Industry Likely to Lose 400,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's engineering industry is
likely to lose up to 400,000 jobs over the next decade through
technological and product change, according to a forecast by the
Engineering Employers' Federation.
</P>
<P>
The forecast, which is due to be published later this month,
will reveal the results a long-term strategic review of the future
of the engineering industry across the country.
</P>
<P>
Based on an extensive survey of engineering company chief
executives and training job development professionals, the
forecast will focus on the shape of the engineering industry until
the year 2010, steering clear of business changes resulting from
the economic cycle.
</P>
<P>
In overall terms, the review will suggest that the prospects
for engineering in Britain look reasonably optimistic and the
country is likely to focus increasingly on the higher-value
computer-based control and systems products rather than
traditional metal-bashing.
</P>
<P>
The review is to predict a decline in Britain's engineering
workforce from its current level of about 1.6 million people to
1.2 million, a cut of 400,000 jobs by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The profile of the remaining engineering workforce will change
significantly with a sharp reduction in the number of unskilled
and semi-skilled jobs.

Protection Organization today urged the government to formulate
policies and issue regulations to protect wildlives in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The organization's Manager Gebremarkos Woldeselasse said lives
of certain animals are endangered as their habitats are being
converted to agricultural and ranch lands.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''menelik'' bushbuck, nyala, wallia, red fox, zebra
and korke are among the rare animals whose very existance is
endangered. Twenty-one mamals, 17 bird species and two
invertebrates endemic to Ethiopia are now threatened to the point
of extinction.
</P>
<P>
The present land allotment in Abayata Shala, Awash, Babile,
Omo, Mago and other parks is damaging the ecology, in addition to
posing a threat to the lives of the animals, the manager said.
</P>
<P>
Woldeselasse stressed that these invaluable and rare wildlives
will disappear in a short span of time unless the government
urgently formulate policies and issue regulations to protect
them.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll of PKK Rebels Rises to 72 in Turkey's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the rebels of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) has risen to 72 in the
cross-border operations by Turkish security forces in northern
Iraq in the past two days, according to an army statement today.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the General Staff of the Turkish Armed
Forces said that the Turkish Armed Forces have been continuing
the cross-border military operations in northern Iraq despite the
bad weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Turkish security forces killed
eight PKK rebels in Nusaybin town in Mardin province bordering
Syria and captured three rebels including two Syrian nationals,
said the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkish F-4 fighters taking off from the air base in
Diyarbakir, southeastern Turkey, had bombarded three PKK camps in
Sinath region, 10 kilometers deep into northern Iraq early this
morning in the cross-border operations which started Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 Turkish troops and village guards attacked the
PKK militants who tried to flee from Sindi throat in northern
Iraq following the bombardment of the Cobra helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops have entered into northern Iraq for several
times in attempts to destroy the military bases from where the
PKK guerrillas launch cross-border raids against Turkish military
and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government, which has been deprived of the control
over northern Kurdish area by the allied forces, has made
protests against the Turkish operations before, accusing Turkey
of violation of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security forces have killed 13,255 rebels, wounded 244
and captured about 2,000 since August 1984 when the PKK started a
guerrilla war for more autonomy in southeastern Turkey, according
to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Over 21,000 people including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops have been killed in the conflicts in the
region.

<HEADLINE> UK Weathers Coldest New Year's Day for Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain weathered one of the
coldest New Year's Days for nearly two decades, which left many
roads impassable, claimed several lives and postponed dozens of
football games.
</P>
<P>
According to the London Weather Center, the windchill factor
brought the temperature in the capital down to -12C on the New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
In London, the chimes of Big Ben, one of its tourist
attractions were silenced for more than two hours when the
mechanism froze Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 people braved sub-zero temperatures to
celebrate the new year in Trafalgar Square at the center of London
on the New Year's Eve, despite falling snow, an alcohol ban and
police's annual appeal to the public to stay away.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Trafalgar Square is the focus of London
celebrations with people there singing, dancing and kissing each
other on the stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
Another 20,000 more merrymakers filled the surrounding streets.
They shivered and shook as they celebrated the approaching of the
new year.
</P>
<P>
There were 21 arrests as numbers swelled in the countdown to
1997, mainly for drunk and disorderly behavior, others for
possessing an offensive weapon.
</P>
<P>
Snowfall was close to the records, with nearly five inches near
Eastbourne, East Sussex, the heaviest fall in the south of England
since l981.
</P>
<P>
The windchill factor from Russia was making it feel much
colder, and snow and ice were making driving hazardous in many
areas. North Yorkshire was declared an emergency area as
snowploughs and gritters worked to keep roads open.
</P>
<P>
On the A36 near Bath, a 26-year-old driver from Trowbridge,
Wiltshire, died in a head-on collision thought to have been caused
by ice.
</P>
<P>
In Caversham, near Reading, an elderly woman was killed when
she slipped on an icy pavement, fell into the road and was run
over by a car.
</P>
<P>
In Bristol, a 64-year-old man was killed by a car as he walked
in the road with his wife to avoid slippery pavements.
</P>
<P>
The cold weather ruined the New Year's Day program, with 23
Premiership and Football League games. The icy spell is also
threatening to ruin the weekend's FA Cup games scheduled for
Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures are not expected to rise above a maximum of 0C
(32F) today. Most areas will be colder with the windchill factor
adding to the bleak outlook.
</P>
<P>
A London Weather Center spokeswoman said, "We are likely to see
it very cold with some snow, a few flakes for a lot of people
rather than huge falls."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Stresses Peace ,Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni today stressed peace and stability in his new year
address to the nation.
</P>
<P>
In his address delivered from his home at Rwakitura,
southwestern Uganda, Museveni said peace and stability are two
basic interests of all the citizens of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of security, he called upon all leaders in the
areas of insurgency to educate the people about the real nature
of the insurgency, adding that it is unfortunate that some people
have been tricked into fighting a proxy war, whose objectives and
consequences they do not understand.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his determination to fulfill the contract he
made with the people of Uganda in his election manifesto last May
on development and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the regional issues, he regretted the bombing of
Ugandan territory by Sudan, a sign that the Sudanese government is
not serious about peace despite the agreement signed between the
two countries for the settlement of disputes.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite this bad signal from Sudan, Uganda will
continue with the peace process and expressed gratitude to the
governments of Iran, Malawi and Libya for their anticipation in
the peace-making process.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern about the situation in Burundi and
Zaire and reiterated Uganda's commitment to the resolutions of
the Arusha summit.
</P>
<P>
He ensured the whole region and those involved in the conflict
that Uganda is not involved in the conflict in Zaire, and that
Uganda's only wish is to see peace and stability re-established in
the whole region so that there can be development.

<HEADLINE> Import Tax Harmonized Between Tanzania Mainland, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Union and
Isles governments have harmonized import tax for five key
commodities effective today.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here today by Acting Minister for Finance
Daniel Yona listed the commodities as rice, wheat flour, sugar,
cooking oil and Khanga.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the move is designed to plug loopholes
for tax evasion through the Zanzibar Isles route and expected to
strengthen the revenue position of the two governments.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar route had been a controversial subject for
several years, with claims that the union government was losing
at least 6 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 10 million U.S.
Dollars) a month in revenue through tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, however, that new rates to be applied will
be announced shortly.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the rates will be worked out in a manner that is
going to minimize adverse effects on consumer prices and revenue
position for any of the two governments.

<HEADLINE> Outgoing UN Chief Returns Home Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing U.N. Secretary General
Boutros Boutros Ghali will return home Friday after finishing a
five-year term at the helm of the world body, with
Undersecretary-General Kofi Annan of Ghana replacing him today.
</P>
<P>
Ghali's expected 10-year reign was cut in half after his
renomination for a second five-year term was vetoed by the U.S.,
while the other 14 members of the Security Council supported him.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who has been working with the world body for 30 years
and is the first U.N. chief to assume the office from inside,
promised to make the United Nations more open and work to resolve
all its financial problems.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, who once said "the member states still don't know what
role they want from the U.N.," only wished "good luck to the
U.N. and happy new year" on New Year's eve, also his last day in
office.
</P>
<P>
He is going to put final touches on his book on the
Egyptian-Israeli peace negotiations and the peace initiative in
November 1977.
</P>
<P>
For someone born in a 100-room Cairo palace and accustomed to
a starring role in the diplomatic circle, this marks an abrupt
end to an illustrious career.
</P>
<P>
When U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher proposed a
one-year extension earlier 1996, the Egyptian reportedly rebuffed
it by asking whether he was being offered "a tip."
</P>
<P>
His grandfather, former Prime Minister Boutros Pasha Ghali,
was assassinated in 1910 when Britain was Egypt's colonial ruler.
</P>
<P>
Ghali held the rank of deputy prime minister for foreign
affairs in 1991 after more than 13 years as minister of state for
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
He accompanied the late President Anwar Sadat on his historic
trip to Jerusalem in 1977. He then played a key role at the Camp
David talks that led to the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ghali became embroiled in a well-publicized row with the
Security Council after six months on the job when he complained
that too much was being spent on U.N. peacekeeping in Bosnia and
too little to assist starvation-stricken Somalia.
</P>
<P>
To Africa, he said, Yugoslavia appeared to be "the war of the
rich."
</P>
<P>
Despite U.S. criticism, he is widely credited with having done
more to streamline the organization than most of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. was owed more than 2 billion U.S. dollars in unpaid
budget dues and peacekeeping costs, more than half of it by the
United States. This is part of the reason behind his dismissal by
the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
He was the first secretary-general appointed in the post-Cold
War era. The U.N. mounted 26 operations between 1989 and 1996,
compared with 15 relatively simple monitoring missions during the
previous 40 years.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Crime rate in Tanzania
has increased by nearly six percent, a statement by the Inspector
General of Police (IGP) Omar Mahita said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a report signed by Commissioner of Police W.
Mwansasu on behalf of the IGP, there were 238,200 reported crimes
in the country between January and June last year, compared to
225,017 reported cases in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
"There have been 13,183 more crimes, which represents a 5.8
percent increase," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The IGP warned in the statement against the habit of setting
on fire people suspected to have committed crimes, saying that
such acts are illegal and punishable by law.
</P>
<P>
"The police would like to remind people to abide by the laws
of the land. When suspects are caught, they should be sent to the
police and let the law take its course," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat-Netanyahu Summit Likely Today, Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
expected to meet today, but they may not sign the Hebron deal,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held an eight-hour
meeting with Palestinian senior officials Abu Mazen throughout
the night at the Herzliya home of U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk
in the presence of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The talks was held after the terrorist shooting in Hebron
earlier Wednesday in which an Israeli soldier shot and wounded
seven Palestinians in the central Market. Both sides condemned
the terrorist act and promised to continue the ongoing peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said after the talks that an Arafat-Netanyahu
summit would possibly be held late today, but several outstanding
issues remained to be resolved before the Hebron agreement could
be signed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Palestinian side should not try to
reopen talks on issues that have been closed. Israeli officials
feared that the Palestinian side might make new demands for
security reasons following the shooting incident Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, issues of concern to the Palestinians include
obtaining a firm date for the last Israeli troop pullback from
the West Bank, the gradual release of prisoners and a Palestinian
presence at the Tomb of Patriachs, the holy shrine for both Jews
and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side especially insisted on its demand for
joint patrol near the holy shrine in order to protect the safety
of Palestinian worshipers. Hebron, where 450 Jewish settlers
live among 120,000 Palestinians, has been a hotbed for
Israeli-Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Before the Wednesday shooting, a Jewish settler named Baruch
Goldstein killed 29 Palestinian worshipers and wounded dozens of
other in a similar shooting spree in February 1994 at the Tomb
of Patriachs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who is now visiting India,
stressed the urgency of speedy conclusion of the long-delayed
agreement on Israeli troop pullback from Hebron. He asked
Mordechai Wednesday to convey a message to Arafat to express
regret for the shooting incident which he described as "a stupid
and wicked act."
</P>
<P>
Ross acted quickly after the Wednesday shooting by holding
separate meetings with Netanyahu and Arafat to offset the
possible repercussion of the incident on the Hebron talks. He
said the incident underscored quick action on concluding a deal
on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned Arafat Wednesday to
express "outrage and sadness" at the incident. Israeli sources
said that during their phone conversation, Clinton urged Arafat to
wrap up the Hebron talks.

<HEADLINE> Flights Delayed In Northeast China Because Of Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A snowstorm that hit northeast
China's Liaoning Province in the past two days has delayed flights
and temporarily halted railway and highway traffic.
</P>
<P>
Seven flights of Shenyang's North China Airlines could still
not return as late as 6:00 P.M. today, and other flights at
Shenyang's Taoxian International Airport were delayed, a spokesman
of the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) told Xinhua
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow also delayed other planes bound for major
northeastern cities, he said, but that the situation should
improve if the bad weather does not last.
</P>
<P>
Railway traffic in Liaoning, which was temporarily disrupted,
has returned to normal, according to the Shenyang Railway Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The snowstorm that began New Year's eve was said to be the
biggest in three years, and brought temperatures down to 17
degrees below zero centigrade.
</P>
<P>
In Shenyang, Anshan, and other cities, traffic police braved
bitter cold to direct traffic, while students and residents took
to the streets to scrape away snow and ice.
</P>
<P>
The power, heat, and gas departments and vegetable suppliers

<HEADLINE> Hebron Remains Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Hebron is reportedly quiet
today, one day after an Israeli soldier opened fire to a crowd of
Palestinians in the center of the West Bank town, wounding at
least seven people.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces have beefed up the security in Hebron, as
armored personnel carriers were placed at key points around the
city, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Noam Friedman, the soldier who carried out the
attack Wednesday, remained in custody, as police and the
General Security Services are trying to find out more about
the man and the motive of his actions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media revealed that Friedman had mental problems.
</P>
<P>
Friedman joined army several months ago, and after some basic
training, he was assigned to a guarding unit at an army base on
the outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The oldest of four children, Friedman lived with his parents in
the Jewish settlement town of Ma'aleh Adumim north of
Jerusalem. He returns home every evening from his base except when
on duty.
</P>
<P>
From a Jewish family, Friedman studied, before his eventually
call-up to the army, in a number of Yeshivas, Jewish religious
seminaries, in the Jerusalem area.
</P>
<P>
Press reports today quoted several rabbis, or Jewish priests,
and people who know him, as saying that Friedman had shown strange
behaviors for some years.
</P>
<P>
A psychologist at Ma'aleh Adumim, who treated him, reportedly
sent a letter to the army, suggesting serious consideration on
Friedman's enlisting and entitlement to carrying weapon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army's military police have also been ordered to open
investigations into Friedman, particularly into the circumstances
of his call up into the army.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets With Sudanese Opposition Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today held talks with Sadek el-Mahdi, former Sudanese premier and
leader of the Sudanese opposition Umma Party.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi arrived here Friday for a ten-day visit at the first
leg of his three-month Arab and European tour.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Sudanese opposition leader met with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and expounded to him the target of
this tour and the situation in Sudan, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the second meeting between Mubarak and a Sudanese
opposition chief within four days. The Egyptian president Monday
met with Mohamed Othman al-Merghani, leader of the Sudanese
Democratic Alliance, which is the gathering of Sudanese opposition
parties working in exile.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mahdi slipped out of Khartoum to Eritrea, the
base of Sudanese opposition operations against the Sudanese
government led by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who ousted
Mahdi in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has accused Sudan of having orchestrated the 1995 failed
attempt on the life of the Egyptian president in Addis Ababa and
granting asylum to Egyptian extremists. Tensions escalated as
Sudan's demand to have larger Nile water quota sparked loud outcry
from Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hiked Fertilizer Prices Worry Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Farmers and farm union officials
across Zambia are complaining about the increased fertilizer
prices, which they said could lead a food shortage in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Zambian Agricultural Ministry raised the
fertilizer prices for the 1996-97 season from the previous
equivalent of 15 U.S. Dollars and 16 U.S. Dollars for a
50-kilogram bag of basal and top dressing fertilizer respectively
to 23 U.S. Dollars and 38 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prices are varying from district to district and are also
lower for cash transactions and higher on credit.
</P>
<P>
Farmers across the country are concerned over the hiked prices
as well as the absence of fertilizers in some places.
</P>
<P>
In Chibombo, central Zambia, they said about 100 hectares of
maize may go to waste due to the lack of fertilizer, blaming it
on the government's failure to deliver fertilizer and provide
credit facilities on time.
</P>
<P>
A government official described the problem as a disaster
because the majority of farmers simply don't have money to buy
the fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
He added that even those with money but living in remote areas
are unable to secure fertilizer because it is mainly found on the
black market in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Another official from a farmers' association said farmers
could not afford fertilizer at the new prices, warning that there
will be a terrible fall in maize production this year.
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need for the government to review their
policy," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The same concern was raised by Zambia National Farmers Union,
noting that in some places, farmers have abandoned maize growing
because of lack of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government attributed the high prices to the
depreciation of the local currency, Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Agriculture Ackson Sejani rebuked the
farming community for complaining at the new fertilizer prices,
telling them to diversify farming if maize production is an
expensive venture.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers are very slow to grasp that. If it doesn't make
economic sense to plant maize they could just plant enough to
feed the family or change to other crops like soya beans and
cotton which are fast selling," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sejani said his ministry will hold a meeting later this month
with all farmers' unions and associations, private importers and
other stake holders to iron out the fertilizer issue and work out
a sustainable credit scheme.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Needs to Reduce Budget Deficit: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan should reduce its
budget deficit to at least 3 percent of its gross domestic product
(GDP) to ensure sustained socio-economic growth, a high Pakistani
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We can live with a budget deficit of 3 percent and anything
more than that will create problems," Shahid Burki, the prime
minister's advisor on finance and economic affairs, told the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) asked Pakistan to reduce
its budget deficit to 4 percent of the GDP if it wants to get
loans from the fund.
</P>
<P>
Burki said the government has to get loans from IMF under
certain conditions, because the choice is to get them or go
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Pakistan, the tax elasticity is only 0.88 and
the government has to have a tax base which expands by bringing
new items and people under the tax net.
</P>
<P>
"We would have to have the political courage to tax agriculture
to help close the resource gap, besides taxing retail trade,
transport and small industry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production, which makes up 25 percent of the GDP,
contributes little to the revenue as successive governments did
not take strong measures to ask big landlords to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
Burki said the government is following a three-pronged strategy
to stabilize the economy by making structural changes, alleviating
poverty and improving human resources.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the government keeps postponing tough decisions
in regard to structural changes, the country will have to go
through an economic crisis after every two to three years.
</P>
<P>
After coming to power on November 5 last year, the caretaker
government set economic reforms as one of its top priorities.
</P>
<P>
A number of economic reform measures have been announced to
restructure banking and other economic sectors and realize
macro-economic stabilization.
</P>
<P>
Bank borrowing for budget support has been reduced by 12
billion rupees (300 million U.S. dollars) since the caretaker
government took office.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Literacy Rate Increases to 39 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's literacy rate has
increased from 35 percent in 1991 to 39 percent in 1995-96, says a
survey presented here today.
</P>
<P>
The report on the Pakistan Integrated Household Survey (PIHS)
presented by the Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) said the
percentage of the population over 10 years of age attending school
increased from 47 percent in 1991 to 52 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Gross enrollment in primary schools stands at 74 percent in
1995-96, virtually no change since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Net enrollment in primary schools fell slightly from 46 percent
in 1991 to 44 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Girls primary enrollment as a percentage of total enrollment
rose from 39 percent in 1991 to 42 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Some 16 percent of children left school before completing
primary education, not much change from that of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Student-teacher ratio is 30 students per teacher in girls' and
34 in boys' schools.
</P>
<P>
The report on the PIHS contains information on basic education,
primary health, population welfare and rural water supply and
sanitation.

The survey covers about 12,800 households from which data have
been collected on a number of different topics.

The second phase of construction, which was begun in July 1996,
helped the province reach its goal of providing the service to all
cities above the county level by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
When its second phase of construction is completed by March
this year, the digital mobile communication service is expected to
reach many towns and main lines of communication.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Probably to Reopen Embassy in Kabul: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will probably reopen
its embassy in Kabul, a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly briefing at the Foreign Office, the
spokesman said that Pakistan technically has the embassy in Kabul
but the premises were damaged in the past.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan closed down its embassy in Kabul soon after September
6, 1995, when thousands of protesters destroyed the embassay,
accusing Pakistan of supporting the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pakistani government has been denying such
allegations and reiterating its neutrality in the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said at the briefing that Pakistan has not
formally recognized the Taliban regime in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's dealing with the ousted Afghan government led by
Burhanuddin Rabbani had come to an end because Rabbani had no more
authority in Kabul, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported today that Pakistan is planning to reopen
its embassy in Kabul in the near future and will become the first
country to have a diplomatic presence in the Afghan capital which
fell to the Taliban on September 27, 1996.

<HEADLINE> China Develops First Tourist Guide Robot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the Robot
Research Institute of Harbin Polytechnical University have
developed China's first robot that performs the duties of a
tourist guide.
</P>
<P>
The robot, which looks like a short spaceman, is 1.1 meters
tall and weighs 17 kilograms, and travels 120 cm per second,
according to Science and Technology Daily.
</P>
<P>
It speaks several languages, including Chinese, English,
Russian and Japanese, and can identify tourist spots with the help
of a sort of radar, an infrared sensor, and a photoelectric switch
in its head.
</P>
<P>
If someone is in the robot's path, he can say, "Please get out
of the way," and after the person moves he is always careful to
say "thank you."
</P>
<P>
If he encounters a barrier, he makes a detour.
</P>
<P>
According to professor Wang Shuguo, one of the robot's
inventors, it can act as a tourist guide, a shopping guide, or do
work for commercial or service departments.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Prices of petrol and diesel went
up by between four and nine percent in Zimbabwe with effect from
January 1, barely three months after the last round of price
increases.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources today said that the highest increase is for
petrol which jumped from 0.42 U.S. Dollar to 0.46 Dollar per
litre, reflecting an increase of nine percent.
</P>
<P>
Diesel prices rose 0.15 U.S. Dollar per litre to 0.35 Dollar
while prices for other petroleum products remained fixed.
</P>
<P>
The latest price increases, which caught most motorists
unawares, had been necessitated by a sharp increase in import
duty for the products, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Most of Zimbabwe's petroleum products are imported from the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The increase is the fourth since April last year when prices
for petrolum products went up by between three and 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hiked Fertilizer Prices Worry Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Farmers and farm union officials
across Zambia are complaining about the increased fertilizer
prices, which they said could lead a food shortage in the new
year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Zambian Agricultural Ministry raised the
fertilizer prices for the 1996-97 season from the previous
BAP313IFR004S02PFQL21:0421:041027
equivalent of 15 U.S. Dollars and 16 U.S. Dollars for a
50-kilogram bag of basal and top dressing fertilizer respectively
to 23 U.S. Dollars and 38 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prices are varying from district to district and are also
lower for cash transactions and higher on credit.
</P>
<P>
Farmers across the country are concerned over the hiked prices
as well as the absence of fertilizers in some places.
</P>
<P>
In Chibombo, central Zambia, they said about 100 hectares of
maize may go to waste due to the lack of fertilizer, blaming it
on the government's failure to deliver fertilizer and provide
credit facilities on time.
</P>
<P>
A government official described the problem as a disaster
because the majority of farmers simply don't have money to buy
the fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
He added that even those with money but living in remote areas
are unable to secure fertilizer because it is mainly found on the
black market in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Another official from a farmers' association said farmers
could not afford fertilizer at the new prices, warning that there
will be a terrible fall in maize production this year.
BAP314SPE012S02PEQL21:0421:040714
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgent need for the government to review their
policy," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The same concern was raised by Zambia National Farmers Union,
noting that in some places, farmers have abandoned maize growing
because of lack of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government attributed the high prices to the
depreciation of the local currency, Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Agriculture Ackson Sejani rebuked the
farming community for complaining at the new fertilizer prices,
telling them to diversify farming if maize production is an
expensive venture.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers are very slow to grasp that. If it doesn't make
economic sense to plant maize they could just plant enough to
feed the family or change to other crops like soya beans and
cotton which are fast selling," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sejani said his ministry will hold a meeting later this month
with all farmers' unions and associations, private importers and
other stake holders to iron out the fertilizer issue and work out
a sustainable credit scheme.

FREETOWN, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Tejan
Kabbah today commissioned into service a patrol gunboat granted
by China, saying it would "minimise the high rate of poaching in
Freetown's territorial waters by foreign vessels."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Kabbah said the aid reflected the

Chinese Ambassador to Sierra Leone Qu Weming said it is
important for Sierra Leone "to patrol its territorial waters in
terms of security and the conservation of valuable foreign
exchange."
</P>
<P>
Officials in Freetown said the boat, worth three million U.S.
Dollars and able to carry up to 200 security personnel, was part
of a 20 million U.S. Dollar assistance provided by China after a
high level delegation from Freetown visited Beijing in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Survey Depicts Bright Picture for HK's Banking Sector in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The latest issue of the Hong
Kong and Macao Economic Quarterly depicted a bright picture for
Hong Kong's banking sector in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A survey carried in the Quarterly, which is published by the
Bank of China Group, said that the return of Hong Kong to China
this year will generate a better operating environment for Hong
Kong's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
It predicts the growth of banking business to remain stable and
the sector to pass through the handover year smoothly despite the
existence of some unfavorable factors.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong dollar deposits is expected to grow in 1997, the GDP
will be higher than last year and more funds from foreign
countries will flow into Hong Kong after the clearing of
uncertainties regarding the handover, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
It forecasts that loans for use in Hong Kong and overseas are
expected to grow faster in 1997. A stronger demand of loans will
be found in building and construction lending, residential
mortgage lending, consumer credit, trade financing, and financing
for mainland's and neighboring countries' infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
The profitability of the banking sector should be able to reach
a new height in the handover year, it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Hong Kong's banking sector experienced a steady growth
against the background of an overall economic upturn.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Capital Market to be Bull in 1997: MIA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Investors'
Association (MIA) said today the local stock market is expected to
"steam" ahead for a further gain in 1997.
</P>
<P>
That the excess liquidity, the biggest driving force in any
financial market, amounted to 2.4 billion ringgit (about 960
million U.S. dollars) as at the end of August 1996, was good for
the capital market, MIA president PHS Lim said in a statement here
today.
</P>
<P>
"There is an even chance to see a favorable stock market for
Malaysia in 1997 especially during the first half (of 1997) due to
various factors," he said, adding the targeted 8.3 percent
economic growth rate for 1997 should augur well for the Malaysian
stock market.
</P>
<P>
He said the fear of an overheating Malaysian economy was over,
hence those foreign institutional investors who once harbored the
fear of an over-heating economy with high inflation and high
interest rates should greatly welcome the Malaysian capital market
now.
</P>
<P>
Money supply in terms of M3 for the month of November 1996 was
21.7 percent, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
He said another factor to fuel the local capital markets was
the balance of payments where Malaysia's merchandise account was
expected to register a large surplus in 1997 with higher exports.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the national bank could employ a tight monetary policy
at this juncture to stabilize interest rates. "On a long term
basis, interest rates will decline as the government may not use
such policy to combat inflation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank would mop up excess liquidity in the
market via more issues of unit trust funds.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing, construction and services sectors are
expected to perform satisfactorily in 1997 along with industries
such as stock broking, banking, gambling, health care and
medication, and transportation, according to Lim.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) main board may
see a growth of about 20 percent during the first half of 1997 to
beyond 1,300 points for the KLSE Composite Index.
</P>
<P>
The second board may undergo corrections from time to time but
"we expect it to outperform the main board for the rest of 1997,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be rotational plays in 1997, and some stocks may
appreciate sharply and we may see more takeovers in the second
board companies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lim also disclosed a new fund amounting to 500 million ringgit
(about 200 million U.S. dollars) would be set up by an
international financial institution with a local investment house
to invest in small and medium paid up capital companies listed in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"Second board stock prices are very volatile and investors who
wish to invest in such stocks must have financial holding power,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On market capitalization, Lim said, "Our market capitalization
may even exceed 1 trillion ringgit (about 400 billion U.S.
dollars) within three to four years."

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) has asked that the forthcoming peace negotiations with the
government be open to the public, the Philippine News Agency (PNA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The request was among several conditions set by the MILF to
avoid speculation about what will be discussed during the formal
negotiations set to start next week, the PNA said.
</P>
<P>
The respective technical committees of the government and the
MILF are slated to meet on January 7 to work out the talking
points prior to the formal peace negotiations at the Dawah Center
in Sultan Kudarat Town, Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Also sought by the MILF is the absence of armed security men,
whether MILF or government, at the venue of the negotiations.
There should be no armed men at the peace talks venue, the MILF
urged.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chair for military affairs, earlier
said only local cops of the Sultan Kudarat Town police force will
be allowed to provide security for the peace talks site.
</P>
<P>
"We do not need an elaborate security plan. The town's police
force is already good enough to secure the negotiators," Murad
said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the government negotiating panel, however,
remained silent on the MILF's request on security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Murad said the coming fasting month of Ramadan
should not be seen as a hindrance to the conduct of the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Muslim faithfuls will observe a month-long fast from January 10
to February 10.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing should continue its
reform and opening-up drive, enlarge foreign trade and better
utilize overseas capital, the city's acting mayor Jia Qinglin said
at a recent municipal economic conference.
</P>
<P>
Jia pointed out that the city should place more emphasis on
quality rather than quantity when using overseas capital, and
should attract overseas investment by improving the investment
environment instead of mainly relying on preferential taxation.
</P>
<P>
According to Jia, the city used 2.25 billion U.S. dollars of
overseas investment in 1996, a rise of 14.2 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The acting mayor stressed that the city should focus on
infrastructure projects that can reflect the city's role as an
international metropolis, projects that help improve shabby
residential buildings, and high-tech managerial programs.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that the city plans to create more laws and
regulations concerning overseas investment, adding that complaint
centers and telephone hotlines will be set up in the city to
better protect the legitimate rights of both foreign and Chinese

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Sets Higher Goals for Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's tourism industry is
setting higher goals for 1997 with a focus on the exploration of
more new markets and special interest events after it has gained a
strong momentum during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) recently introduced its
marketing plans for the new year, saying Thailand will strive to
attract at least 7.84 million tourist arrivals in the year, 7.4
percent higher than the estimated figure for 1996.
</P>
<P>
The TAT also set a target for the country's tourism industry to
earn 9.6 billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange this year, up 11
percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Thai tourism industry has gained a strong momentum during
the past two years when the country held a historic celebration of
King Bhumibol Adulyadej's golden jubilee.
</P>
<P>
The TAT planned to attract at least 7.2 million tourist
arrivals and earn about 8 billion dollars in 1996, but the actual
figures for the year are expected to be slightly higher.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, most of Thailand's tourism promotion
activities were launched around the core event of marking the 50th
anniversary of the king's ascension to the throne and the TAT
mainly aimed to attract tourists aged over 50, honeymoon couples
and four-member families.
</P>
<P>
This year, the TAT has made some changes in its tourism
promotion strategies, in particular by focusing more on female
tourists while continuing to consolidate its achievements over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the TAT's marketing plans for the new year, TAT
Governor Seree Angpaichitr said the efforts will be directed at
promoting the image of Thailand as a safe and high-quality tourist
destination with a great diversity of attractions.
</P>
<P>
In terms of profile targets, Thailand is to put the maximum
emphasis on attracting female tourists as it believes that females
throughout the world have shown an increasing propensity for
travel and they play a growing role in making decisions in regard
to travel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Promoting visits to Thailand by female tourists will also help
correct the negative image of sex tourism, the senior Thai tourism
official said.
</P>
<P>
Attracting honeymooners to Thailand, especially from Japan and
South Korea, is another target set by the TAT to help promote the
image of Thailand as a quality, safe and impressive tourist
destination, Seree said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the TAT this year will continue to make efforts to
attract elderly visitors, family groups, young travel fans and
Thais residing overseas.
</P>
<P>
Thailand this year will pay more attention to regional tourism
cooperation programs in the greater Mekong subregion and the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand growth triangle.
</P>
<P>
The TAT has set up the Agency for Coordinating Mekong Tourism
Activities in Bangkok this year. The new agency will effectively
become a secretariat for the Working Group on the Greater Mekong
Subregion Tourism Sector, which comprises representatives from
Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
East European countries and Russia are also among the new
markets  the TAT plans to develop this year as it sees a good
potential for tourism development there.
</P>
<P>
On the special interest segment, the main focus will be on
frequent and experienced visitors who tend to tour Thailand for
their favorite pastime such as cooking, dancing or bird-watching.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Thailand this year will continue to promote
domestic tourism and encourage Thais to tour their own country.

<HEADLINE> HK Stock Market Sees 48 New Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong stock market
enjoyed a bumper year in 1996 for new listings with 48 new stocks
coming in, up from the 26 registered in 1995, according to today's
South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
Of the 48 new listings, 44 are fully-fledged initial public
offerings (IPO) while four of them have come to the market by way
of introduction.
</P>
<P>
The report said that many analysts predict the total number of
new listings in 1997 may surpass the high of 53 listed in 1994,
and the greatest potential relies on mainland-related companies.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that new listings will perform even better
this year as a spate of China shares are likely to keep the IPO
fervor on the boil.
</P>
<P>
Among the 44 IPOs, the close of the year saw 28 trading above
their issue price while 16 trading below, according to the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
destroyed a large Tamil rebel camp in Eastern province and killed
14 rebels there on Wednesday evening in a new military operation,
according to military sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the troops have so far killed 21 rebels
in the offensive launched on 31 December last year and seized a
large stock of ammunition, food and equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to a rebel radio transmission intercepted by the
military, another 15 rebels were missing apart from the 14 killed,
the sources said, adding that the government side has suffered no
casualties so far.
</P>
<P>
The new offensive aims to destroy jungle strongholds of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in East province. The
government troops are backed by artillery and air cover and have
advanced some 12 kilometers into the jungle, the sources said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Rescues Russian Sailors From Listing Tanker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese today rescued 31 of
32 crew members of a listing Russian-registered oil tanker, the
Kyodo news service quoted Maritime Safety Agency officials as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The 13,157-ton Nakhodka was abandoned when it leaked oil some
106 kilometers northeast of the Oki Islands in Shimane Prefecture,
western Japan, which is about 700 kilometers west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The agency sent six vessels and helicopters to rescue the
sailors after it received report on the accident, which said the
ship was listing by about 20 degrees to the left, at about 2:50
a.m (5:50 p.m. GMT Wednesday).
</P>
<P>
The sailors were found drifting in life boats in the area of
the accident at 9:35 a.m. (0:35 a.m. GMT), the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The officials indicated that waves were as high as six meters
and visibility was poor due to fog in the accident area, and the
tanker, on a voyage from China to Russia, had not been sighted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Singaporeans Go to Critical Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 765,332
Singaporeans are going to the polls today to decide 36 of the 83
seats in the next session of the parliament after the ruling
People's Action Party (PAP) won the other 47 seats on the
nomination day on December 23 last year.
</P>
<P>
By mid-day, 399,278 voters, or 52.17 percent of the voting
total, cast their ballots in all the contested electoral
divisions. At stake in today's polling are six Group
Representation Constituencies (GRCs) and nine single member wards.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 15 GRCs and nine single member
constituencies for this general election.
</P>
<P>
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
and 45 other PAP candidates won their seats in the parliament on
the nomination day as the opposition camp failed to field their
candidates to contest in nine of the 15 GRCs, thus returning the
PAP to power with a majority of 47 seats in the 83-member
parliament.
</P>
<P>
A total of 192 polling stations opened at 8 a.m. local time
(0000GMT) today in the contested constituencies and will close at
8 p.m. (1200GMT), giving voters 12 hours to cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
As early as 7 a.m. this morning (2300GMT Wednesday), queues
were seen outside a number of polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Many voters said they wanted to finish voting early so that
they could either start their daily business or go back home to
enjoy one more day off after the New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared the polling day as a public
holiday.
</P>
<P>
Voters streamed in quietly and orderly at a polling station
near Jalan Bahagia in the central part of the island country, a
constituency where election battles raged on between the PAP and
the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP).
</P>
<P>
The Cheng San GRCs, being contested between the PAP and the
opposition Workers' Party, is the hottest spot in this general
election, which had not been expected before the election
campaigns started late last month.
</P>
<P>
"So by a strange turn of events, Cheng San becomes the focus of
this whole election. The prime minister, two deputy prime
ministers, are coming down ... to show the importance of Cheng
San. If they lose ... this government is diminished. And because
they are diminished, you will also realize, there are grave
consequences for Singapore all round, including Cheng San," Lee
Kuan Yew said at a PAP mass rally on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Workers' Party somehow became the most
formidable rival for the PAP candidates in Cheng San. The party
drew big crowds, sometimes tens of thousands, to its mass rallies,
at which its candidates challenged the policies and programs of
the ruling PAP.
</P>
<P>
Goh Chok Tong said last night that the PAP placed all its
election chips on the table of Cheng San GRC. If the party wins
today, residents in the ward will benefit from a
"winner-takes-all" package of the PAP's programs which will
include estate upgrading and extended subway service, he said.
</P>
<P>
But if Cheng San GRC voters opt for the opposition Workers'
Party, very serious consequences would be brought to Singapore and
internationally, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that he and two deputy prime ministers have staked
their prestige against the Workers' Party and its candidates,
stressing that this is the way the PAP is fighting today's
election.

<HEADLINE> Crime Fighting Atop Philippines' Agenda for 1997, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that his government would put the fight against
crime as one of its top priorities for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Delivering an Address to the Nation in the Presidential Palace,
he said the country is now being challenged by the threat posed by
crime, which must be cracked down not by conciliation but by
competent law enforcement and administration.
</P>
<P>
"Civil society has been lacerated by crime these past years. If
there is one area in which the word 'war' is appropriate, it is in
our fight against crime," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, crime rate in the country has reportedly
not fallen despite the efforts of the government. 147 cases of
kidnapping were reported with 241 hostages involved. At least ten
of them were killed after their families failed to pay the ransoms
demanded.
</P>
<P>
Rape, murder and robbery cases have also increased in the past
12 months. To curb the increasing crime, the government has
resumed death penalty and will inject the first convict to death
in March this year.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ramos also revealed other priorities his
government would undertake in the year, including the pursuit of
peace talks with other rebel groups, the development of national
economy, the measures taken to alleviate mass poverty and the
strengthening of relationship with other nations.

<HEADLINE> Arafat-Netanyahu Summit Likely Today, Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
expected to meet today, but they may not sign the Hebron deal,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held an eight-hour
meeting with Palestinian senior officials Abu Mazen throughout
the night at the Herzliya home of U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk
in the presence of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The talks was held after the terrorist shooting in Hebron
earlier Wednesday in which an Israeli soldier shot and wounded
seven Palestinians in the central Market. Both sides condemned
the terrorist act and promised to continue the ongoing peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said after the talks that an Arafat-Netanyahu
summit would possibly be held late today, but several outstanding
issues remained to be resolved before the Hebron agreement could
be signed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Palestinian side should not try to
reopen talks on issues that have been closed. Israeli officials
feared that the Palestinian side might make new demands for
security reasons following the shooting incident Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, issues of concern to the Palestinians include
obtaining a firm date for the last Israeli troop pullback from
the West Bank, the gradual release of prisoners and a Palestinian
presence at the Tomb of Patriachs, the holy shrine for both Jews
and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side especially insisted on its demand for
joint patrol near the holy shrine in order to protect the safety
of Palestinian worshipers. Hebron, where 450 Jewish settlers
live among 120,000 Palestinians, has been a hotbed for
Israeli-Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Before the Wednesday shooting, a Jewish settler named Baruch
Goldstein killed 29 Palestinian worshipers and wounded dozens of
other in a similar shooting spree in February 1994 at the Tomb
of Patriachs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who is now visiting India,
stressed the urgency of speedy conclusion of the long-delayed
agreement on Israeli troop pullback from Hebron. He asked
Mordechai Wednesday to convey a message to Arafat to express
regret for the shooting incident which he described as "a stupid
and wicked act."
</P>
<P>
Ross acted quickly after the Wednesday shooting by holding
separate meetings with Netanyahu and Arafat to offset the
possible repercussion of the incident on the Hebron talks. He
said the incident underscored quick action on concluding a deal
on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned Arafat Wednesday to
express "outrage and sadness" at the incident. Israeli sources
said that during their phone conversation, Clinton urged Arafat to
wrap up the Hebron talks.

<HEADLINE> China Aims to Produce 30 Billion cu m of Natural Gas Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China plans to double its annual
natural gas production capacity to 30 billion cu m by the year
2005, as one of its important strategies for developing energy
resources.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China National
Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), China is expected to verify additional
onshore gas reserves of one trillion cu m by the end of the
century, with the accumulative total hitting two trillion cu m.
</P>
<P>
By then, the country's gas production capacity will be
increased by another 10 billion cu m, with the total topping 25
billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source said that through further exploration, major
breakthroughs are forecast in the expansion of proven gas reserves
and production capacity in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, the
Tarim Basin and Sichuan Province. And the annual gas output will
reach 30 billion cu m by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC official noted that enormous potential exists for the
country's gas production. Following years of vigorous development,
three large-scale gas production areas have taken shape in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, total
gas reserves of 230 billion cu m have been verified. Total gas
reserves of 200 billion cu m have been proven in the eastern part
of Sichuan. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, total gas
reserves of 160 billion cu m have been verified, in addition to
the discovery of a group of new gas-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai
Province, a large gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion cu
m has been found.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the domestic gas exploration, active efforts are
being made to utilize gas resources of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In central Asia, China has joined an international gas
exploration project which will involve the construction of a
long-distance gas pipeline running through China and the Korean
Peninsula to Japan, providing China with a gas supply of 25
billion cu m a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint venture with Russia for gas exploration in
eastern Siberia will pipe to China 25 billion cu m of gas annually.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government to Help Save Loss-Making NBC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has dispatched an expert team to do an in-depth study on how to
turn the loss-making National Bank of Commerce (NBC) into a
viable bank.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that
the team will draft details on how to improve NBC's banking
services, especially in the field of foreign trade, and issuing
loans to individuals, to medium or large-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The NBC, founded in 1967, had about 18.5 million U.S. dollars
of capitals, 85.6 million dollars of reserves and 627.5 million
dollars of deposits around the beginning of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although the NBC has cut its operational costs and closed down
some of its branches around the eastern African country, it is
still in the red as many of its loans failed to be honored.
</P>
<P>
The government will supervise all the preparations for the
four-or-five-year NBC restructuring program, which will be
carefully implemented with a view to putting the national
interests first, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the current NBC stuff will retain to carry
out the recovering plan, many of them involved in the earlier
streamlining and retrenchment of the NBC after the Banking and
Financial Institutions Act took effect in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to strengthen the NBC, not to weaken or
kill it, the statement reiterated.

10,000 and 100,000 years ago has been discovered in Shennongjia
Valley in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said that they have unearthed some 30 pieces of
stone tools used by human beings in the Stone Age, together with a
large number of fossils belonging to mammals that have become
extinct both in China and throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Among the tools are sharp utensils such as scrapers and
hatchets, mainly made of black flint. They are unlike the stone
tools that have already been excavated in other regions of central
China.
</P>
<P>
The 100-meter-deep limestone cave is located at Hongpingyanbao
in Shennongjia, some 2,100 meters above the sea level.
</P>
<P>
Shennongjia Valley is a natural reserve area, famous for the
legendary "Wild Man" -- the Chinese version of "Big Foot" -- who
is believed to be the offspring of the giant ape, or perhaps a
creature that is half-ape, half-man.
</P>
<P>
On several occasions, Chinese scientists have sent teams to
study the phenomenon, and have found footprints that were believed
to be left by the "Wild Man."
</P>
<P>
The cave was first discovered by a farmer who was chasing a
wild cat that had stolen his hen. The man did not catch the
animal, but he did find some giant teeth in the area.
</P>
<P>
The site was excavated between November and December of 1996 by
a team led by the Hubei Relics and Archeology Institute.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists also have unearthed fossils of more than 20 types
of animals, including the primitive rhinoceros, the eastern
stegodon, giant pandas and hyenas.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Shancai, who is leading the team, said that
archeologists have never found so many rhinoceroses and eastern
stegodons buried in the same place in any other part of China.
</P>
<P>
The fossils belong to at least 30 primitive rhinoceroses and 10
eastern stegodons, he noted, adding that they might have been
sources of food for the primitive people.
</P>
<P>
The findings are important to the study of ancient animals as
well as the research on the lives of primitive man, according to
Wang.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees Stage Sit-In at Nepal-India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Bhutanese
refugees staged a sit-in protest at a Nepal-India border bridge
Sunday, blocking transport and causing inconvenience to people in
the border area in eastern Nepal, reports reaching here said
today.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are protesting against the forced deportation of
some 850 Bhutanese refugees from two camps in the Indian state of
West Bengal to Nepal by Indian police on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They are holding 13 Indian buses, used to take the deported
refugees into the Nepali territory, and said that they would
return the buses only after India agrees to transport the
deportees back to India.
</P>
<P>
Traffic movement on the Mechi bridge at Nepal's eastern border
with India has been paralyzed and Nepali residents are facing a
shortage of daily consumer goods due to the blockade, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees, mostly of Nepali origin, have
been living in several refugee camps in Nepal and India since they
were forced to flee Bhutan six years ago due to the Bhutanese
authorities' "one nation, one people" policy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Appeal Movement Coordination Council (AMCC), a
Bhutanese refugee group, launched a series of peace marches,
trying to walk from east Nepal, via India, to Thimphu, the capital
of Bhutan, to appeal for free repatriation of all Bhutanese
refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, no marchers managed to reach Thimphu as they were
either intercepted by Indian police when crossing India or evicted
by Bhutanese security troops as soon as they entered Bhutan.

<HEADLINE> Thriving Coastal Areas "Cradle" for Industrial Labor Force (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Twelve years ago, Li Ji was a
farmer toiling in Xuanhan County in southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Today, he is a wealthy entrepreneur and the owner of a clothing
factory in his hometown that has turned out one million yuan
worth-of clothing since it opened in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The former farmer attributed the changes in his life to his
experience in south China's coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Li left his hometown to try his luck in the cities of
Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong Province. In these prosperous
areas, Li not only made a considerable profit, but also learned
garment making techniques and gleaned managerial expertise. In
1995, he returned to his hometown with 600,000 yuan and started
his own business.
</P>
<P>
Li Ji is only one of millions of farmers in central and west
China who have worked or are working in economically developed
coastal areas. Several million of them have left farming and
become industrial workers. Like Li, some have become
entrepreneurs, who now have the power to create more opportunities
for their fellow farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics show that Sichuan, the most populous province in
China, steadily exports a labor force of more than five million to
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Densely populated Hunan, Hubei, Henan and Jiangxi provinces
also consider the export of labor as an important measure to
stimulate their rural economies. More than one million farmers
annually migrate from each of these provinces to more economically
developed areas.
</P>
<P>
All of these changes have taken place since the 1980s, when
coastal areas were the first to take off after the country
initiated market economic reform.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a great demand for labor was created in these
rapidly developing areas. Nearly seven million rural workers have
found jobs in Guangdong's Pear River Delta alone, one of the most
prosperous areas in China. Eighty percent of them are from the
countryside and mainly engaged in construction, transportation,
repair and other processing industries.
</P>
<P>
To combat the poor quality of the rural labor force, coastal
areas provide a wide range of job training services to improve
workers' competitiveness in the job market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1994, nearly 150 job training centers had been
set up at or above the county level in Guangdong Province, which
can train 200,000 people annually. There are also 3,600
non-government-run job services in the province, which can train
more than 500,000 people each year.

<P>
A job service network has taken shape in the province, one of
China's most economically thriving areas.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the industrial structure of Shenzhen, where
there are more than two million laborers from other parts of the
country, is switching from a labor-intensive mode to one that
emphasizes good education and expertise.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities presently conduct mandatory job training for
the laborers. Nearly 10,000 employees head for various types of
job training centers after work.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some central and western regions have put
forward new requirements for the migrating population of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Yuanba District of Guangyuan City, Sichuan Province, requires
farmers who are seeking jobs in the coastal areas to learn at
least two applied techniques. Farmers moving out of the district
now work mainly in construction, machine building, electronics,
and repair and processing trades.
</P>
<P>
The labor force flow between eastern coastal areas and central
and western regions has resulted in a new body of industrial
workers, according to analysts here.
</P>
<P>
The farmers-turned-workers are playing a significant role in
the improvement of the quality of Chinese labor force as well as
the economic development of central and western China, they said.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Hakim Ali Zardari, former
member of Pakistan's National Assembly and father-in-law of
deposed prime minister Benazir Bhutto, was arrested today on
charges of embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Investigating Agency (FIA) raided Zardari's
residence in Karachi early this morning after receiving orders
from Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The authorities did not disclose the detailed reasons for
Zardari's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Aslam Hayat Qureshi, former chief secretary of Punjab province,
was also arrested at his residence in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
FIA sources revealed that Qureshi was arrested on charges of
amassing wealth by misusing his official powers under the Benazir
Bhutto administration.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the arrests of Hakim Zardari and
Aslam Qureshi were connected with the corruption case of Asif
Zardari, Benazir Bhutto's husband who has been under police
custody since Benazir stepped down in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry has charged Qureshi with accepting Asif
Zardari's illegal orders through which he deprived the national
exchequer of millions of rupees (one U.S. dollar equals 40
rupees).
</P>
<P>
Since President Farooq Leghari dissolved Benazir's government
on November 5, 1996, the caretaker government has been staging an
accountability movement in the country.
</P>
<P>
The FIA sources said that more politicians would be arrested in
the next few days on corruption charges.

HOHHOT, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 562,000 rural
residents in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have
gotten out of poverty this year by using science and technology.
</P>
<P>
A technological project to grow crops on dry land by using
plastic sheets helped mountainous and arid areas in inner Mongolia
to harvest 1.3 billion kg of grain in 1996, 500 million kg more

<P>
Local farmers report a substantial increase in income from
production of grain, vegetables, and melons, thanks to the use of

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Supervises Medicines With Adverse Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The city of Tianjin has
established a center to supervise the harmful reactions of
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The center will test the safety of a variety of medicines,
collect information on medicines suspected of having adverse
reactions, provide dosage indexes and offer a public information
service.
</P>
<P>
China has established seven such facilities and 85 supervisory
hospitals in 26 provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
Adverse reactions include any physical responses that occur
when approved medicine is taken according to directions, and in
the proper dosage.
</P>
<P>
Side effects, and toxic, allergic and delayed reactions to
medicine also will be studied.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Health Organization, five percent of
China's more than 50 million annual in-patients are hospitalized
as a result of negative reactions to medicine. The number of
people suffering from serious side effects exceeds 250,000.
</P>
<P>
Peng Dunren, a member of the expert committee of the center,
said that although the approval for the production of new
medicines is strict in China, adverse reactions still occur
because of limited clinical trial use.
</P>
<P>
About three fourths of the harmful reactions can be prevented,
Peng believed.

<HEADLINE> Guiyang To Bid Farewell To Heavy Acid Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Gray skies have finally cleared
up in Guiyang, the capital of southwest China's Guizhou Province,
which has long been exposed to heavy acid rain.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report released by the State
Contamination Monitoring Authority, the city once again was not
named on the list of cities that are under a serious threat of
acid rain.
</P>
<P>
The local government attributes this mainly to the use of
different sources of fuel and the relocation of factories that
cause heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Since most of the acid rain comes from burning coal, we
focused mainly on introducing other cleaner fuels such as coal gas
and oil gas," a local official said.
</P>
<P>
Now, gas accounts for 70 percent of the total fuels consumed in
Guiyang, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the removal of pollution-producing
factories from the city area also contributed greatly to the
decrease of acid rain in Guiyang.
</P>
<P>
"We have successfully controlled the frequency of acid rain to
below 50 percent, and we are confident we can completely eliminate
heavy acid rain in the near future," the official said.

predictions, and can rapidly arrange pre-quake preparations and
post-quake relief.
</P>
<P>
He added that after a strong earthquake, the system can
automatically report the time, place and degree of the quake,
scale of the disaster, the areas hit with major shocks, and
disaster relief plans.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 5,400 square kilometers in north China's
Hebei Province, the system consists of several remote sensing
stations, a quake information data bank, radio tracking systems
and mobile communication networks.
</P>
<P>
The computerized center is connected with the State
Seismological Bureau, the mayor's office and the city's quake
prediction and disaster relief radio tracking station.
</P>
<P>
Feng said with the help of the system, the city government
could better issue quake information to the public and carry out
its emergency relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Feng said if an especially strong quake rendered the city
unable to implement its disaster-relief arrangements, the system
is designed to request help from the provincial government or the
central government.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao is a well-known tourist spot in China, and one of
Asia's biggest ports for transporting energy products.
</P>
<P>
In 1976, a devastating earthquake struck the city of Tangshan,
which is near Qinhuangdao. Now, Qinhuangdao, Beijing and most of
the areas in north China are the country's major earthquake-prone
areas.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges to Improve Quality of State Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The years that remain in the
20th century will be an important period in China's drive to
improve the quality of its state-owned assets, a senior official
said.
</P>
<P>
"To optimize our economic growth mode and meet the challenges
posed by competition in overall national strength, we should
energetically develop the state-owned economy, and significantly
improve the quality of our state assets," said Vice-Minister of
Finance Zhang Youcai.
</P>
<P>
"We must make a new breakthrough in our work of administering
state-owned assets," said Zhang, who is also director of the State
Administration of State Assets.
</P>
<P>
The management of state assets during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000) should be improved to the level of "bringing
into full play the position of the public economy and the leading
role of the state-owned economy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
To that end, China should make several changes in the
administration of state property, such as making it more
market-oriented, focusing more on restructuring the state economy
as a whole rather than on single enterprises and placing equal
emphasis on operational and non-operational assets, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that China's state assets had exceeded
5.72 trillion yuan (about 688 billion US dollars) in value by the
end of 1995. The yearly increase of the asset value has been
accelerating, from 12.4 percent since 1949 to 14.5 percent since
1980, and 17.9 percent since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Biggest Redemption Case For Chinese Insurance Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Xi, a poor farmer's son
from suburban Shanghai who suffers from a liver disease, has
received a medical insurance compensation claim of nearly 200,000
yuan from the local branch of the People's Life Insurance Company
of China.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest sum of insurance redemption ever paid by a
Chinese life insurance company in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old boy was diagnosed with the ailment last
April. Doctors said he would not survive if his liver was not
removed immediately.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's parents could not afford the surgery. Fortunately, he
had paid 15 yuan to buy the PICC policy that covered all expenses
for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the students in the city's primary and
middle schools have bought the medical insurance policy. The
Shanghai branch of PICC Life has paid out about 100 million yuan
in redemption fees over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Plans to Reopen Embassy in Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is planning to reopen
its embassy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, the local newspaper
"The News" reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted official sources as saying, "The embassy in
Kabul is almost open as some of the staff have already been there
and are operating from a house."
</P>
<P>
Three houses are being acquired to accommodate the Pakistani
mission in Kabul in the near future, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that Aziz Khan, Pakistan's ambassador to
Malaysia, has been appointed as the new Pakistani ambassador to
Afghanistan and he is scheduled to pay a farewell call on the
Malaysian king on January 6 before flying home.
</P>
<P>
Then he will visit Kabul some time in mid-January to see the
situation there and plan the formal reopening of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's embassy in Kabul was attacked on September 6, 1995,
by thousands of protesters reportedly sent by the then government
led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani for alleged Pakistani support
for the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
However, both the then Pakistani and Afghan governments denied
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, an employee of the embassy was killed and
Ambassador Qazi Humayun and military attache Ashraf Afridi were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan later evacuated its embassy staff and closed the
embassy. However, the Pakistani consulates in the Afghan cities of
Jalalabad, Kandahar, Herat and Mazar-i-Sharif continued to
operate.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that Pakistan would become the first
country to have a diplomatic presence in the Taliban-controlled
Kabul if its embassy started functioning in the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taliban captured Kabul on September 27, 1996, no
country has formally recognized the Taliban regime in the Afghan
capital.

<HEADLINE> Romania Doubles Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 1 (Xinhua) -- Romania started to double fuel
oil prices today, in a bid to make them more comparable with those
in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The price for gasoline jumped to 1900 leus (40 U.S. cents) per
liter from 900 leus per liter, and for diesel oil, up to 1300 leus
(26 cents) per liter from 680 leus per liter.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government decided to raise the prices at the end
of last year, after leu depreciated against the U.S. dollar. By
the end of 1996, gasoline price dropped to five liters per dollar
and drivers in neighboring countries flock in to fill their gas
tanks, taking advantage of leu's depreciation.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ciorbea said the nation's oil
refineries would suffer more losses if current prices remained
unchanged. He said Romanian refineries had lost 880 billion leus
(170 million dollars) because of leu's depreciation.
</P>
<P>
The price hike for fuel oil also led to price increases for
food and train fare.
</P>
<P>
Ciorbea said the government will increase social welfare and
take other compensational measures to counteract the negative
consequences caused to consumers by the price hikes.

<HEADLINE> Water Level Rises in Bangladeshi River Under Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A slight rise in water level has
been witnessed in Bangladesh's Padma River as the quantum of water
stipulated in the Ganges water-sharing treaty with India was
released from India's Farakka Barrage Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime ministers of the two neighboring countries signed the
30- year treaty on December 12 last year, which took effect on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hydrology Department of the Bangladesh Water
Department Board, the water level of the river increased by seven
centimeters at the Rajshahi point in the northwest and 57
centimeters at the Hardinge Bridge point bordering India Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
For the whole day, Bangladesh received 79,041 cusecs of water
of the Ganges, sources concerned confirmed.
</P>
<P>
According to the water treaty, Bangladesh will get a maximum of
67,516 cusecs of water between January 1-10 and a minimum of
27,633 cusecs during April 11-20 in the lean period.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's northern and northwestern regions had been subject
to severe water crisis in the dry months from January to May
because of alleged "unilateral withdrawal" of the water of the
common Ganges River by India at the Farakka Barrage in the absence
of any agreement whatsoever since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people gathered on both banks of the Padma River
in different parts of the northwestern district of Rajshahi to
watch the flow of the Ganges water. But the curious people were
not satisfied as the Padma flow was not heavy.
</P>
<P>
It would take two to three days for the augmented Ganges flow
to roll down the water-scanty district, an expert explained.

Sehgal, chief of the anti-espionage division of the

trade agreement which will allow Laos to win US trade privileges
with its improvement of investment environment, a local newspaper
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations are expected to begin in the areas of
investment and intellectual property rights, US embassy sources in
Vientiane were quoted as saying by "the Nation".
</P>
<P>
Human rights and labor standards and legal system will be the
next targeted issues for the negotiations, they said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be modeled after the one that the United
States reached with Cambodia in October last year, in which the US
granted most-favored-nation (MFN) status to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the sources as saying that Washington set
no preconditions for granting Laos MFN status, but the Lao economy
must become genuinely market-driven on the basis of competition
instead of monopoly.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations on MFN status for Laos, which started in
Vientiane in October last year, are expected to clear the last
hurdle in the full normalization of bilateral ties since the two
countries agreed to upgrade their relations in 1993, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The United States earlier last year agreed to lift the
two-decade-old embargo on economic assistance to Laos in exchange
of Laos' cooperation in narcotics suppression and efforts to
excavate the bones of American servicemen missing in Laos during
the Indochina wars.
</P>
<P>
In June this year, the two countries reached an agreement to
assist Laos in demining and retrieving unexplored ordnance.
</P>
<P>
Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavad has said that Laos
hopes to conclude the MFN deal with the U.S. before it joined the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) next July.
</P>
<P>
Washington reportedly was satisfied with Lao's preparations for
joining the global market reform and the two countries are
studying a proposed draft agreement on trade.
</P>
<P>
The United States currently is the second largest investor in
Laos after Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Promote Herbal Planting in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will
promote the planting of natural herbs in rural areas as a means to
generate self-employment, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Inspecting a herb production and processing company here
Wednesday, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said that herb
planting can significantly help boost the economic status of poor
rural communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged local businessmen to promote the export of herbal
products, which he said have a great potential of earning hard
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Herbs Production and Processing Company said
the company, the first of its kind in the country, is now
producing, processing and exporting herb products worth 650,000
U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The company sells about two thirds of its products, including
essential oils and medicinal extracts, in the international
market, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to officials of the Forest and Soil Conservation
Ministry who accompanied Deuba on the inspection tour, the
government will work out programs and policies to make herb
planting an income-generating resource for rural people.
</P>
<P>
They said only 10 percent of Nepal's 7,000 species of natural
herbs have been identified so far.

<HEADLINE> Tourism in Cuba Booms in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 1 (Xinhua) -- The tourism industry in Cuba saw
an unprecedented boom in 1996 as more than one million foreigners
visited the country, a 30 percent increase compared to the year
before.
</P>
<P>
Gross revenues of the industry reached 1.3 billion U.S. dollars
in 1996, making it one of the largest sources of hard currency for
this Caribbean island, according to official preliminary
statistics.
</P>
<P>
With its enviable weather and idyllic beaches, Cuba has
attracted a great number of tourists mostly from Europe and the
American continent.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Organization of Tourism (WOT), Cuba has
become the second most favorite tourist destination for Italians
and the third for Spaniards. It is also the fourth tourist
destination chosen by Canadians, Mexicans and Germans, the sixth
for the French, the seventh for Argentines and the 10th for
Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Helms-Burton Act promulgated on March 12 by the
United States Government to frighten foreign investors away from
the island, Cuba has 36 contracts signed with oversea companies on
hotel administration and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Even before 1989, when economic reform began, tourism had
become the only sector in which foreign capital was allowed to
enter and joint ventures to emerge.
</P>
<P>
And when Cuba's worst economic crisis, since the triumph of the
1959 revolution, broke out in 1989, the tourism industry proved of
great help in offsetting the depression with the fresh money and
hard currency it generated.
</P>
<P>
This open-door policy also enriched the Cubans first-hand
knowledge about the industry which had been a novelty to them.
</P>
<P>
Advanced ways of management and marketing were adopted by many
hotels, which also presented an example for other sectors of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
Tourism soon would be capable of competing with the sugar
industry, the country's traditional pillar industry.
</P>
<P>
With the glorious past at sight, Cuba is confident of
maintaining a promising future for tourism in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Ministry's studies shows Cuba has the capacity for
150,000 to 155,000 hotel rooms by the year 2000. There were 27,000
rooms available for international tourists at the end of 1996,
when some 4,200 hotel rooms were finished or re-decorated.
</P>
<P>
With the coming of the December to March busy season, the
country hopes to receive about 450,000 foreign holiday makers.
</P>
<P>
Ministry authorities estimated that tourism would guarantee
Cuba more than 1.2 million visitors in 1997, and two million in
2000.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  China Becoming Active Force in Multilateral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China's active involvement in
international multilateral cooperation in 1996 proves the nation
has become a dynamic force in global diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
And the country has attained greater international influence as
a result of Chinese leaders' participation in multilateral
diplomatic activities.
</P>
<P>
At the Fourth Informal Leadership Meeting of the Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC), Chinese President Jiang Zemin
explained the guiding principle that equal attention should be
paid to regional economic and technological cooperation, and to
the liberalization of investment.
</P>
<P>
During the First Asia-Europe Meeting, Premier Li Peng expressed
China's view on a new partnership between Asia and Europe. At the
World Food Summit, he outlined the issue of the world's food
supply, and explained the country's agricultural policy.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of government officials led by Chinese
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also attended the
51st UN General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, following the UN Fourth World Conference on Women the
previous fall, China successfully hosted a series of specialized
and comprehensive international conferences.
</P>
<P>
The meetings turned Beijing into an international center for
communication, where tens of thousands of political dignities,
scholars and well-known public figures from all over the world
exchanged ideas and information.
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting of the 21st Century Forum and 96th
Inter-Parliamentary Conference, common understandings on major
international and regional issues were reached through in-depth
discussions. The outcome of both meetings greatly contributed to
international cooperation based on equality, and world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
And during these meetings, the talks between Chinese leaders
and many government and parliament officials of other countries
gave strong impetus to the improvement and development of
bilateral ties between China and other countries.

<P>
China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, has
always opposed hegemonism and power politics, and maintained the
interests of developing countries by adhering to principles and
upholding justice in the affairs of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
For instance, China plays a special role in promoting the UN's
fair and balanced approach to various problems by supporting the
organization's efforts in handling global political disagreements
and regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The country stresses that the work of the international
community, including UN peace-keeping actions, should strictly
abide by the standards of respecting national sovereignty,
non-interference in internal affairs and peacefully solving
disputes.
</P>
<P>
China holds it is a violation of the UN Charter and a threat to
world peace and stability to interfere in other countries'
internal affairs for various excuses, or to be prone to imposing
sanctions, or to use violence.
</P>
<P>
In the election of the UN secretary-general, which was just
finalized, China firmly backed the position of the Organization of
African Unity, winning the gratitude of developing countries,
especially the African nations.
</P>
<P>
As for the human rights issue, China advocates international
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect, but is
against interference in any country's internal affairs in the name
of human rights.
</P>
<P>
For the sixth time, China successfully challenged, with a wide
show of support, the anti-China motion submitted by some Western
countries at the 52nd session of the UN Human Rights Commission in
April, and maintained its national sovereignty and dignity.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China enhanced its mutual understanding on
the issue with the parties concerned through active bilateral
exchanges and discussions on the basis of equality and mutual
respect.

China worked vigorously to achieve complete disarmament by
taking numerous actions to attain the goal.
</P>
<P>
The country made a great contribution to the conclusion of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty through active participation and a
flexible approach during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
China also was involved in extensive multilateral projects that
positively affected the economy and society, and put forward a
series of constructive proposals to bring about much-needed
changes in these fields.
</P>
<P>
It urged developed nations to take effective measures to create
a more favorable external environment for the economic growth of
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
It holds that the developed countries should offer those that
are developing new and additional funding and technology on
preferential terms, in order to enhance sustained development of
the growing nations.
</P>
<P>
China stresses that international cooperation in social growth
should be conducted on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,
and should respect each country's right to choose its own
political system and economic mode. Prerequisites to cooperation
should be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
China's worldwide involvement in social advancement has greatly
enhanced the healthy development of international cooperation in
this area.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, China has made great strides in its pursuit
of an independent foreign policy of peace, and also in its
participation in bilateral diplomacy, said Zhang Yishan, deputy
director of the the Department of International Organizations and
Conferences of China's Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said China will continue to carry out the independent
foreign policy of peace, and participate in multilateral efforts
in the fields of politics, economy, disarmament and social
development.
</P>
<P>
It will live up to its status as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, oppose hegemonism and power politics, and work
diligently to safeguard the interests of developing nations, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China is determined to make efforts with other
countries to establish a new international political and economic
order that is peaceful, fair and reasonable.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Property Rights Transfer Helps Ailing Enterprises (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- In the three years since China
introduced the system of property rights transfer to bail out its
debt-ridden state-owned firms, more than 1,000 of the businesses
have been merged in Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, and some
1,200 have been sold each year in Zhejiang, Shanxi and Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 200 property rights transfer agencies are
flourishing in China as a result of the nationwide reform of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The agencies, which were established to advance the modern
enterprise system launched by China in 1993, handle the combining,
merging, acquisition and share-holding, and restructuring of
state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the system is to clarify property rights, individual
rights and responsibilities, separate government functions from
those of the enterprises and introduce scientific management.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the readjustment of property rights in state firms
worked well in most parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
As the reform swept across China, the central government pushed
ahead with the re-organization of state-owned enterprises and
supervised the smooth flow of inventory assets. The experiment to
optimize capital structure extended from 18 Chinese cities to 50,
and the total assets involved jumped from 148 billion yuan to 183
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the debt of state-owned enterprises has been
reduced by 7.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Hainan Toothpaste Plant, formerly one of the leading companies
of its kind, was in the red due to lack of funds and poor
management. In 1994, the plant ownership was transferred to an
industrial and trading company, and the new business underwent
technological renovation and initiated a new marketing system,
pushing its output value to 100 million yuan. Of this amount, 70
million yuan was profit.

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the many success stories, experts say China's property
rights trading volume is still small. Negative attitudes, poor
communications, lack of talented personnel, restrictions, laws and
transaction supervision agencies have also hindered the
development of the trading.
</P>
<P>
To create a smoother flow of information, the State
Administration of State Property set up a national property rights
transaction information network last July. The transaction
information will soon be available on the Internet, government
sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Youcai, director of the State Administration
of State Property, to reduce the loss of state property -- a key
issue in property rights transfers and trading -- the government
will establish a system to register property and supervise
property appraisal. Laws and regulations regarding property rights
reform are being worked out, he said.
</P>
<P>
Property rights transactions can help attract more overseas
capital, and promote the readjustment of the industrial setup so
that the state-owned enterprises can improve their economic
performance, said Wang Tong, director of an information center
affiliated with the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy.
</P>
<P>
Other experts have suggested that China should establish a
nationwide, open and competitive property rights trading market so
that such deals can play a more important role in the reform of
state-owned enterprises.

LONDON, January 1 (Xinhua) -- British army bomb experts have
carried out a controlled explosion on a van left in the grounds of
Belfast castle which the Irish Republican Army (IRA) said
contained a land-mine.
</P>
<P>
The IRA said security checks had forced it to abandon the
vehicle last night. Security has been stepped up across Northern
Ireland and in mainland Britain since the IRA abandoned a
cease-fire last February in a 27-year campaign to end British rule.
</P>
<P>
Tension increased recently with signs that pro-British Loyalist
guerrillas might end a two-year truce. Booby trap bombs were
placed under cars belonging to senior republicans, injuring one of
them.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew said today the IRA's
message for the New Year was that they had not turned away from
violence. And he branded the IRA "criminal gangsters".
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, Ulster Unionist party leader, told the Today
Program that it was consistent with IRA activity over the last
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
"There's no indication whatsoever that the IRA are
contemplating politics. Every indication is that they are trying
to step up activity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's time all the other parties in the inter-party talks took
this on board," he added.

SINGAPORE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Polling started here today in
the eighth General Election of Singapore, with 36 out of a total
of 83 Parliament seats at stake.
</P>
<P>
The other 47 seats were already won by the ruling People's
Action Party (PAP) on the Nomination Day on December 23, last
year, when the opposition camp failed to field enough candidates
to contest in nine of the 24 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The PAP fielded a total of 83 candidates, while the five
opposition parties came up with only 38 candidates to run in the
race. In addition, there was one independent candidate, thus
making it a total of 39 from the opposition camp.
</P>
<P>
This time, there are 1,881,011 eligible voters in Singapore, an
island country with a population of almost three million. The
voters are divided into 24 constituencies, namely, 15 Group
Representation Constituencies (GRCs) and nine single-seat
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Since 47 PAP candidates already won walkovers in nine GRCs on
the Nomination Day, real election battles are only being fought in
the rest of the six GRCs and nine single-seat constituencies.
Final results of the contests will come out late tonight or early
Friday morning.
</P>

<P>
SINGAPORE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Polling started here today in
the eighth General Election of Singapore, with 36 out of a total
of 83 Parliament seats at stake.
</P>
<P>
The other 47 seats were already won by the ruling People's
Action Party (PAP) on the Nomination Day on December 23, last
year, when the opposition camp failed to field enough candidates
to contest in nine of the 24 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The PAP fielded a total of 83 candidates, while the five
opposition parties came up with only 38 candidates to run in the
race. In addition, there was one independent candidate, thus
making it a total of 39 from the opposition camp.
</P>
<P>
This time, there are 1,881,011 eligible voters in Singapore, an
island country with a population of almost three million. The
voters are divided into 24 constituencies, namely, 15 Group
Representation Constituencies (GRCs) and nine single-seat
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Since 47 PAP candidates already won walkovers in nine GRCs on
the Nomination Day, real election battles are only being fought in
the rest of the six GRCs and nine single-seat constituencies.
Final results of the contests will come out late tonight or early
Friday morning.

JAKARTA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia had a population of
199.7 million by the end of 1996, making it the world fourth most
populous country after China, India and the United States, a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is based on the projection by the National
Coordinating Board for Family Planning (BKKBN), in cooperation
with the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) and other relevant
agencies," State Minister for Population Haryono Suyono said.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on policy and strategy for contraceptive services
held here Tuesday, he said the figure is lower than that predicted
previously, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"This is the result of our hard work in reducing the country's
birth rate from six percent in 1970 to 2.6 percent in 1996," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have projected that the Indonesian population will
reach 280 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Haryono also said Indonesia has succeeded in reducing the
mortality rate from 145 out of every 1,000 births in 1970 to 55
out of every 1,000 births in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu
province increased its telephone switching capacity to one million
lines on December 26, by extending the program-controlled
telephone switching system to all its counties.
</P>
<P>
The rapid telecom growth in the landlocked province should be
attributed to the local governments' heavy investment and the
preferential policies given to the industry, according to the
"People's Posts and Telecommunications News."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province spent 1.3 billion yuan on the
telecommunications projects, expanding the digital transmission
services to 78.6 percent of its cities.
</P>
<P>
At present, the services of packet exchange and DDN (digital
and data network) are available in most of the counties, and the
downtown area of Lanzhou, the provincial capital, is accessible to
the GSM (global service for mobile communication) service.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, the province built five local
telephone networks, 27,000 long-distance phone lines and three
optical cable trunks now connect Lanzhou with Beijing and other
neighboring provincial capitals.
</P>
<P>
Acting Governor Sun Ying said that telecommunications is the
most rapidly developing industry in the economically
underdeveloped province.

<P>
CHENGDU, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China's largest frequency
converter production center will be built in this capital of
Sichuan Province, in a move to enhance the competitiveness of
domestically-manufactured products.
</P>
<P>
The center will manufacture 300,000 frequency changers annually
when completed around the year 2000. It will be built by the
Chengdu-based Jialing Electric Manufacturing Company.
</P>
<P>
Frequency changers are widely used in electrical applicances
like fans, and in diesel locomotives and subway cars where speeds
have to be regulated by an electric motor.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China used one billion yuan worth of the items and
demand is rising at an annual rate of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has 50 frequency converter manufacturers, but their
output accounts for only three percent of the country's market,
due to the low level of technology.
</P>
<P>
The production center will use advanced technology and is
expected to produce hi-tech frequency changers to improve the
technical standards of Chinese products.

SHANGHAI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- China will open its domestic
insurance market wide to overseas companies and compete in the
world insurance market this year, according to an official with
the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a symposium on insurance held here recently Yu Hua,
an official with the central bank, the People's Bank of China,
says that earnings from China's insurance business amounted to
36.87 billion yuan in the first half of 1996, up 32 percent from
the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But there is great potential and China's insurance business is
still in a "start-up period."
</P>
<P>
China currently has 21 insurance companies dealing in life and
property insurance in China, seven of which are foreign-funded.
</P>
<P>
This does not meet the growing demand however, and much of the
insurance offered does not cover most aspects of life, she noted.
</P>
<P>
She said that China will try to perfect its laws related to
insurance, and to increase the number of insurance companies this
