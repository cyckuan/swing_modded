<HEADLINE> One-Fifth Employees Work Overtime in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Almost one-fifth of all employees
in Canada, an average of 1.9 million people, worked overtime
during the first quarter of 1997, Statistics Canada reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Of those employees who worked overtime, almost 6 in 10 did not
receive overtime pay," the federal agency noted.
</P>
<P>
Those who did not get paid for their extra time worked an
average of 9.2 overtime hours, compared with 8.5 hours for those
who did get paid.
</P>
<P>
Adult men were twice as likely to get paid overtime as adult
women, since men are more likely to work in manufacturing,
construction and other primary industries where paid overtime is
more common.
</P>
<P>
Youth aged 15 to 24 were less likely to work overtime than
adults, and they put in fewer hours than adults. Unlike adults,
most youths who put in overtime did so for pay.
</P>
<P>
"The proportion of the employed population working long hours
have expanded in recent years," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, the "standard" work week has remained in the range
of 35 to 40 hours a week for many years. "This stability masks
significant shifts in the distribution of work hours, especially
since the 1981-82 recession."
</P>
<P>
By 1995, only 54 percent of workers put in a 35- to 40-hour
work week, down from 65 percent in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, the proportion of workers putting fewer
than 35 hours a week rose from 16 percent to nearly 24 percent,
while the proportion of those usually working 41 hours or more
rose from 19 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Typically, white-collar workers were more likely to have worked
overtime than blue-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1997, one quarter of all those working
overtime were employed as managers. About 37.5 percent of
teachers worked overtime, the highest proportion of any occupation.
</P>
<P>
"Almost all managers and teachers who worked overtime did not
get paid for it," the agency said.

<HEADLINE> EU Commissioner Urges EU Ban on Tobacco Advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Social Affairs
Commissioner Padraig Flynn urged here today all EU member states
to take concrete measures to ban tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a "smoking summit" in London, Flynn said that all EU
governments had to make concerted efforts to stop the 500,000
deaths every year in Europe from tobacco-related disease.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that it is incumbent on the public health
authorities to make the fight against tobacco a priority for
action," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on EU states to make joint efforts to fight
against tobacco advertising, saying: "The industry has been
organized on an international basis for many years. It is now time
for governments to act in a similarly concerted way."
</P>
<P>
"If not, we will soon find that our citizens will be targeted
by new marketing efforts in a bid to recover lost markets in the
United States and elsewhere," he added.
</P>
<P>
Flynn said that as an urgent matter EU members should look at
the effects of a pending deal under which tobacco companies will
pay 368 billion U.S. dollars to victims of long-time smoking.
</P>
<P>
On the advertising of tobacco, he said the promotion of
tobacco, by direct or indirect advertising, "must be removed and
there can be no continued justification for pushing sales of such
an addictive and deadly product."
</P>
<P>
"While many argue that smoking is a matter of personal choice,
I would add that the addictive properties of tobacco render that
choice a dependency," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The (EU) member states can also adopt a series of measures at
national level to reduce smoking: particularly important here
would be measures to outlaw sales to minors, to restrict vending
machine sales, to improve smoking cessation programs and to
increase taxes on tobacco," he added.

<HEADLINE> South Korean FM Reiterates Stance on Japanese Fisheries Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo
Chong-ha said today that the disputed waters between Japan and
South Korea should be zoned before the 1965 fisheries agreement
between the two countries is revised.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that Japan's seizure of South Korean fishing
boats in waters it recently unilaterally declared part of its
200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone will not help ease
tensions between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Tokyo are currently revising the 1965 agreement on
fishing in disputed waters around a barren outcrop of islands in
the Sea of Japan midway between the two countries and which both
countries lay claim to.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea is insisting the existing deal be respected
until a new pact is drawn up. However, Japan unilaterally
redefined its territorial waters by drawing a straight line
through the disputed waters in January without consulting South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
Since early June, Japan's Maritime Safety Agency has seized
five South Korean fishing boats for trawling in the area.
</P>
<P>
South Korea wants the two sides to zone their waters in line
with the U.N. convention and has said it cannot accept part of the
straight line Japan has drawn to redefine its territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
It has now frozen talks on the new fishing agreement until the
row is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Yoo said today he didn't believe Japan would unilaterally scrap
the fisheries agreement even though negotiations had stopped.
</P>
<P>
"The one-sided scrapping of the fisheries agreement, if any,
will make the overall relations between the two countries very
difficult," Yoo warned.

<HEADLINE> Britain Unveils New Research Into Gulf War Syndrome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here today a new research program into the Gulf War syndrome
suffered by many Gulf War veterans and promised to allocate new
fund to speed up assessments of the mysterious disease.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Armed Forces Minister John Reid said today that the
government is planning a 2.5 million pound (about 4.24 million
U.S. dollar) research program into the possible health effects of
the combination of vaccines and tablets given to Gulf War troops
to protect them against chemical and biological warfare, and
against desert insects.
</P>
<P>
Many Gulf War veterans complained that the syndrome results
from a cocktail of chemicals administered to troops and has
brought problems such as asthma, chronic fatigue, depression and
skin ailments. Some maintain it has resulted in serious birth
defects in their children.
</P>
<P>
Reid noted that the latest government program will be
supervised by an independent panel of experts, including a
representative of the Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
"We have a duty to discharge our responsibilities in respect of
those who have served their country. I aim to see we do just
that," Reid said.
</P>
<P>
About 51,000 British troops served in the Gulf War and up to
4,000 veterans and their families have illnesses. Veterans argued
that evidence gathered in the United States supports the theory
that the "cocktail" of immunizations and pills may be responsible
for the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces minister also stressed that the Labor
government will continue to pay war pensions to those disabled
because of the Gulf War and he also promised that if further
research shows liability, it will pay compensation.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Increase Gold Output, Miners' Wages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Chamber of
Mines and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) today
announced details of a "historical" accord, under which the
country's gold production will be increased and mine workers
better paid.
</P>
<P>
Both mine workers and their employers hailed the agreement as
being in the best interests of the gold mining industry and as
the best option for its future and stability.
</P>
<P>
Nick Segal, President of the Chamber of Mines, told a press
conference that the accord was "of almost historical
proportions", especially when the two parties agreed to increase
annual gold production by 90 tons countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Chamber of Mines will have mine
workers' wages increased from 10 percent to 25 percent on
condition that productivity and production targets are met.
</P>
<P>
NUM Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe described the accord
as a "significant breakthrough", saying it would lay the basis
for sustained growth in the gold mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Segal said the wage offer that comes with the accord is much
higher than ever before, and linked to greater productivity.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe said the NUM is confident the targets for additional
gold output would be reached as there will be no alternative.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the agreement, about 100,000 mine workers were facing
retrenchment following gold price crash to below 320 U.S. Dollars
an ounce in global market early this month, NUM said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to South Africa, the neighboring Lesotho and
Mozambique are also suffering from the gold slump as tens of
thousands of people from the two countries are working on South
African mines.

<HEADLINE> British Gov't Renews Contact With Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Before a new round of Northern
Ireland peace talks Tuesday, the British government tried again to
discuss with the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, to clarify
controversial conditions for Sinn Fein to join the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam admitted today in an
interview with BBC that her civil servants had contacted with Sinn
Fein by telephone and in writing on peace in the divided province.
</P>
<P>
She said the official talks with Sinn Fein, broken off after
IRA guerrillas killed two police officers in mid-June, were
resumed so that Sinn Fein could not blame Britain's ban on contact
for the IRA's refusal to end its war against British rule.
</P>
<P>
"(British Prime Minister) Tony Blair and I have made clear all
along that what's important is that Sinn Fein cannot give any
excuse that we have not clarified our position," she said.
</P>
<P>
But Mowlam said the renewed contacts were initiated by Sinn
Fein, which is demanding clarification on key issues as a
precondition for seeking a new IRA cease-fire which would admit the
party to the negotiations slated for September.
</P>
<P>
The British government said Sinn Fein could be admitted into
the multi-party peace talks only after the IRA announces a
cease-fire before or during the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein argues the surrender of guerrilla weapons should be
the last item on the agenda of the talks but Britain and Ireland
say they should hand over some weapons as the talks progress to
show good faith and build confidence.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Israel-Palestinian Talks on Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) reached an agreement today on the taking-off and
landing procedures in the Dahaniya airport in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The progress in the aviation talks was achieved in the talks
held in Gaza between Fayed Zidan, Director-General of the PNA
Civil Aviation Authority, and Shaul Mofaz, head of Israeli Army
Planning Branch.
</P>
<P>
Sidan said the two sides also agreed on naming the Dahaniya
airport as Gaza International Airport. Moreover, Israel agreed to
let the PNA to hold the observer status in the International
Aviation Organization.
</P>
<P>
The agreements sparked optimism for the prospects of resuming
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations that have been frozen
since March when Israel began building the Har Homa settlement
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a move to calm down the tension caused by the continued
violent clashes in the Palestinian territories, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai met with PNA Planning Minister Nabil
Shaath last week, during which the two agreed on expediting
the Dahaniya airport and on further construction of the Gaza
seaport.
</P>
<P>
Progress was also reported on resolving the differences on
opening "safe passages" for Palestinians traveling between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The latest aviation agreements could pave the way for further
thawing of the Israeli-Palestinian ice in the peace negotiations
despite the violence in Hebron and other cities.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has said that the Dahaniya airport and Gaza seaport may
free the fledgling Palestinian economy from dependence on Israel
and enable the PNA to control its international trade.
</P>
<P>
But Israel insists that it should have security control over
the transportation in the airport and seaport because it fears
that the PNA could use the freedom of transport to smuggle in
advanced weapons that will threaten Israel's security. Until now,
the two sides have yet settled the disputes over the security
checks, and more talks are expected to follow.

HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) today urged Africa's decision
makers to take advantage of the latest technological development
to boost international trade.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD official Christine Cattell told delegates at the Second
Eastern and Southern Africa Trade Point meeting here that the
globalization and liberalization of world markets offer great
potential for the development and integration of the continent.
</P>
<P>
"If Africa is to increase its participation in international
trade, access to on-line trade and investment information are
very essential," Cattell told representatives from Kenya,
Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Mauritius, Namibia, Swaziland,
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she stressed that "in a world of rapidly evolving
technology, training of human resources is a necessity."
</P>
<P>
"Trade point meetings are important to help strengthen the
trade point network in Africa by promoting regional cooperation
and mutual assistance," the UNCTAD official added.
</P>
<P>
A trade point is a center where trade information is available
for exporters, importers and the business community to develop
and expand international markets for their products.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD introduced a trade point program in 1992 to assist
countries in setting up such points.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli opposition leader said
today that Israel's security needs should not be based on
continued occupation of Arab lands, and pledged his support to the
establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai Braon, leader of the Islaeli Peace Now Movement who
was visiting here heading a delegation, made the statement after
talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Meeting reporters after emerging from the talks, Braon held
Israel's Likud-led government responsible for the stalemate facing
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the ongoing policies adopted by Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu leaves no reason for optimism about a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
"It (the Netanyahu government) fails to carry on the
breakthrough realized in Rabin and Peres' era," he said, adding
that his party is mobilizing the Israeli public opinion to push
for early elections of "a new cabinet that will work for peace."
</P>
<P>
The movement believes in the necessity of realizing just and
balanced settlement through full participation by both
Palestinians and Israelis in everything and in all rights, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians should have their own state like Israel and
have their homeland where they can stay," he said. "Jerusalem
should be an undivided open city but also the capital of the
future Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government rejects the establishment of a full
independent Palestinian state and insists on keeping Jerusalem its
undivided capital.
</P>
<P>
As regard to Syria, Braon said that the only way for Israel to
realize peace is its complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights
and returning it back to Syria.
</P>
<P>
"Peace can never be realized without Syria which cannot accept
something less than what Egypt had accepted, namely return to the
international borders of 1967," he added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also refused to hand over Golan to Syria in return
for a peace treaty, something his predecessors had verbally
accepted. Peace talks with Syria have been frozen over one year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has stepped in as the main mediator between the
Palestinians and Israelis in the past few weeks after U.S. efforts
failed to bring the two sides back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
But it apparently fell short of reviving the peace process
that collapsed in March when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish
settlement in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Resumes Peace Talks with Tribal Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government resumed
talks with the leaders of tribal insurgents here today in a bid to
establish a durable peace in the insurgency-torn southern
Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).
</P>
<P>
It is the fifth round of talks under the government of Sheikh
Hasina. The duration of the parley is not decided yet. However,
today's talks began in a "cordial" atmosphere, said an official
handout.
</P>
<P>
Chief Whip Hasnat Abdullah is leading the government side to
the meeting while the tribal delegation is headed by Shantu Larma
of the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), the
political wing of the armed Shantibahini.
</P>
<P>
During the last peace talks on May 11, the government and the
PCJSS declared in a joint statement that they had reached an
agreement on the conflict and they would sign a peace treaty soon.
</P>
<P>
But the peace process received a severe jolt when differences
of opinion surfaced among the top leadership of the PCJSS, which
has struggled for about two decades for self-rule in the
resources-rich CHT.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Shantu Larma, chief of the PCJSS, was
facing severe opposition from a hard-liners' group against his
stand. Shantu is favoring a solution which will give up the
PCJSS's long-standing demand for autonomy in the CHT.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a team of the Refugee Welfare Association based in
Tripura of India recently visited Chittagong district to see
whether the repatriation process was going on in accordance with
the government's commitment.
</P>
<P>
More than 6000 refugees, out of a total of 40,000 tribal
refugees who fled away to India, returned home between March and
April this year on an "experimental basis," but members of 170
families have not yet been rehabilitated in their homesteads,
refugee leaders claimed.
</P>
<P>
The team said it was not satisfied with the repatriation
process and urged the government to start further repatriation
under the supervision of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Special Affairs told reporters
that although both sides were keen to solve the problem, many
recent issues have made the situation complicated, "which made the
signing of a treaty unlikely in this round of talks," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Clamp Down on Govt Vehicle Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The provincial governments
of South Africa's nine provinces have started to clamp down on
officials found to be abusing government vehicles for private
business.
</P>
<P>
Provincial traffic officers will, from now on, be authorized
to demand permits from people driving government vehicles, said
an official.
</P>
<P>
Previously in South Africa, officials driving government
vehicles have only been subjected to internal fleet management
control systems that were not strictly implemented, said Butler
Matlapeng, spokesman for North West Provincial Transport and
Aviation Minister Frans Vilakazi.
</P>
<P>
Matlapeng said bureaucrats ran up hundreds of thousands of
kilometers for trips that could not be accounted for. This meant
provincial government departments incurred substantial losses in
petrol, repair and maintenance costs on unauthorized trips
undertaken by officials for private purpose.
</P>
<P>
Provinces such as North West and Kwazulu/Natal have now
employed special inspectors with powers to impound government
vehicles when found to be on the road without department permits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Gauteng Province, an economic power-house of the
country, the responsibility of monitoring government vehicles
will still fall into the hands of each department.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng's Public Transport and Roads Deputy Director Tobie
Roux said, however, it would be impossible for a team of
inspectors to monitor government vehicles here because of "unique
traffic patterns" and the large concentration of cars in the
province.

CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A former chief of an Egyptian public

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Poultry Industry Makes Stride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's poultry industry, which
enjoyed stable business last year, expects to have a record
production value of more than 90 million U.S. Dollars this year,
an official said today.
</P>
<P>
John Smith, chairmen of the Commercial Poultry Producers
Association, said, the 1996 output value in the poultry industry
was estimated to have increased to 50 million U.S. Dollars
compared to 42 million Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Smith said he is keen for more exports if the industry is to
expand more rapidly, adding that the situation to date is not too
depressing as exports of day-old chicks, hatching eggs, broilers
and table eggs in the past year earned the industry an estimated
five million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industry would continue its export to the southern African
region except Zambia, where Zimbabwean poultry is still banned
after the outbreak of Newcastle disease three years ago.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police Deployed in Hebron to Prevent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Palestinian police
and security personnel has been deployed along the line dividing
Palestinian self-rule areas from Jewish settlements in Hebron to
prevent further violence, the state-run Israel Radio reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Tarif Zayyad, Palestinian police commander in Hebron,
inspected the confrontation line this morning. He told reporters
that the Palestinian police had been deployed to ensure the area
not to be cut off from other parts of the Palestinian self-rule
city again.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian security officials met in Hebron
Sunday night to discuss the worsening situation in the city. The
Palestinian side agreed to make efforts to calm down the
mounting tensions, but at the same time, demanded that the
Israeli military authorities halt punitive measures against the
Palestinian residents in the city.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that sanctions would be lifted when
change is seen in the field. And they agree to allow some
Palestinian shops to reopen. The stores, which had been ordered to
close by the army, located near an area from which shots were
fired and petrol bombs thrown at Israeli soldiers and Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of violence between Palestinians and Israeli
soldiers erupted after anti-Islamic posters were pasted on
Palestinian shops in the city. The insulting poster depicted
Prophet Muhammad as a pig.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has blamed the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) for encouraging the violence. Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu today threatened to take even harsh
measures against the Palestinians if violence continues.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Asia Up to 81 Bln Dlrs in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment into Asia
increased by 25 percent last year to 81 billion US dollars, with
China accounting for more than one half of these inflows,
according to figures published by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Citing a study by UNCTAD, the trade and development agency of
the UN, the Financial Times reported today that foreign direct
investment in developing countries rose from 97 billion US dollars
in 1995 to 129 billion US dollars last year, of which Asia
accounted for two-thirds, with China drawing 42 billion.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed China's success in drawing investment to
its large and growing domestic market, its economic "soft landing"
as well as measures to promote investment in interior provinces.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, of accounting for an increasing proportion of
foreign investment, Asia's developing countries have also become
important sources of capital.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 51 billion US dollars, or about 15 percent
of all the world's outward investment last year, came from
developing countries, with Asian developing countries accounting
for 46 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The study added that in addition to the increased capital
inflows into Asia, Latin American countries and the Caribbean also
saw a sharp rise in investment last year, 50 percent up on 1995 to
39 billion US dollars.

LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain attracted 32.8 billion US
dollars of inward direct investment by European Union (EU)
countries last year, up from 22.8 billion in 1995, according to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The UK inflows accounted for 40 percent of all EU inward
investment and were more than double those into France, which
received 14.4 billion US dollars of EU investment last year, 1
billion more over 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to OECD data, Britain drew 81 billion dollar foreign
direct investment between 1991 and 1995, becoming the
third-largest host country in the world after the US and China.
</P>
<P>
The OECD said that much of the recent inward investment in
Britain took the form of mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
In the mean time, Britain was also the world's second-largest
source of outward foreign direct investment after the US last
year, with its outflows reaching a record 43.7 billion US dollars,
up from 42.7 billion in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's Government, Rebels to Negotiate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government and the
largest rebel group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA),
are scheduled to hold a new round of negotiations in August, the
independent Sudanese daily Alwan reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the Kenyan presidency has been trying
to make arrangements and hold contacts since the beginning of this
week with the mediator IGADD to set a date for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, no date has been fixed yet, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Government Authority for Drought and Development
(IGADD), which groups Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea,
Djibouti and Somali, has been trying to mediate an end to the
protracted civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted political sources as saying that the Kenyan
presidency will inform the Sudanese government and the rebel group
led by John Garang of the date of the negotiations as soon as it
completes contacts with the IGADD member states.
</P>
<P>
The same sources indicated that Garang has requested a delay of
the negotiations until October in a bid to win time to create
favorable military conditions that may boost his bargaining
position.
</P>
<P>
The sources further asserted that Sudan, having accepted
IGADD's principles of separating religion and politics and
instituting a multi-party system in Sudan, is determined to pursue
the peace process no matter the SPLA joins or not.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government signed a peace agreement with four
small southern rebel factions on April 21 in a bid to put an end
to the 13-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
However, the SPLA, the largest anti-government group operating
in southern Sudan, refused to sign the accord, creating
uncertainty over whether the peace can be holding.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's rebels in the south have fought the government since
1983, seeking a greater say in Sudan's affairs.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Voices "Absolute Support" for Poland's EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
expressed here today "absolute support" for Poland's bid to join
the European Union (EU), saying that "Poland is part of Europe.
Without Poland is the EU a torso."
</P>
<P>
Kohl made the remarks at a news conference after his meeting
with visiting Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
Kohl stopped short of naming any date for Poland's entry into
the EU, but he did stress that future EU members should be
admitted individually, not in groups. The admission of Austria,
Finland and Sweden to the EU as a group in 1996 should not serve
as a model for future enlargement, he added.
</P>
<P>
Poland was among the three Eastern European countries which
were invited last week to join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). The EU has yet to decide on candidates for
its own enlargement and is due to begin the new membership talks
next year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Kohl and Kwasniewski, who is accompanied by
other Polish leaders including Prime Minister Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz, was the inaugural session of planned regular
bilateral summits designed to promote relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders said that the current German-Polish ties are
better than any time in this century.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism of regular summits between German and Polish
leaders was initiated by Kohl during his visit to Warsaw in 1995.
Diplomats said Kohl wants to promote German-Polish ties in the
same manner which have boosted German-French ties since German
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and French President Charles de Gaulle
started regular German-French summits in 1958.
</P>
<P>
French and German leaders now meet twice a year for regular
summits and there are also annual German-Italian and
German-Spanish summits.
</P>
<P>
According to Kohl, it has not been decided how often the
German-Polish summits are due to be held. But he said that the
next meeting will probably be held early next year in Warsaw.

<HEADLINE> London Docklands Publishes 1996/97 Annual Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,200 new homes were sold
in London Docklands in 1996/97, the highest level since 1988 and
double the number of the previous year; 3,800 jobs were attracted
and 1.16 million sq. ft. of office space let.
</P>
<P>
In publishing the London Docklands Development Corporation's
(LDDC) 16th annual report today, Chairman Michael Pickard said, "With
just under a year to go, the LDDC's work to regenerate Docklands
is proceeding flat out. The last year saw every area of activity
move up a gear."
</P>
<P>
"Confidence is high and there is a great sense of optimism for
the future: more homes have been built and sold, nearly 4,000 jobs
created and more office space let. There is every indication that
the prospects look just as good for this year," the chairman
added.
</P>
<P>
The new Labor government's decision to press ahead with the
Millennium Exhibition Center is regarded as the best possible news
for the area and the company.
</P>
<P>
Together with the Jubilee Line Extension (underground) opening
in 1998, the program will secure the long-term future for the
people who live and work in London Docklands.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the Partnership was also announced, which is
a local labor initiative designed to ensure that local residents
have the opportunity to work on the construction of the new
developments taking shape in the area and in the new jobs that
will be created as a result.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that in the next 18 months work will start on
nearly 1 billion pounds (1.6 billion US dollars) worth of new
development in London Docklands including the hotel, residential
and leisure scheme in the area.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Seeks to Step Up Ties With Angola: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Portugal will create conditions to
consolidate peace and facilitate economic development in Angola
in a sense of responsibility as Lisbon attacks much importance to
its ties with Luanda, a visiting minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here for a three-day visit, Portuguese
Economic Minister Augusto Mateus told newsmen at the airport that
he seeks to establish bilateral prolonged ties of cooperation so
as to promote the economy of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese minister said Portugal should import more
products from Angola and invest more in the country and export
more to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and business circle are eager to reinforce
bilateral economic relations to the benefit of Angola's surge of
development, Mateus said.
</P>
<P>
What Luanda urgently needs is to rehabilitate its economy
damaged during the civil war to turn out various kinds of
necessities and streamline its technology to meet the new
situation of world markets, and it is on this very basis that
Portugal will start new cooperation to help promote the
development of Angola's industry, said the Portuguese minister.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Industry Minister Manuel Duque, Mateus
will make extensive contacts with leaders of the economic circle
here, tour enterprises in the capital and take part in the forum
"Investment Opportunities in Angola and the Prospect of
Portuguese Business".

<HEADLINE> Greece: Madrid Communique Just Declaration of Principles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Greek-Turkish joint communique
issued last Tuesday in Madrid was just a declaration of principles
and its effectiveness depended on future action by the two
countries, Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the communique was not an agreement but a joint
statement bearing the meaning of a non-aggression pact.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a climate of safety and stability in the
Aegean would depend on Ankara's future actions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The communique, which was signed between Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel and Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis while
attending the NATO summit in Madrid, called for respect for the
sovereignty of each country, international law and treaties as
well as resolution of disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, the cabinet unanimously endorsed the communique last
week, but 22 ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movements (PASOK)
deputies voiced their opposition to the communique.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that Athens was "gradually slipping into choices
that result in recognition of Ankara's claims, legalization of
Ankara's expansionistic status and an expiation of its policies."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in view of a PASOK Executive Bureau meeting on the
communique, Reppas said that party criticism of government actions
in relations with Turkey could create problems for the government.

<HEADLINE> Portugal, Angola to Promote Judicial Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Minister of Justice
Jose Vera Jardim said here today that Portugal wishes to
strengthen ties with Angola in the judicial field.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to the press upon arriving at the local
airport.
</P>
<P>
Jardim, who is currently in Luanda to attend the fourth
meeting of judicial ministers from Portuguese-speaking countries,
said, long years of civil war has seriously damaged Angola's
legal machines, adding that Portugal believes legal machines and
judicial system are essential to the development of a nation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he noted, Portugal intends to cooperate with Angola
in rebuilding the latter's legal machines.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Angola, former colony of Portugal which
gained independence in 1975, the Portuguese minister will
exchange broadly with colleagues in Angola to make their
cooperation effective.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting to be held from July 15 to 18 has its
theme focusing on "Youth Crimes and Street Children", which,
Jardim said is a common issue plaguing the seven
Portuguese-Speaking countries.
</P>
<P>
It should become their joint action to fight against youth
crimes, Jardim stressed.
</P>
<P>
Arriving on the same plane with Jardim were judicial ministers
from Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde and Brazil. The ministers of
Mozambique and Sao Tome and Principe are already in Luanda.

<HEADLINE> Saudi New Shura Council Takes Oath in Inauguration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Members of the new Shura
(Consultative Council) in Saudi Arabia took oath to start their
functions today, reports reaching here from Saudi red-sea coast
city of Jeddah said.
</P>
<P>
The oath was taken before the Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdulah
Aziz at the inauguration session of the council after its formation
according to a royal decree by the King earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd wished at the inauguration of the new council every
success for the members in their work for the welfare and
development of the Kingdom and its people, according to Kuwait
News Agency reports.
</P>
<P>
 The council was formed after King Fahd issued a decree on
July 5 to increase the number of the former consultative body from
60 to 91.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of half of the former council members was renewed
for another four years term while the remaining 30 were replaced
by new faces. The new body include a number of technocrats,
academics, social scientists and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Shura council in Saudi Arabia is a consultative body charged
with the right of providing suggestions and advises to the ruler
to help run the state affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Shura council was first established in the Kingdom in 1993
with only consultative powers. But it had offered advice and
undertaken serious research concerning many issues relevant to
every day life in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that its expansion comes as a further step to
its participation in the decision-making process in the Islamic
Kingdom and certainly an effort to make the council more
productive.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd had issued several royal decrees on the state
systems which included the council of ministers, the Shura
council and the formation of regional assemblies as part of
the Kingdom's drive to run the state affairs more effectively.
</P>
<P>
The council members could discuss the bills and laws issued
by King Fahd although they have no legislative authority.

<HEADLINE> Aids Epidemic Critical in Botswana: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- With the figures which show
four percent of the population will have AIDS and 18 percent will
be HIV-infected by 2000, the AIDS epidemic in Botswana has
entered a critical stage, a senior government official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a workshop held in Gaborone, Botswana, by the AIDS
unit of the Health Ministry, unit co-ordinator Rose Mandevu said
social and economic consequences would likely to deepen in the
next five years if nothing would be done to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
A report quoted Mandevu as saying the unit's plan to combat
HIV/AIDS over the next five years showed that of the 15 to 49
year-old most sexually active section of the population, 25
percent would be HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
She said the worst thing is that the most economically active
sectors of the population are most affected by the epidemic. In
Botswana people aged 15 to 49 accounted for 89 percent of all
reported cases, among which 56 percent were in the youth group
aged 15 to 29.
</P>
<P>
Early initiation of sex in Botswana increased exposure to HIV,
of all HIV cases reported in the 15- to 19-year age group between
1986 and the first quarter of 1996, 90 percent were of teenage
females, according to the plan.
</P>
<P>
The first case of AIDS was confirmed in 1985 in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Lack of women's empowerment against cultural and traditional
practices in sexual matters and relationships had been identified
as factors that made women more vulnerable to HIV infection, said
Mandevu.
</P>
<P>
From 1986 to 1996, women accounted for 68 percent of
infections in the 15- to 29-year age group, Mandevu said.
</P>
<P>
She also said the epidemic is expected to have significant
impact on the major gains made in the past two decades in
Botswana in the areas of child survival and mortality and life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
Between 1971 and 1991, infant mortality rate per 1000 had
declined from 92 to 45, while life expectancy had increased from
55.5 to 61.7 years, said the official.

full compliance by the parties, in particular by the government of
Croatia, with their commitments, as specified in the Basic
Agreement, to respect the highest standards of human rights and
fundamental freedoms and to promote an atmosphere of confidence
among local residents regardless of their ethnic origin.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming the right of all refugees and displaced persons
originating from Croatia to return to their homes of origin
throughout Croatia, the council strongly urged the government of
Croatia to eliminate promptly the administrative and legal
obstacles to the return of refugees and displaced persons, to
create the necessary conditions of security, safety, and social
and economic opportunity for those returning to their homes in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also urged the government of Croatia to
eliminate ambiguities in implementation of the Amnesty Law, and to
implement it fairly and objectively in accordance with
international standards, in particular by concluding all
investigations of crimes covered by the amnesty and undertaking an
immediate and comprehensive review with the United Nations and
local Serb participation of all charges outstanding against
individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian
law.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Increasing Role of Civilian Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today issued a presidential statement, calling for an increasing
role and special functions of civilian police in peacekeeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Security Council encouraged states to
make available to the United Nations at short notice appropriately
trained civilian police, if possible through the United Nations
stand-by agreements.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed the importance of the recruitment of
qualified civilian police from the widest possible geographic
range to serve in the United Nations operations. It also stressed
the importance of the recruitment of female police officers to the
United Nations operations.
</P>
<P>
The council underlined the necessity for the United Nations
civilian police to be trained as required to render assistance and
support in the organization, training and monitoring of national
police and to help defuse tension on the ground through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated the need for close coordination between civilian
police and the military, humanitarian and other civilian
components of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has established and authorized a growing
number of peacekeeping operations which contain both civilian and
military components. Civilian police in peacekeeping operations
have been playing a more and more important role those years in
contributing to the building of confidence and security between
parties and among local populations, in order to prevent conflict
and contain conflict or to build peace in the aftermath of
conflict.

KUWAIT CITY, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The new U.N. chief inspector
on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction Richard Butler will be here
Friday to detail his policies on Iraq to Kuwaiti officials,
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
An official from Kuwait Foreign Ministry said that Butler, who

Kuwait, would hold talks with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah, acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah
Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, parliament Speaker Ahmad Al-Saadoun

Kuwaiti leadership of the continued determination of the
U.N. Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) to obtain Iraq's
compliance with all U.N. resolutions related to its aggression on
Kuwait in 1990-91.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council has been continuing to oppose any

Iraq failed to grant UNSCOM inspectors immediate and
unconditional access to any location in its territories they
wished to examine in order to testify that Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction are thoroughly eliminated.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's new coalition government
announced today a rise of more than 30 percent of gasoline prices,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Gunes Taner, who is in charge of the
economy, said the increase of consumption taxes on petroleum
products was fair, adding that those who are richer should pay
more for using more petrol.
</P>
<P>
"In a country like Turkey where income distribution is
unjust, the tax burden is generally carried by fixed income
earners," Taner said.
</P>
<P>
He said:" Oil consumption in Turkey has increased to 30
million tonnes. If you keep the oil prices too low it will
disturb the balances and bring a new burden on public finances."
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the government has no intention to
increase petrol prices again except in the case of change in
world oil prices or the Turkish Lira's exchange value.
</P>
<P>
The new government has said that it was forced to raise the
petrol prices because it inherited a troubled economy with
inflation running at near 80 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
"Immediate measures must be taken to lower inflation.
Otherwise, we will be likely to have an inflation rate of 150
percent in 1998", Taner claimed.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC), the
European Union's executive body, said in a publication that it
expected sustained economic growth in Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EC made the remark against the backdrop that the economic
slowdown in Western Europe has had a negative impact on economic
growth in Central European countries (CECs) in 1996, though the
impact remained limited in most countries.
</P>
<P>
In the publication, Economic Reform Monitor, the EC noted that
in 1997 and 1998, growth is expected to accelerate again as the
CECs should be able to benefit from the anticipated faster
recovery in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
The EC explained that external deficits in CECs are rising
rapidly since imports are rising fast while export growth is
constrained by foreign demand. Economic growth is now mainly
driven by domestic demand, it added.
</P>
<P>
The total trade deficit of the CECs now represents some 7.5
percent of the region's GDP, according to the EC.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's democracy
could collapse if the corruption of the police and the judicial
system by organized crime syndicates was not stopped, Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki warned here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the weekend meeting of the
National Executive Committee (NEC), highest policy-making body of
the African National Congress (ANC), Mbeki said elements of the
previous apartheid government's security forces were also
contributing to the crime problem for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said: "It is quite clear that if the corruption in the
police, the judicial system, the prisons service and at the
Department of Home Affairs is not stopped, you could have a
collapse of the entire democratic system."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ANC's Acting Secretary-General Cheryl Carolus said
the NEC meeting noted and expressed serious concern about
evidence that elements from the old state security machinery were
involved in drug dealing, money laundering, car hijacking, taxi
violence and in organized crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these appear to be deliberately engineered and
politically motivated criminal actions," said Carolus.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also stressed that crime had political consequences,
adding commercial crime such as evading import border controls
and theft of containers affected people wanting to trade with
South Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
today that it will provide 27 million dollars more in food aid for
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as a response to
the latest appeal from the U.N. World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
"In response to the World Food Program's announcement July 9 of
an expanded appeal for humanitarian food aid for children in North
Korea, the United States government has decided to extend 100,000
metric tons of grain valued at approximately 27 million dollars,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The allocation of the food will be monitored by the World Food
Program and U.S. private and voluntary organizations, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"Forty-five thousand tons of grain will be monitored
exclusively by the World Food Program and used to feed children of
age 6 and under, in nurseries, kindergartens, and orphanages," he
said. "The distribution of the other 55,000 tons will be monitored
by a variety of U.S. private and voluntary organizations, who will
work in conjunction with the World Food Program."
</P>
<P>
Burns emphasized the aid will be directed at the most
vulnerable -- chiefly children, but also elderly population in the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Burns denied there is any links between the U.S. food aid and
its political talks with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"We have never linked food assistance to the political talks,"
he said. "We have great respect for the World Food Program. They
issued an urgent appeal for food because children and the elderly
are experiencing famine. And we felt... that we had to step up to
the plate and deliver."

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government Ready to Talk with Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government said
today that it is ready to pursue negotiations with the rebel
faction headed by John Garang to end the 13-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today before the Sudanese National Assembly, Foreign
Minister Ali Osman Mohamed Taha said the resumption of
negotiations with Garang would not affect the implementation of
the Khartoum peace agreement the government reached with four
small rebel groups in April.
</P>
<P>
The four small groups, along with the Garang-led Sudan People's
Liberation Army, the largest group, were fighting the government
in southern Sudan to seek a greater say in the country's affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Khartoum agreement, in which the Garang faction refused to
join, stipulates a referendum for people in south Sudan to decide
whether they would stay in or out of the country after a four-year
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to push forward the peace march, the accord and its
implementation will be included in a constitutional decree drafted
by the Justice Ministry, which is expected to take effect upon the
approval by the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Osman said President Omar Bashir would ask the National
Assembly to hold an emergency session to sanction the 14th
constitutional decree. After its passage, a coordination council
with both government and anti-government representatives will be
formed to take charge of affairs in southern Sudan in the next
four years before a plebiscite is held there for people to opt
between unity and secession.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the government and the Garang faction are
to take place in August under the auspices of the Inter-government
Authority for Drought and Development (IGADD).
</P>
<P>
The IGADD, which groups Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia,
Eritrea, Djibouti and Somali, has been trying to mediate a
settlement of the Sudan issue.
</P>
<P>
It issued a declaration of principles in 1994 calling for
separation of religion and politics and institution of a
multi-party system in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister told the National Assembly that
the government had rejected the declaration "because it entailed
conditions and issues that touch on the unity of Sudan."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Sudanese delegation to the recent IGADD
summit in Nairobi accepted it only "as an agenda" for renewed
negotiations with Garang. "It is not binding to Sudan," he added.
</P>
<P>
Osman also said that the Khartoum peace agreement had decided
the issue of self-determination as well as other points of
difference to be negotiated with Garang.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Parents Smoking Leads to 6,200 Children Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- At least 6,200 American
children die each year because of their parents' smoking,
researchers have found.
</P>
<P>
The researchers from the University of Wisconsin Medical School
in Madison, Wisconsin, said that the children were killed by such
things as lung infections and burns.
</P>
<P>
More young children are killed by parental smoking than by all
unintentional injuries combined, the researchers said in the July
issue of the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 5.4 million other youngsters each year
survive ailments such as ear infections and asthma that are
triggered by their parents' smoking. And the smoking-related
illness cost 4.6 billion U.S. dollars to treat annually.
</P>
<P>
The researchers estimated that the childhood loss of life from
parental smoking costs 8.2 billion dollars a year. The cost of
work time lost by parents caring for sick youngsters were not
included.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said 2,800 of the deaths are due to low
birth-weight caused by mothers who smoke while pregnant. About
2,000 of the deaths are attributed to sudden infant death syndrome
caused by secondhand tobacco smoke. About 1,100 are due to
respiratory infection. About 250 children die of burns from fires
caused by cigarettes, matches or lighters. And 14 children die of
asthma.

<HEADLINE> Calm Resumes After Fighting in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 14 (Xinhua) - All is quiet in Jui of the
eastern side of the capital after clashes between Sierra Leone
army and a contingent of Nigerian forces serving in the west
African Peace-keeping Forces (ECOMOG) over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The over 20-hour-long fighting which started on Saturday
afternoon, has left more than 30 civilians dead and about 50
seriously wounded, doctors at local hospitals said here today.
</P>
<P>
State television carried pictures on Sunday night of the
destruction and the bodies of a family of four killed in a bomb
blast from a Nigerian air force jet flying over the area.
</P>
<P>
The jet was sent when both sides used artillery and other
heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
A field visit to the area of Jui, 17 miles from the capital on
Sunday and early today by this Xinhua reporter showed that the
area has been completely devastated with many residents
abandoning their homes with bundles and mats for the capital.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides were dug in with trenches facing each other and
there are certain to be further clashes if the momentum
continues," he said.
</P>
<P>
A doctor at the central hospital said that 15 corpses of
civilians were now at the mortuary while the surgeon in charge of
the military hospital disclosed that 15 more bodies have also
been brought in.
</P>
<P>
"The bodies were completely mangled and hardly recognizable,"
said the surgeon.
</P>
<P>
Red cross officials are still searching for more bodies which
they believe would have been buried as a result of the
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Traffic between the capital and the interior is still
disrupted. But a senior military official assured it would
resume by midday.
</P>
<P>
About 10 Nigerians died in the fighting while the Sierra Leone
army said it lost five with 12 wounded.
</P>
<P>
There has not been any confirmation of the figures.

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush
said Monday in Austin, Texas, that he will answer questions about
a possible presidential bid when he makes his formal announcement

<HEADLINE> US Makes New Offer in Global Banking Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today held
out the prospect of expanded market access to foreign banks,
securities firms and insurance companies in an effort to achieve
similar benefits for American companies in global markets.
</P>
<P>
A new offer for the access was submitted today to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva where negotiators are trying to
achieve a global trade agreement covering the world financial
services market of more than 40 trillion dollars by a December 12
deadline.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky described the new proposal as a
good-faith offer to open the vast American financial services
market to foreign competition in exchange for other nations
extending the same market access to U.S. firms.
</P>
<P>
"With this offer, we are underscoring that the United States is
fully committed to reaching a successful conclusion to the WTO
negotiations," Rubin and Barshefsky said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said "it is critical that our trading
partners, especially the key emerging markets, submit
significantly improved offers that establish a level playing field
for U.S. firms to compete effectively."
</P>
<P>
The United States stunned other countries two years ago when it
walked away from a financial services deal on the grounds that the
offers from other countries, primarily emerging nations in Asia,
were not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. market is substantial one with assets in American
banks, securities firms and other financial institutions totaling
26.5 trillion dollars. The Clinton administration was under heavy
pressure from American financial institutions to pull out of the
talks two years ago because of insufficient offers from other
nations.

WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department today
said that there is no evidence that Americans were behind the
bombing of two hotels in Cuba's capital of Havana this weekend.
</P>
<P>
"There's no evidence whatsoever that Americans were behind it,"
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters. "And
needless to say, the United States government had absolutely
nothing to do with this."
</P>
<P>
Two Cubans were slightly injured in the two explosions, which
took place on Saturday at the Hotel National and the Hotel Capri
in Havana. Cuba has charged that the U.S. government is behind
it.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Interior Ministry said in a statement on Saturday that
it had evidence that the "people responsible for these deeds and
also the materials they used came from the United States."
</P>
<P>
Burns asked the Cuban government to turn over any evidence it
has that Americans were involved in bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We have no information whatsoever here in Washington or
Havana, in our interest section, about the origin of these
explosions...We know nothing about them," he added.
</P>
<P>
"If there's any information the Cuban government has that they
think is real, and they want to turn it over to us, if they think
Americans are implicated, we will listen," he said.

SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Andrej Strejlau, former head

post of Chinese Professional League side Shanghai Shenhua on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Strejlau, 57, trained the Polish national eleven for 54
international matches from 1989 to 1993. He had been Shenhua's
advisor since April.
</P>
<P>
He replaced Bulgarian-born Stojkov, who resigned on Sunday
night after Shanghai was drawn 0-0 by Guangzhou Apollo in a home
match on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Stojkov, who had coached the team for eight months, said he
could not stand the fierce competition in the league and "asked
for a refreshing leave", the club said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said his psychological burden was too heavy to bear, the
club added.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua, who won the league in 1995, is now second behind
Dalian Wanda on the 12-team league standings.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Li Lanqing, speaking
at a national meeting on anti-smuggling work today in Beijing,
said that China has had some achievements in its anti-smuggling
campaign, especially in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
From January of last year to June this year, a total of 20,908
smuggling cases were uncovered, involving more than 15 billion
yuan (some 1.8 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
But, Li pointed out, in spite of the success, the situation is
still serious and police must prepare for a crackdown in the
second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Attention should be paid to the seizure of some major items
like petroleum products, he said, and local officials must be
fully aware of the harmful nature of smuggling and must look after
the nation's interests instead of their own.
</P>
<P>
This is not only an economic campaign, he explained, but a
political one as well, because it is part of the anti-corruption
program and of developing the Party.
</P>
<P>
Because a few state-owned enterprises, collective firms, and
foreign-backed companies have been involved in the smuggling, big
cases must be investigated very thoroughly, he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Probe Nazi Gold Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's central bank is launching
an investigation into whether it was involved in transactions
dealing with looted Nazi gold, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada has started reviewing its records to verify
information in a newly declassified U.S. intelligence document.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you we will be pursuing our review quickly and
thoroughly so the situation can be clarified as soon as possible,"
the bank's governor Gordon Thiessen said in a letter to the
Canadian Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We share your concern that the gold of other central banks
held for safekeeping in Canada could have been associated in any
way, however indirectly, with Nazi Germany gold transactions," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. document dated September 10, 1944, and released last
week said Portugal used the Swiss National Bank to swap 20 tons of
looted Nazi gold for gold held in the Bank of Canada and the
U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
In 1942, the Bank of Portugal deposited about four tons of gold
it bought from Nazi Germany in its account with the Swiss National
Bank, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss transferred the same amount of gold in a Bank of
Canada account to the Portuguese, who in turn transferred the
title to the gold into its Swiss account.
</P>
<P>
In 1944, the Swiss and Portuguese swapped another 15 tons of
Nazi gold for gold held in the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the
document said.

</P>
<P>
School-age children can attend primary and middle schools near
their homes directly without any enrollment exams in 1998, Tao
noted. Those who want to receive further education can apply to
colleges and universities on their own without the approval of
local middle schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, education departments will make a joint
effort to compile new textbooks and teaching materials for primary
education, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The BEC will also set up more primary and middle schools in
rural areas and training programs for teachers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Genetically Altered Rice Developed In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have succeeded
in developing a new strain of rice by extracting an anti-herbicide
gene and injecting it into hybrid rice, which got state approval
today.
</P>
<P>
The herbicide used by farmers can kill weeds and low-quality
rice but leave the new strain of rice, thereby improving rice
output, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The technique will also help reduce the amount of time needed
to check the degree of purity of hybrid rice from four months to
four days, the experts say.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Members Grill Finance Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait' parliament today
interpellated Deputy Prime Minister and Financial Minister Naser
Al-Roudhan over alleged mismanagement, irregularities in handling
public funds and negligence.
</P>
<P>
The questioning motion was initiated by liberal members of the
National Assembly, which decided on July 8 to interpellate the
minister, who chairs the Kuwait Investment Authority which manages
the state's foreign investments of about 40 billion U.S. dollars,
the Central Bank and the Kuwait Airways.
</P>
<P>
Three parliament members today grilled the minister over his
failure to retrieve a sum of 25 million dollars deposited in a
"Tunisian bank suffering financial problems."
</P>
<P>
They accused him of lingering in the application of a certain
law related to the use of empty land plots, squandering huge sums
of public funds.
</P>
<P>
The minister was "reluctant to implement several important laws
directly related to public interests," they said. They also
questioned the standards and criteria adopted by the minister in
nominating chairmen and directors of state-owned institutions.
</P>
<P>
However, Acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah said earlier this month
that the cabinet was keen on supporting Al-Roudhan in the
parliament interrogation motion.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah praised Al-Roudhan's contributions to Kuwait's
post-war economic recovery and development, adding the questioning
was nothing more than the exercise of a constitutional right.
</P>
<P>
Twenty four lawmakers have filed 12 grilling motions against
government members in the history of Kuwait's democratic life
which began with the first legislative session in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The right has been practiced in Kuwait's previous parliaments
and has for once forced a minister to resign in 1985. This
questioning was the first since the election of the current
parliament in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
Al-Roudhan said last Wednesday he would stick to the truth if
he were challenged in parliament over his supervision of key
economic bodies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets With Vietnamese Party Leader (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, meeting today
with Do Muoi, general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party
(VCP) Central Committee, said that the two countries' leaders have
met several times since Do Muoi visited China in November 1995 and
these have played an important role in the development of
relations between the two parties and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that official talks between Jiang Zemin and Do Muoi on
Monday were "rich in content" and had "profound significance" for
the future development of relations and that promoting the
expansion of friendship and cooperation between the two countries
is not only in the basic interests of the two peoples, but also
benefits peace and stability in the region and the world as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and Vietnam are good neighbors with a
common border and common interests in many areas like politics and
the economy and that "We are ready to join efforts with the
Vietnamese side to expand relations in all aspects and to properly
resolve problems in bilateral relations that remain as soon as
possible to push Sino-Vietnamese friendship and co-operation to a
higher developmental level."
</P>
<P>
He said that China will stick to its independent foreign policy
of peace, maintain good-neighborly relations with neighboring
countries, and never seek influence in political or economic
spheres.
</P>
<P>
Its principle is equality and mutual benefit, he noted, and the
two sides should take their needs and their practicality into
consideration and should increase co-operation, standardize deals,
adopt successful international practices, and reform old customs.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to provide a certain amount of free aid to
Vietnam in so far as it can, though the amount will not be large,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises will be the major means of cooperation and the
Chinese government will support and guide them in taking part in
competition in Vietnam on an equal footing with others, he said,
adding that the Sino-Vietnamese Joint Committee on Economic
Cooperation will play a bigger role in this regard.

Substitutes include environmentally-friendly materials like
paper or plant fabrics, according to the order. Recyclable plastic

pay greater attention to more civil language and deeds, a clean
environment, service, and orderly traffic.
</P>
<P>
"Encouraging courtesy and new habits is an important part of

Communist Party of China," according to Ding Guangen, a member of
the Political Bureau and the Secretariat, of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ding is also director of the Central Commission for Guiding

<HEADLINE> HK Announces Two-Year Land Sales Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) today announced its land sales
program for the 21-month period from July 1997 to March 1999.
</P>
<P>
Director of Lands Robert Pope said that the program consists of
100 sites extending to some 157 hectares and is the precursor of
future two-year rolling programs.
</P>
<P>
The two-year program, from April 1997 to March 1999, includes
the four sites already sold since the beginning of the current
financial year and two Private Sector Participation Scheme sites
now being tendered.
</P>
<P>
Pope said that the approximate number of flats to be produced
from this program would be totaled at 55,224. An additional 7,750
flats would be generated from a number of private treaty grants,
with many other flats resulting from the processing of land
exchanges and lease modifications during the period up to March
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Some of the features he highlighted were the large number of
comparatively small sites in the program, which addressed the
Consumer Council's recent concern that, to the disadvantage of
small developers, an insufficient number of such sites were being
made available.
</P>
<P>
Others were the inclusion of four hotel sites, the development
of which will be an important contribution to satisfying the
current high demand for hotel accommodation, a number of
ex-government quarters sites, ex-military sites and the sale of
the Tamar Basin site.

BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, during a
visit to the Lucky Film Corporation in Hebei province's Baoding
yesterday, said that the country's film business should develop
more, and that the company should make a greater contribution by
adapting to the market.
</P>
<P>
Lucky is a key state-owned producer of film that has broken the
monopoly of foreign companies like Fuji and Kodak, and has a big
share of the domestic market. Its color film is sold in more than
40 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the central government has a policy of developing
the country's photo-sensitive paper industry with imported
technology and capital, and by setting up joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
It has also decided to adopt preferential policies to
encourage the development of Lucky's products.
</P>
<P>
In drawing up production plans, he said, Lucky should be
market-oriented and should pay attention to efficiency and respond
to market demands. The success of an enterprise is mainly the
result of the exploration and response to the market by making
products appealing to consumers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Li on the inspection tour were vice-premier Wu
Bangguo and other senior officials.

<HEADLINE> Stone Forest Commemorates Ming Dynasty General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A stone forest has been built here
to mark the 335th anniversary of the recovery of Taiwan by Zheng
Chenggong, a general of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Some 600 people from China's inland areas, Hong Kong and Taiwan
attended today's opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-sq.m. forest was built alongside a memorial hall for
Zheng in his hometown of Nanan in Quanzhou city in Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
The stone tablets in the forest are 1.6 m by 0.62 m to
commemorate the year 1662 when Zheng took Taiwan from Dutch
colonialists. They mostly contain inscriptions of prominent
people. Seven of them use Zheng's handwriting.
</P>
<P>
Zheng refused to be ruled by the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) and
led a group of men across the Taiwan Straits in 1661 and got
control of the island the following year.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Police Arrest 4 Murderers of Japanese Monk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Four of the six masked
assailants involved in the murder of Japanese Buddhist Yunataka
Nawatame have been arrested, Nepali police announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Inspector General of Nepali Police Dhurba Bahadur Pradhan told
a press conference that the four were netted Monday, and a massive
hunt is being launched to trace the other two who are still at
large.
</P>
<P>
Investigations found that the assailants had plotted to rob
Buddhist Nawatame of his money since June 27, Pradhan said.
</P>
<P>
They thought the Japanese monk involved in the construction of
the World Peace Stupa at Lumbini must have a large amount of
foreign currency, Pradhan said.
</P>
<P>
They sneaked into the monk's house on the night of July 3. But
Nawatame turned down their demand for money, so they shot him in
the neck, the police chief added.
</P>
<P>
Nawatame's death in Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha in
southern Nepal, has spelled a wave of condemnation across the
country.

<HEADLINE> 50th Anniversary of China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A high-profile meeting in Beijing
today marked the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, China's first autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, said that the event
celebrated the 50th anniversary of China's regional autonomy
system for ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
He said that in half a century the region has made remarkable
progress in economic and social programs under the leadership of
the Chinese Communist Party and the central government, and that,
"What has been done in the Inner Mongolia Region shows that the
Party leadership is the fundamental guarantor of the
implementation of the regional autonomy policy of ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
He added that as a state administrative region, the autonomous
region must implement the country's constitution, laws, decrees,
and policies, and work for the nation's interests.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the unity of ethnic minority groups and the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, head of the United Front Work Department of the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said at the meeting
that the regional autonomy system has guaranteed both the status
of ethnic groups in their regions and the unity of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, he said, there has been an increase in
ethnic conflicts and religious disputes in some countries and
regions, but, because of its regional autonomy system, China has
maintained ethnic harmony. He went on to say that the fundamental
thing is to improve people's standard of living and narrow the gap
between ethnic regions and other more developed parts of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets With Vietnamese Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
met with his Vietnamese counterpart Phan Van Khai here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The two vice-premiers exchanged views on furthering bilateral
economic and trade ties during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that the
frequent exchange of visits by the leaders of the two countries in
the past few years has given important impetus to Sino-Vietnamese
economic ties. The trade volume between the two countries has
increased year after year thanks to the joint efforts of the two
sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
China and Vietnam, linked by mountains and rivers, have similar
national conditions, Wu continued, noting that the two countries
enjoy a good political relationship and their economies are
complimentary, which provide good conditions and big potential for
bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the Chinese government place importance to
Sino-Vietnamese economic ties, Wu said. He expressed the belief
that the current China tour by Do Muoi, General Secretary of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of Viet Nam (CPV), would
open broader prospects for various forms of Sino-Vietnamese
economic and trade cooperation on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Phan, who is also member of the Political Bureau of CPV Central
Committee and is accompanying Do Muoi on his current China visit,
said that Do Muoi's visit would push forward Vietnam-China ties in
an all-round way and promote an early settlement of the left-over
problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese deputy prime minister expressed his hope that
the two countries would adopt practical measures to make bilateral
cooperation in economy, science and technology more fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister Liu Jiang of Agriculture briefed Do Muoi on
the development of China's agriculture this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese entrepreneurs also held talks with their
Vietnamese counterparts this afternoon to explore the
possibilities of expanding bilateral economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Warring Factions Lack Willingness for Peace: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The UN Special Envoy Norbert
Holl said today that Afghan warring factions especially the
Islamic Taliban militia still lack the willingness to make peace,
Pakistan Television (PTV) reported.
</P>
<P>
"They (the factions) have not yet reached a stage where both
sides are ready to compromise," Holl told reporters today in Kabul
after talks with Taliban's senior leaders, PTV reported.
</P>
<P>
Holl considered the Taliban as being the more belligerent
faction.
</P>
<P>
"The northern alliance in my view is rather ready to
participate in peace initiatives whereas the Taliban, I think,
still see themselves in a stronger position," Holl said.
</P>
<P>
"Afghanistan is no more a forgotten subject" because due to his
initiatives the war-torn country was now "permanently on the
agenda" of the UN Security Council, Holl said.

"Basically this phenomenon is natural, but such human
activities as the concentration of large numbers of people in the
city area certainly have some influence on the high temperatures,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Meteorology Bureau also say that since
late June, most parts of north China have experienced hot weather,
with the average highs being two to four degrees more than in
normal years.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Beijing Meteorological Observatory say that
this century similar phenomena have occurred several times, but
this will probably be the longest.
</P>
<P>
Although complaints can be heard almost everywhere, doctors
working in emergency wards are not much busier than usual. "Due to
various heatstroke prevention actions the number of patients have
not increased dramatically," said one doctor at Union Hospital.
</P>
<P>
However, experts say, the hot-weather will probably affect
grain output in the fall in north China, especially corn and
soybeans, and will very likely be followed by rainstorms.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Residents Hoping for Cooler Weather (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Eight extremely hot days have
caused the people of Beijing to pay more attention to the weather
than at any other time.
</P>
<P>
People gazed expectantly when dark clouds occasionly appeared
in the sky, but the clouds always drifted away, leaving the heat
waves and sighs of disappointment immediately after they had
concluded celebrations of the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Although cool rain is expected to be moving in gradually from
south China, there is little hope for the next two or three days
that the city's people will hear any good news from the weather
bureau.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Beijing Meteorological Observatory say that,
since July 8th, the daily highs in Beijing have been above 35
degrees C. The hottest was on July 13th, when temperatures over
most of the city were above 38 degrees, and the reading in the
Shijingshan District was 39.8.
</P>
<P>
"Having had two cool summers in 1995 and 1996, Beijingers will
complain more about the hot weather," said Lei Zhenfa, director of
the Beijing Meteorological Observatory.
</P>
<P>
Out on the streets, there are fewer pedestrians and bicycles
than usual, while people crowd into shops and department stores
with air-conditioning not only to shop but also to enjoy the cool.
</P>
<P>
At a Baishiqiao intersection, a traffic policeman said that
people are staying in their offices longer to avoid the sunlight,
so afternoon rush hour has moved from about 5:00 p.m. to after
6:00.
</P>
<P>
According to Huang Chaoying, a senior expert from the State
Metoerology Bureau, the main cause of this year's sustained hot
weather is a strong pressure-ridge over the city.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Police Seize Big Heroin Haul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Romanian police seized some 83
kilograms of heroin from a truck in the capital on Monday, their
biggest haul so far this year, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Police, who searched the truck after a tip-off, also found more
than 20 kilograms of explosives in the vehicle owned by a Turkish
company. They also detained four people suspected of drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the four people, including a Romanian and
foreigners, are suspected of belonging to an international drug
cartel and were involved in drug trafficking under the cover of
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Romania has become a key staging post for European
drug-traffickers since 1991. Drugs from the Middle East, Asia and
Latin America are increasingly being smuggled to other European
countries via the central European nation.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, only 35 kilograms of drugs were seized but in 1996 5.7
tons of drug were seized. Some 1.4 tons of drugs have been seized
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
A tenth of the drugs smuggled into Romania are sold in the
country to a growing number of drug addicts, mainly youngsters,
the reports said.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
has reduced the liquidity ratio requirements for commercial
banks from 25 percent to 20 percent, according to a statement
from the bank today.
</P>
<P>
The move will make banks and non-bank financial bodies in
Kenya have more resources available for lending, thus
encouraging them to lower their base lending rates, said the
statement made by Reuben Marambi, the chief CBK banking manager.
</P>
<P>
CBK has demanded all banks and non-banking
institutions to maintain a certain percentage of their assets
in liquid form to facilitate day-to-day business.
</P>
<P>
CBK also requested financial institutions as from August 1
to declare a specific base lending rate.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of CBK's efforts to restructure domestic
debt from the short-dated Treasury bills to long-term bonds and
governmental stocks, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The bank's fourth issue of floating rate Treasury bonds which
have a much higher yield than the 91-day Treasury bills started
trading last week at the secondary market.
</P>
<P>
Yields on the 91-day bills for the first time this year fell
to under 20 percent last month. Now they stand at 18.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates on loans in the eastern African country
have been the subject of debate with investors saying they are a

<P>
Li, also chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, said that the

<P>
Li said that China and Vietnam have proven that there must be
reforms to strengthen and develop socialism, and that Maxist
theory should be combined with reality to keep its vitality.
</P>
<P>
"It is a long process before socialism matures, so it is
necessary to keep on exploring and perfecting and developing it
through reforms," and it is also natural that there are problems
in the reforms, but those problems can only be solved by
maintaining the reforms, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe in socialism because it is truth which came from
practice and has been proven by practice," he said, "but, we must
admit that Marxism does not contain all the truths, and it must be
developed through practice."
</P>
<P>
"We can not expect classical authors to foresee everything
today from decades or a century ago," he said, and it is necessary
to combine Marxism with steadily changing reality in order to give
it vitality from nutrition and enrich its content.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee, with Jiang Zemin as its core will
stick to the Marxism of contemporary China: the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics which was initiated by the
late Deng Xiaoping, he added.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi said that he is pleased to see China's achievements in
reforms and the open-up drive, reunification, and foreign affairs,
and that with the development of China's socialist reforms, China
has gained much precious experience.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Vietnamese Communist Party, the Vietnamese
government and people, Do Muoi wished the Chinese people, under
the leadership of the CPC with General Secretary Jiang Zemin at
its core, greater success in its Socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes China will achieve its modernization goals.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese leader said his country is willing to deal with
Vietnamese-Chinese relations by taking the overall situation into
account, and that maintaining friendly relations between the two
peoples is important for the two countries and for peace,
development and progress in the world.
</P>
<P>

<P>
HONG KONG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A ceremony was held here today
to mark the end of term for the Hong Kong Regional Affairs
Advisors engaged by the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, held in the China Resources Building, was
attended by Qin Wenjun, vice director of the Xinhua News Agency
Hong Kong Branch, and nearly 200 Regional Affairs Advisors from
Kowloon area.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on behalf of Zhou Nan, director of the Xinhua Hong
Kong Branch, Qin said that all the Regional Affairs Advisors have
done a lot of work for and made significant contributions to the
smooth transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"You have won the people's respect and your names will be
recorded in history," he said.
</P>
<P>
Between March 1994 and July 1995, the Xinhua News Agency Hong
Kong Branch engaged a total of 670 Hong Kong residents from
various social circles as Hong Kong Regional Affairs Advisors.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important measure to ensure Hong Kong's smooth
transition and to implement the principle of 'one country, two
systems' and 'Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong' with a
high degree of autonomy," Qin noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Branch has attached great importance
to the role of the advisors, and has kept close contact with them.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, he said, various offices of the Xinhua
Branch across Hong Kong invited the advisors to more than 440
panel discussions and consultative conferences on Hong Kong
regional affairs, and solicited individual opinions from the
advisors frequently.
</P>
<P>
"Though your term has come to an end, we hope that you will
continue to be concerned about the regional affairs of Hong Kong,
and support the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region," he added.
</P>
<P>
A similar ceremony was held Monday for 192 Regional Affairs
Advisors from Hong Kong Island area. It was attended by vice
director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch Zhang
Junsheng.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, South Africa to Form Economic Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and South Africa have
agreed to set up a joint commission to enhance bilateral trade and
economic ties, Minister/State Secretary Drs Moerdiono said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by Indonesian President Soeharto and
his South African counterpart Nelson Mandela during their talks at
the Merdeka Palace earlier today.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to form the commission was taken after learning
that the trade volume between the two countries is still low,"
Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to involve the two countries'
private sectors in the economic commission.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Mandela also expressed his country's wish to
host the next non-aligned movement summit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said Indonesia is ready to share its experience of
hosting the summit with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
South Africa also asked Indonesia to support its bid to hold
the 2004 Olympic games, Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived here Monday for a three-day state visit,
began his visit in Indonesia's island resort of Bali Saturday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Indonesia established diplomatic ties after
South Africa's historic all-race elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries has increased by 309 percent
since 1993. Last year South Africa's exports to Indonesia stood at
167.8 million U.S. dollars, while imports from Indonesia totaled
100.1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Mandela will fly to Bangkok for a two-day
visit there.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- AIDS deaths continue to decline in the United States and the
trend is expected to go on, Federal health officials said. The
number of deaths dropped 19 percent, to 30,700 from 37,900, in the
first nine months of 1996 compared to same period of 1995. For
the first time, deaths of women decreased -- although by 7 percent
compared to the 22 percent decline in deaths among men.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Census Bureau said Monday that "limited use of
scientific sampling" is essential to making the year 2000 census
accurate, a position that angered congressional Republicans who
are insisting on an old-fashioned head count of the nation's
population.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton summoned Republicans and Democratic
congressional leaders to the White House for a meeting today in
hopes of bringing the last round of balanced budget negotiations
to a conclusion by as early as the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- TWA-crash investigators conducted inflight testing of the
center fuel tank of a chartered 747 off the coast of New York, the
first in a series. The flights are expected to continue for at
least 10 days, and each is supposed to measure a variable that may
have contributed to the July 17, 1996, explosion and crash that
killed 230 people.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton endorsed a proposed law Monday that would
bar health insurance companies, employers and managed care plans
from discriminating against people on the basis of their genetic
make-up. His support raises the profile of the issue, which has
stirred broad concern as an increasing number of genetic tests
becomes available.

<HEADLINE> KEDO Sets South Korean Vessels Test Sail to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Two South Korean vessels set off for
Shinpo Port in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
today in a test run for the transport of machinery and materials
needed to build light-water reactors (LWR).
</P>
<P>
The vessels were sent by the Korean Peninsula Energy
Development Organization (KEDO), a U.S.-led international
consortium which is providing the reactors to the DPRK as part of
a 4.5 billion U.S.-dollar agreement between the U.S. and the DPRK
in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the DPRK agreed to freeze its nuclear program,
which Washington suspected was being used to develop nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
In return, the United States agreed to arrange the provision of
two LWRs generating 1,000 megawatts of power each by around 2003.
</P>
<P>
Since the construction of the LWRs will be done by South Korean
firms, the equipment and materials are being shipped through the
shortest route to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The ships, which left the port of Ulsan in South Korea's North
Kyongsang Province today, will arrive at Yanghwa port in Shinpo,
where the LWRs will be built, on July 17.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK ship will guide the navigation once the vessels enter
its territorial waters, officials from KEDO said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven South Korean crew members, one KEDO staff member and
three South Korean officials related to the LWR project are on
board one barge belonging to the South Korean Express Company.
The vessel is also transporting desks, chairs and other office
equipment for KEDO's office which will be set up in Shinpo.

<HEADLINE> Waste Dumping Poses Threat in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 17,000 tons of waste
oil dumped, burnt or used as wood preservative in Kenya every
year, posing a serious environmental and economic hazard, a local
press report said today.
</P>
<P>
Although waste oil recycling facilities exist in Kenya, only
500 out of 29,000 tons of used lubricants is recycled annually.
The recycled rate is less than 2 percent, agaisnt nearly
40 percent in Germany, 38 percent in Israel and more than 30
percent in South Africa, said the report.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of waste oil generated by industries in Kenya
is estimated to be burnt in boilers as it is cheaper than fuel
oil.
</P>
<P>
"Some laundry firms buy used oils from garages for use in
their boilers, not realizing that there is chlorine contamination
originating from the use of solvents in degreasing and oil
cleaning," said S. Kantaria, a director of Waste Reclaimers
Kenya, the country's key collector of oil for regeneration.
</P>
<P>
Burning oil contaminated with chlorinated solvents will
produce hydrochloric acid in the emissions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The dumping of oil in Kenya is usually due to ignorance, or a
don't-care attitude, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Oil may end up in the soil in the country because of leaking
tanks or over-turned tankers and often people will throw waste
oil to suppress dust on roads or in sewerage after servicing
vehicles, added the report.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that oils used in Kenya are generally heavier in
sulphur compared with most developed countries, which restrict
sulphur to less than 0.3 percent. The figure in Kenya is more
than one percent.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Calls for UN Action Against Sudan's Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government has
called on the United Nations Security Council to take appropriate
and prompt action against the Sudanese authorities' plot to
assassinate Presidnet Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of weekly "Eritrea Profile"
available here today, Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldetensae
made the appeal in a letter to current President of the UN
Security Council Peter Osvald.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, he noted that the aborted plot to assassinate
President Isaias is "gross violation of the principles of the UN
charter and rules of international law."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the primary motive behind the
assassination plot is to bring about political confusion in
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Sudanese regime of being prepared to take to
pursuing its objective of subversion, terror and destabilization,
urging the Security Council to take appropriate action without
further delay.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Eritrean government exposed that the Sudanese
government plotted to assassinate President Isaias, dispatching a
member of its security forces to Eritrea on November 14, 1996 to
infiltrate into the National Democratic Alliance of the Sudan
based in Eritrea "so as to accomplish the abominable act".

<HEADLINE> Australia to Suspend Military Aid to Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia is to suspend its
military aid to Cambodia following the ouster of First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh by his rival, Second Prime
Minister Hun Sun, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the future of the 1.5 million U.S.-dollar defense
cooperation program, which involves communications training,
maritime maintenance and language training in Cambodia, would
depend upon Cambodia's commitment to peace and democracy.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister said Australia's commitment to
mine clearing in Cambodia would continue.
</P>
<P>
He said other major donors would be consulted before Australia
decides on the future of its 24 million U.S.-dollar general aid
program to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The future of our aid program will take into account whether
the situation on the ground allows for an effective aid program,
the acceptability of the policies of the Cambodian government, and
the views of other major donors and ASEAN countries," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Australian government had made clear
the military overthrow was "completely unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia's recognition of Hun Sen's government was
not an issue, as Australia had a policy of recognizing states, not
governments.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Adopt More Comprehensive Policy Towards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will adopt a more comprehensive policy
towards Myanmar upon its joining the regional grouping, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who is also chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee,
told Parliament that ASEAN's policy and approach, with priority on
constructive engagement at present, was most suited to Myanmar but
on its joining ASEAN, a more comprehensive policy would be
adopted.
</P>
<P>
When Myanmar eventually becomes a member of ASEAN, the
grouping's policy towards the country will change from that of
constructive engagement to a more comprehensive one as certainly
there are other matters and other ASEAN approaches and procedures
which that country is required to observe, he said in reply to
opposition leader Lim Kit Siang during question time in the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar along with Laos will be admitted into the regional
grouping at the forthcoming ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on July
24-25 as decided by ASEAN foreign ministers at their special
meeting here on May 31.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said ASEAN was prepared to give sufficient time to
Myanmar to make changes because the regional grouping understood
the difficulties faced by that country to initiate them in a short
time.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN understood the views of other nations over
Myanmar's membership in ASEAN but the decision made by the
regional grouping must be based on the interests of the region and
ASEAN.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Population Grows To 17.89 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Australia's population rose by
1.04 million, or 6.2 percent, to 17,892,423 during 1991 to 1996,
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said today.
</P>
<P>
ABS spokesman Stuart Jackson said the population had grown
despite lower levels of immigration in recent years and a drop in
birth rates.
</P>
<P>
Results of the August 1996 census, which were released today,
also show Australia now has more females than males, and the
number of people identifying as aboriginal or Torres Strait
Islanders has jumped 33 percent since the previous census
conducted in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The census showed women outnumbered men in all states except
Western Australia, where the population of two sexes were equal,
and the Northern Territory where men outnumbered women. Nationally
Australia's population is now 50.5 percent female and 49.5 percent
male.
</P>
<P>
The census records a dramatic jump in people identifying as
indigenous following greater publicity on indigenous issues.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 figure of 352,970 aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islanders is 33 percent up from the 1991 figures and 55.1 percent
up from the 1986 figures.
</P>
<P>
According to the census, Australia's population is continuing
to age. The proportion of the population aged over 65 grew from
11.3 percent in 1991 to 12.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The median age of males has increased from 30 years to 33 for
men and from 31 to 34 for women over the 10 years since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Today's data shows there are also more younger people, with
3,852,120 Australians under 15 as compared with 3,764,682 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The number of people born overseas has dropped to 21.8 percent,
from 22.3 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Despite independent MP Pauline Hanson's concerns about the
level of Asian immigration, the statistics show that of
Australians born overseas, 56.7 percent were born in Europe and
the former USSR, 21.9 percent in Asia and 4.9 percent in the
Middle East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 47.2 percent of Australians over 15 had a yearly
income of less than 11,700 U.S. dollars, with 5.3 percent having
more than 39,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Australians renting homes rose from 26.7 percent in 1991 to
28.7 percent last year, while the number of homes owned rose
slightly from 40.4 percent to 40.9 percent, and the number of
homes being purchased dropped from 26.7 percent to 25.5 percent in
1996.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Government Takes Measures to Ensure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government led by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has launched major constitutional
reforms to ensure smooth governance, political stability and
consequently economic development.
</P>
<P>
With the unanimous adoption of the 14th Constitutional
Amendment by the National Assembly on July 1, the 46-year-old
Sharif, who came to power in mid-February, has got another feather
in his cap.
</P>
<P>
The apparent purpose of the 14th Amendment, which bans change
of loyalty by parliamentarians elected on tickets of their
respective parties, is to root out floor-crossing, horse trading
and blackmailing which have become a malaise in the country's
political life, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
"We are introducing structural changes in Pakistan politics,
and as a whole, the nation will feel satisfied with the
performance of the politicians," said the beaming Sharif after all
the members of the National Assembly voted in favor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the majority of governments were thrown out by
forcing the ruling members to change their loyalties," he said.
"We will not do so. We would bury all the ill practices of the
past."
</P>
<P>
The passage of the 14th Amendment is seen as a second landmark
legislative measure by the Sharif government to safeguard its
ruling position.
</P>
<P>
With the passage of the 14th Amendment, Sharif has acquired
full control over his party, the observers said, because the party
members' political fate is now tied to that of the party leaders,
who they can desert and disobey only at the cost of losing their
seats.
</P>
<P>
The Sharif government has also introduced another
constitutional reform removing unrestricted presidential power to
dismiss an elected government.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Pakistan's parliament unanimously adopted the 13th
Amendment to scrap the article in the Constitution empowering the
president to dismiss an elected government and dissolve the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
With the 13th and 14th Amendments in hand plus his party's
majority in parliament, Sharif was likely to avoid premature
departure from power and unnecessary political confrontation, the
observers said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that these constitutional reforms by Sharif's
government in a short span of five months will not only strengthen
the government but also pave the way for carrying out Sharif's
economic reforms.

independent survey of customer views on the services, the Hong
Kong Post's first customer service pledge, and its achievement for
the first time of the pledge to deliver 98 percent of local
letters on the day after collection.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 94 percent of respondents from the
general public, 96 percent of the business sector and 86 percent
from the philately sector were satisfied or extremely satisfied
with the Post's services.
</P>
<P>
The first customer service pledge formalizes Hong Kong Post's
commitment to fulfill needs and exceed expectations, with
professional and caring services which are on time, reliable,
convenient and outstanding value for money.
</P>
<P>
Footman said: "These results demonstrate that 1996 was a good
year for Hong Kong Post. But they also provide the further
impetus to our efforts to improve our services," he said.
</P>
<P>
Plans have been developed to improve in areas identified by
customers in the survey, especially waiting time, customer
friendliness and availability of philatelic products and to reduce
waiting time at the counters, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Post was pressing ahead with new and improved
performance pledges and services, including a freeze on postage
rates until July next year, extend discounts for bulk postings and
a new bulk economy service.
</P>
<P>
Footman assured 11 new pledges for the 1997, including seven
improved pledges, two new pledges and two pledges for new
services.
</P>
<P>
Among them are delivery of all local mail on the day after
collection, serving customers within 10 minutes, delivery of all
outward airmail to the first available flight, delivery of all
inward airmail arriving in Hong Kong before 2:00 p.m. to major
commercial and industrial areas, on the next day, delivery of all
parcels to major commercial and industrial areas within two days
and processing various applications within seven working days.

<HEADLINE> HK To Launch Vaccination Program Against Measles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is to kick off a large
vaccination program late this month against a predicted measles
epidemic, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Starting from July 28, a total of 580,000 targeted people will
get the free measles shots at 110 government clinics under the
program, the Hong Kong Standard quoted a spokesman for the
Department of Health as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 teenagers queued up for appointment slips on
Monday since youngsters aged between 12 and 19 are among the
vulnerable group to the disease.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a small outbreak of measles and rubella
affected some 2,000 people in Hong Kong, according to the South
China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to inject 15 million HK dollars
(about two million US dollars) into the vaccination program, which
aims to inoculate 1.2 million people ahead of an expected measles
outbreak this winter.

HONG KONG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) Chief Executive Joseph Yam has expressed his strong
confidence in the strength of the Hong Kong dollar at a time when
some currencies in Southeastern Asia plunged under heavy
speculative attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged to the US dollar at a
rate of HK$7.780, was not vulnerable to speculators on the
currency market thanks to its underlying strength, today's Hong
Kong Standard quoted Yam as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange rate has been very stable. We're absolutely not
concerned at all," the HKMA Chief Executive was quoted as
saying. Yam's confidence in the local currency came from Hong
Kong's hefty foreign reserves of more than 80 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hong Kong has signed with many Asian countries
repurchase agreements, which ensure the authority has sufficient
liquidity to fight speculators, Yam told another local English
newspaper the South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's economy boasts sound fundamentals -- five
to six percent GDP growth per year, a low jobless rate and a
healthy balance sheet.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Build Airport-HK Direct Ferry Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to start construction of a
terminal near its international airport later this year and open a
direct ferry service to Hong Kong by August 1998.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Ho, the Macao casino magnate who headed the Macao
Tourism and Amusement Company, told the local press that his
company is to start construction of the Macao International
Airport Ferry Terminal within the year.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion and operation in the latter half of next year,
passengers to the Macao airport will be able to leave for Hong
Kong directly by boat in a trip that will cost about an hour.
</P>
<P>
Stanley said the plan has been delayed for some time because
there are "some problems yet to be solved." The cost of the
project will also increase, he said, refusing to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to boost the competitiveness of the
Macao International airport as the new Hong Kong airport at Chek
Lap Kok will be inaugurated soon.
</P>
<P>
Passengers from Hong Kong can take the direct ferry service to
the Macao airport and those destined for Hong Kong can also take
the service, which is cheaper than via the Hong Kong new airport.

<HEADLINE> Macao Tourist Arrivals Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Macao in the
first five months dropped 2.4 percent from the same period last
year, the latest statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
show that the number of tourists coming to Macao reached
3,200,913, down 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists traveling to Macao plummeted in April
and May, when only 1,198,971 tourists were recorded. The number
increased 2.7 percent in the first quarter of the year, reaching
2,001,942.
</P>
<P>
Comparing with April 1996, tourist arrivals dropped 9.4
percent, and comparing with May last year, the number dropped 10.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attributed the decrease of tourist arrivals
mainly to the result of a negative image to outsiders after an
avalanche of foreign news coverage of Macao's crimes earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that the number of passengers from Hong Kong, the
dominant source of tourists for Macao, declined 13.7 percent in
the five months. The number of Japanese tourists dropped 7.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of tourists from Taiwan, China's inland
areas and Britain show a continuous rise.
</P>
<P>
The number of travelers from Taiwan rose 73 percent by May,
from China's inland areas 17 percent and Britain 28.1 percent,
compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Macao tourism officials earlier expected the number of tourists
to reach nine million this year, after it surpassed 8.15 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a big income earner for Macao with a population of
450,000.

<HEADLINE> Consular Assistance, Protection Offered to HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in Cambodia
and the Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Commissioner in
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) have done a lot
of work to protect Chinese Hong Kong citizens stranded in
Cambodia, said a spokesman for the Commissioner's Office here
today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that since the military conflict broke out
in the capital Phnom Penh some 10 days ago, they have been working
very closely with the SAR Government in providing consular
assistance and protection to Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He said that when the conflict happened, the Chinese Embassy
immediately called a meeting of representatives from related
companies to give a briefing on the situation in Cambodia, and
arranged a hotline and contacts for Chinese citizens in Cambodian
to get in touch with the Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Embassy made it clear that all Chinese nationals, including
Hong Kong residents with British National (Overseas) passports,
would be offered consular protection and assistance. At that time
some Chinese Hong Kong citizens were in the warring areas, and the
Embassy assisted them in moving to safe places.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that, in order to provide timely consular
protection, the Embassy issued a public notice twice to invite
Chinese citizens, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan
compatriots, to register at the Embassy.
</P>
<P>
So far 79 Hong Kong compatriots have registered at the Embassy,
most of whom have left Cambodia, while the remaining will make
their own decision either to leave or stay, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Embassy has made representations many times with
the Cambodian government, demanding the Cambodian side to adopt
necessary measures to protect the life and property safety of all
Chinese citizens in the country.
</P>
<P>
So far no casualties have been reported among Chinese Hong Kong
citizens, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Office of the Chinese Foreign Ministry's
Commissioner in HKSAR actively cooperated with the Embassy in
Cambodia and kept in close touch with the SAR Government. The
Office made timely reports on Hong Kong people's demand and played
a link-up role.
</P>
<P>
The Office has also opened a hotline to answer Hong Kong
compatriots' inquiries and passed their requirements onto the
Embassy in time, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said at present the Cambodian situation tends to become
stable, and the Embassy has decided that at this moment it does
not consider dispatching planes to evacuate Chinese citizens in
Phnom Penh, but will continue to maintain close contact with them,
so that consular assistance and protection can be offered to them
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Embassy will continue to negotiate with
Cambodian officials and the local police force, and strongly
demand the Cambodian authorities to adopt practical and feasible
measures to protect the life and property safety of all Chinese
citizens in Cambodia, including compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Office will continue to work closely with
the SAR Government and the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, so that
the rights and interests of Hong Kong compatriots in Cambodia can
be better protected.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Needs $1bn to Repair Ailing Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria needs 86 billion Naira
(over one billion U.S. dollars) to repair its ailing refineries,
which have led to continuous fuel shortage in this top
oil-producing country in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chief Dan Etete, the petroleum resources minister revealed
this Monday while addressing the Nigerian Guild of Editors in
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with the money provided, the
rehabilitation of the country's four ailing refineries will take
18 months and will allow them to operate at an average of 85
percent of their installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
The four refineries, two in Port Harcourt, one in Warri and
another in Kaduna, were built seven to 32 years ago. Aging
equipment plus poor maintenance have reduced their production to
half of their capacities.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, none of the four refineries has
undergone thorough maintenance in the last three to four years,
whereas such maintenance should be done in every two years.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the refineries can only produce a total of nine
million litres of fuel everyday, only half of the country's daily
consumption, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the maintenance problem, the minister also called for
the need to hire foreign vessels to lift fuel to Lagos and other
coastal cities, as the existing pipeline systems are aged and
insufficient.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Allows No Demonstration Without Written </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma has announced Monday that no more public protests will be
allowed without the written approval of the police.
</P>
<P>
The move follows a demonstration for jobs by 600 ex-combatants
in Oshakati last Tuesday, during which four regional councillors
of the ruling South West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO)
were held hostage,local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a stern public address made in Windhoek, Nujoma said no
person had the right to "attack physically, molest, hold hostage
or interfere with other citizens" as had happened at Oshakati.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he decreed that in future no citizen would be
allowed to hold public demonstrations without the written
permission by the police.
</P>
<P>
Political parties have the right to organize, politicize,
campaign, recruit members from society, the president said,
adding that this also applied to trade unions and members of
civil society.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that citizens would from now on be able
to do so "only after obtaining permission to hold such
demonstration".
</P>
<P>
The demonstration at Oshakati, that sparked the presidential
decree, followed a two-week protest for jobs by former fighters
in Windhoek, which had government scrambling for solutions.
</P>
<P>
The protest dissolved once Nujoma had personally promised the
fighters jobs in various government ministries and projects,as
well as private companies.
</P>
<P>
About 23,000 former fighters of the People's Liberation Army
of Namibia and the South West Africa Territory Force as well as
the special unit of the former South African police, were
demobilized with independence.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman: US Should Not Issue Transit Visas to Taiwan Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China expressed the hope here
today that the United States will not allow Taiwan's leaders to
enter the US on a transit visa so that they can carry on
activities of creating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" in
an attempt to split the motherland, and thereby avoid damaging
Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said that the
US should adhere to the principles of the three Sino-US
communiques and honor what it has said in addition.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks at a weekly press briefing in response to
a question about a report that the US government will issue a
transit visa to Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that the Taiwan issue is the most important and most
sensitive issue in Sino-US relations, and that the proper handling
of the issue is the key to a healthy and stable development of
Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that Taiwan's leaders' real reason for trying to
transit the US is to sabotage the cause of peaceful reunification
of China by creating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan," and
to damage Sino-US ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken note of the fact that the US government has
repeatedly reaffirmed its 'one China' policy and would abide by
the three Sino-US communiques," Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure Projects in China's Inland Draw Foreign Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Investors are facing increasing
competition in the road building sector, one of the key
infrastructure industries in the Chinese inland areas, according
to a report released today by Salomon Brothers.
</P>
<P>
In its latest research report entitled "China Infrastructure
Sector -- the Road Builders," Salomon Brothers attributed the keen
competition to enhanced access to overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), China is
expected to spend 20 billion US dollars on building national
highways. Salomon Brothers forecast that four to five billion US
dollars will be raised in forms of foreign funds, including loans
from the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank, project
financing funds from foreign banks and money pooled from equity
market.
</P>
<P>
Cathy Chang, the regional infrastructure analyst of Salomon
Brothers, said: "The rising number of initial public offerings in
the sector has also reduced the scarcity value of the original
road builders."
</P>
<P>
So far, four highway companies of the Chinese inland areas have
gone public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, raising a total of
9.273 billion HK dollars (1.190 billion US dollars). Some Hong
Kong-based companies have shifted their focus on infrastructure
investment in inland provinces, mainly toll roads and bridges, and
power plants.
</P>
<P>
Chang expected that the infrastructure boom would continue in
the second half of this year with more new issues in the pipe line
and further fund-raising activities by listed companies.
</P>
<P>
Apart from fund raising on the stock market, debt financing
will become an important channel to pool more foreign funds into
the capital-intensive infrastructure sector in inland
areas. "Raising fund on debt market is generally cheaper than on
equity market," said Chang.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Consumer Price Index Up 2.8 Pct This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's year-on-year
consumer price index (CPI) for the first six months 1997 expanded
2.8 percent to 109.3 against the corresponding period of 1996,
according to the official figures released here today by the
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the CPI which is a measure of inflation during
the January-June period this year was due to increases observed in
the indices of all main groups except for clothing and footwear
which decreased 0.5 percent, the Statistics Department said.
</P>
<P>
The two main groups -- food and gross rent, fuel and power
together -- accounted for 85.8 percent of the overall increases
recorded in the current period under review.
</P>
<P>
The 4.9 percent increase in the index for food was the result
of a 4.2 percent increase for food at home coupled with an
increase of 6.7 percent for food away from home.
</P>
<P>
Eight sub-groups of food at home recorded increases during the
period with higher increases shown by meat (7.1 percent), fish
(6.7 percent), and rice, bread and other cereals (6.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
Other increases recorded were for milk and eggs, other foods,
coffee and tea, sugar, and fruits and vegetables, while the index
for oils and fats decreased 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CPI for June this year rose 2.2 percent to 109.5 from the
same month last year, and compared with the previous month, it
decreased 0.1 percent, brought on by a 0.2 percent decrease in the
indices of the main group Food.
</P>
<P>
As for beverages and tobacco, furniture and household equipment
and operation, transport and communication and recreation,
entertainment, education and cultural services, the indices in
June remained stable at 105.3, 103.9, 103.8 and 106.2
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Plan to Quit Commonwealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Nigerian official has
denied that the country had completed arrangements to quit from
the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Auwadlu Yadudu, the special adviser on legal matters to the
head of state, General Sani Abacha, has described such reports as
"false and untrue".
</P>
<P>
He told the official News Agency of Nigeria last week in
Kaduna State that the country has never contemplated that option
and has no intention of doing so in future.
</P>
<P>
Though the Commonwealth suspended Nigeria's membership in
November 1995 for executing writer Ken Saro-wiwa and eight other
Ogni activists, Yadudu said it has never threatened to expel
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said Nigeria would remain in the Commonwealth in spite of
all the injustices it faced.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG)
explained Monday that the Commonwealth will decide on whether to
re-admit Nigeria or impose further sanctions on it in November,
when the heads of governments of the Commonwealth Nations will
meet in Scotland.

<HEADLINE> Report: Egyptian Family Income Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptians took home more money
and spent more last year than they did in 1995 when the economic
reform began to pick up its pace, the Arabic Al-Ahram daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A recent study, compiled by the country's Central Agency for
Mobilization and Statistics, showed that the annual average
family income has risen to 7,570 Egyptian pounds (about 2,226
U.S. dollars) in 1996, up by 32.6 percent over 1991.
</P>
<P>
The annual per capita income exceeded 4,500 pounds (1,324
dollars) last year, while each city dweller earned 5,253 pounds
(1,545 dollars) and a country folk got 3,867 pounds (1,137
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, recent social and economic developments in Egypt
have led to the diversification of the income sources of the
Egyptian family and the rising spending in consumption, said the
report of the census that is conducted every five years.
</P>
<P>
The fastest growth in the family expense was made in food,
drinks, education, clothing and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
Education took up 4.61 percent of urban's family's total
expenditure in 1996, up from 2.9 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Food remained the largest family spending last year, eating up
56.37 percent of the whole family budget, which was less than the
59.35 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent World Bank rating, Egypt belongs to the
low-income bracket, with an annual per capita income of less than
1,200 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Won't Take New Loans Until Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will not borrow new loans
from abroad until the bulk of its current debt is paid, according
to Finance Minister Anthony Ani.
</P>
<P>
The government reduced the debt to 28.06 billion U.S. dollars
by the end of last year when it redeemed 5.4 billion dollars of
the stock.
</P>
<P>
However, the debt problem remained enormous and must be
confronted head-on, Ani said on Monday, adding that the
government was inclined to aid from multinational donor agencies
in place of loans.
</P>
<P>
With the need to cut down the debt stock, the federal
government has decided to put an embargo on new external loans.
And in the alternative, the government prefers assistance from
such agencies as the World Health Organization (WHO), which the
minister described as very helpful.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at a workshop in the capital
Abuja on External Aid Negotiation organized by the WHO with his
ministry, the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, WHO Regional Representative Abraham Samba
accused African nations of mismanaging funds from donor
countries, saying that the region defeated the good intention of
most donor entities and still remains largely underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
The WHO official was, however, faulted by National Planning
Minister Chief Ayo Ogunlade who said most developed countries
sometimes used the less developed ones as avenues to provide
employment for their nationals in the guise of aid.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the budget for foreign experts and
consultants often takes up more than 60 percent of the aid. After
discounting values for logistic and accommodation, the actual
amount left for the project may be less than 20 percent of the
aid value," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Ogunlade, such assistance must fall within the
scope of national rolling plan and budgetary systems for
long-term sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
He called for involvement of local experts in execution of aid
or externally funded projects.
</P>
<P>
It would not only encourage or enhance the sustainability of
such projects after the departure of foreign experts, it would
also facilitate the harmonization of expertise with local needs,
culture, tradition and circumstances, he added.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the workshop are representatives from the six
countries of Gambia, Ghana, Lesotho, Liberia, Nigeria and Zambia.
The forum is expected to last a week.

<HEADLINE> One Million Shanghai Residents Live in Civilized Communities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Le Junren, a senior resident at
Ganquanyuan Community in Shanghai who was diagnosed with cancer
many years ago, credits his survival from the disease to the clean
and tidy streets, fresh air, and warm friendships in his
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't live in such a nice community, I might already be
dead," Le said.
</P>
<P>
Ganquanyuan is a city-level "Civilized Community," with more
than 8,900 residents and a green coverage of 45 percent, said Gao
Meixia, director of the community office.
</P>
<P>
Tree-lined streets wind through the communities, houses are
surrounded with green plants and the scent of flowers and grass is
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about one million Shanghai people are
living in more than 600 such appealing neighborhoods, which are
characterized by their comfortable environment, stable social
security systems, harmonious neighborhood relations and colorful
recreational activities.
</P>
<P>
The Civilized Community of the No.7 neighborhood committee of
Caoyangwu Village, the first of its kind, was formed in 1989,
designed to provide an attractive and comfortable living
environment for the people working in this modern city.
</P>
<P>
"We begin our 'civilization scheme' by promoting the use of
garbage bags," said Tan Judi, an official with the neighborhood
committee.
</P>
<P>
"At first, people were reluctant to take the trouble to bag
their garbage, but it soon became a habit and they were delighted
to find it was helpful in cleaning the air and cutting down on
flies and mosquitos," Tan said.

In the process of building the Civilized Communities, the
district and sub-district officials also can learn how to settle
the problems in residents' daily life, said Xu Deming, director of
the city's Office for Ethical and Cultural Progress.
</P>
<P>
In Linfen sub-district of Zhabei District, at the meeting point
of the urban and rural areas, it's difficult to find
transportation. The family members of a woman in labor had to
catch a ride from a garbage truck to get her to a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
Upset by the incident, the director of the sub-district office
organized several units to build nine roads across the community
which lead to various parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
To provide job opportunities for laid-off workers and help
solve difficulties in residents' family life, the Civilized
Communities have developed a number of community services, such as
senior citizens centers, retail vegetable outlets, and
housecleaning services.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the satisfaction rate of the residents for
their environment soared to over 98 percent, while more than 99
percent of residents supported the building of more such
communities.
</P>
<P>
The contradictions that crop up from the social changes can
easily be dealt with by the common people when they have jobs and
lead pleasant lives, said Huang Ju, secretary of the Shanghai
municipal committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that's why the society still maintains stability, the
economy develops and reforms are carried out smoothly, in spite of
the fact that an accumulated number of about one million employees
at the State-owned enterprises have been laid off in recent years,
and more than three million transient people flow into the city
each year," Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will continue to build the Civilized Communities on a
large scale over the next three years and the number of people
living in them is expected to be three million by the end of
2000.

<HEADLINE> China's Kazak Herdsmen Riding Motorcycles Instead of Horses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- In some pastoral areas of northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Kazak herdsmen are
putting their trusty steeds out to pasture, replacing them with
motorcycles and other modern means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
For years, the nomadic Kazak people herded their sheep or
cattle and even went shopping on horseback. They believed having
several strong horses tied to a tree in front of their houses was
a sign of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
But in Shitizi Kazak Nationality Township of Hutubi County,
motorcycles and mini-buses are whizzing up and down the village
roads, and people on horseback are becoming a rare sight.
</P>
<P>
The township has more than 800 households of Kazak herdsmen,
who now have bought 210 motorcycles and nearly 300 vehicles of
various types and sizes. Almost every family has a tractor, said
Aguhan, the head of the township.
</P>
<P>
It used to take a Kazak herdsmen a week on horseback to travel
to the county seat from the mountains where they live, a journey
of more than 100 km. As a result, they never went to town in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
"Now herdsmen come here by motorcycles instead of horses, as
they used to. The modern transportation means save them time and
protect the environment," Aguhan said, pointing to the motorcycles
parked in front of the township building.
</P>
<P>
The county government spent more than a million yuan in 1994 to
build a highway leading to the township. Some herdsmen have become
well-to-do enough to buy mini-buses to carry passengers to town, a
trip of several hours.
</P>
<P>
In villager Hasm's home, visitors were impressed by two Honda
motorcycles, a large tractor, a four-wheeled tractor, and a fodder
grinder. His family earned nearly 60,000 yuan last year, raising
60 sheep, 17 heads of cattle, growing more than six ha of wheat
and maize.
</P>
<P>
"Convenient transportation makes it possible to get new
knowledge quickly, and I have learned to apply advanced technology
to planting and breeding to raise my income," Hasm said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Tests Electrical Interference On GPS Users </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Defense Force
(ADF) is testing this week how electrical interference affects the
Global Positioning System (GPS) by transmitting electrical jamming
signals from the ground and air.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Defense Department spokesman Richard Hogan said the
trials could affect the accuracy of GPS equipment used within a
450 km radius of Woomera airfield, in South Australia's mid-north,
between today and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He warned users of the system, a global satellite navigation
system, not to rely on it this week because trials taking place at
the Woomera airfield could interfere with the accuracy of the
service.
</P>
<P>
The GPS is used by the ADF, aircraft, bushwalkers and trucking
companies, with users receiving signals from satellites to
pinpoint their position within a couple of meters accuracy.
</P>
<P>
The ADF and Airservices Australia are testing how electrical
interference affects the GPS users in the test area.
</P>
<P>
The signals will be transmitted in 10-minute bursts to avoid
seriously disrupting the GPS during the trials.
</P>
<P>
The GPS satellite navigation system being tested receives
signals from 24 satellites in six orbital plains 24 km above the
earth.

<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 75 people have been found
dead after a motor vessel carrying nearly 200 passengers sank in a
lake in Indonesia's North Sumatra, the official Antara News Agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place in Toba Lake on Sunday night after the

</P>
<P>
The number of casualties was likely to increase as several
passengers were still missing, the report said.

</P>
<P>
"The market is taking a breather after going a little bit too
hard on expectations of an interest rate cut," broker Hamish Dee
said.
</P>
<P>
"People are a little bit skeptical of when it's actually going
to happen, in fact if it will happen," Dee added.
</P>

The all resources index closed 13.3 points down to 1420.8,
while the all industrials plunged 62.7 points to 4205.0.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit in the
first half of this year totaled 9.142 billion U.S. dollars on a
customs-cleared basis, up 1.068 billion dollars from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the customs administration, exports increased by
0.7 percent to 65.202 billion dollars, while imports were up 2.4
percent to 74.344 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, trade balance turned to be a surplus of 97.6 million
dollars in the month of June, the first monthly black figure in
thirty months. The June surplus was a result of slower growth in
imports, stable overseas oil prices and recovering exports of
heavy-chemical goods, said industry and energy officials.

<HEADLINE> Rate Sentiment Keeps Australian Dollar Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Concerns about the Reserve Bank
of Australia's (RBA) next move on official interest rates kept the
Australian dollar lower against its U.S. counterpart today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended trading at 73.57 U.S. cents, down
from 73.83 Monday, but off an 18-month low of 73.45 U.S. cents hit
during this morning's trade.
</P>
<P>
The local currency hit a high today of 73.71 after trading
between 73.60 and 73.90 offshore overnight.
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan's senior dealer Andrew McGill said that
offshore traders tonight could continue to test the currency's
downside.
</P>
<P>
Many market participants think the RBA could cut the 5.5
percent cash rate following the release of quarterly inflation
data on July 23 and wages data due July 24.
</P>
<P>
Westpac Bank's July currency report said today that there was
little scope for a meaningful recovery in the Australian currency
while the economy remained soft and RBA easing prospects remained
high.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 84.05 from 83.89 against the
Japanese yen and was at 1.3168 from 1.3138 against the German
mark.

<HEADLINE> Manila Stocks Plunge Over Uncertainty Around Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Stocks at the Philippine Stock
Exchange plunged today due to uncertainty about where the peso is
settling down after it was allowed to float freely.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange composite index, a
basket of 30 companies, fell 54.87 points, or two percent to close
at 2655.86 points.
</P>
<P>
It surged by 9.59 points on Monday, the first day of trading
after the Central Bank announced the de facto devaluation of the
peso. Last Friday, the index registered a 190-point increase, the
biggest one-day growth in four and a half years.
</P>
<P>
At today's session, the broader all-share index dropped by 17.4
points to 853.19 points. All sectors declined, led by the mining
sector which was followed by the commercial-industrial, the banks
and financial services sector, the property and oil sectors.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5.56 billion shares worth 64 million U.S. dollars
was traded. Declines outnumbered advances 120 to 16 with 41
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said most dealers adopted a wait-and-see
attitude due to the volatility on the country's foreign exchange
market. At one point on Monday, the peso devalued to 29.75 pesos
against one dollar, the lowest in two years, before closing at
28.77 pesos to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Central Bank's statement that it would intervene
in the market again at a proper time also fed speculation and kept
some foreign investors outside the local bourse.

<HEADLINE> Henan Province Protects Farmers' Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- To protect farmers' enthusiasm
for growing grain, China's most populous province of Henan is
taking steps to buy all State-contracted grain that the farmers
want to sell.
</P>
<P>
Henan had a record summer grain harvest of 22.55 billion kg
this year. But farmers were concerned that the resulting lack of
purchasing funds, insufficient storage facilities, and delayed
transportation and sales would cause prices to drop.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government reiterated that the contracted summer
grain of three billion kg remains unchanged, and the purchasing
price will be maintained at 10 percent higher than the state fixed
standard price last year.
</P>
<P>
Henan pledges to buy one billion kg of additional grain by the
end of August at market prices and doesn't allow IOU purchases.
</P>
<P>
It needs some 7.3 billion yuan to buy summer grain and
oil-bearing crops, and localities are making efforts to raise
enough fund.
</P>
<P>
The province has also taken steps to lighten farmers' financial
burdens in a move to encourage them to grow more grain.

<HEADLINE> Erenhot's Water Supply to Be Short No More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Erenhot, a trading port on the
China-Mongolia border, has changed its former image as a city
without water.
</P>
<P>
The harsh climate and other natural conditions left the city
suffering from frequent severe water shortages. Water from deep
wells drilled by local people was undrinkable because of its high
flourine content.
</P>
<P>
During the early 1980s, visitors from neighboring Mongolia used
beer and mineral water to wash up, said a director from the city's
water company.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, aided by the central and regional authorities, Erenhot
invested about 40 million yuan to build two pipes from a water
source discovered 60 kilometers outside the city, the director
said.
</P>
<P>
The city's daily water output now amounts to 15,000 tons, which
is enough for a city with a population of 100,000. And Erenhot,
with less than 60,000 residents, plans to send its surplus water
to Dzamin Uud, a small town in Mongolia 4.5 km from Erenhot.

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
stressed during a meeting with visiting Vietnamese party chief Do
Muoi here today that the sincerity and friendly cooperation
between China and Vietnam will benefit the development of both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, a standing committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC), said he is convinced that the relationship between the two
parties and the two countries will become closer and more friendly
through efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Do Muoi, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV), arrived in Beijing Monday for a
five-day official goodwill visit.
</P>
<P>
China and Vietnam have maintained traditional friendship and
they share basic common points, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the relationship between the NPC and the National
Assembly of Vietnam as an important part of the friendship between
the two parties, the two countries and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the contacts between the two sides have been
increasing, Qiao said, expressing the hope that they will further
expand cooperation, learn from each other, and work to safeguard
and advance Sino-Vietnamese friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
At this historic turn of the century, Qiao said, the leadership
and people in China will continue to work hard to further promote
the reunification of the country, to implement the independent
foreign policy of peace, and to develop the friendly cooperation
with neighboring countries and all nations of the world.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Do Muoi on the construction of China's
socialist democracy and legal system.
</P>
<P>

Vietnam and China as well as between the two parties have been
sound, adding his purpose for coming to China is to push the
bilateral ties to a higher level, and to ensure that the
good-neighborly relations between the two countries will continue
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and China should maintain their friendship from
generation to generation, he said.
</P>
<P>

the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the great
achievements China has made in its reform and opening up drive. He

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Improves in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The overall flood situation improved
further today due to stoppage of heavy downpour in most parts of
Bangladesh and resultant fall in the flow of most rivers in the
Meghna and southeastern hill basins.
</P>
<P>
According to the Flood Information Center, the overall flood
situation in southern Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Bandarban and
Khagrachhari districts is expected to improve further today while
the flood situation in some northern districts will start
improving.
</P>
<P>
However, the center forecast that more areas of northwestern
Kurigram and Sirajganj districts may be inundated.
</P>
<P>
A bulletin of the center said the Ganges was rising fast and
might flow above the danger level at Goalundo within next 24
hours. As a result, low-lying areas of some nearby districts may
be inundated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the road-link between Chittagong and Cox's Bazar
which remained snapped for five days was restored Monday as water
receded from the highway. But the Dhaka-Sylhet road communication
remains suspended due to the collapse of a bridge over the river
Khowai.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said a huge amount of food, clothes, rice and
cash has been sanctioned among the flood affected people from the
Prime Minister's Relief Fund.
</P>
<P>
A government handout said the Ministry of Disaster Management
and Relief has sanctioned 655,000 taka (about 15,000 U.S.
dollars), 161 tons of rice, 1,500 cans of biscuit, flattened rice
and fried rice for distribution in the affected districts.
</P>
<P>
As many as 20 tons of rice have been reserved for each district
to meet emergencies caused by flood and other natural hazards, the
handout said.

<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today ordered
the military and police in the southern Philippines to support a
local governor's mission to restart the stalled peace talks
between the government and the Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' order was conveyed personally by Presidential Management
Staff head Alexander Aguirre to regional police director Frank
Clida and Maj. Gen. Raul Urgello, commander-general of the Army's
6th Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao, met with Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) vice
chairman Hadji Murad last week in renewed efforts to resume the
peace talks between the MILF and the government.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said Misuari and Murad agreed on the need to normalize
the situation in Mindanao and the MILF's return to the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that the two sides should cease fire, keep
open the roads and highways in their areas of conflicting and
cooperate in the anti-kidnapping campaigns in Mindanao, Aguirre
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government and the MILF are trying to re-open
their sixth round of low-level talks following the military's
recent offensives in which dozens of MILF rebels were killed.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, also chief of the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), offered himself as a peace mediator between the government
and the MILF. But it was reported that the MILF has refused
Misuari's offer.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a 12,000-member breakaway faction of the mainstream
MNLF which signed a peace agreement with the government last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Able to Sustain Policies despite Speculative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has been able to
sustain its present economic and monetary policies despite
speculative attacks on its currency, acting prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim said today.
</P>
<P>
Speculative attacks were more aggressive in some countries,
forcing them to respond in a manner not necessarily according to
the direction they had planned for, Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
But "in our case, we have been fortunate to have been able to
sustain this but will have to be realistic to balance between a
reasonable exchange rate", Anwar, who is also Finance Minister,
told newsmen after officiating the "International Islamic Capital
Market" conference here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's local currency ringgit opened at 2.5650/80 against
the US dollar today from 2.5340/60 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit slipped to a low of 2.5700 during New York trading,
a level last seen about three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Anwar turned down the overheating factor as one of the reasons
for the speculative pressure on the local currency, saying it was
the bloating estimates by certain quarters over the country's mega
projects that should be blamed.
</P>
<P>
These "irresponsible estimates" had portrayed different views
of the country's economic growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to see the development in the next few weeks...we have
seen speculators achieving major successes in some countries...we
have our policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the end, it is the country's fundamentals that
determined the value and the strength of the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Based on the existing fundamentals, the present temporary "over
correction" of the ringgit would eventually come to an end, he

</P>
<P>
Kabariti became prime minister in 1996 and resigned in March

to the Jordan Investment Promotion (JIP).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, total investment in Jordan's different sectors
amounted to 354 million Jordanian dinars (about 495 million
U.S. dollars), with tourism, industrial maritime transport,
agriculture and hospital sectors generating the largest shares,

Investors so far have requested to carry out 15 projects worth
105 million dinars (about 148 million dollars), Badran said.
</P>
<P>
JIP has approved 13 projects by local and foreign investors
worth 95 million dinars (about 134 million dollars) in industry
and tourism, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian ministry of industry and trade is planning to
create a committee grouping representatives from various
ministries and departments to issue licenses for the investors,
the director general said.
</P>
<P>
He said that now no minimum volume of capital for local and
foreign investors will be required to start a project.

<HEADLINE> China Successful in Exploring Overseas Oilfields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China National Petroleum
Corp. has been granted the rights to contract, operate and hold
shares in the overseas oilfields in Canada, Peru, Thailand as well
as other countries, and the move has produced noteworthy results.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has recorded an annual oil supply of 700,000 tons
from the overseas oilfields which the country contracted to
operate, either wholly or partly, marking a major breakthrough in
expanding the international oil markets.
</P>
<P>
And the establishment of the China Overseas Oil and Gas
Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the China National Offshore Oil Corp
(CNOOC), has attracted the attention of the international oil
circle.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC has by now purchased a 32.58 percent of the stock from
the Indonesian Malacca Oilfield, becoming its largest
shareholder. China has charted a yearly oil supply of 400,000 tons
from the Malacca Oilfield since 1994. And by the end of 1996,
CNOOC had taken back all the dividends.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, CNOOC has succeeded in expanding its technological
presence in the world oil markets. The overseas projects taken on
by CNOOC include an offshore platform in the United Arab
Emirates, offshore oil drilling in Japan, and geophysical
prospecting and seismic data collection in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, CNOOC experts have been invited to act as
technological advisors for overseas oil exploration in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC experts expect that China's offshore oil supply will
reach two million tons by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Israel Unveils Railways 2000 Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israel has started a
long-awaited Railways 2000 program to remarkably improve its
railway services, reported the Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Amos Uzani, director-general of Israel Railways, announced
Monday that the Railways 2000 program includes plans for
widespread improvements and new services.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the Tel Aviv-Netanya service along the
Mediterranean coast will be extended to Binyaminna.
</P>
<P>
The single journey time of the four daily non-stop trains
between Haifa and Tel Aviv will be shortened from one hour to 50
minutes, thanks to signalling improvements and the doubling of the
track.
</P>
<P>
The number of daily services on the Tel Aviv-Netanya route
will be increased from 59 to 67.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a greater number of trains operating to
Ashdod, a port city in south Israel, with the completion of
signalling work in Mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that current budgetary restrictions prevent the
upgrading of the existing service for years, but stopping short of
disclosing the cost of the program.
</P>
<P>
Uzani also announced the long-term intention to operate
double-decker trains, with the introduction of the first
electrified lines to Kfar Sava and Rishon Lezion, two towns not
far from Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Israel Railways expects a record 6.3 million passengers this
year, but maintains that with a steady increase of its
annual budget over the next five years, that total could reach
44 million.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Vietnamese Foreign Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said today he is convinced that the
settlement of the boundary issue between China and Vietnam will
open broad prospects for the comprehensive development of bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark in a meeting with Vietnamese Foreign
Minister Nguyen Manh Cam, who accompanied Do Muoi, general
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
Vietnam (CPV) on his current China visit.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China and Vietnam are friendly neighbors, and
are building socialism in line with their respective national
conditions.
</P>
<P>
To further friendly cooperative ties between the two countries
is not only conducive to the development of both counties, but
also benefits peace and stability of the region, Qian noted.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Manh Cam agreed with Qian's assessment of bilateral
relations, and thanked China for inviting him to attend Hong
Kong's handover ceremony on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers spoke highly of the talks between
Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), and Do Muoi, general secretary of
the Central Committee of the CPV, saying they think the
discussions will help improve bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They said that the two foreign ministries, as the major
departments in charge of the boundary negotiations, are
responsible for strictly carrying out the consensus reached by the
two top leaders on speeding up the boundary negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On boundary negotiations, Qian said that the Chinese side is
willing to speed up the process in the spirit of taking the
general situation into consideration, seeking common grounds while
reserving differences, settling the easier issues first and then
the more problematic ones, managing time well, conducting
discussions in a friendly way and reaching a fair settlement, so
as to promptly solve the boundary issue on land and delineating
the boundary in the Beibu Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China hopes the two sides do their utmost to
attain this goal.

negotiations, saying that Vietnam is willing to enhance cooperation
with China, overcome existing difficulties, settle the issue as
soon as possible, and create conditions for further bilateral
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Official: Jordan's Poverty Rate Down to 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 15 (Xinhua) - The current number of Jordanian
families living under the line of absolute poverty is estimated at
9 percent, a drop of 5.5 percentage points compared with that of
1994, according to a senior Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, families living near the poverty line has been
estimated at 150,000 which accounts for almost 21 percent of the
total population of 4.139 million, Minister of Social Development
Mohammed Kheir Mamser said at a seminar held in the University of
Jordan Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mamser noted that families that earn less than 102 Jordanian
dinars about 144 U.S. dollars per month are considered as living
under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
At Monday's seminar, Mamser said that the improvement of
poverty situation could be attributed to the government's
continuous efforts to curb poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He also said some new government projects would be carried out
in further efforts to get rid of poverty. But the minister did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Poverty remains a serious problem for the kingdom that defies
a simple or quick solution, according to a Jordanian government
release in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the number of people living under the poverty line
decreased to 18 percent from 30 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's economy suffered considerably in the 1991 Gulf War to
end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, during which Jordan was
sympathetic to the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Medpartennariat Jordan `97 (the
Euro-Mediterranean economic conference) ended here late Monday
night with mixed reactions from its organizers and local
participants and media.
</P>
<P>
While local participants and media said that they could not see
concrete results from the conference, in which representatives
from 350 European, 22 Israeli and 150 Jordanian companies
participated, the organizers noted that it yielded positive
results.
</P>
<P>
Farouq Hadidi, Director General of Jordan Export Development
Commercial Centers Corporation (JEDCCC) which organized the
conference, told reporters that the conference provided all
participants with export and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Most of the meetings held between Jordanian and foreign
companies were successful and some deals were initialed between
them for future trading and industrial projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hadidi said that these future deals will place Jordan as a gate
to neighboring countries and facilitate the transfer of
technology in industrial investment field.
</P>
<P>
He rejected reports that most of the European companies were
looking at Jordan as a market for their products, saying that the
European companies were seeking partners who can make products
with their trademarks under licence.
</P>
<P>
Some participants from foreign companies noted that the
conference did result in several preliminary agreements for
future joint ventures and export projects.
</P>
<P>
However, local businessmen said that they had hoped to see more
concrete results from the conference, such as the establishment of
joint venture projects.
</P>
<P>
"You can not do business at the Medpartenariat," said Anwar
Obeidat, secretary of the Jordan-Europe Business Association.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that the results of the conference
were not fully optimistic as expected.
</P>
<P>
"The Medpartenariat Jordan `97 ended on a subdued note Monday,
with local participants speaking reservedly on the event`s
success," Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for underlicensing manufacturing partners,
but most companies were coming here to sell," it quoted a
Jordanian businessman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, which opened Saturday, was aimed at
enhancing economic cooperation among countries of the
Mediterranean region and the European Union (EU).

<HEADLINE> Manila Wants Orderly Foreign Exchange Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Central Bank governor Gabriel
Singson said today that the Philippine monetary authorities would
continue making efforts to support an orderly foreign exchange
market.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue with a firm monetary policy stance to support
our decision last Friday, July 11 to allow the peso to float more
flexibly," he said.
</P>
<P>
In line with this approach, he said, the Central Bank is
maintaining its overnight and 5-day borrowing rates at the current
32 and 25 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the bank offered a new two-week instrument, also
at 25 percent while raising its one-month borrowing rate to 25
percent from 12.37 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are sending strong monetary signals to let the market
realize that while the peso will be allowed to float more
flexibly, we also want to see orderly market conditions. We expect
the foreign exchange market to calm down and stabilize in the next
couple of days," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before announcing the free floating of the peso, the Central
Bank intervened in the foreign exchange market by heavily selling
U.S. dollars to stabilize the peso, which was under speculative
attacks due to the depreciation of the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
However, the costly but futile intervention made the country's
U.S. dollar reserve shrink to 10 billion from 12 billion in just
10 days. To preserve the foreign exchange reserve and the economic
growth rate, the bank abruptly changed its tune and announced the
de facto devaluation of the peso last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank said that it would intervene again if the
situation in the foreign exchange market runs out of control.
</P>
<P>
When the peso devalued to a four-year low of 29.75 pesos
against the dollar on Monday, the bank sold half a million dollars
to guide the market. The exchange rate then closed at 28.77 pesos
against one U.S. dollar, much better than expected.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A forum celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the establishment of the Inner-Mongolia Autonomous
Region was held at the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, said at the forum that the region's economy has
developed rapidly since China's reform and opening up drive was
launched in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The region's gross national product has increased by 49 times
over that reported in 1947, and its financial income has increased
by 103,000 times.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the region's experience has proved that the
existence and development of the region can be credited to the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that to uphold the autonomous region system,
China must focus on economic development, and at the same time
safeguard and strengthen the unity of each ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
Buhe pointed out there are nearly 170,000 cadres of minority
ethnic groups in the region, making up one-fourth of the total
number of cadres there, and he praised the achievements made by
the regional government in training the cadres of the various
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said at the
forum that the region's various ethnic groups have maintained a
good relationship since its establishment.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to uphold and perfect the autonomous region
system, fully carry out the Law on Regional Autonomy For China's
Minority Nationalities, and work out and improve related laws,
regulations and supervisory systems, he said.

registry would result in deeds searches, transfers and
registration being done quickly, making the registry here one of
the most modern in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Checkpoint Passing Procedures to Be Simplified at Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Passing procedures at three
checkpoints of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, became simpler as of
today, in a move to increase the speed of vehicles and cargo
across these sites between Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, at the Huanggang, Wenjindu and
Shatoujiao checkpoints, trucks which formerly were
inspected by customs and frontier departments, respectively, will
now only be inspected by customs.
</P>
<P>
The change was included in a decision jointly made by the State
Commission for Restructuring the Economy, State Economic and Trade
Commission, the Ministry of Public Security and General
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials at the three checkpoints now are expected to
take on the tasks of inspecting service people and their documents
covering vehicles for communications and transport, and will turn
over cases involving illegal immigration to frontier departments,
which formerly did the entire job.
</P>
<P>
Frontier departments now are required to keep the customs
officials informed of problems, and the two agencies will conduct
joint investigations if necessary.
</P>
<P>
On May 1, offices set up at the three checkpoints to carry out
quarantine of animals and plants were closed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Population Likely to Double in 23 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's estimated population of
12.3 million people is likely to double in 23 years, according to
the Zimbabwe draft population policy carried out by the National
Economic Planing Commission.
</P>
<P>
The report said that HIV/AIDS is likely to slow down the
population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
It said Zimbabwe's population growth rate of 3.1 percent in
the last 16 years is "too high" and unsustainably against an
annual economic growth rate of 2.1 percent during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
"This becomes critical when the rate of growth of the economy
lags behind that of population. The economic development of
Zimbabwe will reguire an accelerated accumulation of capital
savings. Increased investments in the productive sector of the
economy will foster growth in output and employment," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The population policy is expectged to help the government
realise achievements in economic, social, and demographic areas
through adjustments in population growth but ultimately it seeks
to improve the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
The draft population policy is complete and will soon be the
subject of a national debate before it is officially adopted by
the government.

<HEADLINE> China Reforms Elementary Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Many primary and middle schools in
China have initiated educational reforms to solve the problems
caused by putting undue emphasis on the proportion of students
admitted to higher-level schools.
</P>
<P>
Since the resumption of the national entrance examination in
1987, the advantages enjoyed by university graduates in many
aspects have led parents, students and even school authorities to
view high test scores as the only aim of education.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number of students who are good at
test-taking but do not excel in other areas has aroused the
concern of the education community. Backed by education departments,
some schools have carried out reforms in the examination system to
improve students' overall competence.
</P>
<P>
Yantai, in east Shandong Province, was the first city in China
to carry out such reforms in 1984. The local government abolished the
unified graduation exam for primary school students so that they
can enter the middle school nearest to their homes without taking any
exams.
</P>
<P>
In middle schools, students with different academic abilities
receive classroom instruction at their own level, and those who
choose not to attend high school are sent to vocational high
schools at grade four.
</P>
<P>
Qiqihar, in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, introduced
a new examination system in its primary schools in 1993. The
tests, which formerly took place only at the end of a term, are
now offered throughout the whole course of a term.
</P>
<P>
The testing takes many forms, including questionnaires,
contests and homework, which are offered at random, thus
alleviating test-taking anxiety that some students experience.
</P>
<P>
The reform in exams is bound to cause reform in how to assess
the competence of each student. Many cities have substituted a
grading system for the former 100-point system. The everyday
performance of a student will be noted on a report card and teachers
write comments about the students' performance once a month.
</P>
<P>
Some schools are also going all out to create a comfortable
study environment for children.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Imports Maize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has imported about 120,000
tons of white maize from Zimbabwe to increase its grain stocks,
according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the maize consignment was announced by Chance
Kabaghe, director of the Food Reserve Agency (FRA), on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The maize has been imported to address the country's
anticipated grain shortage this year, according to the FRA.
</P>
<P>
The imported maize will be sold to grain traders and millers
wishing to purchase white maize, Kabaghe said.
</P>
<P>
Kabaghe also disclosed that there is urgent need for Zambia to
restock its strategic maize reserves as the national reserve
stocks only have 15,000 tons of white maize instead of the
required 270,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Zambian farmers have reduced their maize planting areas
because of the unstable prices which made them little profits in
1996 when there was a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the weather conditions have not been in favor of
grain growing in some parts of the country this year. Hence the
anticipation of grain shortage, said the report.

<HEADLINE> China's First SOS Village Develops Kids' Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The SOS Children's Village in
Nanchang, capital city of East China's Jiangxi Province, has
become the country's first orphanage with a diversified
extra-curricular program to foster the children's special skills.
</P>
<P>
The village has adopted 96 orphans since it was set up in
1994. Village officials at the time determined that offering
housing without a specially-designed education program was not
enough.
</P>
<P>
Since the spring of 1995, the orphanage has offered courses in
painting, dance, table tennis and other skills.
</P>
<P>
In these classes, the children soon developed their strong
points: Four kids in the table tennis class won the third
prizes in both the single and team contests in a city
competition.
</P>
<P>
One year later they became the first SOS village children
admitted to the province's physical education school.
</P>
<P>
Many parents in the area have brought their children to the
school to attend the courses.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat of the International SOS Children's Village has
highly praised the Nanchang SOS village, holding it up as a model
for other SOS villages in China.

<HEADLINE> Two Civilians Killed in Bombardment in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Two civilians have been killed
and another one wounded when artillery shells fired by a
Israeli-backed militia crashed into the village of Berti, some
50 kilometers south of Beirut, the Daily Star reported this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The only English daily in Lebanon noted that Monday night's
bombardment by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), bringing to three the
number of civilians killed in the south since the weekend,
signalled an expansion of war to areas previously unaffected by
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The bombing came in response to a Hezbollah attack on a SLA
patrol in the north sector of the so-called "security zone" in
south Lebanon established by Israel in 1985, which left two
militiamen wounded.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, claimed its fighters attacked the patrol with
"automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades", destroying an
SLA armored vehicle and "killing and wounding all the members
of its crew."
</P>
<P>
The bombardment began immediately after the attack, with more
than a hundred 155mm shells fired from Zafata and Majidieh in
the Israeli-occupied buffer zone hitting the area, according to
police sources.
</P>
<P>
Laiqa Marmar, 70, a Palestinian and her son Ahmed, 30, were
both killed while her 12-year-old daughter Ahlam was wounded
in the bombardment of Berti, 10 kilometers east of the south
Lebanese port city of Sidon, police sources in the city said.
</P>
<P>
The Voice of the South radio, run by the Israeli client
militia, claimed that the shelling was prompted by the wounding
of the two militiamen.
</P>
<P>
During the fatal shelling, two Israeli warplanes fired two
air-to-surface missiles at Kfar Melki in Iglim Al-Toffah, a
ridge often used by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas as a springboard
to launch attacks on the border strip. No casualties were caused
in the air raid, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment of Berti, a mixed Muslim and Christian
village located outside the normal areas of retaliation by
Israel and the SLA, apparently fulfilled the threats made last
month by Antoine Lahd, commander of the SLA, who warned that
villages east of Sidon would be targeted by his artillery if his
militiamen remained under the attack by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In a surprise move Monday, the south Lebanon-based
U.N. peacekeeping forces publicly condemned for the first time the
recent Israeli shelling of civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
After talks with the Lebanese foreign minister, Major General
Stanislaw Wozniak, the commander of the 45,000-strong U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), said "We cannot in fact do much in
these cases but we have addressed a strongly-worded protest to
the Israelis over intensifying their shelling which hit
residential areas."

basis for Sino-Japanese friendship, Wan said he hoped that young
statesmen from the two sides can view bilateral relations from a
long-term and strategic perspective, so as to work together to
bring a sound and stable Sino-Japanese relationship into the next
century.

Japanese Diet and leader of the delegation, told Wan that the
Group of the Komei Party is an organization for Dietmen belonging
to the former Komei Party, which is now included in the New
Frontier Party.

<P>
He said that the group will carry forward the friendly
tradition started by the former Komei Party towards China, and
work toward the development of bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> China Tries to Expand Chain Store Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China will build a number of
large-scale chain stores each exceeding 10 billion yuan (1.2
billion US dollars) in annual sales in the coming five to ten
years, according to a plan released recently by the Ministry of
Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
The plan also says that this year, three chain stores each
exceeding one billion yuan (120.4 million US dollars) in annual
sales, and 50 that each top 100 million yuan in annual sales will
be built.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen Bangzhu, minister of Internal Trade, the
fast-emerging chain store business in China has become a new
growth area in the commodity distribution sector after achieving
remarkable economic returns and obtaining public approval in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The focus on further development of the business will be on
expanding the business scale and improving the management," the
minister told a meeting on chain store business which was held
recently in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had over 700 chain store businesses
with a total of over 10,000 stores operating across the country.
</P>
<P>
The sales of the chain stores accounted for 1.2 percent of the
total commodity retail sales nationally, and in 35 large
cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, the proportion reached 4.1
percent and 6.9 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
They are operating mainly in the form of supermarkets,
warehouse stores, convenience stores, department stores,
speciality shops and snack shops.

<HEADLINE> France Did Not Support Mobutu: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HRARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- French Ambassador to Zimbabwe
Jacques Migozzi denied Monday recent claims by the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) leadership that France had armed and
supported ousted president Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Migozzi told the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana that France did
not have much to benefit or to protect by supporting Mubutu in
the wake of the offensive by Laurent Kabila's forces.
</P>
<P>
"We did not have many business interests in former Zaire.
besides, I have not noticed any specific accusations against
France," he said.
</P>
<P>
Migozzi was reluctant to discuss the issue in detail, opting
to talk about the disappearance of Rwandan refugees in the DRC
who were being investigated by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The DRC is among Africa's mineral rich countries and has large
oil, diamond, gold and copper deposits. Since Kabila took power
in May, it has been in the centre of a mineral scramble from big
multi-national mining companies.
</P>
<P>
France had been accused of providing military aid to the
fallen Mubutu regime which was toppled by then rebel leader
Kabila last May after 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila's Finance Minister Mawapagna Mwana Nanga said
recently the French contingent in Brazzaville supplied weapons to
the former presidential guard.

FUZHOU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The government of East China's
Fujian Province has vowed to wipe out illiteracy among young and
middle-aged people by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Some 100,000 people within this age bracket will learn to read and
write 1,500 Chinese characters and pass qualification exams while

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China will impose a fishing ban in
the Yellow Sea and East China Sea in July and August, in a bid
to protect certain species of fish, the Ministry of Agriculture
(MA) announced today.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's decision, no trawl boats will be
permitted to fish in July and August in the area that extends from
27 degrees to 35 degrees north latitude.
</P>
<P>
Over the next two months, boats can fish only in areas 30
nautical miles east of offshore and a system to check the number
of young fish will be strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive year that China has declared a
two-month no-fishing season.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that such a ban is the most effective way
to protect the country's offshore fishing resources, said a
ministry official.
</P>
<P>
After first no-fishing season, the output of hairtail fish grew
by 14 percent to a record 740,000 tons in 1995. The weight
of each hairtail increased from 80-100 grams to 125 grams. The
output of little yellow croaker, silvery pomfret, prawn and crabs
had also increased to various extents, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Prices of imported crude and
petroleum products and power rates are likely to rise slightly in
the Philippines due to the devaluation of the peso, the Philippine
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the government institutions said the increases
would be "minimal" because of the prevailing low prices on the
world market, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a senior official of the Energy and Regulatory Board
as saying that for every one-peso depreciation, there might be a
corresponding increase of about 0.1 to 0.2 pesos in the average
price of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The peso devalued from 26.40 pesos to 28.77 pesos against the
U.S. dollar on Monday, the first day of trading after the Central
Bank announced the free floating of the Philippine currency last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the peso's value was generally viewed as a positive
move and welcomed by the business sector. However, it also raised
worries over the increase in prices of basis commodities and
higher inflation in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops were on full
alert along the northern border and in the Israel-occupied
security zone in south Lebanon Monday night for fear of
retaliation after Israeli army killed two Lebanese civilians,
reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Lebanese resistance guerrilla organization,
Hezbollah, had earlier warned of Katyusha rocket retaliation on
the Galilee districts in northern Israel, if Israel persisted in
consistent breaches of the Operation Grapes of Wrath
understandings.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached between Israel and Hezbollah with
the help of the U.S. and France in April last year, Israel would
not attack civilian targets while the guerrillas promised not to
fire Katyusha rockets on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The warnings by Hezbollah spiritual leader Sheikh Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah and other leading officials were made after a
70-year-old Lebanese villager was killed by an Israeli tank
fire, but before the latest incident, in which a woman and her
son were reported to have been killed and a girl wounded as a
result of Israeli heavy fire.
</P>
<P>
The wounded girl and the bodies of those killed were brought
to hospital in Sidon. They were reportedly hit during heavy
Israeli shelling of Berti village, east of the southern Lebanese
port city.
</P>
<P>
Maj.-Gen. Amiram Levine, head of the Israeli army Northern
Command, Monday night warned Hezbollah not to launch Katyusha
rocket attacks. He declared that the Israeli army would respond
severely.
</P>
<P>
A heated debate has been going on across political spectrum
in Israel on whether Israel should withdraw from south Lebanon
unilaterally. Some parents of the soldiers in south Lebanon have
formed a group lobbying for an end of the costly, decade-old war
in the Lebanese territory.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Urges to Set up Council on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's opposition parties, in
response to President Daniel arap Moi's signals on reforms, has
urged to set up a broad-based national consultative council to
discuss the timetable for minimum constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
The council should be established immediately, said three
senior members from the Inter-Parties Committee which include the
Democracy Party and the FORD-Kenya, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mukhisa Kituyi from the FORD-Kenya said the council composed
of representatives from political parties, organized civil
society and religious groups would be expected to agree on the
modalities of holding peaceful elections.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is seen as a shift from the hard line stand
earlier taken by the opposition over the issue. It came after the
most violent clashes between the government and the opposition
rallies claimed 14 lives around the country on July 7.
</P>
<P>
Moi announced on Friday that he would call top-level meetings
of his ruling Kenyan African National Union (KANU) to deliberate
on constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders said on Saturday that they doubted Moi's
sincerity, arguing that it was a way of buying time.
</P>
<P>
In response, KANU National Chairman Wilson Ndolo Ayah said on
Monday the party is willing to engage in dialogue on
constitutional reforms with registered political parties with a
concrete agenda.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to talk with anybody who has a clear vision of
the constitutional changes that the country needs, but we will
not listen to groups of people who specialize only in making
noise and hurling insults at others," he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have been putting pressures on
President Daniel arap Moi to conduct constitutional reforms
before the forthcoming general elections, while Moi insists he
only do that after the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, any candidate, if he wins no
less than 25 percent of votes respectively in five of the eight
provinces of Kenya, he can be qualified as a legal president.
</P>
<P>
Now the opposition leaders urged to change the clause,
demanding the future president get more than 50 percent of the
total votes nationwide otherwise form a coalition government with
other parties.

<HEADLINE> China Pursues Name-Brand Strategy to Invigorate Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Confidence in Chinese-produced
goods has been increasing among Chinese consumers as they've come
to realize that a group of their own name brands are of the same
quality as foreign products.
</P>
<P>
Name Brand computers such as Legend and Great Wall have become
popular among Chinese consumers, and the market shares of these
computers have increased constantly amid cutthroat competition
over the past few years. These brands are now exported to over 100
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the State Bureau of Technical
Supervision and the State Statistics Bureau found that Changhong,
Conka, TCL King and other Chinese -made famous color TV sets have
seized more than 65 percent of the domestic market share, while
famous domestically-produced VCD players have also occupied half
of the market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the ten best-selling refrigerator brands on the
Chinese market are all name-brand products made in China. Little
Swan, Haier and some other washing machines have claimed more than
83 percent of the country's market. In addition, home-made air
conditioners have taken a 72 percent share of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts attributed the achievements to China's new
strategy of fostering name brands to invigorate its national
industry.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Chinese enterprises have firmly implemented
the name-brand strategy, as they have come to realize that in
international competition, name-brand products hold sway with the
market share and distribution of interests, said Jiang Xiaojuan, an
economist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has entered a period when large enterprises and
enterprise groups are beginning to dominate industrial production,
which means that development of name-brand products will increase
their ability to compete, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Shunde in southern China's Guangdong Province, more
than 260 major enterprises have set up technology development
centers. Some of the high-tech products, with high quality and low
production costs, have rapidly worked their way into the market.
</P>
<P>
Shunde, formerly a small city on the Pearl River Delta, has now
made a name for itself in the country for Rongsheng refrigerators,
Meidi electronic appliances, Kelong air conditioners, and Gelanshi
microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the name-brand strategy has enabled its
enterprises to make breakthroughs in technological improvement
within a short period of time. At present, the city has 75
enterprises each with an annual sales exceeding 100 million
yuan (about 12 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The city government of Qingdao, Shandong Province, where the
headquarters of Haier, China's largest household electronic
appliances producer, is based, has lent support to the firm in all
aspects, such as financing, taxation, credits, foreign
exchanges and investment. The annual sales of Haier has
topped 6.21 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the course of carrying out the name-brand strategy, Chinese
firms have started to pay closer attention to modern marketing
expertise, said an economist with the Research Institute of
Financing and Trade under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"This marks a great shift in the production and management
strategies of Chinese firms," the expert said.
</P>
<P>
TV manufacturing giant Changhong, considered the brightest spot
of China's national industry, has come up with an ambitious plan
to edge into the exclusive international club of 500 top
enterprises at the beginning of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Sales of Changhong TV sets ranked first in China for eight
years in a row, reaching 4.8 million units last year. The
government has extended to it a series of favorable policies to
help it accelerate expansion, said Ni Runfeng, chairman of the
Changhong Electronics Group.
</P>
<P>
To rejuvenate the national industry, the Chinese government has
set a target that by 2010, major industries are expected to churn
out a group of name-brand products which are competitive in the
international market.

<HEADLINE> International Sentence Upsets Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, one of the
three members of the Presidency of Bosnia, today expressed
indignation at a 20 years jail sentence handed down by the
International Court of Justice to Dussan Dadich for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik, who is a Serbian, said in Banjaluka that it was a
"political sentence rather than a legal sentence."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the sentence was given without adequate evidence,
Krajisnik was quoted by the Yugoslav news agency Tunjug as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president of the Republic of Srpska, Biljana
Plavsic, said the sentence was a "grim reality." The president
said she was doubtful about whether Dadich was a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
The International Court of Justice, based in the Hague,
announced on May 7 that Dussan, who is a Serbian, should be held
responsible for his crimes of ousting and physically torturing
Moslems and Croatians in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Records Lowest Inflation in Three Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand registered an
inflation of 1.1 percent in the year ending June this year, the
lowest since June 1994, Statistics New Zealand said today.
</P>
<P>
The three-year low figure was achieved thanks to falling
transport cost and mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
Calculated accordingly, the Reserve Bank estimated that the
underlying inflation rate - the Bank's measurement for inflation
which excludes interest rate movements and one-off price shocks -
at 0.3 percent for the June quarter and 1.5 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash is contracted with the
government to keep underlying inflation below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics NZ figures show that in the June year, three of the
nine groups that make up the consumer price index (CPI) recorded
increases while six recorded falls.
</P>
<P>
The major rise came from the housing group, including house and
land prices and rents.
</P>
<P>
However, construction costs, which had risen every year since
1981, fell 1.1 percent in the year under review.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Political Parties Differ over Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Major political parties in
Bangladesh differ in their stands on today's strike called by a
grouping of Islamic organizations to protest a Zionist act of
blasphemy against the Holy Quran.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic groups called a dawn-to-dusk strike on July 3. Five
days later, Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's fourth largest party,
called an eight-hour strike for the same day and the same reason.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that a Jewish woman on June 28 pasted some
anti-Muslim hate posters to about 20 Arab storefronts in the West
Bank city of Hebron. The posters depicting the Muslim Prophet
Mohammad as a pig stomping on the Koran has provoked strong
condemnation from across the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), at its
Standing Committee meeting on July 11, extended its support to the
strike call.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the ruling Awami (People's) League (AL)
Zillur Rahman, however, opposed the strike, saying that it served
political motives of a "vested quarter."
</P>
<P>
He said the AL cannot support the strike as the parliament had
already unanimously adopted a resolution strongly condemning the
offending act against the Holy Quran.
</P>
<P>
The third largest Jatiya (national) Party, which supported the
AL in forming the government, also protested today's strike. But
the dissident group of JP led by Shah Moazzem and Kazi Zafar have
extended their support to the strike program.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third nationwide strike enforced by the
opposition parties this year.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Suggests Regional Conflicts Be Addressed in NY </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov told his British counterpart Robin Cook here today that
regional conflicts should be addressed in the Russia-NATO
ministerial meeting scheduled for September in New York.
</P>
<P>
When talking about the agenda of the meeting, Primakov
suggested that the issue of Bosnia be discussed and that an armed
force made of both Russian and NATO troops be set up to deal with
possible regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-NATO's partnership council, set up under a landmark
pact signed in May giving Moscow a say in some of the NATO's
affairs, is to hold its first ministerial meeting in September
during the United Nations' General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Cook's visit was aimed at improving strained relations with
Russia at a time of NATO enlargement and an apparent Western
crackdown on fugitive war crimes suspects in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Last week, NATO officially invited the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland to join the military alliance. And last Thursday
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia shot dead a former Bosnian
Serb police chief and arrested a hospital director.
</P>
<P>
Russia bitterly criticized NATO's swoop on suspected Bosnian
war criminals and its recent enlargement, describing the latter as
"the biggest mistake in Europe since the end of World War Two".
</P>
<P>
As for the military alliance's further expansion, Cook told
reporters that NATO would consider the next wave of applications
according to the situation of that time, adding that NATO's door
would remain open all the time.
</P>
<P>
Cook was the first British cabinet minister to visit Russia
since the Labor Party won the May 1 election, ending 18 years of
Conservative rule in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Calls for Boosting South-South Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto has
stressed the need to strengthen cohesion and unity among
developing countries to boost South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet in honor of visiting South African
President Nelson Mandela at the State Palace here last night,
Soeharto congratulated South Africa on its appointment to host the
Non-Aligned Movement summit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia supports the leadership of South Africa in this
movement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After the end of the cold war, we have made adjustments to
make the movement relevant to significant changes occurring in the
world as well as to enable it to attain our initial goals," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also urged developing countries grouped in the
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) to refrain from confrontation with
developed nations.
</P>
<P>
"Since the holding of the 10th Non-Aligned summit in Jakarta
(in 1992), we have abandoned confrontations with developed
nations. Instead, we have been promoting partnerships with them,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Mandela praised Indonesia's socio-economic achievements under
the leadership of President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
"You have changed your country from a major importer of food to
one based on self-sufficiency, your experience in this regard will
be valuable to many countries in the developing world, not the
least on our African Continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived here on Monday for a three-day state visit
to Indonesia focusing on economic links, said trade between the
two countries had increased four-fold in the past four year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, bilateral trade stood at about 200 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto and Mandela will hold talks today and witness the
signing of an agreement on double taxation avoidance between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will fly to Bangkok, Thailand on July 16 to begin an
official two-day visit there.

<HEADLINE> River Harnessment in Northeast China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province has made great progress in harnessing the Liaohe
River thanks to the just-completed reconstruction of a floodgate
on the well-known waterway.
</P>
<P>
The Shuangtaizi floodgate, which was originally built in the 1960s,
is 60 km away from the mouth of the river. It is a key water
control project on the river to prevent the backward flow of sea
tides and to control the flood waters. It also offers an important
water supply for local economic development.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the sluice gate has been almost completely
blocked by silt, seriously weakening its capacity of flood
discharge and threatening the safety of nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the provincial government allocated more than 47
million yuan for the improvement of the water gate, which was
designed to control serious flooding that occurs once within 50
years and supply 800 million cu m of water to the neighboring
farmland and fertilizer plants per year.
</P>
<P>
The local government harnessed the Liaohe River during the
1986-1990 period, aiming to control serious flooding that occurs
once within 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Central and the local governments have raised money in recent
years to harness the river and improve its capability to fight
floods.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to contribute to the economic development in
the large number of cities and grain production bases along the
Liaohe River.

ROME, July 14 (Xinhua) -- About 27 percent of Italy's urban
water is lost due to leaking and oozing during running in
ill-maintained pipes, a survey by an Italian agency showed today.
</P>
<P>
Poor management and bad maintenance of the country's 6,200
major water pipelines are to blame for the shocking waste of
water, which has caused water shortage in the entire south of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The heavy leakage in Emilia-Romagna region has driven the water
price as much as 10,000 liras (6 U.S. dollars) per liter, the

SANTIAGO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Education will be top on the
agenda of the second summit of the Americas to be held in Santiago
in April, 1998, a Chilean Foreign Ministry official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The principal idea that dominates the agenda is education, as
a basic tool for overcoming the difficulties of development on the
continent," Juan Martabit, a Foreign Ministry official for
American affairs said.
</P>
<P>
The second issue is the promotion of democracy and human
rights, said Martabit, who is the general coordinator of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
He said the third question in discussion will be "economic
integration and free trade", which include the enormous
undertaking of the FTAA (Free Trade Area of the Americas) and
matters such as capital markets, regional energy integration and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be more convenient if U.S. President Bill
Clinton were to show up at the summit to give credibility to the
creation of the FTAA.
</P>
<P>
The summit will deal with other issues such as corruption, drug
trafficking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Martabit announced that during the summit, the heads of state
and government will sign two documents: a political statement and
an action plan that is being worded among the participants of the
summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 15,000 ha of Chinese
chestnut trees in Dongyuan County, Guangdong Province, didn't
bear fruit for nearly 10 years until 1993, when researchers at the
provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences went to the area to
provide technical help.
</P>
<P>
China's poverty-stricken areas have long been plagued by poor
education and lack of well-trained people. Therefore, improving
people's education and skills is considered key to poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
The province sent 4,000 professionals from 48 research
institutes to 50 poor counties in mountainous areas. The experts
have maintained long-term contacts with the counties, and helped
them bring in more than 10 million yuan of investment and 120
million yuan of bank loans.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 1.1 billion yuan in output value was generated and
100,000 technicians and management staff from trained 1992 to the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts have transformed Nanxiong City's cottage industry of
growing gingkoes into a pillar industry by shortening the
fruit-bearing time from 15 years to only five years. The city now
has more than 3,300 ha of gingkoes.
</P>
<P>
The institutions also help the poverty-stricken areas import
technology and provide economic information for the needy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Company to Explore Oil, Gas in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- One more Indonesian company has
agreed to explore and produce oil and natural gas at three onshore
blocks in Myanmar's Magway division.
</P>
<P>
Official paper The New Light of Myanmar reported today that
under a production sharing contract signed here Tuesday between
the PT Exspan Sumatra Oil Company of Indonesia and state-run
Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), the Indonesian company is
to conduct the exploration and production at blocks in Ohndwe,
Kyaukkyi-Mindon and Padaukpin-Monnatkon areas.
</P>
<P>
last October, an Indonesian company, the APN Petroleum Ltd.,
signed a contract with the MOGE to carry out oil and gas
exploration and production in Chauk and Yenangyoung, two onshore
areas in central Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
One of Myanmar's onshore gas fields, the Aphyauk gas field in
Taikkyi area in central part of the country, has been supplying
natural gas to Yangon, Pyay and areas in southern part of the
country for power generation and industrial use.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a pipeline has also been laid to bring natural gas
from another newly developed onshore oil field -- the Kyaukkhwet

According to official sources, Myanmar has signed more than 20
production sharing contracts with oil companies from nearly 10
countries including Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Thailand and the United States to explore oil and
natural gas in seven onshore and five offshore areas in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics also show that foreign

<HEADLINE> Tsingtao Beer Expands into Group Enterprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Tsingtao Brewery Group Co Ltd,
China's leading beer producer and one of the country's few
international brands, was launched recently in the east coastal
city of Qingdao, Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The group, a wholly owned State enterprise registered with the
State shares of the previous Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd holds 44.42
percent of the shares of the Tsingtao Brewery Co Ltd, valued at
399.8 million yuan (49.17 million US dollars), the
English-language newspaper China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tsingtao Brewery Group Co Ltd is in a three-tier structure: a
real estate company, an advertising company and other business
companies held by the group -- non-binding enterprises contracted
with the group.
</P>
<P>
Li Guirong, chairman of the group's board of directors, called
this move another significant capital operation after Tsingtao
Beer was restructured into a joint stock company in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The move is an attempt to rebuild Tsingtao's image in the stock
markets -- ensuring good returns for investors, advancing
multiplied businesses and merging small beer producers to promote
large production.
</P>
<P>
Tsingtao was the first inland company listed in the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tajik Decree, Implementation of Peace Deal Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov
today signed a decree implementing an agreement on achieving
national peace and harmony, and a mutual pardon pact with the
oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, the government would draw up a plan within a
week to implement the accord on peace and harmony, which it struck
with the oppositions in Moscow on June 27, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A special coordination group, to be headed by Deputy Prime
Minister Akil Akilov, would be set up to take charge of the
implementation of the accord, which was aimed at ending the
five-year civil war in the Central Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the peace deal, the two sides would exchange
prisoners of war and establish a 26-member national commission for
reconciliation, to be led by Islamic opposition leader Abdullo
Nuri.
</P>
<P>
The commission, made up by government and opposition
representatives, had already drawn up plans for legislative
elections next year, and the composition of a coalition
government, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of government posts must be given over to the
opposition, and opposition forces must integrate with government
forces or lay down their weapons, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the mutual pardon pact, which was already signed by Nuri
last week and was to come into effect after the signing of the
president, both sides agreed to free captives seized after
military conflicts broke out in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Since its independence in 1991, conflicts among political,
religious and ethnic groups in the country have left thousands of
people dead and many more homeless.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government has speeded up reconciliation with the
oppositions since 1995. Large scale fighting ended after a truce
was signed in December last year, but sporadic clashes continued.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Troops Overrun Extremists' Main Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Government troops have captured the
main camp of the extremist Abu Sayyaf, a rebel group in the
southern Philippines, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the soldiers seized the camp on Sunday
following a series of encounters which started Friday morning when
some Abu Sayyaf members attacked the head office of the troops
deployed in Basilan province.
</P>
<P>
As of noon Monday, military sources have claimed the killing of
at least 20 Abu Sayyaf members and five soldiers, the report said,
adding that the rebels are still fighting back in the hills after
the fall of their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there were reports that the Abu Sayyaf has forged a
military alliance with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
and is being reinforced by MILF members.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a renegade faction of the mainstream rebel group,
the Moro National Liberation Front which signed a peace agreement
with the government last year.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF are trying to rescue their
deadlocked peace talks after dozens of MILF rebels were killed
recently in the fierce offensives launched by government troops.

<HEADLINE> China Pull out of Indonesia Badminton Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China has to pull out of the
Indonesia Open badminton tournament because the host nation failed
to issue the team visas on time, Chinese head coach Li Yongbo said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The competition has already begun today, but the Chinese
players are still at home. Li said they only got their visas
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
``The late visa-issuing prevented the Chinese team from
travelling on time,'' said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li revealed China planned to send all its top shuttlers to
the "prestigous event, including world women's singles title
holder Ye Zhaoying, world and Olympic women's doubles champion Ge
Fei and Gujun.
</P>
<P>
"The host told us last night that we can leave for Jakarta
today, but the competition will be in full swing when we arrive
there."
</P>
<P>
Although the Indonesian Badminton Association promised to
postpone Chinese players' matches by one day, that will force the
shuttlers to play more matches the next day.
</P>
<P>
Li said if Chinese players fly to Jakarta and take one day off,
some of the players such like Ge Fei will have to play four
matches on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"That is too tough. No one can bear it. To play under such
abnormal circumstance will affect players results and rankings,
so we have to withdraw," Li added.
</P>
<P>
Players usually got to the host city one day before the start
of the competition in order to be adapted to local conditions
and regaining forms.
</P>
<P>
Li said China will take part in Singapore Open next week.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time for Indonesia to grant the entrance
visas too late for the Chinese team, who replaced the Indonesian
shuttlers to dominate the badminton world this year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Economic Growth to Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The depreciation of the baht will
result in the fall of Thailand's economic growth rate this year to
4.6 percent from an earlier forecast of 5.6 percent, according to
the National Economic and Social Development Board.
</P>
<P>
The country's growth rate last year was about 6.8 percent, the
lowest in a decade.
</P>
<P>
The board, which is the state planning agency, also readjusted
the inflation rate projection for this year, from a previous 4.5
percent to 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new forecast is based on projections that the value of the
baht will settle at 28.50 to the US dollar, and it could be
revised again if the baht falls further, according to Wirat
Wattanasiritham, secretary-general of the board.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, the current account deficit is forecast
to decline to 6.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) from 6.5
percent forecast earlier, while exports are likely to increase by
8.2 percent, up from an earlier projection of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year exports growth was near zero.
</P>
<P>
Imports are expected to drop by 2.4 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The export and import projections will also be subject to
further study, said Wirat.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government spokesman Varathep Ratanakorn said on
Monday that a 'buy Thai' campaign will be launched to encourage
Thai people to buy more Thai-made products and to take holiday at
home rather than abroad.
</P>
<P>
The government will also further cut unnecessary spending by
government agencies, particularly on foreign trips, and Thai- made
goods would be given priority in all state procurement programs.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Thailand governor Rerngchai Manakanond said on Monday
that the central bank has also revised its projections, which are
close to those of the National Economic and Social Development
Board.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Have Nuclear Power Plant by 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will have a nuclear
power plant by they year 2003 or 2005 to meet a drastically
increased demand for electricity, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
"We will have a nuclear power plant, depending on the agreement
between the government and the House of Representatives," director
general of the National Atomic Energy Board Iyos R. Subki said
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After opening a seminar on nuclear power plant, he said the
nuclear power plant would remain the last alternative, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Despite abundant energy sources in Indonesia such as gas, coal,
hydro and solar energy, he said the country had to explore the
possibility of alternative power plants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Morris Rosen of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) told the seminar that population growth would raise
the need for energy which would in the end prompt the construction
of nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Indonesia would have a population of 270
million by the year 2020 when the need for energy would increase
by an average of eight percent per year.
</P>
<P>
There is no technology without risks, he said, adding the use
of coal, oil, gas, solar, hydro energy might have an impact on the
environment.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht Down by 15 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The baht has depreciated by 15
percent against the US dollar since its float on July 2, according
to Thai central bank Deputy Governor Chaiyawat Wibulswasdi.
</P>
<P>
"We think the baht has weakened enough, or even a bit too much,
given the current state of the economy," he said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank on Monday announced its official reference
rate for Friday's trading at 29.945 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The reference rate is based on a weighted average of trading on
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyawat said the spread between bid and ask prices by local
commercial banks was narrowing, indicating that trading volatility
was easing.
</P>
<P>
The last official midrate before the float was 25.79 baht to
the US dollar on June 30. Since its float, the baht has weakened
steadily, trading at as low as 30.50-31.00 baht to the dollar late
last week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, central bank Governor Rerngchai Marakanond said the
baht would stabilize further over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
He said volatility in regional markets had affected baht
trading onshore, adding that he did not expect the baht to
depreciate further.
</P>
<P>
although the central bank is optimistic that the baht could
stabilize further over the next several days, some analysts
believe that baht could weaken further in the next several months,
reflecting continued pessimism about the health of the economy,
especially the finance sector, and volatility in regional trading
of the Philippine peso, the Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian
rupiah.

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The China Construction Bank has
concluded its bond dealings on the stock exchanges and turned to
the inter-bank bond market as required by the central bank.
</P>
<P>
A bank official said that the bank now trades and repurchases
treasury bonds through an inter-bank bond trading system, and the
Central Bond Registration Co. Ltd. has become the new custodian of
all the state treasury bonds owned by the bank.
</P>

The People's Bank of China, the central bank, issued a circular
in early June to stop bond dealings on the stock exchanges and
stock trading centers across the country, in a bid to cut the bank
funds off from the stock market.
</P>

The China Construction Bank was designated as the primary dealer
of state treasury bonds in February, 1995, and has since

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China is feeling the pressure to
provide jobs for an estimated 160 to 180 million additional
laborers during the 1996-2000 period, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
In order to increase employment, China needs to add vital
investment, not only by absorbing foreign funds but also relying
heavily on internal fund accumulation and investment.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be given to curbing inflation most likely
caused by increased investment, in a bid to keep prices stable to
help create a sound environment for the country's rapid economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The country can also use bank loans to increase investment.
To cut the links between investment and inflation, the country
should increase residents' direct investment while reducing
assistance through bank loans.
</P>
<P>
To increase job opportunities, the government must readjust
some of its macro-economic policies, especially those that are
oriented towards increasing goods and jobs. Emphasis should be
placed on infrastructure and technical renovations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government must take steps to encourage
individuals to use surplus money to help expand production,
rather than for luxury consumption. It should also develop
preferential policies for individuals' investment.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Lack Aggressiveness in Business, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The lack of aggressiveness on the
part of Canadian business circle is holding the country back from
being more competitive, a new survey suggests today.
</P>
<P>
Less than a third of chief executive officers (CEO) surveyed
believed Canadian firms are "very competitive", and 29 percent of
them cited the lack of aggressiveness as "most common shortfall of
Canadian firms."
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Canada has the capability to do even better --
to turn those aspirations into reality. But to do so, we're going
to have to become more aggressive," said a senior official with
the Deloitte Consulting Group, which did the survey.
</P>
<P>
At present, Canada's corporate passivity appears to be
subsiding, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
And every respondent from a non-multinational company said that
their company would expand internationally in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent said that this would involve exporting goods or
service overseas, while 47 percent were planning to set up branch
plants or sales offices.
</P>
<P>
As expected, the United States was the preferred destination
for Canadians, with nearly a quarter (22 percent) of CEOs saying
they would expand into the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mexico was a distant second, at 7 percent, while western
Europe, China, Brazil and Argentina, were each cited by 5 percent
of CEOs as expansion target.
</P>
<P>
The survey, made public today, canvassed the view of 52
Canadian CEOs whose companies employ 350,000 people, generated 65
billion U.S. dollars in sales in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Exchange Rate Seen to Stabilize: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' top monetary
official has expressed confidence that the exchange rate between
the country's currency peso and the U.S. dollar would stabilize
within the next few days, the local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as
saying there were signs that the peso-dollar rate was stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
The peso showed its stability at the opening of trading Monday,
rebounding briefly to 27.45 pesos to one dollar, but settled at
29.09 pesos to one dollar at the closing of the market. The
reference rate or weighted average Monday was 28.77 pesos to one
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The central bank announced last Friday to allow the peso-dollar
rate to move "within a new wider range" after fighting vigorously
speculators for one week.
</P>
<P>
The announcement sent the peso plunging 11.5 percent to 29.45
against the dollar on the trading floor, after which it settled at
28.08 before trading was soon suspended that morning.
</P>
<P>
Justifying the float of the peso, Singson said the government's
principal concern is to protect the "well-earned" economic gains
of the Filipino people from current currency "turbulence" in
regional currency market.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that it was difficult to determine the exchange
rate level where the market is expected to settle "as the market
basically reflects the collective decision of all the participants
and not just the central bank."
</P>
<P>
But he reiterated that the monetary authority will continue to
monitor market developments and ensure orderly market conditions.
</P>
<P>
He also allayed fears of prices hikes, saying all government
agencies, especially the Price Monitoring Council, had been
mobilized to make sure that no one will take advantage of the
current situation.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori's Popularity Drops: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- At the end of his seventh year in
office, President Alberto Fujimori's approval rating has dropped
to nearly a half of what it was at the beginning of his second
term, a survey showed today.
</P>
<P>
If the elections were to be held Tuesday, 31 percent of the
voters would vote for Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade and only 15
percent for the president, said the CPI company, which conducted
the poll.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered Lima and 11 of the most important cities in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The CPI manager, Manuel Saavedra, said this is a very critical
time for the government because the president's popularity is
nose-diving.
</P>
<P>
According to another polling company, Fujimori, who began to
lose popularity in 1996, was maintaining the support of half the
citizenry in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The plunge occurred during the second quarter of this year due
to a series of incidents that occurred after the successful rescue
on April 22 of the hostages from the hands of the Tupac Amaru
rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
The pollsters attributed the drop in Fujimori's popularity to
political problems, including accusations of human rights
violations, confrontations with the press, the re-election bill
and alleged cases of corruption.
</P>
<P>
For the CPI polling company, the reasons include what it
described as government errors, such as the recent dismissal of
Constitutional Court Magistrates.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican police authorities
have noticed an increase in the consumption of narcotics in the
country as indicated by a rise in seizures of the drug known as
"crack."
</P>
<P>
More than 12,000 pieces of crack were seized in the first six
months of the year. Only 17,800 pieces were confiscated throughout
last year, police said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the crack, about 7,100 pieces, was seized in San
Jose. The Atlantic port of Limon and the Pacific port of
Puntarenas are the other two main transshipment centers for the
drug.
</P>
<P>
Crack is cheaper and more harmful than cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Police said the seizures of cocaine and marijuana have also
increased.

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil Fields Increase Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Oil fields in the South China Sea
pumped out 6.78 million tons of crude oil during the first half of
this year, a 31 percent rise over the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The oil fields, being exploited through Sino-foreign
co-operation, are expected to increase their crude oil output to 12
million tons this year from 11. 84 million tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The oil fields are under the jurisdiction of the Eastern South
China Sea Company, one of the regional companies of the China
National Offshore Oil Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Nine oil fields have proven commercially worthy of development
in the South China Sea; eight of them are already in operation.
</P>
<P>
The Eastern South China Sea Company has developed co-operative
relations with 38 foreign counterparts from 11 countries and
regions -- including the US, Britain and Italy. It has signed 43
contracts with foreign companies to recover the oil.
</P>
<P>
In North China, the Dagang Oil Field, located southeast of
Tianjin, has produced 100 million tons of crude oil since it began
operations 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It produced more than 2.18 million tons of crude oil and 193
million cubic meters of natural gas and verified 125 million tons
of oil reserves during the first half of this year, surpassing
targets set for this period.
</P>
<P>
The field began production in 1964 and has drilled 21 oil and
natural gas wells, with annual production capacity of 4.3 million
tons of crude oil and 360 million cubic meters of natural gas. It
also has a processing capacity of 2.5 million tons of crude oil
annually.
</P>
<P>
Dagang Field, covering a prospecting area of 18,600 square
kilometers in 25 districts, counties and cities, has become a
modern, comprehensive oil and natural gas base integrated with
production, processing, machine building, research and design. It
ranked sixth in the country, with 4.34 million tons of crude oil
output last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Refuse Muslim Leader's Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine Muslim rebel group has
expressed its refusal to the mediation of a former Muslim
separatist leader for resuming the stalled peace talks between the
government and the MILF, local television reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), told the SNN television Monday that the MILF will
not need Nur Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM), in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
MILF leaders, including Jaafar, earlier welcomed Misuari's
mediation and even met him last week. Misuari was ordered by
President Fidel Ramos last week to act as an intermediary between
the MILF and the government to help bring the MILF back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Misuari was chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), which signed a peace deal with the government last
September to end its decades of separatist movement in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar, who did not give the reason for abruptly turning down
Misuari's intervention, said what the government should do now is
to show their "sincerity" in talks with the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF will reopen peace negotiations with the government
only after the government troops withdraw from its former second
largest camp, Camp Rajah Muda, in Cotabato province in central
Mindanao, he said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF indefinitely postponed its sixth round of low-level
peace talks with the government after the military seized Camp
Rajah Muda late last month.
</P>
<P>
The pull-out of the military from MILF-controlled areas,
especially Camp Rajah Muda, is one of the four conditions set by
the MILF for restarting the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the MNLF, and it has refused
to join the MNLF-Manila peace accord. The MILF began its
exploratory peace talks with Manila last January, but the talks
have so far failed to make any major progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Arne Ljungqvist, vice-president of
world athletics ruling body IAAF, hit out on Monday at his own
body for giving Michael Johnson a wild card to compete at the
world championships despite not being selected by the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
Ljungqvist claimed the decision-making process is completely
mad. "This is an important question on which a decision should be
taken after full discussion and analysis, not through a flippant
telephone vote with a few hours warning."
</P>
<P>
The IAAF announced earlier that it would be awarding a wild
card to the defending champions for the first time at next month's
championships in Athens.
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit stupid when you adapt the IAAF rules to fit the
Americans' rules. Its like putting the cart in front of the
horse. The U.S. should fit its rules with those of the IAAF," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who completed historic 200 and 400 meters doubles at
both the last world championships and at last year's Atlanta
Olympics, failed to make the U.S. team after he missed the
national trials because of injury.

</P>
<P>
She said that "with a first class ticket to NATO comes the
obligation to make a first class contribution."

She commiserated over severe floods hitting the north and east
of the Czech Republic in the past week, and pledged more help from
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
Albright, born in Prague in 1937, said she only recently became
aware of her Jewish origins.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, she visited Prague's Jewish quarter and found the
names of her paternal grandparents on the memorial walls of a

TIRANA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The final result of a referendum in
Albania showed that most people in the country opposed restoring
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
The figures released today by the electoral committee indicated
that 66.74 percent of the respondents preferred the country to
remain a republic while 33.26 percent welcomed restoration of
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
An early election was called in March after the collapse of
pyramid investment schemes which sparked nationwide strong
protests. The president's ruling Democratic Party resigned after
five years of ruling the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
Under the order of President Sali Berisha on June 29, a
referendum was held to decide the political system of the
country. About 1,423,209 out of a total of 1,986,550 voters, or
71.64 percent, took part in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Leka Zogu, son of late King Ahmed Zogu, and some pro-monarchy
political groups said they would not recognize the result.

<HEADLINE> Sino-US Study on Fuel Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Experts from China and the United
States are working together to develop technology that will
convert China's rich coal resources to automotive fuels and
seeking more efficient energy use with a minimum of environmental
pollution, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
They have completed a life cycle analysis which assesses the
economic, environmental and energy impact of using China's natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
The research project, which focuses on converting coal in
coal-producing Shanxi Province and other coal-rich regions in
China, will provide a valuable tool to help China's central and
provincial governments make scientific decisions based on the
sustainable and environmentally friendly use of coal resources,
according to the State Science and Technology Commission
Vice-Minister Xu Guanhuag.
</P>
<P>
The research project is being jointly conducted by the State
Science and Technology Commission, the US-Based Ford Motor Co.,
Qinghua University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
China has limited petroleum resources but abundant coal and
natural gas reserves. The country has been a net importer of oil
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Developing coal-based auto-fuels such as methanol, methane,
gasoline, and diesel is strategically important, for automobiles
consume a large amount of oil in China, and the number of vehicles
in the country will continue to increase along with future
economic growth, said Xu.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the world's top producers of coke extracted
from coal. But this process emits large quantities of wasted gases
causing serious air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Extracting methonol from the wasted gases and converting it to
vehicle fuels can reduce air pollution and save energy, according
to the 3E study report released yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Two major methods are used to produce methonol: converting coal
directly to methonol and extracting methonal from coke-burned gas,
experts noted.
</P>
<P>
The 3E study, started early last year, is a computer-based
method aiming to provide an efficiency comparison between the two
methods to find better technology to convert coal to vehicle
fuels. It's a comparison instead of a new method.
</P>
<P>
The study covers coal mining and transportation; the conversion
of coal to fuel; rational fuel distribution; materials and
manufacturing techniques for vehicle production.

RIO DE JANEIRO -- Foreign direct investments in Brazil
reached 7.3 billion U.S. dollars during the first semester of
this year, an increase of 52 percent over the same period in
1996, according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The increase in foreign direct capitals contributed to the
financing of the deficit in the current account and to the
increase in this country's competitiveness in international
markets.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguay and Argentina reached an agreement last
week in which Uruguay will export Uruuguayan automobiles under
preferential terms, announced Uruguayan Industry Minister Julio
Herrera on July 9.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Argentina agreed to extend import licenses to
trucks and auto parts. Herrera also revealed that there
is a binational undertaking between Uruguay and China in force,
oriented to the assembly of trucks for supplying the regional
market.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- The meeting of Chilean and Argentine foreign and
defence ministers which was scheduled to be held on July 10 and
11 was postponed until the end of this month, according to the
Chilean Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the meeting is to exchange opinions over an
open agenda of topics of bilateral interest.
</P>
<P>
There is only one border dispute between Chile and Argentina
remains to be resolved: the one in the Southern Ice Fields.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- The municipal hall of Montevideo and the
ecological coordination of the Metropolitan Area Society of the
state of Buenos Aires, agreed to cooperate in activities designed

<HEADLINE> O.J. Simpson's Dream House Sold for $2.63 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Former football star O.J.
Simpson's house was sold at auction today for 2.63 million U.S.
dollars to the bank that had foreclosed on it.
</P>
<P>
The sale was held outside the courthouse in Los Angeles
suburban Norwalk. Bidding opened at 1,875,000 dollars. Patrick
Dobiesz, representing lender Hawthorne Savings, opened the
bidding. Four times, another bidder added one dollar to the pot.
</P>
<P>
By buying the property, Hawthorne Savings can sell it privately
for a much higher price. It also eliminates any excess money that
would have been used to pay part of a 33.5 million dollars civil
judgment against Simpson.
</P>
<P>
Although Simpson was acquitted of murder during a criminal
trial, he was found liable for the killings in a wrongful death
trial that ended earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The 6,200-square-foot home in Los Angeles' wealthy Brentwood
section, which Simpson has lived in for 20 years, has six baths, a
tennis court, waterfalls and an Olympic-size swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how quickly Simpson would have to move out. He
said he will remain in the home with his two youngest children for
a while, hoping to find another residence in Brentwood by this
fall.

<HEADLINE> Britain Shut Down Two Meat Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- the British government shut down
two meat plants today which were suspected of breaking an EU ban
on exports of British beef.
</P>
<P>
The move was responding to investigations by the Ministry of
Agriculture and the European Commission's anti-fraud unit.
</P>
<P>
"Evidence is coming to light that some UK-based companies may
have been exporting UK beef," Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham
said in a statement. "I am serving notices on two companies
requiring them to stop the relevant business immediately."
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence, too, that the companies in question have
been failing to comply with the basic requirements on record
keeping, whose purpose is to ensure that the origins of meat can
be traced, and falling down on hygiene standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the European Commission announced that
hundreds of tons of beef had been exported from Britain to EU
countries and nations outside the bloc since EU banned export of
the British beef in March, 1996 for fear of eating beef infected
with mad cow disease could lead to people contracting a fatal
brain disease, CJD.
</P>
<P>
The beef was fraudulently declared to be of Belgian origin.
Britain reacted to the news by saying it had already launched an
investigation into media allegations of illegal beef exports.
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely determined that the inquiries into this
complex affair should be pursued to the end. I am determined to
crack down hard on anyone who runs risks with public safety,"
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government, which came to power in May, has been
trying hard to get EU's beef ban lifted. It fears that the

LUANDA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Observers and observers on
Angolan peace process from the U.S., Russia and Portugal today
jointly denounced the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) for detaining a U.N. plane in east Angola.
</P>
<P>
On July 11 to 12, UNITA detained a UN helicopter engaged in
investigation missions in North Lunda province for 24 hours, it
said, adding that earlier than this on June 7, UNITA also
detained a plane of the World Food Program in Moxico province in
southeastern Angola.

In a joint statement, the two also blamed UNITA for abusing UN
personnel and non-governmental organization staff working in the
area, saying the actions have violated the Lusaka Peace Accord
and the resolutions by the UN Security Council, as well as the
spirit announced by the political committee of UNITA on June 16,
in which UNITA promised investigation into cases violating peace
wishes to avoid further recurrences.

The statement finally requests that UNITA abide by its
promises and, in a responsible manner, prevent any incidences
from bringing harm to the present situation. Meanwhile, it
appeals to the United Nations to include the recent incidents
into its agenda.
