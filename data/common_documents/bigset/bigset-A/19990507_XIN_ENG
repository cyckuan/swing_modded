<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The military men of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) killed 18
innocent civilians when they raided a market in Chipeta Town of
central Bie Province Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Kuito hospital in the provincial capital is full of people
who have been injured by the UNITA attack, the official Angola
News Agency Angog reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The market, about 30 kilometers southwest of Kuito, capital
city of Bie, is one built on some railway car storages.
</P>
<P>
Anastacia Nangueve, an old woman who survived the disaster with
only a bullet in her right knee, accused the UNITA men of firing
at people firstly in the market like mad and then looting almost
everything in the market.
</P>
<P>
People who fled from the town also charged that UNITA men were
taking youths by force to reinforce their army in Camacupa, a City
not very far from Chipeta, and that any one who dared to refuse or
intended to run away would be killed on the spot.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Boost Sugar Output for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye Thursday urged sugar producers to explore ways
to meet the need of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the sugar stake-holders here, Sumaye
said Tanzania's annual sugar demand stands at 300,000 tons, but
local production is only 130,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue importing sugar when the country has all
the prerequisites to attain self sufficiency," he told the
attendants, asserting that privatization of sugar factories means
to revamp the local production.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting, which drew officials form public and
private sugar factories, importers, sugar cane out-growers and
tax authorities, is to deliberate on the sugar policies.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Kilimanjaro Sugar Company said that
productivity at his company has declined in recent years due to
inadequate capital outlay, and deterioration of the assets and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"The installed capacity of the four sugar factories in the
country is 228,000 tons per year in 1998, but the production is
only 113,622 tons," he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Situated between latitude one and 11 degrees south of the
Equator on the Eastern African coast, Tanzania has identified a
host of places where the climate, soil and topography are well
suited for sugar cane farming.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Accuses Greece, Cyprus of Escalating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Thursday accused Greece and
Cyprus of escalating the tensions in Cyprus and the Eastern
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry's deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli
told reporters in Ankara that the ongoing flight of Greek fighter
jets over Cyprus shows that the Greek-Greek Cypriot front insists
on raising tension in the island.
</P>
<P>
Four Greek fighter jets on Wednesday attempted to land at a
military air base in Cyprus, but "had to turn back without
landing," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The jets were participating in military exercises by the Greek
Air Force near Cyprus, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek and Greek Cypriot provocations are deepening the
confidence rift and harming the stability on the island, " he said.
</P>
<P>
The landing of Greek F-16 fighter jets in a military air base
in Cyprus last spring led to a sharp escalation of tension in
relations between Turkey and Greece. Turkey retaliated by sending
F-16s to the Turkish Cypriot side on the island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, have long been at odds
over the limits of air space, sovereignty over some Aegean islands
and the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> One Injured in Bomb Blast in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was injured, but
nobody was killed in the bomb blast which occurred in the biggest
market in Uganda' s capital city Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The injured is a person who is a cleaner at the Owino market.
He was injured in the leg, Deputy Spokesman John Kimera told
Xinhua in the market this evening.
</P>
<P>
He said the bomb went off at around 7:40 p.m. when the market
was closing. People were moving out when the explosion was heard.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was not powerful, and the motorcycles and cars parked
nearby were not damaged, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kafumbe road leading to the Owino market was
closed to traffic. Ballistic experts from the police are still
piecing up information to establish the type of the bomb.
</P>
<P>
Police officers are checking nearby hospitals to see if more
people were injured.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth bomb blast which occurred this year and the
second one in this month. A grenade explosion last Saturday
injured at least five people drinking in a pub. Bomb blasts this
year have killed at least 10 people and injured dozens of others.

<HEADLINE> Romania's National Bank to Prioritise Acquisitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Romania's National Bank will
prioritise the acquisitions of hard currency next week in an
attempt to maintain the country's foreign currency reserves at one
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Quoting officials with the central bank, the local daily
Romania libera reported on Thursday that the bank has over the
last weeks bought huge amounts of U.S. dollars to strike a balance
in the exchange rates of the national currency leu.
</P>
<P>
Another way the central bank attempts to consolidate the
reserves is raising loans in the international capital markets.
Thus, the bank mounted a campaign of negotiations with important
commercial banks worldwide to reach short-term loan agreements,
hoping to get some 600 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Romania will get more than one billion U.S. dollars up to the
end of the year by accumulating certain loan tranches that are
already agreed upon, officials of the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Romania's foreign debt amounts to 8.9 billion U.S. dollars,
with more than 40 percent of which granted by international
financial bodies: the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
the International Monetary Fund and the Euozean Union.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt's service for 1999 stands at 2.862 billion
U.S. dollars, the highest in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Romania's foreign currency reserves stood at 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars in April this year, plus 920 million U.S. dollars' worth
of gold and 1.2 billion U.S. dollars of private reserves. Debt
servicing peak in May and June will entail the spending of 930
million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Rugova Says NATO Force in Kosovo Is Vital to Stop War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The top ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova said Thursday that the presence of an international peace
force in Kosovo which included NATO was a "key condition" to
solving the Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference Thursday evening with
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema and Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini, Rugova said that the "installation of an
international peace keeping force composed of NATO and other
countries" was vital to stop the conflict over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The conditions for reaching a negotiated settlement are those
laid down by the international community," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order for Kosovar refugees to return home, the
withdrawal of Serbian troops and the creation of "secure
conditions" were necessary.
</P>
<P>
"I am for peace and non-violent resistance, and the entire
Kosovo population, including the Kosovo Liberation Army, is in
favor of a peaceful, political solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema said that "Something is beginning to crack in the
marble-like position of Belgrade."
</P>
<P>
He told the Kosovar leader that "We will be at your side in the
search for a peaceful solution."
</P>
<P>
Dini, just back from a Group of Eight meeting in Bonn, also
said that there were "glimmers of hope" which hadn't existed
before, and that "We are getting closer to a solution."
</P>
<P>
He said that Belgrade had made "significant gestures" like that
of releasing the three U.S. soldiers captured by Serbia last month
and allowing Rugova to come to Rome.
</P>
<P>
He said that Thursday afternoon's G8 meeting had shown that not
only NATO but a "wider community" had "fixed principles" about the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Rugova held talks with D'Alema and Dini Wednesday evening,
reviewing with the Italian leaders step-by-step developments of
the crisis in Kosovo. They also examined the possibilities for a
political-diplomatic solution to the ongoing conflict.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Islamist Virtue Party Deputy Chairman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Aydin Menderes, deputy chairman of
the pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP), Thursday resigned from the his
party post in protest against the inability of FP leader Recai
Kutan in solving the "headscarf controversy."
</P>
<P>
A FP deputy, Merve Kavakci, triggered the dispute among
political parties as she entered the parliament hall wearing a
headscarf on May 2 for oath-taking session, causing chaos in the
parliament and protest by parties.
</P>
<P>
Women are not allowed to wear headscarf in state and public
institutions under the law in the mostly Muslim-populated but
secular state of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Menderes has been said to be against the move by Merve Kavakci
in parliament, but he called on both his party and opponents to
settle the controversy within the norms of a state of law.
</P>
<P>
Menderes' surprise resignation is seen as a big blow to the FP
and some other FP deputies loyal to Menderes are also expected to
resign from the party.
</P>
<P>
The FP, which became the third largest party after the recent
elections and holds 111 seats in parliament, stems from the
Islamic Welfare Party which was outlawed in January, 1998 for its
ultra-Islamic policies.
</P>
<P>
Right after the incident, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
criticized Kavakci for wearing headscarf when attending the new
parliament oath-taking ceremony, saying such a move provoked
Turkish people.
</P>
<P>
He said that "if because of your headscarf you are claiming to
be a Muslim, this means you are making discrimination. This is
provoking people."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that "everyone in Turkey has
the right to wear whatever she would like in their private
lives. But, the General Assembly of Parliament is not within the
bounds of anyone's private life."
</P>
<P>
"In state life, the rules and regulations of the state should
be obeyed. Parliament is not the place to challenge the state,"
Ecevit added.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Called to Join in Zambia's Hydro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has announced
a package of incentives for private sector participation in hydro
power generation and transmission.
</P>
<P>
The incentives comprise financial arrangements, fiscal
concessions, security and institutional arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Launching a document titled "framework and package of
incentives for private sector participation in hydro power
generation and transmission development", Energy and Water
Development Minister, Ben Mwila described the incentives as "a new
and unique policy."
</P>
<P>
The framework and package of incentives provided by the
government would give prospective investors sufficient confidence
and comfort, Mwila said in Lusaka Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government has categorized projects for investment into
power generation and transmission.
</P>
<P>
Projects shall be offered to the private sector on the basis of
"build, operate and transfer" in case of power generation.
</P>
<P>
For transmission development, the offer is on the principle of
"build, own and maintain."
</P>
<P>
"For these projects government is offering internationally
competitive terms and simplification of procedures, by
establishing a one window operation," Mwila said.
</P>
<P>
The ownership of these power projects would be transferred to
the government or its appointed agent free of charge after 30
years of operation.
</P>
<P>
After 30 years of operation the government would lease out the
operation and maintenance of the plant, and other things being
equal to the original entrepreneurs, who would have the first
preference for continued operation and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Fiscal incentives for investors include 10-year corporate tax
exemption, tax free importation of equipment for generation,
transmission and distribution of power, exemption from income tax
in Zambia for foreign lenders and free repatriation of equity
along with dividends.
</P>
<P>
The government is to create an office for promoting private
power investment within the ministry of Energy and Water
Development.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Concerned Over Fightings in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Thursday expressed
deep concern over a fresh flare-up of fightings between two Somali
rival factions, which have taken a heavy toll of both sides.
</P>
<P>
In a related statement issued in the day, Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid appealed to Somali faction leaders to
exert efforts to forge national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Fightings erupted last April at the town of Bua Dhubo in
southwest Somalia, between two rival factions of the Somali
National Front, killing 11 people and wounding 25 others.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid held Somali faction leaders responsible for
hampering regional and international efforts aimed at realizing
durable national reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He called on the belligerent Somali factions to hold dialogs in
a bid to resolve their disputes in a peaceful way, stressing that
dialogs, not fightings, are the best way to settle disputes.
</P>
<P>
It is the Somali people who, in the end, pay the hefty price of
the bloody conflicts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Warring factions have been controlling the country in the Horn
of Africa since 1991 when its dictator, Siad Barre, was toppled by
the anti-government forces.
</P>
<P>
The factions agreed last year to form a broad-based central
government in an effort to realize national reconciliation. But
few tangible results have been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
Somalia is a member of the 22-nation pan Arab forum.

JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- South African Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma Thursday called on students to take the lead in
combating AIDS in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing students at the University of Natal in Durban, Zuma
urged students to take responsibility to fight AIDS, a deadly
disease to human being.
</P>
<P>
She said when dealing with the epidemic, issues such as
inequality, gender, health services, safety and security,
education and discrimination should be considered.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that AIDS could have a negative impact on the
planning for the future if it was not attended to.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of South Africans aged between 15 and 40 years were
 reportedly HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that about 85 percent of South African people
were not taking precautions to prevent the disease and 50 percent,
mainly youth, thought they could identify people infected with the
disease.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way that you can identify someone with the disease
-- I appeal to you to remove this stigma and start to prevent the
disease," Zuma told the students.

<P>
KHARTOUM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail Thursday expressed hope for improving his country's
ties with all neighbors to achieve security and stability in the
African Horn region.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from an Asian tour, Ismail said the foreign
policy of Sudan especially towards its neighbors was based on a
dialogue principle.
</P>
<P>
The minister has recently visited China, South Korea, Malaysia
and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
On the Qatari-brokered accord signed by Sudan and Eritrea,

of relations between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"From this starting point we seek to enhance our relations with
the neighboring countries without exception," he said, adding that
"Any country takes a step in this direction will find us taking
steps towards it."
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Eritrea signed on May 2 in Doha, capital of Qatar, an
agreement to solve the dispute between the two countries whose
relations remained strained since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The recent meeting between Speaker of the National Assembly
(parliament) Hassan al Turabi and leader of the opposition Nation
Party in Geneva on May 2 was part of "the government efforts to
unite all with the country and strengthen the national unity,"
Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the meeting would lead to the return of
opposition members in exile and the resolution of all of the main
issues of the nation.
</P>
<P>
The minister also reaffirmed the government's endeavor to
settle the problem of south Sudan in the framework of the
initiative of the Inter-Governmental Authority for Development
(IGAD).
</P>
<P>
He urged the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) to be
more serious in its talks with the government. He ruled out the
possibility that his government could accept the SPLA proposal to
establish a confederation in the south.

WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) --The United States on Thursday
called a U.N.-brokered agreement on East Timor an important step
forward for its future.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the agreement will be an important step
forward to achieving a peaceful resolution of East Timor's
future," a State Department statement said.
</P>
<P>
the statement came as Portugal and Indonesia agreed on
Wednesday on arrangement for a referendum on August 8 on whether
the people of East Timor want autonomy or independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was once a Portuguese colony. After it withdrew,
Indonesia invaded the territory in 1975 and held it ever since.
</P>
<P>
The State department called on all sides concerned to
"facilitate the immediate establishment of a U.N. presence."
</P>
<P>
But several hours after the agreement was reached,
anti-independence militiamen went house to house beating and
abducting civilians in Halolia, about 45 km southwest of Dili, the
territory's capital, according to the East Timorese Socialist
Party.
</P>
<P>
"The United States remains deeply troubled by the unrestrained,
violent activities of civilian militiamen who seek to bias the
consultation through terror and intimidation," the State
Department statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that Indonesia take immediate steps to ensure
overall security for all in East Timor," it said.

BONN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton

Bonn said they backed the G8 statement of principles for resolving
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
But they also said the NATO strategy of air strikes on

The statement was significant in that Russia and the Western

<P>
"I think there is a real peace process under way but it has no
chance of reaching a satisfactory conclusion unless we maintain
allied unity and firmness," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the Western to stick to the NATO strategy with
more patience.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to aggressively support our air campaign and
aggressively support any diplomatic initiatives that will secure
the conditions necessary for lasting peace in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
There was no reason to change NATO policy just when it seemed
air strikes were beginning to work, said Schroeder.

<HEADLINE> NATO: Yugoslavia Must Accept Conditions By Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A NATO spokesman said here Thursday
that Yugoslavia must take practical action to show its acceptance
of an agreement reached Thursday by NATO allies and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Group of Seven most industrialized countries and Russia this
afternoon issued a joint statement on ending the war in Yugoslavia
by agreeing on an international presence in Kosovo under a United
Nations mandate. The foreign ministers from the United States,
Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia reached
the principle agreement in Bonn at a so-called G-8 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The NATO welcomed the G-8 statement "very warmly," Jamie Shea,
the NATO spokesman, told a news briefing at NATO headquarters in
Brussels. It showed the "diplomatic track was very functioning"
and "a very important stage to bring the crisis to an end," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Yugoslav President must show his practical
action of withdrawing his military and paramilitary forces from
Kosovo. "We need to see action,....but not a verbal acceptance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Another NATO spokesman for military briefing, Major General
Walter Jertz, told reporters that NATO will not change its
strategy at this moment and will continue to intensify its air
strikes against Yugoslav military forces without considering
political aspect.
</P>
<P>
However, the two spokesmen acknowledged that the NATO's Allied
Operation is far from success and had to pay heavy price if they
further escalate the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We have not been able to achieve our objective we initiated
from the beginning,....we have intensified our air campaign over
last few days, we are going to intensify it further," Shea said.

community to pay more attention to the crisis in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Salim, who arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit to
Angola, told the press after meeting Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos that the civil war in Angola has caused many
deaths and displaced thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
He hoped countries in Africa and other regions should "do their
best" to help the Angolan people "end the human tragedy as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
The OAU is calling on the international community for urgent
humanitarian aid extended to Angola, said Salim.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also condemned the opposition National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) for sabotaging the 1994
Lusaka Protocol, and held its Chairman Jonas Savimbi responsible
for the current situation in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Secretary General reiterated on behalf of the OAU that
every individual country should strictly abide by the relevant
resolutions of the U.N. Security Council which impose sanctions on
the UNITA rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Salim and dos Santos exchanged views on the
conflict situation in Congo (K) and Congo (B) and on the concrete
steps to peacefully resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Salim said the pan-African organization is "very worried" about
the situation in Congo (K) and hoped that Angola would "play a
positive role" in ending the nine-month conflict there.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief also announced that African heads of state and
government will issue a resolution on the issue at the forthcoming
OAU summit slated next month in Algeria.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Arab Monetary Fund extended financial
facilities to Algeria to the tune of 131 million dollars,
representing 75 percent of Algeria's paid quota in convertible
currency.
</P>
<P>
The facilities were extended under an agreement concluded in
Abu Dhabi Wednesday. It was signed on behalf of the Arab Fund by
its chairman and general manager Dr Jassem Al Manaa, and for
Algeria by governor of the Bank of Algeria Abdul Wahab Karman.
</P>
<P>
The loan is aimed at consolidating a reform program initiated
by the Algerian authorities in the financial and banking sectors
during 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
By extending this loan, the Fund will have provided Algeria
with six loans whose total value amounts to 756 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- Iraq has called upon the United Nations to cease
deducting money from the revenues specified by the memorandum of
understanding, better known as oil-for-food program, in favor of
those harmed by the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
A message to this effect was addressed by Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohamed Saeed Al Sahaf to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan. Underscoring that the program was termed "oil-for-food "
rather than "oil for compensations", he said payment of
indemnities negatively has affected the humanitarian needs of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food and medicine accord, signed by Iraq and United
Nations, was enforced as from January 1996. It allows Iraq to sell
oil to 5.2 billion dollars every six months for the purchase of
food, medical supplies and other basic needs. Part of the oil
revenues are regularly deducted to compensate those harmed by the
Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese banks' interest rates covering both loans
and deposits are set to be cut by 1 percent following a decision
by the Banks Association in Lebanon, the Daily Star reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The association said Wednesday that the move was aimed at
helping the government cut interest rates on Lebanese pounds
and treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
The association suggested that all of its member banks
lower the charge on dollar loans to 9 percent and reduce
the interest paid to depositors to a maximum of 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) has granted 90 million U.S. dollars to
support sanitation schemes in Alexandria, Egypt, Governor of
Alexandria Abdel Sallam el-Mahgoub said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The grant will be used to expand plants to treat waste water in
the Mediterranean port city, 210 kilometers northwest of Cairo,
el-Mahgoub told reporters after a meeting with a USAID working
group.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported in the day
the U.S. agency has also agreed to offer 2.6 million dollars
to a training course for irrigation engineers and farmers in
preserving water.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources will
organize a two-week training course and a three-month field
training course aimed at increasing awareness of preserving water
resources and protecting water against pollution.

<HEADLINE> Over 20,000 Meningitis Cases Registered in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Sudan saw an outbreak of meningitis
with the total number of contractors hitting 21,337, of whom 1,513
died since the first week of last December.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of the Sudanese Health Ministry Prof. Bashir
Ibrahim told reporters that the recurrence rate of the epidemic
was low in the western Darfour province and high in other
provinces such as Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis first showed up in the two provinces of the White
Nile and the Northern. And a medical team, including
representatives of the Dutch Embassy in Khartoum has been sent to
assess the situation in the two areas, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization has provided 3 million dosages of
meningitis vaccine to the affected-areas, Ibrahim added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also trained medical personnel in the provinces of
the White River, Al-Gazira, Greater Kardafan, Sanar and the Blue
Nile.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross appealed earlier
this week for providing vaccines to Sudan's highly-populated urban
and rural areas, saying that up to 20 million people in the
country were waiting for vaccination.

<HEADLINE> No Political Stability Without Land: Zimbabwean Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's senior government official
said here Thursday that political stability and economic
development in the country remain under threat as long as the land
resettlement program is not fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Willard Chiwewe, chairman of the Task Force on Land in the
National Economic Consultative Forum, said poverty eradication in
rural areas remained a dream and the donor community had a moral
obligation to speed up the land resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
Chiwewe, who is also senior secretary of the Ministry of
Information, Post and Telecommunications, said this at a policy
seminar for senior diplomatic and local staff of embassies and aid
agencies.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had prepared and adopted a project
document covering the inception of the second phase of the land
reform and resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
"The stage we have now reached requires the mobilization of the
 government and donor finance, the refinement of alternative
models of land acquisition and resettlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, there would be a joint meeting on a
later date between selected donors, the government and
representatives of private stakeholders to map the way forward.
</P>
<P>
The international donors conference which was held last
September had set the stage for greater international
understanding and support for Zimbabwe's future land policies and
programs, Chiwewe noted.
</P>
<P>
However, some international financial lending institutions had
been delaying financial credit support to Zimbabwe, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has so far designated about 841
farms, of which 321 have been published in the government gazette
as acquired for resettlement.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Hails U.S. Productivity Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said Thursday the performance of U.S. economy over the
past seven years is "truly phenomenal", but warned that the global
recovery from a severe financial crisis remains fragile.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to an international banking conference in Chicago,
Greenspan said productivity (output per hour of work) had clearly
risen recently and he credited large investments being made in
computers and other high-tech products of the information age.
</P>
<P>
He said it is this increase in productivity that has allowed
the economy to grow as rapidly as it has in the past few years
without fostering higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's speech represented the most thorough view presented
so far by the Fed in a debate among economists over what has been
responsible for the extraordinary performance of the U.S. economy.
The economy has survived the global financial turmoil and
continued to expand at a strong clip without inflation.
</P>
<P>
But Greenspan also pointed out that the gains in productivity
cannot keep inflation at bay forever. He warned that the nation's
longest peacetime expansion will be threatened at some point down
the road by the tight labor markets.
</P>
<P>
He disagreed with some economists' claim of a new economic era
in U.S. saying "I have experienced far too many alleged new eras
in my lifetime that have come and gone".
</P>
<P>
U.S. productivity, which had been barely increasing at a weak 1
percent annual rate in the early 1990s, has been rising at close
to a 3 percent rate over the past year.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said while some of this may be a temporary upturn, he
believes the overall rise reflects the strong investments
businesses have been making in recent years, due to low interest
rates, in new computers and other productivity-enhancing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Fed policy-makers will have to remain alert to address
imbalances in the economy, the most significant being the tight
labor markets, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
"As I have said on previous occasions, there are imbalances in
our expansion that, unless redressed, will bring this long run of
strong growth and low inflation to a close," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At some point, labor market conditions can become so tight
that the rise in nominal wages will start increasingly outpacing
the gains in labor productivity," Greenspan added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the world economic situation, Greenspan said while
there were signs that the crisis countries in Asia were beginning
to recover, but the recovery "though real, remains fragile."
</P>
<P>
"With a little backing and filling, the emerging-nation crises
of the last two years are likely to gradually dissipate and these
countries should move onto a significant recovery path," he said.

<HEADLINE> Genocide Allegations Directed at Top Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan prime minister's office
continued to be plagued by mounting allegations of involvement in
the 1994 genocide levelled against its top officials.
</P>
<P>
After allegations directed against Prime Minister Pierre
Celestin Rwigema himself, the arrest and trial of his former
director of cabinet, Antoine Bizimana, on genocide charges, and
the arrest of his personal secretary Martin Sibomana, the
newly-appointed Secretary-General Celestin Kabanda is reportedly
faced with similar charges, the Rwanda News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
''We were disappointed at hearing that the cabinet appointed
Kabanda at that very sensitive post,'' one member of the prime
minister's party -- the Democratic Republican Movement -- who
asked not to be named, confided. ''It is as if no prior
investigation was made into his case,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Kabanda was appointed secretary-general in the prime minister's
office on April 23, 1999 by the cabinet meeting. He was
previously working in the Ministry of Agriculture. This post has
been vacant since last year following the death of Anastase
Nderebeza.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in Rwandan capital Kigali as well as in
Kibuye Prefecture alleged that Kabanda actively participated in
the 1994 genocide as a ring-leader, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
''This man cannot dare go back to his village,'' one source
told the news agency. ''He knows that everyone there knows about
what he did there in 1994,'' the source added.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the police in Kigali arrested Kabanda three
times for genocide charges but he was released thanks to the
intervention of some big shots, including former Gendarmerie Chief
of Staff Col. Deogratias Ndibwami, Rwigema himself, former Justice
Minister Faustin Nteziryayo, now in exile in North Carolina in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
This new development in the Prime Minister's Office has raised
many questions about why Rwigema always shows preference to such
people whose reputation has been tarnished by their alleged role
in the tragedy which befell Rwanda five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Allegations against Kabanda hit the streets of the capital
while his boss himself still struggles to clear himself up of
alleged participation in the genocide which were widely spread in
local and international media.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Rwigema was involved in distributing arms
to marauding Hutu gangs of killers in one of the capital's
neighborhood, Biryogo, and was drawing lists of Tutsis to kill.
</P>
<P>
Rwigema strongly rejected the accusations blaming them on his
political foes who want to assassinate him politically by
spreading such unfounded accusations.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Vice-President Major General Paul Kagame, recently
told reporters that when such accusations are levelled against
such a high- ranking official or any political leader of his
caliber, they ''must be taken seriously, and more so carefully.''
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no official confirmation, it is
reported that a case file has been opened about the alleged role
Rwigema might have played in the massacres in Biryogo.
</P>
<P>
As for his former director of Cabinet, the prosecution had
requested death penalty for his role in the massacres of over
20,000 Tutsis in his home commune of Mbazi, southern Butare,
between April and July of 1994. The final verdict is still
awaited.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to claims by the Prime Minister, Kabanda in person
acknowledged that his case file has been established by the Muhima
brigade, and that he was interrogated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
''It is not the first time these allegations are levelled,''
Kabanda said. ''I was asked about my participation in the
destruction of the Nyange Church.''

JOHANNESBURG, May 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Thursday welcomed
the agreements signed in New York Wednesday by the foreign
ministers of Indonesia and Portugal on the future of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government believes that the agreements,
concluded under the auspices of the United Nations
Secretary-General (Kofi Annan), will provide an appropriate
framework to address the needs of the people of East Timor," the
Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
South Africa expressed the hope that despite reports of renewed
violence in East Timor, the leaders of all parties will respect
the provisions of the agreements and urge their followers to act
with utmost restraint during this process of change.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria pledged that it will continue to support all the
efforts by Annan and his envoy to ensure a peaceful and lasting
resolution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, which had been a Portuguese colony, was occupied by
 Indonesia in 1975 and was formally annexed in the following year.
 But Jakarta's sovereignty over the territory is not recognized
internationally.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean State Enterprises Incur Huge Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's major public enterprises
incurred huge losses totalling 10.6 billion Zimbabwean dollars
(278 million U.S. dollars) during the 1997/98 fiscal year largely
due to mismanagement, inappropriate investment and the unfavorable
economic climate, the Treasury has said.
</P>
<P>
In a summary of the Public Enterprises' 1998 performance
released Thursday, the Treasury said the major contributors to the
losses were the National Oil Company, the Electricity Supply
Authority, the Cold Storage Company, the National Railways and the
Iron and Steel Company.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural Finance Corporation was the only major
government-owned enterprise to make a profit of 50.5 million
Zimbabwean dollars (1.3 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is under the second phase of its economic reforms
dubbed the Zimbabwe Program for Economic and Social
Transformation.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury said a number of achievements had been made in the
 implementation of the program launched last year.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the government was progressing with the
establishment of the Revenue Authority meant to increase revenue
collection and improve on administrative efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to trim the size of the civil service and thus reduce
the wage bill were continuing although the actual size remained
high due to need of personnel in sectors such as health, education
and specialized fields.
</P>
<P>
The civil service rationalization exercise was expected to
continue with 6,000 posts abolished by December, 1999, according
to the Treasury.

<HEADLINE> Protestors Closely Watch NATO Activities in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Anti-war protestors in the northern
Greek port city of Thessaloniki are now closely watching the
activities of NATO vehicles heading for neighboring Macedonia and
ready to block the port's gates at any movement.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) Thursday quoted an
anti-war committee member as saying that they had groups of
monitors watching the gates of the port and in the case of NATO
activity, they would immediately inform members of the committee
and the local Communist Party branch to set up a blockade.
</P>
<P>
Continued NATO bombing against Yugoslavia and civilian
casualties would only serve to harden the stance of the committee
against NATO forces using Thessaloniki as a vital landing and
transit point for any operations in the neighboring country,
committee member and municipal councillor Agapios Sahinis said.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 vehicles, including armored tanks and supply
containers, as well as hundreds of soldiers, are reportedly
waiting to head out of Thessaloniki to NATO operations in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials were reported to be concerned about the
increasing frequency of protests and obstruction of NATO work
despite the fact that the largest part of the NATO force
originally planned for Macedonia are already in place.
</P>
<P>
In another port city of Piraeus, near Athens, three foreign
banks, the American-based Chase Manhattan bank, the British-based
Midland bank and the French-based Banque Nationale de Paris were
attacked by anti-tank rockets shortly after midnight Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Slams NATO Air Strikes as Being "Genocidal" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia, which has accused
the U.S.-led NATO of mounting "genocidal" air strikes, said the
destructive power of the explosives so far used was equal to that
of about nine Hiroshima-type atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the U.N. Security Council
circulated on Thursday, Vladslav Jovanovic, charge d'affairs of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations, said NATO used
"special bombs" on May 2 to attack power plants and transmission
stations, blacking out hospitals, water supply systems, food
stores and bakeries.
</P>
<P>
"The air strikes were aimed at destroying the power grid of
the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They constitute unprecedented crimes, genocidal in nature, as
they target the entire population of Yugoslavia and are aimed at
provoking shortages of food and other essential provisions which
would cause widespread famine and, eventually, a humanitarian
catastrophe of unseen proportions," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
In another open letter to all agricultures and specialized
agencies in agricultural field, Yugoslav Agriculture Minister
Nedeljko Sipovac said his country had been the target of "11,000
tons of most destructive explosive."
</P>
<P>
This was "on average more than a kilogram (2.2 pounds) per
citizen, which equates to the destructive power of about nine
atomic bombs launched on Hiroshima," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sipovac, whose letter was also sent to ministers of
agriculture and specialized governmental agencies in other
countries, said that "by daily planned bombing NATO has caused
(an) ecological catastrophe, not only on the territory of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but on the territories of all
Balkan, Danube Basin, Mediterranean and European countries as
well."
</P>
<P>
He cited what he said were attacks on chemical plants and
fertilizer factories, use of ammunition containing depleted
uranium, and the "burning of vast quantities of oil, gasoline,
crude oil, asphalt, tyres and other materials at high
temperatures."
</P>
<P>
He said the pollution "permanently endangers the flora and
fauna of the river basins of the Black Sea, the Adriatic Sea, the
Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea."
</P>
<P>
The NATO air strikes, which entered the seventh week Thursday,
has created a large exodus of refugees from Kosovo, a Serbian
province, and huge damages to civilian facilities, including
civilian residence.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Keen on Iraq's Unity, Integrity: Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Thursday expressed the league's keenness on Iraq's
national unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Iraqi Justice
Minister Shabib al-Maliki, Abdel-Meguid said the league is opposed
to any attempt to interfere in Iraq's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League rejects the so-called no-fly zones in the north
and south of Iraq as "lacking in international legitimacy," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain set up the no-fly zones to
allegedly protect the ethnic Kurdish minorities in the north and
the Shiite Muslims in the south of Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War,
which drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The league is "in continued contact with" the United Nations,
its chief Kofi Annan and the Security Council president on the
necessity to end the sufferings of the Iraqi people, Abdel-Meguid
said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi people are in dire need of food and medicine after
nearly nine years under U.N. economic sanctions imposed in 1990
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The league is closely following the contacts and discussions in
the U.N. Security Council on the reports by the U.N. committees on
Iraq, especially the humanitarian committee in which the league is
participating, Abdel-Meguid said.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Lawyers Appeal Against UK Extradition Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers acting for former Chilean
dictator Augusto Pinochet on Thursday launched a legal challenge
to the British Home Secretary's decision to allow extradition
proceedings against him.
</P>
<P>
The retired general's legal team went to the High Court to
lodge an application for a judicial review of Home Secretary Jack
Straw's authorization of extradition proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that after very careful consideration we have
today lodged an application for permission to apply for judicial
review of the Home Secretary's decision," Pinochet's solicitor
Michael Caplan said after filing papers at the High Court.
</P>
<P>
"I have informed both the home secretary and the government of
Spain. We are anxious for the application to be considered as
soon as is convenient to the court," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he would not discuss the grounds on which the lawyers will
appeal his case.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, was arrested in London last October at the
request of Spanish judges who are seeking to try him for crimes
including torture and genocide relating to his 1973-1990 rule in
Chile.
</P>
<P>
Spain will be represented at a later hearing that will
determine if the judicial review will be allowed. If it is
granted, it is likely to go ahead within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
In March, a seven-man panel of the Law Lords -- the UK's
highest court -- reduced the number of charges General Pinochet
would have to face.
</P>
<P>
They argued that only crimes allegedly committed after the UK
signed an international convention on torture in 1988 could be
tried.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet remains under armed guard at a rented mansion on the
exclusive Wentworth estate in the suburb of London while the
latest moves are made in this highly complex legal battle.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts expected that Pinochet's appeal would focus on
whether Straw had properly considered all factors in the case,
including the time which had elapsed since the alleged offenses as
well as the appeals by Chile for Pinochet to be returned home.
</P>
<P>
They also expected Pinochet's lawyers to question whether Straw
had properly considered the offenses attributed to Pinochet and
the views of Britain's top court, the Law Lords.
</P>
<P>
With all of the legal wrangling, no date for extradition
proceedings has been set.

<HEADLINE> Australian Bestseller Published in Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Embassy here held a
ceremony this evening to mark the publication of the Chinese
version of the Australian bestseller A Fortunate Life by Albert
Facey.
</P>
<P>
It is the story of an ordinary Australian man who is tested by
many adversities in life. At the age of two, Facey lost his father,
and his mother had deserted him later. He started work at eight on
the rough West Australian frontier, struggled as an itinerant
rural worker, survived the gore of Gallipoli, the loss of his farm
in the Depression, the death of his son in World War II and of his
beloved wife after 60 devoted years.
</P>
<P>
Facey was one of those rare individuals who embraced life to
its fullest. Every experience, no matter how bad, was always
enriching. His guiding star was hope.
</P>
<P>
When Facey finally wrote his autobiography, he concluded, "I
have been very fortunate and I am thrilled by it when I look back.
"
</P>
<P>
Facey, who had no formal education, taught himself to read and
write. He made the first notes on his life soon after World War I.
Then, after retirement, at the suggestion and with the support of
his wife, Facey wrote his stories in book form.
</P>
<P>
The book was published in 1981, winning Facey great fame. The
unschooled, octogenarian kitchen-table writer died in 1982, aged
88, nine months after A Fortunate Life had been published to wide
acclaim.
</P>
<P>
So far, it has sold more than 500,000 copies worldwide.

<HEADLINE> China Values Ties with Madagascar: Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- China values its friendship and
cooperation with Madagascar, and is keen to work with Madagascar
to develop a long-term, equal, mutually beneficial and
comprehensive relationship into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao made this remark in a meeting
with Madagascar's Foreign Minister Lila Ratsifandriamanana.
</P>
<P>
He said that both peoples have a deep and traditional
friendship, and pointed to the fact that bilateral relations have
been developing well since the establishment of diplomatic ties 27
years ago, although the international situation and their
respective domestic situations have undergone great changes.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also maintained frequent high-level
exchanges of visits, and they have pursued gratifying cooperation
in a variety of areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that China appreciated and thanked Madagascar's
government for its adherence to the "One China Policy", and the
abolition of its "Special Arrangement" with Taiwan, as well as its
consistent support in the U.N. Conference on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-president also spoke highly of Madagascar's
domestic and foreign policies. He said that he appreciated the
efforts made by Madagascar's government and people, under the
leadership of President Didier Ratsiraka, to maintain national
stability, develop the national economy and promote regional
cooperation, as well as its increasingly important role in
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ratsifandriamanana said that during her China visit, she had
seen for herself China's achievements in its economic construction
and the country's splendid cultural heritage. She added that the
two countries have a deep friendship, and that bilateral ties have
been developing rapidly and smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The visitor praised the bilateral relations highly, and thanked
China for its support and assistance for Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
She said that the two countries share the same views on many
international issues, including the Kosovo issue, human rights,
and the issue concerning respect for sovereignty and non-
interference in others' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Madagascar firmly supported China at the U.N. Conference
on Human Rights held last month, she added, and expressed that
hope that the cooperation and friendship between the two
governments and peoples will continue to grow.

<HEADLINE> S. Somali Town Council Resigned Amid Speculations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The permanent committee for the
district council of Merca Town, southern Somalia, Wednesday
resigned amid speculations, making the situation there uncertain.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that an administration of some sort
voluntarily steps down in the war-torn east African country. Merca
Town is the regional capital of Lower Shabelle region controlled
by faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aideed.
</P>
<P>
According to the members of the council, their resignation has
nothing to do with the arrival of the Oromo ethnic military
personnel who arrived in Merca Town, a natural port about 100 km
south of Mogadishu, Tuesday on a ship together with their arms.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of this mysterious ship shook the town and southern
Somalia as a whole. Reports speculated that the Eritrean
government is supporting Aideed in an extension of Eritrea's
year-long border conflict with its Horn of Africa neighbor
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Port officials said that the ship chartered by the Eritrean
government for Somalia is transporting between 500 and 700
military personnel mainly Oromo ethnic Ethiopians and quite a few
Eritrean officials.
</P>
<P>
The ship is also reportedly carrying over 40 anti-aircraft
heavy machine guns, about four armed personnel carriers, more than
80 other kinds of heavy machine guns, in addition to thousands of
assault rifles mainly AK- 47s and a large consignment of
ammunition for those guns together with their spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The heavy weapons aboard the ship are yet to be off-loaded, but
some food was off-loaded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an unusual meeting of the district council Wednesday, the
nine-member permanent committee forwarded their unanimous and
collective resignation from their official duties they held on
behalf of the people in the region in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
In a three-page document issued at the conclusion of the
meeting, the local authority of the port town of Merca said they
have seriously reconsidered the political, security and public
matters in the town.
</P>
<P>
In the document which was also made available for the press,
the committee said their resignation was prompted by the
increasing unemployment after the natural port of the town had
stopped 95 percent of its operations for the prevailing
circumstances in the town.
</P>
<P>
The increasing insecurity which they said is further raging and
the tax collected from the business centers, markets and shops
which never return back to the development of the town are among
the matters which forced the local authority to step down.
</P>
<P>
The use of the gun and organized crimes which are rampant
throughout the region have also forced the local authority to
reconsider their public duties and turn the responsibility back to
the people of Merca to elect again their own and appropriate
non-clan-based leaders to tackle their problems.
</P>
<P>
All nine members including their chairman, Sherif Abdurahman
Ahmed Dhegaweyneh, have signed the document.
</P>
<P>
Among the embarrassing issues forcing the local authority to
step down include the killing and robbing against the civilians on
the public transport buses from Merca Town toward the capital, and
the recent departure of the international aid workers from the
region due to insecurity.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Blood Agency May Reject Donors Who Visited U.K. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Blood Service (CBS) said
Thursday it may stop accepting blood donations from people who
have traveled to the United Kingdom because they could have been
exposed to a fatal brain disease.
</P>
<P>
The CBS wants to avoid blood donations contaminated with new
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- the human equivalent of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as mad-cow disease --
that may be transmissible through blood.
</P>
<P>
Ian Mumford, vice-president of communications for the CBS,
confirmed there was likely to be some sort of deferral of donors,
but the agency will seek advice from the public before it makes a
decision on which donors will no longer be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, about 598,000 Canadians visited Britain. A new
survey by the CBS found that 22 percent of the Canadian Blood
Service's donors have traveled to the U.K. since 1980, the period
where they would have been at risk of getting Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, at least 40 people have contracted new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from eating tainted beef, as has one
person in France. But there has never been a confirmed case of the
disease in North America.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be aired publicly Thursday when the National
Blood Safety Council, an advisory body to federal Health Minister
Allan Rock, begins a two-day public forum in Vancouver on
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the blood system. Officials from
the blood agencies and experts from Canada, Britain and the U.S.
will discuss how to formulate an appropriate safeguard.
</P>
<P>
Canada would become the first country in the world to institute
a ban on donors who have been to the U.K..

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets South African President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua)-- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), today expressed
satisfaction over the development of relations between China and
South Africa, and the conviction that President Nelson Mandela's
current visit will further promote ties.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the visiting South African president, Li said
since the establishment of diplomatic relations early last year,
bilateral ties have grown smoothly, high-level contacts have been
frequent, and the momentum for cooperation in various fields has
been sound.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
Chinese government and people have always sympathized with and
firmly supported the South African people's struggle for racial
equality and national liberation, and fostered a deep friendship
with the African National Congress and other liberation
organizations, he noted, adding that Chinese leaders of different
generations have all paid special attention to relations with
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Li said that since the end of the 2nd session of the Ninth NPC,
Chinese leaders have paid visits to some European, American, and
Asian countries, and sent a message worldwide that China is firmly
devoted to the causes of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to further consolidate relations with South
Africa and other African countries, and develop friendship with
all countries, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-
existence, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li said that contacts between the NPC and the South African
National Assembly have been increasing. Last year, he received
Frene Ginwala, speaker of the South African National Assembly, in
Beijing, and they reached a common understanding on expanding
cooperation. He said China welcomes more parliamentarians from
South Africa to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Mandela expressed thanks for China's past selfless support for
South Africa in its struggle for racial equality and national
liberation. He agreed with Li that bilateral relations have
progressed greatly since the establishment of diplomatic ties,
saying this has brought about benefits to both sides.
</P>
<P>
He said his current visit is successful, and expressed the hope
that it will raise bilateral ties to a new level.
</P>
<P>
The two also exchanged views on the African situation and other
issues of common concern.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Hong Kong people who had
attempted to smuggle diesel oil into neighboring Guangdong
Province were each sentenced to one year's imprisonment and fined
120,000 yuan here today by the Guangzhou Intermediate People's
Court.
</P>
<P>
Cheung Kin-hai, captain of the "Lotus Mountain" tanker, which
is owned by Hong Kong's New World Shipping Co., and Chan Long-fei,
a crew member on the boat, were found guilty of smuggling 314.7
tons of diesel oil, from which they gained 58,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
They were caught by officers of the Panyu Customs in the
province, when the illegal transaction was being done, January 6.
The police confiscated the cargo and the illicit money.
</P>
<P>
A court source reported that the criminals would have evaded
112,000 yuan in tariffs, if the plot had been successful. The
special anti-smuggling squad was set up January 8, and this was
the first case it had handled.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Safeguard Donor Aid to Health Sector: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Health Minister Jackson
Kalweo has pledged that his government will safeguard donor aid
to the health sector reform program at all cost.
</P>
<P>
Opening a donors' group meeting at the World Health
Organization office here Wednesday, Kalweo noted that his
government greatly valued donor contributions to the health sector
and would not want to see the assistance halted due to
misunderstanding, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied press reports that relations between his
ministry and some of donors were sour.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a recent report that a Danish donor had
withdrawn a 600-million-shilling assistance to the health sector
reform program following the ministry's failure to satisfy all set
conditions.
</P>
<P>
While re-affirming his commitment to strengthening the
existing cordial relations with the development partners, Kalweo
urged key donors to the health sector reform program to be more
open and frank and to raise any issues relating to the program to
his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The spread of HIV/AIDS pandemic, Kalweo observed, has become
one of the most different health challenges facing the country
today as the AIDS patients consume 50 percent of the resources
available.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that a National AIDS Council will be
established by December this year to fight and control the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, Kalweo added, previously confined to a few parts of
Kenya, is now widespread throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Africa's Growth Prospects Better in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) said here Thursday that Africa's
economic growth prospects in 1999 would be better than in 1998 and
forecasted that Africa's growth rate would increase to four
percent from 3.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The "Economic Report on Africa in 1999" issued by the ECA said
the 3.3 percent growth rate in Africa last year, compared with 2.9
percent growth in 1997, was the highest among regions of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"For the fourth consecutive year, gross domestic product (GDP)
in Africa grew faster than population, contrasting markedly with a
decade and a half of declining per capita income," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
On performance at sub-regional level, the report said North
Africa doubled its growth rate from 2.1 percent in 1997 to 4.4
percent last year, while central African countries improved their
performance to 4.9 percent last year from 4.0 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"In the remaining three (regions), there was definite
deceleration in growth momentum," the report said, adding that
West Africa declined from 4. 1 percent to 3.6 percent, East Africa
from 2.8 percent to 2.5 percent and Southern Africa from 2.5
percent to 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
For sub-Saharan Africa, recovery was robust, at 2.6 percent,
from two percent in 1997, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Africa's 11 oil-exporting countries
obtained their 3.7 percent growth rate in 1998, compared with 3.6
percent in 1997, while 42 non-oil exporting countries increased
their growth rate from 2.3 percent in 1997 to 2.9 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The 33 least developed countries in Africa continued to
increase and deepen their growth momentum and they managed to
boost their growth to 4.1 percent in 1998 compared with 2.4
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Africa's agriculture grew by 3.5 percent compared with 1.7
percent of the previous period while industrial sector grew by 3.2
percent in 1998, down from 3.8 from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Africa's export revenue declined by 17 percent, down to 95.6
billion U.S. dollars in 1998. "For the first time in the decade
of the 1990s, the trade balance turned negative, boosting the
current account deficit to a high of 16.5 billion U.S. dollars,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Resource flows into Africa declined to three billion U.S.
dollars from 4. 5 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 as the result of
reduced private flows and bilateral credit, the report said. For
sub-Saharan African countries net transfers declined by nearly 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Africa's total debt was 350.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 and
the debt service at the same period was 35.7 billion dollars,
raising the debt service ratio to nearly 31 percent of goods and
service exports in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"If Africa is to reduce poverty by half over the next decade
and half, it would need to attain and sustain an average growth
rate of seven percent per annum," the report said, adding "this is
the major challenge for African policy-makers and their
development partners."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Trade Account Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's trade account
deteriorated by 4.3 percent to a deficit of 91.8 million U.S.
dollars during March, compared with 88 million recorded in the
previous month, the central bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration was contributed by a significant decrease in
export earnings which went down by 14.1 percent, despite a
1.8-percent decrease in imports, the Bank of Tanzania said in the
April issue of its monthly economic review .
</P>
<P>
The decrease in export earnings was mainly due to a fall in
export volumes as well as decline in export unit prices. Earnings
from traditional sector decreased by 15.2 percent while
non-traditional export earnings increased by 12.2 percent over the
review period.
</P>
<P>
Decreases in export unit prices of cotton, sisal, tea, tobacco
and cashew nut and decreases in export volume of coffee, tobacco
and cashew nut caused the decline in traditional export earnings.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the bank said Tanzania's annual
inflation rate increased slightly by 0.1 percent compared with the
rate recorded in February this year.
</P>
<P>
The latest national food supply statistics indicate that a
shortage of 585,000 tons of grain emerged in the first half of
this year, due to inadequate short rains experienced in most parts
of the country since last October.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's external debt has
risen to approximately 8.3 billion U.S. dollars, the central bank
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total debt committed at the end of March this year stood at
8.295 billion U.S. dollars, representing an increase of 4.7
percent when compared with 7.923 billion U.S. dollars registered

</P>
<P>
Out of the total amount, disbursed outstanding debt was 6.836
billion U. S. dollars while committed undisbursed debt was 1.459
billion U.S. dollars, the Bank said in the April issue of its
monthly economic review.
</P>
<P>
When the disbursed outstanding debt is classified by economic
sectors, it reveals that for the period ending March this year,
25.9 percent of the debt was disbursed in the form of balance of
payments support, while transport &AMP; telecommunications and
agriculture received 20.1 percent and 14 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Energy &AMP; mining received 12 percent, followed by industries
which absorbed 7.7 percent of the debt.
</P>
<P>
Social welfare and education, finance and insurance and tourism
received 4.2 percent, 3.2 percent and 1.2 percent of the debt,
respectively. The remaining 11.7 percent of the debt was absorbed
by other sectors.
</P>
<P>
In March of 1999, new loans amounting to 10.2 million U.S.
dollars were contracted. During the same period, disbursements
amounted to 13.1 million U.S. dollars, while actual debt service
amounted to 20.6 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Number of U.S. Jobless Claims Rises Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of first applications
for unemployment benefits increased slightly last week after two
consecutive weekly declines.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported Thursday that 301,000 people
filed for jobless benefits, an increase of 6,000 from the previous
week.
</P>
<P>
In the previous week, the benefit applications had dipped below
the 300,000 level to 295,000. From late January through mid-March,
the weekly applications number remained below 300,000 for a nine
week stretch, the longest period since 1973.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday's jobless claims report showed that a four-week
moving average for claims was essentially unchanged at 307,000,
compared to 307,500 the previous week.
</P>
<P>
In state-by-state data which lags the national figures by one
week, the Labor Department said 35 states and territories had
decreases in claims for the week ending April 24, and 17 had
declines with one reporting no change.
</P>
<P>
The largest increase in unemployment claims was in
Massachusetts, a rise of 4,639, reflecting increased layoffs in
service industries; Rhode Island, an increase of 1,161 because of
higher layoffs in service industries and manufacturing.

WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- At least four people were killed
as a line of powerful tornadoes blew through the west of the U.S.
state of Tennessee early Thursday, damaging buildings in 30
counties.
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims, a man and woman, died in Linden City when
their home was destroyed by winds. A 14-year-old girl, who had
been missing since Wednesday night, was found early Thursday and
taken to a hospital where she died upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
The fourth person was killed when his car hit a tree that had
been blown down across the highway in Madison County.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified number of injuries were reported in Tennessee.
Funnel clouds were spotted in eight counties.
</P>
<P>
Nashville International Airport was closed for a time because
of the winds. Two people received minor injuries due to flying
debris and about 30 small planes in a hangar were damaged, airport
officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the counties reported scattered power outages, downed
trees and torn-off house roofs and some damaged buildings. Near
Nashville City, several campers at a trailer park were injured.

<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern met in Downing Street on
Thursday, opening a new round of Northern Ireland negotiations on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers met with key party leaders of the province in
fresh efforts to end the political stalemate over arms
decommissioning in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Ulster Unionists, the Social Democratic and
Labor Party (SDLP) and Sinn Fein were scheduled throughout
Thursday to have their own sessions with Blair and Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts by the leaders of the two countries, government
officials did not believe that the talks would deliver a
breakthrough on the issue of paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
"There's no new blueprint on the table, but there are a number
of ideas around that we want to tease out and discuss with the
parties," said a Downing Street spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"There are well known difficulties but there's a determination
to move this forward," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party, led by Northern Ireland First
Minister David Trimble, has refused to sit with Sinn Fein in
government unless the IRA first begins to dispose of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein and the IRA have refused to surrender their arms,
arguing that handing over weapons was not a precondition of the
peace agreement for Sinn Fein to join the cabinet.

LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Thursday that Ibrahim
Rugova, the moderate ethnic Albanian leader in the Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, would visit London as soon as next week.

<P>
Rugova, who arrived in Rome on Wednesday after reports that he

by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, Defense Secretary George
Robertson told reporters.

"The foreign secretary invited Mr Rugova to visit London soon

early as next week," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said Rugova expressed his gratitude for British and
NATO support and hoped to return to Kosovo soon.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia,
Britain repeatedly alleged that Rugova might had been killed by
Serbs and later said he had been under house-arrest in Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Mainland City, Macao Company End Debt Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The city government of Jingzhou in
central China's Hubei Province and the Macao-based Keymon
International have ended their three-year-old debt dispute through
intermediation by China's Supreme People's Court, according to
official sources.
</P>
<P>
The concerned parties in Jingzhou have paid back 2.6 million U.
S. dollars to the Macao investor, while the overseas lender has
donated five million RMB yuan to the city.
</P>
<P>
Observers here urge local governments at all levels to learn a
lesson from the case, so as to promote the building of China's
market economy, especially at a time when China is eager for early
entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
In July 1991, the leader of a synthetics project in Shashi,
which was later merged with Jingzhou City, based on the former
Jingzhou Prefecture, borrowed 2.05 million British pounds and 20.
50 million Deutsche Marks from the Macao company with an
irreversible guarantee issued by the city government.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the debtor factory began to return the money gradually.
However, it failed to repay the whole debt, due to financial
problems caused by market fluctuations. By June 1996, the two
parties confirmed that the synthetics producer still had to repay
the remaining sum of 2.6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The creditor then brought a lawsuit against the city government,
the city finance bureau and the synthetics company.
</P>
<P>
The dispute aroused due to the different legal systems in Macao
and the Chinese mainland. In Macao, the government is eligible to
secure business deals, while in the mainland, governments are not
allowed to provide guarantee for the borrowing of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Both plaintiff and defendant, who also differed on the amount
of money the government had guaranteed, appealed to the Supreme
Court, when they received the ruling of the higher court of Hubei.
</P>
<P>
They finally reached an agreement in February this year, under
which the city government is obliged to supervise the problem and
help the synthetics manufacturer to repay the amount outstanding.

MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Distributes Nearly 500,000 Tons of Food in 9 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
distributed 497,000 tons of food grains under the vulnerable group
feeding (VGF) program among flood victims across the country
during the past nine months, the official BSS news agency reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The food grains distribution through VGF cards began shortly
after the devastating floods that started to strike the country in
July last year, Press Secretary to the Prime Minister Jawadul
Karim said in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In view of the huge losses of crops due to the two-month-long
flood, the government embarked upon a massive VGF card
distribution program and distributed 400,000 cards in October
1998, with another 200,000 cards added in November the same year,
he said.
</P>
<P>
About 30 million people in 53 of the country's 64 districts
were affected by the prolonged flood, inflicting an estimated loss
of 4.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, each card holding family was given eight
kilograms of rice and eight kilograms of wheat each month till
November, and five kilograms of rice and 15 kilograms of wheat
from December to April this year except the month of January,
according to Karim.
</P>
<P>
The distribution and implementation of VGF cards were made
through three committees, comprising people's representatives,
government officials and representatives from non-government
organizations, with members of parliament as advisers, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the VGF program, the government also sanctioned
195,000 tons of wheat under the Food for Work Program for the
post-flood rehabilitation activities, he added.

<P>
Bonn May 6 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of the Group of
Eight (G-8), seven western industrialized countries and Russia,
ended their talks Thursday at Petersburg near Bonn with a five-
point statement, including seven "general principles" on a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers agreed that Yugoslavia should withdraw
from Kosovo its military, police and paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
They also called for establishment of an interim administration
for Kosovo to be decided by the U.N. Security Council to ensure
peaceful and normal life for all inhabitants there.
</P>
<P>
An effective international civil and security presence,
endorsed and adopted by the United Nations, should be deployed in
Kosovo to guarantee the achievement of the common objectives, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers urged a political process to be initiated towards
the establishment of an interim political framework providing for
substantial self-government for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo self-governing process must take full account of the
Rambouillet accords and the principles of sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and the other countries of the
region.
</P>
<P>
And the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army should be demilitarized,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Other principles include: the safe and free return of all
refugees and displaced persons and unimpeded access to Kosovo by
humanitarian aid organizations, a comprehensive approach to the
economic development and stabilization of the crisis-torn region.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Safeguard Donor Aid to Health Sector: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Health Minister Jackson
Kalweo has pledged that his government will safeguard donor aid
to the health sector reform program at all cost.
</P>
<P>
Opening a donors' group meeting at the World Health
Organization office here Wednesday, Kalweo noted that his
government greatly valued donor contributions to the health sector
and would not want to see the assistance halted due to
misunderstanding, the East African Standard newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied press reports that relations between his
ministry and some of donors were sour.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a recent report that a Danish donor had
withdrawn a 600-million-shilling assistance to the health sector
reform program following the ministry's failure to satisfy all set
conditions.
</P>
<P>
While re-affirming his commitment to strengthening the
existing cordial relations with the development partners, Kalweo
urged key donors to the health sector reform program to be more
open and frank and to raise any issues relating to the program to
his ministry.
</P>
<P>
The spread of HIV/AIDS pandemic, Kalweo observed, has become
one of the most different health challenges facing the country
today as the AIDS patients consume 50 percent of the resources
available.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that a National AIDS Council will be
established by December this year to fight and control the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Malaria, Kalweo added, previously confined to a few parts of
Kenya, is now widespread throughout the country.

<HEADLINE> NATO Air Strikes Create Ecological Catastrophe in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- An open letter from Belgrade
said that the NATO air strikes, which has entered its seventh week
Thursday, has created "irrecoverable" ecological catastrophe in
Yugoslavia in addition to the growing death tolls of civilians.
</P>
<P>
The letter, distributed here on Thursday, is addressed to the
ministers of agriculture and specialized government agencies in
agricultural field by Nedelijko Sipovac, Yugoslav minister of
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"By everyday planned bombing, NATO has caused ecological
catastrophe not only on the territory of FRY (the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia), but on the territories of all Balkan, Danube
basin, Mediterranean and European countries as well," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
"On a densely inhabited continent such as Europe is, where
ecological balance is rather sensitive, one of the basic world
postulates, the postulate of ecological right, proclaimed in Rio
de Janeiro in 1992, has been annulled," said the letter, made
public here via the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"FRY has become one of the war polygons of NATO alliance, on
which are, unfortunately, being measured all technological war
accomplishments," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"This is confirmed by the fact that on this country has been
launched 11,000 tons of most destructive explosive or in average
more than a kilogram per citizen, which equates to the destructive
power of about 9 atomic bombs launched on Hiroshima," Japan, the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Those damages are irrecoverable and those losses irreparable.
The biological diversity is not the property of the state or
nation on whose territory they can be found, and none of the
generations of humans have the exclusive right to enjoy them," the
letter said, "Such type of ecological losses affects THE WHOLE
REGION OR THE WHOLE OF THE THIRD WORLD."
</P>
<P>
Every country that bases its development on agriculture,
energetics and industry has on its territory stored smaller or
bigger quantities of materials that are aggressive to human health
or environment, the damage of which can cause extremely dangerous
consequences of wide range, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all of this, NATO is carrying out planned bombing of
chemical plants intended for civil purposes, and bombing of
these is causing direct ecological catastrophe," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
"By aiming at plants for production of artificial fertilizers
the complex increase of concentration of toxic material of
ammonia, chlorine and phosgene has been ascertained, and it is
well known that those were used as war gases during World War I,"
said the letter. "The result of those dangerous materials,
especially heavy metals, is also 'the black rain' that recently
fell over Pancevo, and which very soon will be falling over
Europe."
</P>
<P>
"The increased measured level of radioactivity is the result of
usages of bullets with impoverished uranium and it causes the
disastrous degradation of nature and seriously endangers the human
health of present and future generations," said the letter. "It
also causes the extreme ecological endangerment of living nature
and natural mechanisms for self protection and self generation."
</P>
<P>
"The damage caused to ozone layer will have strong consequences
to human kind, plant and animal world of the whole planet earth,
since it is well known that the damages do not occur only on the
area of activity," the letter said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Start Probe of Successive Satellite Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force said Thursday
that it will convene a special review of the recent string of
failed Titan IV rocket launches that have set back its space
satellite programs.
</P>
<P>
The review is expected to be done jointly with the National
Reconnaissance Office, which operates the government's military
and intelligence satellite programs, acting Air Force Secretary
Whitten Peters said.
</P>
<P>
It will recommend changes in practices and procedures to
"assure continued access to space for the Defense Department,"
Peters added.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a Titan IV rocket left a military communications
satellite in an orbit thousands of kilometers too low. And on
April 9, a missile-warning satellite ended up in a useless orbit
following its launch aboard a Titan IV, which is built by Lockheed
Martin Corp. A Titan IV also failed in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Renewed Commitment Required to Eradicate Polio by 2000: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Renewed efforts are needed to meet the
goal of polio eradication in the South-East Asia Region by the
year 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite remarkable progress made by all its 10 member countries
in the region, four countries have to accelerate efforts to ensure
that the region is polio-free by the end of the century, according
to a press release from the WHO Regional Office for South-East
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The WHO, which is leading the international efforts to
eradicate polio by the year 2000, concluded the sixth annual
meeting of the Technical Consultative Group TCG) of the South-East
Asia Region on vaccine preventable diseases here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number of reported polio cases in the region decreased from
25,711 cases in 1987 to 2,268 in 1998, and Indonesia, Myanmar and
Thailand, after making remarkable achievement in controlling
vaccine-preventable diseases, have joined other polio-free
countries of the region: Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka, the
release said.
</P>
<P>
Only four countries - Bangladesh, the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), India and Nepal - in the region remain
polio-endemic.
</P>
<P>
The TCG recommended that the four countries should plan and
conduct "mopping-up campaigns" to reach every child along with
National Immunization Days and sub-National Immunization Days to
ensure all children are protected.
</P>
<P>
"Bangladesh, the DPRK, India and Nepal need to implement
expansive house-to-house, door-to-door, boat-to-boat polio
immunization campaigns in the remaining areas where polio virus
continue to persist," the release said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the four countries are on track to meet the
December 31, 2000 deadline, the TCG will meet in a mini-session in
September this year to review polio eradication progress in these
countries.
</P>
<P>
Critical to the eradication process is detection of cases of
acute flaccid paralysis, a symptom of polio, and essential to
polio eradication is a good surveillance system, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The South-East Asia Region accounts to more than half the
world's cases of polio each year, with most the cases from India,
followed by Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> UK Bank Keeps Interest Rates Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England has decided to
keep interest rates at 5.25 percent despite calls from
manufacturers to lower them.
</P>
<P>
On making its decision the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee
referred to "encouraging signs of recovery" Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is only the second time in the past eight months the
committee has pegged the level of rates amid expectations that the
current cycle of rate reduction is at or near an end.
</P>
<P>
The decision was hardly a shock as a majority of economists and
analysts had been predicting no change.
</P>
<P>
Although this hold on the interest rates is disappointing news
for British manufacturing, which had lobbied for a cut, the Bank
expects sterling to weaken from its "present high level".
</P>
<P>
The Bank says: "If sterling were not to weaken as assumed,
there might.... need to be further easing of interest rates in
order to keep inflation on track to meet the 2.5 percent target."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Calls for Political, Peaceful Settlement for Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Ambassador to the United
Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG) has urged NATO to stop aggression
against his country in order to reach a political and peaceful
settlement for the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The most important precondition to settle all political issues
in Kosovo and Metohija and to resolve humanitarian problems is
halting NATO aggression, destruction and killing of people," said
Branko Brankovic at a press conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the lasting commitment of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to reach a political, peaceful settlement for the
crisis in Kosovo and Metohija," the Yugoslav ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that direct talks with equal participation of
representatives of all national communities are the direct way of
achieving a broad autonomy, with the April 28 joint statement by
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and Ibrahim Rugova as an
example.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the operations of the Yugoslav military forces in
Kosovo, Brankovic said, "As long as NATO continues its aggression
it is the duty and responsibility of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia to engage as many forces as needed for the defense of
the country, just as any other country in the same circumstances
would do."
</P>
<P>
However, he added, after the aggression stops and NATO forces
withdraw from Yugoslav borders, Yugoslavia will establish peace-
time level of deployment of its forces in Kosovo and Metohija.
</P>
<P>
On the issues of the safe return of refugees and displaced
Yugoslav citizens, Brankovic said that his country has already
several times publicly appealed for their return. "For the time
being, the only obstacle to their return is the continuous NATO
bombardments," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As for an international presence in Kosovo and Metohija, the
Yugoslav ambassador said that the Yugoslav government is ready to
receive a UN-led mission but its structure and mandate shall have
its prior agreement.
</P>
<P>
Brankovic reaffirmed that Yugoslavia "will not accept to be
imposed on any solutions, interests and strategies which may put
Yugoslavia into the status of someone's colony or protectorate."

<HEADLINE> Ministers Meet on Financing Africa's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A joint conference of African
ministers of finance, economic development and planning opened
Thursday here at the United Nations Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
This conference, the first joint meeting organized by the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) since its
structural reform in 1997, is taking place against the background
of a number of important developments that pose serious challenges
to financing Africa's economic and social development and thereby
alleviating poverty on the continent.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
said Africans today are at a very critical juncture in their
history and the challenges Africans face are complex and the task
they face to ensure sustainable development is indeed herculean.
</P>
<P>
"Our prospects for development hinge on our ability to mobilize
 resources for that task, and on our ability to make that
mobilization sustainable," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Africa's debt burden, Meles said "obviously the debt burden
of Africa which has now reached over 350 billion U.S. dollars and
representing a debt stock to export ratio of well over 300
percent, is by consensus beyond debt sustainability."
</P>
<P>
ECA Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako recalled that the 1995
World Summit for Social Development ratified the plan to reduce
poverty in Africa by half by the year 2015, which requires a four
percent reduction in the number of people living in poverty each
year.
</P>
<P>
To reduce poverty by half by the year 2015, an average growth
rate of seven percent per year is required, he said, adding the
growth rate requires an investment rate equal to 33 percent of
gross domestic product, which in turn needs 15 percent of domestic
savings and nine percent of official development assistance.
</P>
<P>
Vijay S. Makhan, Assistant Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), said official development
assistance has fallen for six consecutive years, from 0.33 percent
of the combined gross national product (GNP) of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)--Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) donors in 1992 to 0.22 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is now less than one third of the agreed U.N. target of
0.7 percent of the GNP, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 participants, including ministers of finance,
ministers of economic planning and development and governors of
national banks, from 53 African countries as well as
representatives from U.N. agencies, inter- governmental and
bilateral partners sectors are attending the three-day meeting
which will focus on challenges of financing African development.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE Trades 192BN Pounds Per Day In April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, MAY 6 (Xinhua) -- The nominal value of contracts traded
on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(LIFFE) averaged 192 billion pounds daily during April, down 14
percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Total outstanding business in all Euro money market contracts
at the end of April exceeded 2,300 billion euros, LIFFE announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Although April saw quieter trading conditions generally, open
interest in LIFFE's Three Month Euribor contracts has grown for
the fourth consecutive month, with a 14 percent increase over
March.
</P>
<P>
Hugh Freedberg, LIFFE's Chief Executive, said "LIFFE's share of
exchange-traded Euribor market volume remains at 87 percent."
</P>
<P>
"This shows that LIFFE continues to provide its customers with
the best market for euro-denominated money market products," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Open interest, a good indicator of liquidity and long-term use
of the market, stood at 6,510,795 contracts, valued at 2,738
billion pounds on 30 April 1999, LIFFE said.

<HEADLINE> Fischer: Negotiations Still Needed After G8 Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 6 (Xinhua) -- More negotiations will be needed after
the foreign ministers of seven leading western industrial
countries and Russia have passed a joint statement of general
principles aiming at solving the Kosovo crisis, German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement, which marked the first time that Moscow and the
Western agreed on a common policy on Kosovo, came amid diverging
views between the two parts, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"That's why we give you principles instead of the text for the
U.N. Security Council resolution," he said at a press conference
at Petersberg near Bonn after the G8 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The statement did not mention the NATO, instead it called for
deployment of "an international civil and security presence
endorsed and adopted by the United Nations" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But the Western stressed the NATO would have to play a main
role.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the "security
presence" in the satement meant "a strong military force with NATO
at its core".
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said only the NATO could
ensure the credibility and the implementation of the principles.
</P>
<P>
"It (the principles) must have teeth and those teeth will need
to be supplied by the NATO," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear whether Yugoslavia will accept the
principles, which need to be converted into a U.N. Security
Council resolution. But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Belgrade would give green light for the plan.
</P>
<P>
Other ministers attending Thursday's meeting came from France,
Italy, Canada and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Main Parties Racing for Premiership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Just about 10 days before the
general elections begin, the two main political parties in Israel
are maneuvering for the race.
</P>
<P>
There was growing feeling in the opposition Labor Party that
the race for premiership would be concluded in the first round of
elections scheduled for May 17, according to a report of Israel
Radio on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the ruling Likud Party also said that they were
expecting a decisive win in the first round.
</P>
<P>
A second round of voting will be held in early June if none of
the candidates for the premiership can get over 50 percent of the
votes in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The hope for a one-round voting emerged after a recent public
opinion poll showed that the supporting rate for the Center Party
leader Yitzhak Mordechai continued to drop.
</P>
<P>
The poll, published on Tuesday night, showed Mordechai would
win only 7 percent of the votes in the first round, compared to 12
percent in the last survey.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Labor
leader Barak, according to the poll, would get more than 35
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Following the poll, the Labor Party has called for Mordechai to
join forces with it, in hope that Mordechai's supporters would
turn to Barak in the elections and the race for the premiership
would be able to finish in the first round.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, local analysts said that since a majority of
the newly-established Center Party had been traditionally Likud
supporters before Mordechai left Likud early this year,
Mordechai's drop in the race for the premiership might strengthen
Netanyahu's chance for winning.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Mordechai has insisted that he would not withdraw
from the race.
</P>
<P>
But senior officials of the Center Party told local daily
Haaretz on Thursday that if signs showed in the next few days that
Mordechai's pulling out of the race would not hurt his party's race
for the Knesset (parliament), a serious discussion of a withdrawal
scenario would be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli Interior Minister Eli Suissa
Thursday apologized for his remarks on the Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The minister, member of the right-wing Shas Party, said on a
TV campaign on Wednesday night that Shas and the Interior
Ministry are keeping the country from being overrun by call girls
and church-goers from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The remarks drew sharp criticism from the Yisrael Baaliya Party,
which mainly presents the interests of the Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The apology was made only after Netanyahu mediated between the
two parties on Thursday. Netanyahu reportedly is trying to get the
support of both Shas and Yisrael Baaliya in the coming elections.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Sign Initiative on Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Seven African ministers signed an
initiative on water supply and management with the United Nations
Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) and the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) here Thursday, in a bid to address the
looming water crisis in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are from Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya,
Senegal, South Africa and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony, Klaus Toepfer, acting executive
director of Habitat and executive director of UNEP, announced that
he would soon set up an annual award for best practices in urban
water resource management.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer revealed that he was considering to appoint Goodwill
Ambassadors for Water in African Cities who could take the message
of conserving water for the urban poor to all parts of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is the first of its kind to help African
countries in managing the growing urban water crisis and protect
the continent's threatened water resources and aquatic systems
from the increasing volume of land-based pollution.
</P>
<P>
The project is a follow-up to the Cape Town Declaration in
1997, adopted by African ministers to address the urgent need for
managing water for African cities. It is also a joint initiative
of the Habitat and the UNEP within the framework of the U.N.
system-wide Special Initiative on Africa.
</P>
<P>
The project will be implemented in collaboration with the
ministers of water resources, environment and urban development in
the participating countries.
</P>
<P>
Other agencies involved in the project include the Water Supply
and Sanitation Collaborative Council, the Southern African
Development Community and the Water Utility Partnership for
Capacity Building in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be funded by the German government
and the United Nations Foundation for International Partnerships.
</P>
<P>
The on-going 17th session of the Habitat Commission on Human
Settlements is focusing mainly on the revitalization of the
Habitat, work program and budget for the biennium 2000-2001,
security of tenure for all residents in cities.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Bill to Protect Americans' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly
adopted Thursday a bill aimed at protecting consumers' privacy by
making it a federal crime for anyone to misrepresent himself to
obtain someone's private financial data.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 95-2 for the amendment to sweeping legislation the
Senate is considering that would let banks, securities firms and
insurance companies get more deeply into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
The amendment takes aim at the practice of pretext calling, in
which people call employees at banks and other businesses and use
Social Security numbers to get information about bank accounts and
other financial data.
</P>
<P>
"Americans have become increasingly concerned about the issue"
of privacy, said Senator Paul Sarbanes of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The vote came a day after the Senate, in a setback for the
Clinton administration, defeated an amendment that would have

<HEADLINE> Fresh Round of N.Ireland Talks Achieve Little Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Little progress has been made in the
latest talks in London aimed at ending the stalemate in the
Northern Ireland peace process, a Downing Street spokesman said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there was no prospect of a quick
breakthrough in negotiations involving Prime Minister Tony Blair,
his Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern and key party leaders of the
province.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the Ulster Unionists, Social Democratic and
Labor Party and Sinn Fein arrived later on Thursday for their own
sessions with Blair and Ahern.
</P>
<P>
As talks continued into the afternoon, a Northern Ireland
Office spokesman said the atmosphere was "low key".
</P>
<P>
He added: "The essential issues, the essential elements don't
change. It's a question of looking at different ways of bringing
things together. It's not for us to say 'this is the only way'.
</P>
<P>
Despite the continuing impasse Downing Street has stressed
there is "no question" of parking the Good Friday Agreement, which
provides for a power-sharing executive to be set up in the
province.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party, led by Northern Ireland First
Minister David Trimble, has refused to sit with Sinn Fein in
government unless the IRA first begins to dispose of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein has maintained publicly and privately that they
cannot deliver any IRA gesture on arms.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Welcomes Pacts on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council on
Thursday welcomed the agreements signed between Indonesia and
Portugal on East Timor and gave its support to Secretary-General
Kofi Annan in his efforts to solve the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the council support the decision of the
Secretary-General to dispatch United Nations staff to East Timor
as soon as possible to assist in the implementation of the
agreements," said the council's May president Denis Dangue Rewaka
of Gabon.
</P>
<P>
The accords signed on Wednesday include East Timor's autonomy
package and security arrangements and procedures for a
U.N.-organized poll to determine the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
If a popular consultation results in the approval of the
autonomy by a majority of the East Timorese, Indonesia would
initiate the constitutional measures for the implementation of the
autonomy framework.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, on its part, would initiate the procedures for the
removal of East Timor from the list of Non-Self-Governing
Territories, now numbering 17 in the world, and the deletion of
the question of East Timor from the U.N. agenda.
</P>
<P>
If the majority rejects the proposed autonomy, Indonesia would
take the constitutional steps to terminate its links with East
Timor and restore the status the territory held prior to 1976.
</P>
<P>
Then Indonesia and Portugal would make arrangements for a
peaceful and orderly transfer of authority in East Timor to the
U.N. which would initiate a process enabling it to begin a
transition towards independence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of 800,000 and an area of more
than 18,800 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until
1975 when a civil rift induced Indonesian occupation. In 1976
Indonesia annexed it and the U.N. has since been seeking a
solution to the question.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council Wednesday, Annan said the
U.N. will face logistical and other problems in carrying out the
consultation process in a short time-frame between now and the
poll on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Annan has emphasized the need for the parties to put the main
security elements in place, which include bringing armed civilian
groups under strict control and prompt arrest and prosecution of
those who incite or threaten to use violence.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Continue Use of Land Mines: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Deputy Foreign Minister,
Toko Serrao said here Thursday that Angola, which is still locked
in a civil war, will continue to use anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
Serrao made the remarks at the on-going meeting of the
signatory states of the convention on the prohibition of the use,
storage, production and transference of anti-personnel land mines
being held in Maputo, capital of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Serrao is the first Angolan senior official to make a speech at
the meeting which started on May 3.
</P>
<P>
Angolan government has been criticized these days for not
observing the land mine prohibition convention, which the Angolan
government signed on December 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
A report titled "Toward a Mine-free World Monitor Report 1999"
said that both the government and the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had used anti-personnel land
mines after they were thrown into renewed civil war in late1998.
</P>
<P>
An investigator with an international mines prohibition
campaign even said new land mine zones had cropped up in eastern
Angola's Luena district, and that the local government prevented
any move of clearing land mines in the area.
</P>
<P>
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does
not produce or export land mines, it said they have found, in
Angola, about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from
over 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
It is said that one out of 415 Angolans has been a victim of
land mine in this southern African country with a population of 12
million.
</P>
<P>
Angola, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
Namibia are the four countries which suffer most from land mines
in the southern African region.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 people were killed by land mines and another
500,000 injured by them in this region in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The land mine prohibition meeting, which has attracted about
1,000 representatives from 72 countries and organizations
including the United Nations, will come to a close Friday.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Strives for Free Trade Area by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has been urged to double its efforts in
ensuring that all programs are on course if it has to achieve a
free trade area by October 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Minister of Communications and Transport David Saviye
said all key programs on regional integration should be fully
implemented so that the regional grouping could achieve a free
trade area next year.
</P>
<P>
Saviye was speaking at the opening of the second consultative
meeting on Advance Cargo Information System (ACIS) in Lusaka
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said programs like ACIS should be fully implemented because
it would provide service providers and users with online
information to enable them to conduct their businesses in a more
efficient and cost effective manner.
</P>
<P>
Saviye also called for the full participation of all
transporters in the ACIS program so as to promote efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same meeting, COMESA Secretary General Erastus
Mwencha said the ACIS program has had positive impact on railway
transport where it had been implemented.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to train users of ACIS so that the
program could be sustainable.
</P>
<P>
ACIS can only be an effective management tool if all parties
fulfill their obligations toward ensuring that each transport
operator, each user and each country will have access to
information they need, he added.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Pool Resources on Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending the joint 33rd
World Tourism Organization (WTO) and 24th Africa Travel
Association (ATA) meeting in Accra Thursday stressed the need for
African countries to pool resources in order to make an impact on
the global tourism market.
</P>
<P>
 Delegates said that African states must also harmonize travel
 regulations and expedite action on conventions that facilitate
international travel "if they want to get their fair share of the
ever- growing lucrative tourism industry", the Ghana News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
 Delegates were deliberating on the theme "Access Africa:
tearing down the barriers to travel" at the five-day conference
being attended by more than 1,500 participants, including African
ministers of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The joint conference, the first of its kind, is under the
theme "Africa: tourism destination for the next millennium".
</P>
<P>
Delegates maintained that poor infrastructure and institutional
 facilities, coupled with conflicts on parts of the continent,
have rendered tourism development efforts insignificant.
</P>
<P>
They listed poor transportation network and travel formalities,
 numerous check points on roads, coupled with harassment by
customs officers, bureaucracy, poor marketing procedures and
political instability, as major obstacles to tourism development
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Ousmane N'Diaye, WTO Representative for Africa, said it is
important for African countries to form national committees on
resolving travel problems.
</P>
<P>
N'Diaye, who projected that Africa would by 2020 get 75
million tourist arrivals, said national travel and tour
operators must also cooperate and plan joint packages to enhance
regional tourism.

WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- A computer problem at the air
traffic control center on Long Island in New York State of the
United States delayed departures from Newark and LaGuardia
airports Thursday morning, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The traffic control center lost power in one of its main
computers, forcing a switch to a backup system, said U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) spokesman Jim Peters.
</P>
<P>
The Move prompted controllers to increase the separation
between departing flights from 16 to 32 kilometers, creating
delays of up to 45 minutes for each flight.
</P>
<P>
The problem was fixed in about 45 minutes, but flights out of
Newark were still being delayed as of mid-morning, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, computer problems at the main air traffic control
center for O'Hare International and Midway airports in Chicago in
Illinois State caused numerous flight delays and cancellations for
passengers traveling into and out of the city.

<HEADLINE> Sunflower Cultivation Becomes Popular in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The cultivation of sunflower as one of
the oil seed crops has become increasingly popular among
Bangladeshi farmers with the growing demand for edible oil.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture experts said that sunflower farming was less risky
because it could stand adverse weather condition and could be sown
and cultivated in winter as well as in summer.
</P>
<P>
The sunflower could be harvested after 90 to 100 days only from
the date of sowing the seeds and only four kilograms of seeds were
required for one acres, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As Bangladesh has to import more than half of the edible oil
consumed in the country each year, sunflower cultivation has a
bright prospects, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In Nawabganj and Madaripur districts, northwest and southwest
of here respectively, sunflower cultivation has become visibly
popular, with an increasing number of farmers bringing more and
more acres of land under sunflower cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Sunflower was cultivated in about 30 acres of land in each of
the districts, according to local agriculture officials.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh produces only about 200,000 tons of edible oil a
year, far short of the country's domestic needs, according to the

<HEADLINE> Guinea-Bissau Controled by Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Rebels seemed to be in control of
the west African country of Guinea-Bissau Friday after troops
loyal to President Joao Bernardo Vieira surrendered, according to
Portugal's Lusa News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier Humberto Gomes, Vieira's army commander, announced
that surrender, saying in a brief statement that he wanted to
avoid further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
"Taking account of the deteriorating situation and the
interests of the country, and that enough human life has been
sacrificed, the chiefs of staff of the armed forces, forces loyal
to the republic, declare their surrender," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement was handed to the military representative of
Portugal, the country's former colonial power, for delivery to
rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
The president's army had laid down their arms in the capital
Bissau just hours after fierce fighting broke out Thursday night,
shattering a six- month truce since a peace deal was signed in the
Nigerian capital of Abuja in November, a Lusa report from Bissau
said.
</P>
<P>
Rebels, led by former army chief Ansumane Mane, have controlled
most of the country, one of Africa's poorest, soon after the
revolt first erupted on June 7 last year.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Sees Economic Rebound Starting This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Friday he expects a strong economic rebound beginning this
year as a result of increased agricultural output, rising exports
and investments.
</P>
<P>
In his speech before the National Export Congress, Estrada
urged the export sector to support his administration's pro-poor
thrusts by creating more jobs and giving the poor in the
countryside a better life.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports grew 15 percent to 7.85 billion U.S.
dollars in the first quarter this year compared to 6.82 billion
U.S. dollars in the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the Philippines last year surged 17 percent to 29.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy that our export performance continues to rally
growth for the country. All throughout the crisis since the second
half of 1997, we maintained healthy, double-digit export growth
rates," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Estrada cited the observation of an
International Monetary Fund team that the country's agriculture
will grow by 2.6 percent to 3.4 percent this year to 2004 and that
the Philippines will be among the first to recover fully from the
regional economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The same team has projected that with the recovery in
agriculture, improved investments and the rebound in industrial
activity, the Philippine economy would be able to grow by 5.2
percent to 5.8 percent in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"There is so much expectation for an economic rebound to start
this year," he told exporters as he lauded the Department of
Trade and Industry and the private business sector for coming up
with an export master plan for 1999-2004.
</P>
<P>
Estrada approved the Philippine Export Development Plan, a
strategy that calls for sustained export growth in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
The plan, according to Estrada, will bring the benefits of the
export sector not only to a few Metro Manila-based businessmen but
also to the poor in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada announced "decisive" government actions to
help the export sector cushion the impact of the prevailing Asian
currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Among these measures are easing the guidelines to make the
5-billion-peso (125 million U.S. dollars) special financing
program more accessible to small and medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government will also explore the possibility of giving the
private sector access to low-interest funds, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Rises by 4.3 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate rose
by 4.3 percent in April as the number of lost manufacturing jobs
reached 402,000, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the April unemployment rate was only
slightly higher than the 29-year-low of 4.2 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. unemployment rate has been at or below 4.5 percent for
the past 12 months, the best showing in three decades, despite the
troubles being suffered by manufacturers and farmers.
</P>
<P>
Job creation actually accelerated sharply in April as the
losses in manufacturing were more than offset by big gains in
service sector, where 131,000 new jobs were created.
</P>
<P>
In all, payroll jobs shot up 234,000 in April after inching up
only by 7,000 jobs in March, which had been the weakest monthly
increase in more than three years.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey of
households, rose in April because the number of people entering
the work force looking for employment grew more rapidly than the
rise in the number of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings increased by three cents to 13.11
dollars in April. The length of the average working week rose to
34.5 hours from 34.4 in March.
</P>
<P>
The weakness in manufacturing included a drop of 7,000 jobs
because of a strike in ship building. Other manufacturing
industries shedding jobs last month included aviation, industrial
machinery, textiles and fabricated metals such as steel.
</P>
<P>
Jobs in mining fell by another 6,000 last month, reflecting
primarily cutbacks in oil and gas drilling.

<P>
BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai army will undertake
restructuring process, which is aimed at achieving its goals amid
the changing world situation, Army Commander-in-Chief General
Surayudh Chulanond said here Friday.
</P>

years with military personnel and major divisions being
maintained.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring process would automatically help reduce army
forces by 46,000 over the next eight years, from 236,000 at
present to 190,000 in 2007.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Bundestag, lower
parliamentary chamber, Friday in Bonn passed with overwhelming
majority a bill to deploy 1,000 more soldiers in Macedonia and
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Among the voting legislators, 566 were in favor with 43 against
and 7 abstained.
</P>
<P>
At present Germany has 3,300 soldiers stationed in Macedonia,
with further 850 to be deployed there in coming weeks. The
parliament bill will strengthen Germany's military presence in
Balkan region to over 5,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's cabinet members said the additional troops would be
"strictly limited to" take part in humanitarian actions to help
the refugees in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Without military support, the humanitarian organizations can
not cope with the emergent situation in the region, said Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 parliamentary members from the Greens Party and
the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) said civil organizations
should play a more important role in helping the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Support from the military division will hurt the civil
character of humanitarian aid, the legislators said.

</P>
<P>
The Dien Bien Phu victory crowned the 1953-1954 Winter-Spring

Commenting on the strong position of the United States and the
United Kingdom against Myanmar, he recalled that Myanmar had
maintained cordial relations with both of them previously, saying
that these relations cooled down since 1988.
</P>
<P>
He denied that it was Myanmar's doing since the country has
always desired good relations with them.
</P>
<P>
He said that Myanmar is fully aware of the importance of the
two countries in the world today, admitting that with their
cooperation in terms of development and technology, Myanmar shall
be able to march towards its goal for progress and modernization
at a much more rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, he said, Myanmar has done its best to promote
good relations with these countries.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he complained, the two countries have adopted a
very
negative attitude against Myanmar allegedly because of their
political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with economic relations between France and Myanmar,
Khin Nyunt stated that the two countries have benefited from
fruitful cooperation in the economic sphere, while enjoying
friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar believes and hopes, he noted, that France will have a
better understanding and appreciation of the challenges Myanmar
faces and will work together with Myanmar in overcoming the
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, he said, is satisfied with the progress of the
economic activities of the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Srdja Bozovic, chairman of the
Republics Chamber of the Yugoslav parliament, on Friday said he
would write a letter to the European Commission, urging NATO to
stop the bombing against his country.
</P>
<P>
Bozovic, who is on a visit to Ukraine, said that he hoped
Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman Alexandr Tkachenko would join
him in submitting the letter.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis should be solved through peaceful means, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Bozovic also pointed out that NATO's attack on Yugoslavia from
March 24 had seriously violated the charter of the United Nations
and some elementary requirements of the international law. The
Yugoslav people had no choice but to defend their motherland.
</P>
<P>
NATO's military action, which came under the excuse of
preventing humanitarian disaster in Kosovo, had resulted in more
casualties of civilians and refugees, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far, NATO's bombing has killed 1,200 people, injured more
than 5,000 and damaged 25 bridges, 23 transmitters and over 50
industrial structures. In addition, more than 500,000 people lost
their jobs due to the air strikes, Bozovic said.

SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A local businessman has been

The stiff sentence is seen as part of the country's campaign to
crack down on rampant fraud in this field.

Two local companies were ordered by the court in the Baoshan

Since 1996, Zhuang Guohua, chairman of the board and general
manager of a village-based business firm, had collaborated with

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Rift with Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has denied
reports that it has any rift with Rwanda on the way to resolve the
armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued Friday, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs described the New Vision and Monitor (newspapers) reports
about the rift and Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa's
reconciliation efforts as groundless and therefore misleading.
</P>
<P>
"Both newspapers reduced the purpose of the mini-summit in
Dodoma to an attempt by President Benjamin Mkapa to resolve a rift
between Uganda and Rwanda over their military campaign in the
Democratic Republic of Congo," said the release.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry wishes to clarify that the Dodoma meeting was
part and parcel of the Lusaka process. It was a follow-up to the
Sirte meeting that was held recently in Libya," it added.
</P>
<P>
The summit in Dodoma, Tanzania, was convened to enable the
neighbors to enhance the peace process for the DRC and therefore
it was not an effort by Tanzania to reconcile Rwanda and Uganda
which enjoy cordial bilateral relations, the press release noted.
</P>
<P>
It appealed to the media to cross check information of this
nature before publication in order to avoid such erroneous
reports.
</P>
<P>
New Vision and Monitor, the two leading dailies in this capital
city, said Wednesday that the summit in Dodoma was an effort by
Mkapa to bridge the gap between Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
They said that the countries' position on the war in the DRC is
now at variance. Rwanda would like to march on to Kinshasa if they
can while Kampala wants to pull out because the situation at home
is not favorable.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have deployed many troops in the eastern part
of DRC to allegedly guard against their borders. DRC President
Laurent Kabila said they were aggressors.

<HEADLINE> African Economies Grow in 1998 As World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- K.Y. Amoako, Executive Secretary
of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), said
Friday that while the growth of world economy slowed from four
percent in 1997 to two percent in 1998, Africa's economies
actually expanded from a growth of 2.9 percent in 1997 to 3.3
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going three-day joint conference of African
ministers of finance, economic planning and development here in
the Ethiopian capital, Amoako said Africa has come out from being
the last among all regions in 1997 to the first in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In his "report on the economic and social situation in Africa"
to the conference, the ECA official said as international economic
results suffered since commodity prices declined, Africa's balance
of trade turned negative for the first time this decade because
export revenue declined by a full 17 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Private resource flows into Africa were off 33 percent from an
already low base, he said, adding that these negative factors in
1998's performance are a source of worry for 1999.
</P>
<P>
On Africa's income inequality, Amoako said in Africa, those in
the top 20 percent receive nearly ten times the income of those in
the bottom 20 percent. "Forty-four percent of African people live
below the poverty line and a large number live close-by," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently only 15 percent of Africans live in a national
economic environment considered adequate for sustainable growth
and development, he said, adding that "seven countries, with 27
percent of the population, have poor prospects for
sustainability".
</P>
<P>
The three-day joint conference, which has drawn some 500
participants from 53 African countries, will conclude Saturday.

<P>
YANGON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar authorities continued to
publish on Friday evening the content of a recent interview by
French reporter Delphine Evmoon of the Faits and Projets Magazine
with Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, first secretary
of the State Peace and Development Council.
</P>
<P>
This part of the interview, which deals with Myanmar's internal
affairs, was carried in an official "Information Sheet."
</P>
<P>
Asked why Myanmar refused to extradite Khun Sa, former drug
warlord, to the United States when he surrendered, Khin Nyunt said
that Khun Sa had made a pledge that he would not be involved in
narcotic drug activities in any way and abide the arrangements
made by the government.
</P>
<P>
"Now, he has totally given up his involvement in narcotics on
his own accord and is living (up) to the promises given to the
government, there exists no reason to extradite him to the U.S. to
be tried as a criminal," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Myanmar government's refusal to have dialogue with Aung
San Suu Kyi, general secretary of the opposition National League
for Democracy (NLD), he noted that he had initiated discussions in
August last year with U Aung Shwe, NLD chairman, for "confidence
building" between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He, however, complained that the NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi
insisted on including Aung San Suu Kyi at any meeting.
</P>
<P>
He accused the NLD of trying to create obstacles on the path to

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Increase Spending on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- African countries were urged
Friday to increase their budget on AIDS prevention activities.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Peter Piot, executive director of the
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) at the on-going
three-day joint conference of African ministers of finance,
economic planning and development which was opened here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Piot told participants that by one conservative estimate
one-quarter of the population of Africa, 150 million people, has
been personally affected by the epidemic. The nine most heavily
affected countries in the world are all in Africa.
</P>
<P>
At least nine million Africans have already died of AIDS, over
22 million Africans are currently living with HIV or AIDS, and
there are almost eight million African children under the age of
14 who have lost their mother or both parents to the AIDS
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Piot said, 3.5 million African adults were newly
infected with HIV and another half a million African children were
newly infected at birth because their mothers already carried the
HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, many in Africa and elsewhere still view AIDS
purely as a health problem. But in fact, it is much more than
this. AIDS is at the heart of the development agenda for Africa,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe today, he said, half of the in-patients in
hospitals are there because of AIDS-related illness and models
show that by 2005 AIDS treatment costs will be over 60 percent of
the Ministry of Health budget. "In Kenya by 2005 AIDS treatment
costs will be over 50 percent of the Ministry's budget," he added.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has conservatively estimated that countries with
high HIV prevalence will lose one percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) growth per capita annually.
</P>
<P>
A recent study found that in 1997, only 150 million U.S.
dollars a year was spent in African countries on AIDS prevention,
he said, adding "we are currently estimating that a billion
dollars or more needs to be devoted to AIDS programs in Africa, if
we are to come to grips with the epidemic."

<HEADLINE> 410 Kosovo Refugees Arrive in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Four hundred and ten Kosovo
refugees, the first group of about 4,000 to come to Australia from
Macedonia refugee camps, arrived in Australia's largest city
Sydney Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Among those greeting the refugees at Sydney International
Airport were Australian Prime Minister John Howard, his wife
Jeanette, Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock and his wife.
</P>
<P>
The 410 Kosovars comprise 216 males and 194 females, 27 under
the age of two and eight over 60.
</P>
<P>
Howard indicated that they will not be allowed to stay in
Australia permanently.
</P>
<P>
"It is our solemn wish that you will soon be returned to your
homeland," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister announced last month that Australia will
accept 4,000 Kosovo refugees on a three-month basis, while
stressing that the refugees will not be granted permanent resident
status.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were later taken by bus to Sydney's East Hills
Barracks, about 25 km southwest of the city, and are expected to
stay there for about four days before leaving for Brighton
Barracks on Tasmania, an island state located about 400 km south
off the Australian continent.

<HEADLINE> International Land Mine Conference Ends in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The five-day meeting which has has drawn about 1,200
participants from 102 countries and some international
organizations, referred the anti- personnel mines to an insidious
instrument of war and terror, and said in the declaration that
states parties to the convention agreed that the use of the mines
exacerbate tensions and impede diplomatic efforts to find peaceful
solutions to conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on international community for any
possible assistance, be it financial or technical, to end the use
of anti-personnel mines around the world, so as to alleviate the
humanitarian crisis caused by them.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mozambican Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao
who chaired the meeting told a press conference that he hoped all
United Nations members would become signatories of the Ottawa
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Ottawa Treaty was signed in December 1997 by 135 countries,
74 of which have ratified it. Its ambitious goal is to clear all
the mines on the earth, which is estimated to be over 300 million,
before the year 2009.
</P>
<P>
A report of the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines said
there are more than 100 million anti-personnel land mines planted
around the world, and that at least 108 countries are stocking
some 250 million anti- personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that more than 30 countries have
removed and destroyed 12 million such mines while 12 countries
have totally destroyed their land mine stocks.
</P>
<P>
Now, eight of the 12 big producers have signed on the Ottawa
convention on banning the use, stock, production and transfer of
anti-personnel land mines, said the report.

ISLAMABAD, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations plans to send a

WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Unites States and its allies reached agreement with
Russia on Thursday on a set of principles for resolving the Kosovo
conflict that include the key NATO demand for deployment of an
international military force there and an offer to Belgrade of
continued sovereignty over the province.
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that an
unexpected leap in technology is primarily responsible for the U.S.
"phenomenal" economic performance and the current extraordinary
combination of strong growth, high corporate profits and soaring
stock prices.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Thursday to spend
$13 billion for the NATO bombing campaign that it declined to
endorse days ago. Republicans also vowed to pour billions more
into the military, which they said the president has gutted.
</P>
<P>
-- House Republican leaders are so united behind Gov. George
Bush of Texas for the Presidential nomination that they already
began meeting informally with him to discuss a common agenda for
the 2000 elections. Bush has not yet formally declared his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that "
inflationary pressures could re-emerge, possibly faster than some
currently perceive" if technology-driven productivity gains slow
or employers continue to hire so readily.
</P>
<P>
-- Corporate Indonesia may finally be climbing out of its $72
billion debt hole as an 18-month impasse convinces more lenders
and borrowers that they will have to accept losses.

<HEADLINE> Hongkong Telecom to Develop Beyond Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Telecom will diversify
its businesses and explore opportunities beyond Hong Kong to meet
tougher competition in the future, the company's chief executive
Linus Cheung said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Hongkong Telecom will have no future if we remain to be a
telephone company," Cheung said at a press conference to announce
the company's final results for the year ended March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Telecom, Hong Kong's major full-service communications
provider, Friday reported a net profit of 11.50 billion HK dollars
(1.47 billion U.S. dollars), representing a 7.7 percent decrease
from that of the previous year (before exceptional items).
</P>
<P>
The company's future will also be dark if it is just a
telecommunications company, Cheung said. That's why Hongkong
Telecom aggressively adjusts itself to intensify development in
Internet and E-commerce and explore investment opportunities
beyond Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We are seizing the growth opportunities of the Internet and
investing in skills and capabilities to strengthen our position
and achieve a clear lead in Asia," Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
"We shall drive to capture growth from global Internet and data
through closer integration with Cable &AMP; Wireless on international
network sharing, traffic management and new service developments,"
Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
"This will ensure we get the benefit of global reach, scale and
early adoption of new technology -- all of which is essential to
enable Hongkong Telecom to remain competitive amongst global
players," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Telecom will have no future if it restrains itself
within Hong Kong, Cheung said. He said that he is ambitious to
play the "World Cup", not just the "Hong Kong League".
</P>
<P>
Cheung said that Hong Kong Telecom has a cooperation with China
Telecom and China's accession to the World Trade Organization will
bring fresh opportunities to the company.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has its own advantage in investing in China's
mainland including good reputation, modern technology and good
cooperative relations, Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
The company said Friday that its turnover decreased by 7.5
percent to 32.41 billion HK dollars (4.15 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, Hongkong Telecom chairman Brian
Smith said that 1998 has been a very difficult year for companies
operating in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"The weak economic environment in Hong Kong throughout the year
has dampened demand for basic telecommunications services," Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, Hongkong Telecom has faced intense price
competition, particularly in international telephone and mobile
services," he said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the board of directors remains confident of the
company's underlying strength and its longer term prospects and
has recommended a final dividend of 46.6 cents per share, making a
total of 85.2 cents for this financial year.
</P>
<P>
The company's international telecommunication services revenues
declined 18 percent to 15.56 billion HK dollars (1.99 billion U.S.
dollars) due to the economic downturn here.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Telecom signed an agreement with the government in
March 1998 to surrender its exclusive international license.
</P>
<P>
However, local telecommunication services revenues grew by 6
percent to 9.40 billion HK dollars (1.20 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The firm said its mobile services revenues were 3 percent lower
at 5.82 billion HK dollars (74.61 million U.S. dollars) as the
numbers of customers switching networks has increased.
</P>
<P>
The firm said revenues for its Internet and interactive
multimedia services increased 146 percent year-on-year to 626
million HK dollars (80.25 million U.S. dollars).

medicine. Some universities and institutes in Hong Kong have
offered courses on the traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
Local medical workers respond to Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa's call to try their best to turn Hong Kong into an
international center of traditional Chinese medicine, he said.

MADRID, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid president Lorenzo Sanz
confirmed here on Friday that he was trying to bring in Brazilian
and Inter Milan striker Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
"I am not promising anything but I am working on this," Sanz
said on the Spanish radio station Cadena Cope.
</P>
<P>
But he also admitted it was a very difficult operation and had
little chance of success.

<HEADLINE> China to Present Arts Academies Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Culture today
announced that it will organize the largest-ever joint performance
of young stars from the nation's arts academies later this month.
</P>
<P>
"The most outstanding students and young teachers from China's
13 most prestigious arts academies will display their talents to
the public during the performance week," Pan Zhenzhou, vice
minister of culture said at a press conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
From May 23 to 28, the ministry plans 12 performances at the
Century Theater, the Concert Hall in Zhongshan Park, the Chang'an
Theater, and the Central Drama Institute's Experimental Theater.
</P>
<P>
"Arts academies are the backbone of the state's artists and
have produced many elite performers who have received
international awards," Pan said.
</P>
<P>
He praised many arts academies, including the Central
Conservatory of Music, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the
Central Drama Institute, and the Shanghai Drama Institute, for
their achievements.
</P>
<P>
The CPAA Cultural Entertainment Company, the marketing
organizer for the performance, said that it will bring many young
and promising performers into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
Several word-renowned performing groups have invited Chinese
award-winners to join them in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Pan also underscored that the upcoming performance is one fruit
of the educational and structural reforms that have been carried
out within the academies. The 30 arts academies and schools in
China boast 13,000 teachers and more than 100,000 students.
</P>
<P>
State authorities this year decided to thoroughly restructure
the arts academies, and raised the average annual tuition fee to
10,000 yuan (1,200 U.S. dollars). However, youngsters dreaming of
stardom still strive to obtain a quality education there.

<HEADLINE> Candidates for Macao SAR Chief Unveil Platforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The two candidates for the office of
the first chief executive of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) announced here Friday their platforms, both promising
to uphold the principle of "one country, two systems" after
Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
"The 'one country, two systems' principle provides a solid
foundation for Macao's future development," candidate Edmund Ho
Hau Wah said at the second plenary meeting of the Selection
Committee for the first government of the Macao SAR here Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
To implement the principle of "one country, two systems," it is
necessary to adhere firmly to the Macao Basis Law, which provides
the constitutional basis for the establishment of the SAR, Ho told
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Any failure to adhere to the Macao Basic Law will seriously
affect Macao's future ... The practice of 'one country, two
systems' will have a profound and far-reaching effect on China, as
well as on Macao," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Ho said that, if elected, he would carefully study the problems
in Macao and formulate short-, mid- and long-term plans to address
them.
</P>
<P>
He said he would take measures to restore law and order in
Macao, noting that Macao has been affected by recurring crimes in
recent years and he is determined to fight crime and address the
issue of law and order thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
On the economic side, Ho said efforts should be made to boost
the major industries in Macao -- tourism and gambling, export and
processing trade, finance and real estate.
</P>
<P>
He also unveiled his plan to promote efficiency and fairness in
public administration, fight corruption to build a clean
government, enhance education and youth affairs, improve social
welfare and strengthen ethnic harmony, among other things.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Au Chong Kit, the other candidate, said at the same
meeting that the development of Macao in the future will depend on
the sense of mission of local residents under the prerequisite of
"one country, two systems," "Macao people governing Macao" and a
high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
It also hinges on the rule of law and a clean government, among
other things, Au said.
</P>
<P>
"In all the work I have participated to serve the Macao people,
I have never considered my personal glories and disgraces, gains
and losses. Instead, I have been concerned about the earnest
implementation of 'one country, two systems' and 'Macao people
governing Macao'," he told the Selection Committee members.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that the current social system and
life style in Macao will remain unchanged after its return to the
motherland on December 20 this year and this is a common
aspiration of the Macao people, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that, if elected, he would make efforts to reform the
gambling sector and raise the per capita income of the Macao
people through developing tourism, gambling, entertainment,
finance and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Au also voiced his concern about the public order in Macao and
stated his determination to combat underground gangs which vie for
interests from gambling.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebel Leader, ECOMOG Agree on Key </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean rebel leader Foday
Sankoh and the commander of the west African peace-keeping force
ECOMOG have agreed on a key condition for a cease-fire, Nigeria's
The Post Express newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh agreed that his Revolutionary United Front (RUF) would
"free up main highways", a key condition of a cease-fire, Togolese
President Gnassingbe Eyadema disclosed following a meeting with
the Sierra Leonean rebel leader and ECOMOG Commander General Felix
Mujakeruo in Lome Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah this week asked
the rebels to demonstrate their genuine desire for a cease-fire by
withdrawing from highways and the mainstay mining areas in the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh and Mujakperuo "embraced each another and then had
lunch," said Eyadema, Chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), which along with the United Nations, is
arranging peace talks between the Kabbah government and the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh and his field commanders have been meeting in Togolese
capital Lome since late last month to consult on strategy of
ending the eight-year conflict in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said they would produce a document outlining their
proposals at the weekend, and then hand it over to Togolese
authorities next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The head of a Sierra Leonean government delegation will then be
invited to Lome for peace talks with the rebels, a Togolese
official said, although no date was set for the possible meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh who was sentenced to death for treason last October was
released temporarily from prison nearly three weeks ago to meet
face-to-face with his followers in Togo for the first time in two
years after being arrested in Nigeria on arms charges.
</P>
<P>
The RUF launched its guerrilla war in 1991. Since then, more
than 20, 000 people have died and half of the country's population
has been uprooted.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Ruling Party Appoints Genocide Suspect as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front
(RPF) has appointed a new law-maker who is suspected to have been
involved in the 1994 genocide in his home prefecture of Cyangugu
in southwest Rwanda, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Elisee Bisengimana, 33, was designated last week by
Secretary-General of the ruling party Charles Murigande, as one of
the new candidates to replace its four law-makers who resigned.
</P>
<P>
Since February 1999, the Rwandan transitional assembly is
rocked by purges engineered by the forum of seven political
parties sharing power in the government.
</P>
<P>
Up to 16 parliamentarians have either resigned, or been
expelled from the assembly because of absenteeism, incompetence,
misconduct, genocide charges, or collaboration with Hutu
extremists.
</P>
<P>
Bisengimana is said to have been a ring-leader in the massacres
of Tutsis, judicial sources in Cyangugu said.
</P>
<P>
Genocide survivors in Cyangugu contacted by the RNA alleged
that Bisengimana was seen at a refugee camp at Gihundwe, drawing
the list of Tutsi males who were then rounded up and killed at a
local soccer stadium.
</P>
<P>
"We have not heard of such allegations," Tito Rutaremara, head
of RPF parliamentary group, said. "If you have enough evidence,
put it out before he swears in and benefits from immunity."
</P>
<P>
This nomination has provoked a wave of reaction from other
political parties who said that the RPF choice was betraying its
record of being a party which fought genocide and promised to rout
out impunity in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Many have expressed concern about how these appoitments to
senior government posts or in parliament are made. In some cases,
well-known genocide suspects who have been denounced by human
rights organizations occupy key positions in the civil
administration or in the military.

<P>
CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- An anti-terrorism pact signed by Arab
countries took effect on Friday, 30 days after seven of the
signatories have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
"The enforcement of the pact marks a key accomplishment of the
Arab states in facing up to terrorism," Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said in a statement issued in the day
for the event.
</P>
<P>
The pact can "thereby protect people's lives and safeguard

<P>
The landmark agreement, which was signed by Arab ministers of
justice and interior in April 1998, seeks cooperation among the
Arab countries in combating terrorism, including extradition of
terrorist suspects, exchange of information and denial of shelter
and support to terrorists.
</P>

LUSAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Wholesale prices of all petroleum

JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian government would
not allow a free-for-all trade in diamonds as has been proposed by
a parliamentary committee, South Africa's The Star newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The business report quoted Namibian Mines and Energy Minister
Jesaya Nyamu as saying Thursday that the suggestion that Namibia
decriminalize dealing in diamonds was "far-fetched and
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"We will not jeopardize our diamond industry or those of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
We value the industry and will not accept proposals by those
who are misinformed and ignorant of it," the minister was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said it was unfortunate that other diamond-producing
countries, notably Botswana and South Africa, had taken as fact
the recommendations made by the parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
"That the committee made this proposal does not mean we will
accept it. We don't want to promote chaos in the industry," Nyamu
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking to improve upon those archaic parts of the
existing legislation. That does not mean we are against anybody
or the Central Selling Organization (CSO of De Beers, the South
African diamond giant)."
</P>
<P>
Reports that Namibia would end the monopoly of the CSO for
diamond sales and allow free possession of cut or uncut stones
sparked concern from Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Botswana President Festus Mogae told a news conference in
Gaborone Tuesday that in that case, diamonds bought or stolen from
Botswana could be openly traded in Namibia.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Namibian parliamentary committee of natural
resources, submitted to the National Assembly for consideration,
recommended the trade be deregulated and decriminalized through
the new Diamond Bill, now before parliament.
</P>
<P>
The committee argued that Namibian people were entitled to
benefit from the natural resources of the country.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's diamond trade is still regulated by the South African
Diamond Proclamation of 1939 which makes unauthorized diamond
buying a crime against the state. The new Diamond Bill has been
before the Namibian National Assembly since November last year.

<HEADLINE> Henan Province Uses More Funds for Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has attracted a total of three billion yuan (about 360 million U.S.
dollars) from at home and abroad in the past five years for
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Henan in the upper reaches of the Huaihe River is a major coal
producer in China. Therefore, it shoulders a heavy burden of
environmental protection. The Yima Gas Project and the
technological upgrading project of the province's papermaking
companies have used a total of over 60 million U.S. dollars, and
the harnessing project of the Huaihe River has consumed about 100
million U.S. dollars from Japan.
</P>
<P>
The province was provided with 1.17 billion yuan last year by
the central government for 19 infrastructure projects. And a loan
with a discount interest of 145 million yuan, an allocation of 206
million yuan from the National Development Bank, and a specific
fund of 10 million yuan from the central government have solved
the problem of drinking water for 700,000 residents along the
seriously-polluted Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the province has also intensified its cooperation and
technological exchanges with foreign countries in environmental
protection, including Japan, the United States and Canada.

<HEADLINE> UK Voters Reject Separatism, Blair Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Friday that Labor's victory in regional elections showed
voters' rejection of the break-up of the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"I believe and I hope that out of these elections the union of
the United Kingdom will have been strengthened, rather than
weakened," Blair told reporters in London.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Labour Party looks set to be the largest party
after historic assembly elections in Scotland and Wales -- but
possibly without overall majorities in both places.
</P>
<P>
Blair noted that in Wales the nationalist party, Plaid Cymru,
had rejected separatism at the start of the campaign, while the
pro-independence Scottish National Party "has not done nearly as
well as they expected" in the voting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened is that as the debate has gone on, people
have rejected separatism," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also said his Labour Party was likely to
form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats in Scotland,
which was the third largest party next to Labour and the pro-
independence Scottish National Party.
</P>
<P>
Results showed Labour set to claim 57 seats in the 129-member
parliament versus a less-than-expected 37 seats for the Scottish
National Party, still several seats less than a required overall
majority to form a government.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Police in Malaysia's southern
state of Johor seized 7.9 kilograms of heroin from a car Thursday,
the biggest seizure in the state so far this year, the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Acting on a tip-off, police checked a car driven by a
30-year-old man and found 17 packets of the heroin hidden in its
bonnet, Bernama said quoting Johor state Narcotics Department
Assistant Commissioner Mohd Ali Mohd Yusof.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested three people including a woman aged between 26
and 43 later after questioning the man (car driver), the report
said.
</P>
<P>
All of them would be charged under Section 39B of the Dangerous
Drugs Act which provides for the mandatory death sentence by
hanging on conviction, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohd Ali, the seizure had a street value of 1.7
million ringgit (about 0.447 million U.S. dollars).

KAMPALA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Among the victims of the bomb blast
that occurred here at 6:10 a.m. Friday morning, four people were
seriously injured and one was still in critical condition, a
hospital source told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Kikampikaho Gedion, deputy director of Mulago hospital, the
biggest in Uganda, said the hospital admitted eight people injured
in the blast at the Natete market.
</P>
<P>
"They are still in the casualty department receiving treatment.
The conditions of the remaining are stable," he said.
</P>
<P>
John Kimera, deputy spokesman of Ugandan police, told Xinhua at
11:30 a. m. that the bomb, which seems a grenade, was put in a
plastic bag and was abandoned between two pickups near the main
entrance to the market.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured are five men and five women. Police could
not establish the motive of the blast yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the reasons for the recent spate of bomb
blasts in the capital city, most of them in the downtown area, the
spokesman said the terrorists just wanted to send waves of panic
among the public.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth bomb blast so far in the Ugandan capital this
year. Four of them occurred in or around market places.

<HEADLINE> More Imported Goods to Be Stamped in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government decided to
have five more kinds of imported goods to be stamped for
circulation in its domestic market from May 17 in efforts to fight
smuggling, protect domestic production and increase State budget
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam News Agency reported Friday that the goods are gas
cookers, electric rice-cookers, bicycle frames, thermos flasks and
explosion motors of working machines, according to a circular
jointly issued by Vietnam's General Department of Customs and the
Ministries of Finance, Trade and Public Security.
</P>
<P>
As of June 1, these imports, whether stored in warehouses,
displayed for sale in shops or delivered, will be regarded as
smuggled goods if they do not display the proper import duty
stamps.
</P>
<P>
Other imported goods required to be stamped include bicycles,
electric fans and pumps, alcohol, completely-assembled TV sets,
videocassette recorders, air-conditioners, refrigerators, engines,
ceramic bath installments and floor tiles.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam first introduced the stamping of imported goods on

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Set Up Industrial Research Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided to
 establish a national industrial research fund to support joint
research efforts to achieve national objectives of
industrialization by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of Research and Technology Ministry, Sammy
Mbova said here Thursday that his government would increase its
funding for industrial research sector to 20 percent of total
research allocation.
</P>
<P>
The overall goal of the fund would be to strengthen the
national industrial productivity, create jobs and reduce poverty,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Kenya spends less than 0.5 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP) on research, and out of this, less than five percent
is spent on industrial research and development.
</P>
<P>
Local media Friday quoted Mbova as saying that the government
would speed up the initiative with policies to drive the country
to a newly industrialized status in light of declining funding
for research activities from the treasury.
</P>
<P>
Mbova encouraged the involvement of more private sector
participation in the country's industrial research and development
by creating partnership, contracting and consultancy.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Kenya Industrial Research and Development
Institute, Harry Kaane said that his institute would draw from the
fund to finance the five priority areas under the national
industrial research program.
</P>
<P>
The program include food security, job creation in micro and
small enterprises, promotion of cleaner environment, improvement
of habitation for urban low income workers and promotion of
industrial and technological information exchanges, Kaane added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Launch Polio Eradication Drive in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is set to
launch a three-day massive anti-polio immunization campaign in
Afghanistan from May 9, U.N. officials said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the Taliban authorities of
public health, this campaign will involve more than 19,000
volunteers, health workers and social mobilizers, they said.
</P>
<P>
All 4.3 million Afghan children under five years of age are
targeted in two rounds for this year's polio vaccination campaign.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 3.6 million children between one year and
five years old are expected to benefit from vitamin A
supplementation during the second round scheduled for June 13-15.
</P>
<P>
Louis Georges Arsenault, UNICEF representative in Afghanistan,
told journalists here in a weekly press briefing that the two
warring Afghan sides have given verbal assurances to the UNICEF
that they will observe cease-fire during the vaccination campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said a surveillance system was established in Afghanistan in
September 1997, which continues to function despite the ongoing
conflict and complex situation there.
</P>
<P>
So far, 85 cases of confirmed polio have been detected, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Mass immunization campaigns have been conducted in Afghanistan
since 1994. Every year, the United Nations has negotiated days of
tranquillity with all sides in the conflict so that more children
could be reached with the oral polio vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The campaigns are part of the ongoing global commitment to
eradicate polio by the end of the year 2000. Provisions are being
made for an intensified effort in 1999 and 2000 with another set
of immunization campaign later this year and two sets scheduled
for May/June and October/November in 2000 to attain polio
eradication in Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said on Friday that breakthrough on Kosovo issue could be reached
only after NATO halts its bombing against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of Thursday's Group of Eight (G8) foreign ministers
meeting on Kosovo in Bonn was simply a step in the right direction
but not a breakthrough, Ivanov said after presenting wreath to the
tombs of the unknown martyrs on the 54th anniversary of the
victory of Russia's Great Patriotic War.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We cannot stop here, we must quicken our pace and
prepare a U.N. Security Council resolution."
</P>
<P>
The minister also welcomed the moves aimed at halting NATO's
military actions in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Russian Foreign Ministry and the presidential
envoy to the Balkans Viktor Chernomyrdin would provide a series of
important suggestions in the near future on the Kosovo Crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov expressed regret that NATO launches more and more
fiercely airstrikes on Yugoslavia which leave people dead and
injured everyday.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Russia could not solve the problem solely,
but will make joint efforts with the international community as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, foreign ministers from the G8 -- made up of the
biggest western industrial powers plus Russia -- agreed on a seven-
point plan to be endorsed by the U.N. Security Council that calls
for a deployment of "effective international civil and security
presence" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It also called for a U.N. interim administration for Kosovo and
self-rule, but rejects independence of the Yugoslav province.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Seeks to Check AIDS Spread in Tanzanian Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has launched a program to check the alarmingly high
spread of HIV/ AIDS in Tanzanian school-age children.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Senior Program Officer Kate Fleming said at a meeting
here Thursday that the move started this week in several regions
will help young people to change their attitudes toward the deadly
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the program is that between 2.5 and 3 million
school-age children are not in primary schools throughout
Tanzania, denying them access to information on the prevention
against HIV infection, she said.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania has no specific institution taking care of such
children and their parents are too at a loss with regard to
communication with their children on the HIV/AIDS issue," local
media Friday quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
Richard Mabala,a program consultant, added that many Tanzanian
young people nursed a mistaken conception that HIV/AIDS is a town
disease.
</P>
<P>
He said that the program would restore confidence in the young,
 especially girls, on how to resist forced sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
"A research in Musoma region indicates that 25 percent of the
young girls admitted having been forced or raped in their first
sexual intercourse,"he added.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF program will involve leaders at all levels,
religious institutions and non-governmental organizations and will
organize workshops and seminars to intensify communication and
social mobilization.
</P>
<P>
It will also establish youth centers for medical and counseling
services to promote sustainable change in sexual behavior and
attitude especially among sexually active girls and boys.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a UNICEF report said Thursday that there are over
150,000 children in Tanzania at present who have been rendered
orphans because of the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The report said that families often break contact with AIDS
patients, resulting in a situation that after the death of the
last patient, the orphans usually fail to attend primary schools
and go into prostitution or criminal activities as a result.

<HEADLINE> China Visit Has Been "Fruitful": Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua)-- Visiting South African President
Nelson Mandela said here today that his current China tour has
turned out to be "fruitful."
</P>
<P>
The 81 year old, energetic president made this remark at a
press conference prior to his conclusion of a three day state
visit as guest of his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin. He left
Beijing earlier today at the end of his visit.
</P>
<P>
During the stay, Mandela met with President Jiang, Premier Zhu
Rongji and Chairman of Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
China is the last leg of his four nation tour which has also
taken in Russia, Hungary and Pakistan. Prior to this, he had
already toured many other countries. The soon to retire president
said that with these good-bye visits he was saying thanks to those
countries that had supported South Africa when the country was
almost all alone.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to have chosen to end my political career by
visiting China," said Mandela, who will step down in early June.
</P>
<P>
The president voiced satisfaction over the development of
bilateral ties since the establishment of diplomatic relations
early last year.
</P>
<P>
"Our decision to sever relations with Taiwan and establish
diplomatic relations with China was and still is correct, and I
have no doubt that future development will show that we took a
correct decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the commercial relations between China and
South Africa have expanded very rapidly within the last eighteen
months to the satisfaction of both countries.
</P>
<P>
"Although no economic agreement was signed this time, there
have been successful meetings between the two foreign ministers on
issues that may deepen bilateral relations between the two
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president, who had been in prison for decades in his
struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination, expounded
his concept of democracy. "There are various interpretations of
what democracy is about," he said, stressing that it should be
based on the experience and conditions of different countries. "
Democracy for us means that we should be able to address economic
and social problems," he added.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has lifted a
half-year-old ban on holding Miss Tanzania contests, local media
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education and Culture issued a document
Thursday, saying that the beauty contests will help design the
national dress as an identity as well as promote the use of the
Kiswahili language popular in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
The document lists a number of regulations that must be adhered
to by the organizers and the contestants, including stating the
kind of clothes to be worn by the contestants and the prizes.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary stage of the contests should be held in as many
parts of the country as possible at district, regional and
national levels so as to give the contests a national character
and image.
</P>
<P>
The government reiterates that Kiswahili should be given
prominence in the contests. However, other languages such as
English, French, Arabic and others can also be used.
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the contests said that a new round of contests
for Miss Tanzania is expected to start next week.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar tightened its
grip above 67 U.S. cents Friday, spiking briefly to a 14-month
high as euphoria over the Australian currency continued, before
settling to be little changed.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 67.16 U.S. cents from 67.24
U.S. cents in Sydney Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the session it reached a peak of 67.43 U.S. cents, a
level not seen since March 1998. It marked a low during the day of
66.91 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
In its semi-annual statement the Australian central bank said
Thursday that it no longer expected a significant downturn in
growth in the second half of 1999, but underlying inflation was
still forecast to reach 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank did not comment directly on the future direction of
monetary policy, but the statement was interpreted as strongly
hinting that interest rates are on hold.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that this, combined with continuing positive
sentiment surrounding commodity prices, was supporting the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Australian dollar was also buying 0.6226 euro
from 0.6257 euro Thursday and 80.51 Japanese yen from 81.07
Japanese yen while the euro was trading at 1.0788 U.S. dollars
from 1.0747 U.S. dollars.

BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua)-- China dealt with 69,655 economic

However, crimes involving values of more than one million yuan
number 17, down 59 percent on an annual basis.

<HEADLINE> Rural, Urban Consumption Gap Narrowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The disparity of rising sales in
rural and urban China is narrowing, though the consumption level
in rural areas is still 10 years behind that in cities.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report issued by the State Administration
of Internal Trade, the income of rural residents grew 5.6 percent,
9 percent, 4.6 percent and 4.3 percent from 1995 to 1998, but
their consumption levels were 6.2, 2.3, 1.7 and 0.7 percentage
points lower than those of urban residents, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The report attributes the consumption trend mainly to improved
living conditions in the countryside, including the development of
highways, power supplies, and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
If the income of rural residents can be raised steadily, there
will emerge a booming rural market, especially for durable
commodities, the reports says.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Lower on Banks Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A major sell-off in the banking
sector dragged the rest of the Australian sharemarket sharply
lower Friday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark All Ordinaries Index shed 50.9 points, or 1.7
percent, to close at 2,987.7, after lifting off an intraday low of
2,971.1.
</P>
<P>
The major culprit for the fall was the rapidly devalued banking
sector, hit hard by the belief that a cut in interest rates was
out of the equation.
</P>
<P>
The Banking Index tumbled 319.8 points, or 4.6 percent, to
6,611.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index closed recording a hefty fall of
113.8 points at 5,178.5 while the All Resources Index again showed
its strength with an 8.5-point rise to 1,267.2.
</P>
<P>
Market turnover was heavy with 744.99 million stocks changing
hands worth 1.019 billion U.S. dollars with 803 stocks falling,
741 rising and 461 remaining steady.
</P>
<P>
Among the pressured banks, National Australia Bank (NAB)
recorded the biggest fall, diving 1.71 Australian dollars to 25.79
Australian dollars, as analysts re-rated the stock following
Thursday's profit results. Turnover was 8.7 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the biggest four banks in Australia, Commonwealth
Bank of Australia forfeited 65.9 cents to 24.89 Australian
dollars, ANZ bank dropped 53 cents to 11 Australian dollars and
Westpac bank shed 54 cents to 10.1 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
One of the few bright spots in the market Friday was the gold
sector. Miners dealing with the precious metal watched their share
prices soar Friday with the sub-index picking up 91.7 points to
1,173.5.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion in Sydney was trading at 288.8 U.S. dollars an
ounce at the close, up from 287.05 U.S. dollars at the close
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the resources sector generally, diversified miner BHP picked
up some of the positive sentiment, adding 9.2 cents to 17.792
Australian dollars, and global miner Rio Tinto tumbled 24.2 cents
to 24.85 Australian dollars.

<HEADLINE> European Companies in China Support China's WTO Ambitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- European companies in China have
stated their support for the country's ambitions to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO), saying the WTO should leave a
comparatively long transitional period for China's certain fragile
industries to adjust.
</P>
<P>
It is mutually beneficial, they said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Ricks, President of Ericsson (China) Company Ltd., told
Xinhua that China's entry into the WTO will benefit foreign
investors, who are now here or will come to China.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that this was because of more transparent
policies for investment, which will increase their confidence in
expanding investment.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson, which has set up more then ten enterprises in China,
including holding companies and research institutes, will double
its investment in the next few years, he pledged, adding that his
company will accelerate investment when China becomes a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson hopes China and the European Union (EU) will reach an
agreement to allow China's accession within this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Frederic Cho, chief representative of
Skandinaviska Enskilda Bank, giving China the WTO membership will
benefit all parties, from a long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
"It is reasonable to provide a long transitional period in
certain areas like banking, which will influence the reforms of
State-owned enterprises and the making of laws and policies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted a Chinese saying, "haste makes waste" to warn those
foreign firms who hoped China to open comprehensively in a short
time to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
"Although my bank hopes China will allow foreign capital to
operate Renminbi business as soon as possible, and cancel the
regional limits for overseas banks, I insist that the opening of
China's financial sector should be step by step, and no acute
changes in the next few years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it will not benefit any side if China is left out of
the WTO in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Siemens, the world electrical giant, which has an investment in
China of above one billion deutsche marks, also demonstrated its
support.
</P>
<P>
Ernst Behrens, president of Siemens Ltd., China, said "Of
course Siemens supports China" in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He added that the WTO issue should not be affected by political
factors or human rights issues. This should be a principle in the
China-United States negotiations.

<P>
MACAO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Selection Committee for the first
government of the future Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR)
held its second plenary meeting here Friday to hear the two
candidates for the first chief executive talk about their
conceptions on governing Macao.
</P>
<P>
Through drawing lots, Edmund Ho Hau Wah was chosen to be the
first one and Stanley Au Chong Kit the second to give speeches
expounding their administrative policies should they be elected
the first chief executive of the Macao SAR, which will be set up
on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
Out of nine applicants, Ho and Au were given candidacy for the
first chief executive on April 23 at the first plenary meeting of
the Selection Committee. Ho won 125 nominating votes and Au 65.
</P>
<P>
Each candidate spent about one hour to explain their
administrative programs at the meeting Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"As a Chinese born and brought up in Macao, I have always had
the reunification of our country at heart and have been looking
forward to the return of Macao to our motherland," Ho said at the
beginning of his speech.
</P>
<P>
"Should I be elected chief executive, I will shoulder the
responsibilities incumbent upon me and lead Macao confidently
through a smooth transition to permanent harmony, stability and
prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to stressing the importance of the "one country,
two systems" principle, his speech also covered law and order,
economic restructuring, public administration, fighting corruption
and striving for clean government, education, social welfare and
ethnic harmony.
</P>
<P>
Au's speech was entitled "My Choice." He explained his plans
to improve the economic and social conditions in Macao on the
basis of his all-round understanding about the region.
</P>
<P>
He listed the virtues of a qualified chief executive as clear
conscience, justice, honesty and unselfishness.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the chief executive is expected to be able to
establish a fine image for Macao in the world, listen carefully to
the wishes of the public, push forward reforms in Macao, lead
Macao out of economic depression and improve residents' living
standard, he said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, Selection Committee members will raise questions for
the two candidates to answer.
</P>
<P>
The Selection Committee will choose the first chief executive
on May 15.

<HEADLINE> Labor Poised to Win Elections in Scotland, Wales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labor Party looks
set to be the largest party after historic elections in Scotland
and Wales -- but possibly without overall majorities in both
places, according to unofficial results on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Results showed Labor set to claim 57 seats in the 129-member
Scottish parliament versus a less-than-expected 37 seats for the
pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP).
</P>
<P>
And the Liberal Democrats look set to enter government for the
first time in decades as partners in a Scottish Lib-Lab coalition.
</P>
<P>
Donald Dewar, Scotland's Labor leader and likely head of the
new parliament, said things would never be the same again.
</P>
<P>
"Scottish politics will be forever changed. I am proud to be
part of a party that delivered Scotland its first parliament in
300 years," he said after winning his seat.
</P>
<P>
In Wales, where counting does not start until later on Friday,
a BBC exit poll forecast Labor would take between 28 and 32 seats
in the 60-seat assembly while the nationalist Plaid Cymru would
secure up to 17.
</P>
<P>
The likely results in Scotland and Wales vindicated Blair's
gamble of offering limited home rule to quell growing independence
movements.
</P>
<P>
The elections reshaped British politics by giving Scotland a
parliament for the first time since 1707 and Wales a less powerful
national assembly, its first ever.
</P>
<P>
But the SNP was also on course at least quadruple its tally by
being the single biggest victor in the battle for regional "top up
" seats, and looked set to form the official opposition against a
coalition administration.
</P>
<P>
SNP leader Alex Salmond said: "I think we've had the best
result in this party's history and whatever happens tonight I
think the SNP are moving forward and we're the only party that's
doing that."
</P>
<P>
Conservative leader William Hague was also bolstered by his
party's showing in the local government elections across most of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative won control of a number of key councils and
broke the 1,000-seat barrier -- enough for the Conservative leader
to claim he had led the faithful to the start of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
The downside for all parties was the low turnout. In the
locals, this was around 29 percent and in parts of Wales it
climbed only slightly higher.

PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- One step was made on Thursday toward a possible solution to
the Kosovo crisis, as the principal members of NATO and Russia
agreed upon the main lines of a peace process which would
guarantee the deployment of an international force in Kosovo.
Russia made an important step by not presenting any pre-condition
for realizing a political solution.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The agreement reached on Thursday by the Group of Eight
countries on a political solution to Kosovo remains in the
darkness of serious divergence between the United States and
Russia. U.S. President Bill Clinton described the agreement as a
step forward, but said the NATO would continue aggressively the
airstrikes. Russia said a political solution is impossible unless
NATO stops bombing.
</P>
<P>
-- French Defense Minister Alain Richard submitted on Thursday
a series of secret reports on the actions of the Serb military in
Kosovo to the prosecutor of the International Tribunal on war
crimes in former Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour. The documents include
the photo copies taken in the air by French reconnaissance planes,
showing the detention of groups of Kosovo Albanian men by Serbian
forces in rural areas.

SEOUL, May 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
said Friday that he expects a drastic improvement in inter-Korean
relations this year.
</P>
<P>
"I will map out all measures with caution in the expectation
that there will be a drastic improvement in inter-Korean relations
this year," Kim told a press conference attended by more than 120
foreign journalists at the presidential palace Blue House.

Asked to give details of the predicted "dramatic improvement,"
Kim said he was unable to give specifics, but suggested it may
include the resumption of dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang and
the holding of economic cooperation conferences.
</P>
<P>
Kim forecast an epoch-making development that may remove the
Cold War structure on the Korean peninsula as soon as
international suspicions about the Kumchang-ri site in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are cleared up and a
report by U.S. special envoy William Perry is made public.
</P>

PHNOM PENH, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) provided
more than 50 million euros for three important projects in
Cambodia to help thousands of rural Cambodians get clean water,
improve agricultural yields and obtain quality education for their
children.
</P>
<P>
A signing ceremony was held Thursday at the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation. Ambassador Michel

</P>
<P>
The second project, known as "Support Program for Basic

residence in Putrajaya next month.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Department complex and the prime
minister's official residence were built under the first phase of
the project covering 1,527 hectares out of a total area of 4,581
hectares of Putrajaya, designed to be a smart garden township.
</P>
<P>
The new federal administrative capital, located 25 kilometers
south from Kuala Lumpur, which cost 22 billion ringgit (about
5.789 billion U.S. dollars) to build, is expected to be completed
in June 2002 and could support a population of 330,000, according
to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Putrajaya is part of the much-publicized Multimedia Super
Corridor, which is under construction, where Cyberjaya, the
world's first intelligent city, is also located.

<HEADLINE> Over One Million Land Mines Planted Around World: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- There are more than one million
anti-personnel land mines planted around the world, a report of
the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines said.
</P>
<P>
The report titled "Land Mine Monitor 1999" available here
Friday said that at least 108 countries are stocking some 250
million anti-personnel land mines.
</P>
<P>
However, the reported noted that more than 30 countries have
removed and destroyed 12 million such mines while 12 countries
have totally destroyed their land mine stocks.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1998, 16 countries spent a total of 640 million
U.S. dollars in removing land mines, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Originally, 54 countries produced land mines. Now, eight of
the 12 big producers have signed on the Ottawa convention on
banning the use, stock, production and transfer of anti-personnel
land mines, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The production of land mines has greatly decreased, it said,
citing that in the 15 years before 1993, 65 million land mines
were planted, which means four million each year, while in the
mid-1990s, only 2.5 million land mines were produced each year.

<HEADLINE> S. African Departments Discuss Banning Smoking in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The issue of whether prisoners
should be allowed to smoke in jail has been under discussion
between officials of the departments of Health and Correctional
Services, the Citizen newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The discussion started soon after the Tobacco Products Control
Act was signed by President Nelson Mandela last month.
</P>
<P>
The act imposes a blanket ban on smoking in public places and
the workplace, but then allows Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma to
regulate for exemptions.
</P>
<P>
No details of the discussion about banning smoking in prison
has been available.
</P>
<P>
For now, only two countries are known to have dealt
specifically with smoking in prisons in their tobacco control
legislation. One is Botswana, the other is New Zealand. The
former completely bans smoking in prison while the latter offers
an option of smoking cells or designated smoking areas.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the South African Health Department said that they
tend to follow the New Zealand model, recognizing that smoking is
an addiction. And there is a feeling that complete ban is too
punitive, the officials added.

<HEADLINE> Maize Shortage in Kenya Sends Prices Soaring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- An acute shortage of maize over the
past two weeks has led to a flour price rise of between 17 percent
to 25 percent in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Kariithi Murimi, Chairman of the Wheat Millers Association of
Kenya said Thursday that the millers had been adversely affected
by a 36 percent rise in the price of maize over last month.
</P>
<P>
The serious shortage of maize forced the millers to operate
below capacity, the Daily Nation newspaper Friday quoted Murimi as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the higher prices of the flour of maize and wheat
were partly caused by high transport fees from the Indian port
Mombasa to Kenyan capital Nairobi due to the poor roads. Most
imports enter the east African country through Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Murimi also attributed the price increase to a 11 percent drop
in the value of the Kenyan shilling to the U.S. dollar in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The sector was expected to continue importing wheat until July
when local wheat is available, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
continued its diplomatic efforts to bring peace to the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) as Deputy President Thabo Mbeki met his
Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, to discuss the DRC issue
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's office gave no details of the discussion, except
confirming that it was part of the effort to bring pace to the
DRC.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria regards Kagame, who doubles defense minister, and
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe as the two key figures in the
DRC peace effort as Rwanda is allegedly providing the backbone of
the rebel forces fighting to overthrow DRC President Laurent
Kabila. Zimbabwe sent troops to fight along with the DRC
government forces last August soon after the rebels took up arms
against Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Exports of Egypt's Free Zones Rise This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's free zone exports in the first
four months this year rose 30.5 percent from the same period last
year, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The free zone exports stood at 154 million U.S. dollars so far
in 1999, 36 million dollars more than the same period in 1998,
Ibrahim Fawzi, chairman of the General Investment and Free Zone
Authority, said on Thursday at a symposium entitled "Investment
Opportunities in Egypt."
</P>
<P>
The symposium was part of the five-day Francexpo '99 opened
last Sunday by Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri and his
French counterpart Lionel Jospin during his two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The free zone exports increased to 406 million dollars in 1998
from 302 million dollars in 1997, Fawzi said, citing the soar of
direct foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has set up six free zones in Cairo, Ismailia, Suez,
Alexandria, Port Said and Dumyat, where investors are offered
favorable conditions including tax exemption as long as 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi pledged that Egyptian laws will protect foreign
investments against nationalization and confiscation.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year ending on June 30, Egypt exported
5.33 billion dollars worth of goods while its imports stood at
16.55 billion dollars, with a deficit of 11.22 billion dollars.
Egypt is seeking ways of promoting exports in a bid to reduce
trade deficit.

<HEADLINE> Export Credit Insurance Develops Rapidly in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China has seen a rapid growth of its
export credit insurance business in the last decade, accompanied
by a steady growth of its export.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Yifei, an official from the People's Insurance
Company of China (PICC), the company has signed more than 200,000
short-term insurance contracts and over 50 medium and long-term
contracts with a total insured amount of 14 billion U.S. dollars
since November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under these contracts, PICC has paid 70 million dollars in
indemnities to insurees.
</P>
<P>
It has also provided an insurance cover of one billion dollars
for overseas investment in China and recovered 200 million dollars
owed to Chinese firms by overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
As a major international export credit insurer, the PICC helped
Chinese exporters get more than five billion dollars in foreign
currency lending by international banks to many major export
projects by Chinese manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
For example, it persuaded 14 Chinese and foreign banks to lend
530 million dollars to the Tehran subway project, one of the
largest machinery and electrical equipment export projects
undertaken by Chinese firms in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Export credit insurance is a popular means used by various
governments in the world to encourage the exports of its products
by providing its exporters with a guarantee against risks
resulting in the non-payment on the part of the importers.
</P>
<P>
In November 1989, the PICC started its export credit insurance
service, the first such services in China, with 60 million dollars
from the Ministry of Finance as the initial reserve against risks.
</P>
<P>
In October 1998, the PICC, as the representative of China's
export credit insurers, was formally acknowledged and admitted as
a member by the International Union of Credit and Investment
Insurers, more simply known as the Berne Union.
</P>
<P>
As an umbrella organization of international export credit
insurers, the Berne Union plays a major role in co-ordinating the
export credit and investment policies of various countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, members of the union provided a total guarantee of 44.
6 billion dollars for foreign investment in China, surpassing the
amount of actual foreign investment in the country in that year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that PICC's admission by the union will help
international investors to have a better understanding of China,
and hence encourage more investment in the country.

<HEADLINE> One Fifth of China's Urban Residents Use Coal as Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A Ministry of Construction
official said today that one fifth of China's city-dwellers still
use coal as fuel.
</P>
<P>
As the pollutants and dust are directly discharged into air,
coal burning has become one of the major factors worsening China's
urban atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, "In terms of air pollution, south China's
cities are better than those in the north, and the summer is
better than winter.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting the use of gas in the cities and encouraging central
heating systems has become a task of great urgency."
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration issued a
circular in 1996, calling on China's large and medium-sized cities
to formulate regulations prohibiting the use of raw coal as fuel.
To date, a total of 123 cities across China have drawn up special
regulations governing the issue.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 23.7 billion cubic meters of gas and
natural gas, as well as some eight million tons of liquefied
petroleum gas were supplied to Chinese citizens in 1998, a rise of
31.7 percent and 75.2 percent respectively on the 1995 figures.
</P>
<P>
Some 79 percent of China's city-dwellers now use gas as their
fuel, an increase of 10 percent more than the figure in 1995.
While in Beijing and Shanghai, the rate of urban residents using
gas has been maintained above 90 percent for years despite
continuous growth in the urban population.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Eleven rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in operations launched by the
Turkish security forces in eastern Turkey, the Anatolia News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces Thursday wiped out 30 PKK rebels
after a large group of PKK militants ambushed the government
troops on duty in Yayladere town of Bingol province late Wednesday
night, in which nine soldiers were killed and another was wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces have launched large-scale military
operations in search of the PKK guerrillas in country areas of
Yayladere and Kigi towns between the provinces of Bingol and
Tunceli.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cobra and Skorsky helicopters also raided the
shelterings of PKK militants in the region.
</P>
<P>
Fightings between the Turkish security forces and the PKK
guerrillas are continuing in the region.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent
Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey. The conflicts have claimed
over 37,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan was captured by Turkish special
agents in Kenya in mid-February and has been detained on Imrali
Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa for
trial on charges of treason.

<HEADLINE> China Utilizing Sea Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Various technologies including
desalination of sea water and the direct use of sea water in
industry are encouraged in China to relieve the lack of water in
coastal cities and islands.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that the per capita fresh water rate in China is
less than one quarter of the world average, and more than 300
cities are short of water. The situation is more serious in the
coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Utilizing sea water is an important method of solving this
problem, said Gao Congjie, an academician at the Chinese Academy
of Engineering, adding that desalination technology has been well
developed in China for more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
A desalination plant with a daily capacity of 500 tons was
constructed in east China's Zhejiang Province in 1997, and China's
largest desalination plant, which can produce 1,000 tons of fresh
water, was completed in northeastern Liaoning Province last year.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's various desalination facilities can produce
four million tons of fresh water every year, according to an
official of the State Oceanic Administration (SOA).
</P>
<P>
Sea water is also directly utilized in industry, and about 170
million cubic meters of sea water is used as a coolant at the
Tianjin Dagang Power Plant every year.
</P>
<P>
Gao Congjie said that China takes no more than 10 billion
cubic meters of water from sea every day, much less than many
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that technology for exploiting sea water should be
further developed, and systematic sea water desalination projects
should be designed.
</P>
<P>
According to the 21st Century Agenda for China's Oceans,
created by the SOA, China will launch several pilot projects using
sea water for irrigation, industry, and everyday use in several
coastal cities.

<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China will impose a levy on land

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Growing Support for Israel's Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Just 10 days before Israel's
general elections, a public opinion poll showed that support for
the left-wing Labor Party leader Ehud Barak was growing.
</P>
<P>
The poll, published on the local daily The Jerusalem Post, was
conducted among a representative sample of 500 voters early this
week and had a margin of error of approximately 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll suggested that Barak would beat current Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in a second round of voting by 49 percent to
43.5 percent. Seven percent of those questioned were undecided.
</P>
<P>
Barak's edge over Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud
Party, was up slightly over a similar poll taken in the previous
week, when Barak garnered 48 percent compared with Netanyahu, who
got 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, Barak also led the first round voting
with 41 percent, followed by Netanyahu with 38.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister election is slated for May 17. If none of
the candidates can get more than 50 percent of votes in the
first round, a second round will be held in early June.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll also showed that the Center Party Leader
Yitzhak Mordechai's fortunes continue to sour: last week's polls
showed he would gain 9 percent of votes in the first round, but
this week the figure declined to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the support for Mordechai dropped, the Labor has called on
the Center Party to joined forces with it in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts noted that the majority of those classified as
"undecided" in the poll voted for Netanyahu in 1996 elections; if
they, about 7 percent of the voters this year, do so again, the
difference between Barak and Netanyahu would shrink.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Exports of the Pudong New Area, an
emerging financial and trade zone in Shanghai, reached 1.28
billion U.S. dollars for the first quarter of the year, up 37.3
percent from the 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
The exports were worth 28 million U.S. dollars more than
imports, the first report of a trade surplus since the Pudong New
Area was founded in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Local trade experts attributed the growth mainly to increases
in exports of overseas-funded enterprises and high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Customs, 52 percent of the exports
were accomplished by the area's more than 2,000 overseas-funded
enterprises, compared with 50 percent last year and 15 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports of technology-intensive goods, such as computers and
machinery, made up 50 percent of the total, while those of labor
and resource intensive products kept on declining.
</P>
<P>
Experts also point to a diversified market that has helped
boost exports. To date, the area has enhanced its presence in more
than 130 foreign countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls For Enhanced Efforts In Solving Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Information Industry
(MII) is calling on major government departments and crucial
sectors to make enhanced efforts to solve the computer 2000
problem (Y2K) and ensure sufficient funding.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi, director of the Information Products Administration
Office under the MII, said that 18 major government institutions
have made progress toward solving the Y2K problem, but the task is
still "tough and requires more efforts."
</P>
<P>
For ten days last month, the MII investigated the 18
departments and found that the banking and financial sector, and
Customs had completed their tests and revisions.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi said it is wrong for some enterprises and institutions
to believe that solving Y2K is strictly the technicians'
responsibility, and she stressed that leaders at all levels should
take part in these efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to one legal expert, China still lacks effective laws
and regulations for the Y2K problem, and in many circumstances
need help from international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi disclosed that the MII will organize officials from
ten departments in Beijing and Shanghai to visit the United States
in October where they will seek international cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for Action on Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has
asked his cabinet ministers and permanent secretaries to fight
corruption in their respective ministries instead of merely
speaking about its existence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his cabinet members at the State House here
Thursday, Moi said that the public would like to see action taken
against corrupt officials, especially those in the departments
notorious for graft such as road department.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Kenya Times newspaper Friday quoted the president
as saying it is ironic that permanent secretaries grumbled about
corruption as they are charged with the role of implementing
government policies.
</P>
<P>
The ministries are required to make sure the projects they
started be completed, and never start the new ones unless the
earlier ones were complete, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
The president also requested the ministries to ensure no
dumping of cheap imports, which jeopardize local industries and
job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Moi told his subordinates that plans are to be made to
privatize the Kenya Meat Commission so as to improve the meat
industry and benefit livestock keepers.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a budgetary provision for training of civil
servants so that they become better managers and implementers of
government policies.
</P>
<P>
But he added that public servants should resist foreign
policies and advice which impacted negatively on the image of the
government.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has ordered to create a Presidential Retirement Income Commission
(PRIC) to integrate the country's different pension and retirement
fund systems, the Philippines News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was quoted as saying there is a need to integrate the
various pension and retirement fund systems to make them "more
equitable, efficient, affordable and financially sound."
</P>
<P>
He said the PRIC will review operations of the current
Philippine retirement income system so it can make recommendations
for reform and improvement, which will result in better service to
the people.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member PRIC will be composed of representatives from
the government, the armed forces, labor and the private sector,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The PRIC will assess operations of the current retirement
income system with focus on coverage of its major components, it
said.
</P>
<P>
It will also develop a shared vision of the basic scope and
structure of the retirement income system.

The only way to develop Chinese enterprises into high quality
and strongly competitive ones is through competition in the global
market, the article said.
</P>
<P>
Certain Chinese industries, including telecommunications,
finance, insurance, and tourism sooner or later will be opened to
international competition. That's why they have to deepen
restructuring, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Temporary pains will be replaced by upgrading of the entire
economy, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
"A strong rival can often excite the latent ability of the weak,
" the article said.
</P>
<P>
China's color TV market was almost monopolized by Japanese
products in the early 80's, but now domestically produced color
TVs account for three fourths of the market share. All the
personal computers in the Chinese market were imported ten years
ago, but last year half of all computers sold in China among the
top-ten brands were made by domestic manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Chinese negotiators have been able to secure a
transitional period. China will cut its tariff gradually to a
level that Chinese industries can withstand, imports of certain
sensitive commodities will be limited until 2005, trade of
significant agricultural products still need quotas, and the
service trade will be opened step by step.
</P>
<P>
Domestic enterprises have long suffered from unfair competition.
However, WTO membership will provide an opportunity for the
Chinese economy to become a part of standard and fair
international competition, it added.

<HEADLINE> WTO Accession Part of China's Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's sustained effort to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is a part of its reform and opening-
up drive, according to a signed article in Friday's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The gradual opening of China's service sector is a need of the
ongoing reform and opening-up, rather than a concession, the
article noted.
</P>
<P>
China's goal is to foster new economic growth points and boost
consumption, as well as to create positions of high- and middle-
income job opportunities, it said.
</P>
<P>
China's confidence in opening winder to the rest of the world
is due to the fact that none of the WTO members, most of which are
still developing countries, have experienced difficulties in the
course of opening their service sectors, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
There were some arguments before China opened the manufacturing
of TVs and refrigerators, but it took the right step, according to
the article.
</P>
<P>
After 13 years of negotiations, the Chinese people have learned
that service is the engine of the entire economy, as it is
intensive in knowledge, professionals and technologies. "No
advanced service, no developed economy," the article stressed.
</P>
<P>
WTO membership will not only give China equality of trade
opportunity, but will also spur its initiative to institute
international trade norms, it noted.

<P>
In the process of opening to the world, the first consideration
must be the security of the Chinese economy, and this economic
security does not conflict with opening-up, the article pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the former economy which was formed in isolation was
extremely fragile, it added.
</P>
<P>
Practice demonstrates that the biggest threat to economic
security is exactly a closed economy, which features clogged
access to information, low competitiveness, and backward
macroeconomic management, it noted, adding that economic security
will only be consolidated through a continuous opening process.
</P>
<P>
After 20 years of reform and opening-up, China's ability to
ward off risks had not been weakened, but rather strengthened, it
said.
</P>
<P>
When taking part in the WTO, which accounts for 95 percent of
all global trade and investment, the Chinese economy will
gradually be connected to the world economy, widen its opening,
and dispose all its resources rationally.
</P>
<P>
With WTO membership, more Chinese enterprises will participate
in the world economy, more overseas investment will flow into
China, and Chinese consumers will gain great benefits, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, developing countries should be highly aware of
economic security, given the history of world trade which includes
protectionism, unpredictable international floating capital,
mergers among multinational corporations, and the defects of the
international trading system, it said.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should open their economies in accordance
with the level of their economic development, and aid its fledging
industries, it noted.
</P>
<P>
In the course of WTO negotiations, China insists that it should
remain in a controlling position in Sino-foreign cooperation, open
its market gradually, and keep the door of the capital market
closed.
</P>
<P>
The article said in conclusion that WTO membership should be
based on the benefits of economic development and social stability.

<HEADLINE> Closure Lawsuit Filed Against Turkey's Pro-Islamic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Vural Savas, prosecutor of the
Supreme Court of Appeal, announced Friday to file a lawsuit to the
Constitutional Court to ban the pro-Islamic Virtue Party (FP), the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Savas made the announcement mainly on account of FP deputy
Merve Kavakci's attempt to take oath at the ceremony session of
the parliament on May 2 wearing a headscarf.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, FP deputy chairman Aydin Menderes resigned from
his party post in protest against the inability of FP leader
Recai Kutan in solving the "headscarf controversy."
</P>
<P>
Kavakci triggered the dispute among political parties as she
entered the parliament hall wearing the headscarf according to
Islamic custom, causing chaos in the parliament and protest by
parties.
</P>
<P>
Women are not allowed to wear headscarf in state and public
institutions under the law in the mostly-Muslim but strictly
secular country.
</P>
<P>
Menderes reportedly opposed Kavakci's move in parliament, but
he called on both his party and the opponents to settle the
controversy within the norms of law.
</P>
<P>
Menderes' resignation is seen as a big blow to the FP and some
other FP deputies loyal to Menderes are also expected to resign
from the party.
</P>
<P>
The FP, which became the third largest party after the recent
elections and holds 111 seats in parliament, stems from the
Islamic Welfare Party which was outlawed in January, 1998 for its
ultra-Islamic policies.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel also criticized Kavakci for
wearing headscarf when attending the new parliament oath-taking
ceremony, saying such a move provoked Turkish people.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister-designate Bulent Ecevit said that "everyone in
Turkey has the right to wear whatever she would like in their
private lives. But, the general assembly of parliament is not
within the bounds of anyone's private life."
</P>
<P>
"In state life, the rules and regulations of the state should
be obeyed. Parliament is not the place to challenge the state," he
added.

<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A recent sample test indicates that
home-produced petroleum products are 100 percent qualified.
</P>
<P>
The test, conducted by State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision, involved 20 batches of petroleum products from 20
enterprises in 11 provinces and municipalities, including No.90
lead free petroleum and No. 93 lead free petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises involved in the test are mainly leading
petroleum producers, which have a lion's share of the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
But experts warned that petroleum producers still face severe
challenges, as China is expected to issue new standards on the
quality of petroleum, which will set stricter limits on such
harmful elements as alkene and aromatic hydrocarbons contained in
petroleum.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has been urged to double its efforts in
ensuring that all programs are on course if it has to achieve a
free trade area by October 2000.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Minister of Communications and Transport David Saviye
said all key programs on regional integration should be fully
implemented so that the regional grouping could achieve a free
trade area next year.
</P>
<P>
Saviye was speaking at the opening of the second consultative
meeting on Advance Cargo Information System (ACIS) in Lusaka
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said programs like ACIS should be fully implemented because
it would provide service providers and users with online
information to enable them to conduct their businesses in a more
efficient and cost effective manner.
</P>
<P>
Saviye also called for the full participation of all
transporters in the ACIS program so as to promote efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same meeting, COMESA Secretary General Erastus
Mwencha said the ACIS program has had positive impact on railway
transport where it had been implemented.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to train users of ACIS so that the
program could be sustainable.
</P>
<P>
ACIS can only be an effective management tool if all parties
fulfill their obligations toward ensuring that each transport
operator, each user and each country will have access to
information they need, he added.

<HEADLINE> Status of Dollar Unlikely to Change in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite the prospect that the euro
will assume an important role in world economy, the status of the
U.S. dollar is unlikely to change in Gulf countries in the near
term, the Gulf News daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The euro is still unfamiliar to the Gulf countries for them to
make any strategic decision regarding its use as an alternative to
the dollar, the paper said, quoting Gulf bankers.
</P>
<P>
Most Gulf currencies are pegged to the dollar, the reserves of
the Gulf countries are in dollars, and this is likely to continue
for some time, said Ibrahim Dabdoub, chief of the National Bank of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, the euro, which is adopted by 11 European countries,
is important for Gulf countries in the long run in oil pricing and
in maintaining exchange rate stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
This was echoed by Al Dukheil, chairman of the Saudi-based
Consulting Center for Finance and Investment.
</P>
<P>
Dukheil suggested that the authorities of Gulf Cooperation
Council countries, which include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, should consider
introducing a dual system of pricing for oil.
</P>
<P>
With such a system, the Gulf oil exporters can use the euro in
transactions with European countries and the dollar when doing
business with another countries, he said.

<P>
On the road along the 22-kilometer Xinkai river across Shenyang
city, Zhang and other retired people clear garbage and trim grass,

The 65-year old Zhang Chengzhe, once a national technology
innovator and model laborer, has been given an audience by the

</P>
<P>
His current work has also won him the respect and support of
society. Learning about his work from the media, more Shenyang
residents have joined his group to make their city clean.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I already thought of making more contributions to
society before my retirement," said Zhang. He and dozens of other
model laborers set up a real estate company to provide more
convenient services to citizens.
</P>
<P>
Zhang and his colleague have been praised by China's elderly
people's organizations, and regarded as a model for other aged
people, because their work proves that "the elderly are still able
to contribute to society".
</P>
<P>
"With their rich work and life experience the elderly can still
make contributions to societies. They should not be excluded from
doing social work just because they have retired from their
occupations." Yu Guohou, vice-chairman of the China's Old

<P>
China is now to embrace a "silver hair" era. Demographers
estimate that there will be 130 million 60-year olds or above in
China by 2000 and by the middle of next century the number will
reach 400 million.
</P>
<P>
The government and research organizations have paid close
attention to the growth of the ageing population and its influence
on the economy, employment and social insurance.
</P>
<P>
Yu noted that China has now set its working goal for elderly
citizens which is providing medicare, the opportunity for study,
leisure time and their working chances.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is now launching activities to encourage old
people to carry out jobs within their abilities, participate in
social development, and continue to realize their life value, all
of which will help the old population to live more actively.
</P>
<P>
Yu said: "More senior citizens are now willing to do social
work after their retirement. They are even irreplaceable in some
fields."
</P>
<P>
A survey by the China Elderly People's Research Center showed
that China's senior citizens are now extending their working scope
to include technology consultation, education and community
services.
</P>
<P>
It also showed that over 20 percent of the retired people in
China have gone taken up new working positions. Over one million
senior citizens are helping to educate the next generation and
nearly two million retired teachers are now still continuing their
careers.
</P>
<P>
Si Xia was 85 years old when she retired from the attached
primary school to Nanjing Normal University, and was possibly the
oldest on-the-post teacher in China at that time.
</P>
<P>
She is now nearly 90 years old, and still reading newspapers
every day and paying close attention to the development of
children.
</P>
<P>
"There does exist some prejudices toward old people. But most
important of all, we aged people should make contributions to
society for as long as we can," she said.

<HEADLINE> Adequate Funding for Y2K Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- An information industry official
today called for ensuring the adequate allocation of funds for
tackling the millennium computer bug.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a national seminar, Zhang Qi, director of the
Information Products Administration of the Ministry of Information
Industry, said the key sectors of China's national economy and
industries vital to people's livelihood cannot afford to overlook
the Y2K problem, despite the fact that computer applications in
China are not as prevalent as in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Estimates on the Y2K problem have set the global costs at 600
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far, the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank,
has invested 5 billion yuan on tackling the millennium bug, and
more funds are expected to be added.
</P>
<P>
The Construction Bank of China has used 600 million yuan on
working out the contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
The General Administration of Customs has invested 2 billion
yuan on software upgrading.
</P>
<P>
These institutions are among the government departments and
industries which have completed their computer system revision and
testing.
</P>
<P>
However, shortages of funds are holding back many institutions
and businesses in their attempts to tackle the Y2K problem. "This
is a key issue," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
She pointed to the fact the Northeast Earthquake Monitoring
Network is unable to meet its budget by 2 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
A series of policies in favor of the Y2K efforts are needed to
ease the funding shortages, Zhang said, suggesting discount loans
aimed at the computer bug projects, and tariff exemptions on
imported equipment as a result of the problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she pointed out, computer and electronics companies
should not treat this problem as a business opportunity. She
warned about the short-sightedness of those companies that have
set a "sky-high price" for their services in solving the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
"They should charge very little or not at all for the sake of
the interests of the broader pictures and their own reputations,"
she added.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>

a representative sample of 500 voters between Sunday and Tuesday
of this week found that One Israel leader Ehud Barak would beat
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a second round by 49 percent
to 43.5 percent. Barak's edge over Netanyahu was up slightly over
a similar poll taken in the previous week which showed he would
get 48 percent of the votes while Netanyahu 43 percent in the
decisive round.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Finance Minister Meir Sheetrit and top ministry officials
are aghast at two proposals that Netanyahu intends to submit to
the cabinet Sunday - eight days before the elections - which
would earmark 900 million shekels (about 225 million U.S. dollars)
for the health system and the Jerusalem municipality. A senior
treasury official said the proposal is "an election bribe, pure
and simple."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- A Yediot Aharonot poll showed that Barak would lead in the
first round of voting on May 17 with 42 percent of the votes
while Netanyahu would get 37 percent. In the second round, the
poll showed, 50 percent of the voters would vote for Barak, 42
percent for Netanyahu, and 8 percent undecided. Both Likud and

would be decided in the first round.

<HEADLINE> Construction on Macao Handover Site Starts Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Construction of an interim facility
for the ceremony marking the handover of Macao from Portugal to
China will break ground next week and will be completed in
November, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The structure, with a floor space of 6,000 sq m and a height of
20 m, can hold 2,500 people. It includes a main hall, a guest
house, a media center and a number of other subsidiary facilities,
an official with the Preparation Office for the Handover Ceremony
said.
</P>
<P>
The building is located near the newly-completed Cultural
Center not far away from the Hong Kong-Macao Ferry Terminal and
will be designed to fix into the features of the environment, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the existing facilities will be made use of for the
handover ceremony to reduce the level of demolition and avoid
construction repetition.
</P>
<P>
The structure will be built with sturdy and durable materials,
but not for permanent purposes, he said, adding that the site will
be turned into a park after the metal framework is removed
following the handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The top and some walls of the building will be built with
transparent materials.
</P>
<P>
Construction work is expected to end in October and interior
decoration will be completed in November, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians' Destiny in Their Own Hands: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian people have the
absolute right to set up an independent state on their own land,
Palestinian consul-general in Dubai Saleem Abu Sultan has said.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian people alone will determine the appropriate
time for such a declaration," the envoy was quoted on Friday by
Khaleej Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to delay the declaration of a Palestinian state
was not the result of external pressures," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The decision came following exhaustive studies and
consultations between President Yasser Arafat and world and Arab
leaders and the Palestinian Legislative Council," he added.
</P>
<P>
On April 29, the Palestine Liberation Organization Central
Council decided to postpone making a final decision on the
declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He said that no deadline has been set for the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"It could be in a month's time, two months time or in a year's
time. It has not been decided yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the current unrest and street protests by the
Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank disappointed at the passage
of the May 4 deadline without a statehood declaration, he said
"frustration is a natural reaction."
</P>
<P>
The envoy stressed, however, that "while the Palestinian
people and various political factions have a right to protest
within democratically accepted parameters, they do not have the
right to ignore the PNA (Palestinian National Authority)
leadership and threaten the security of the state."

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in New Zealand drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's unemployment has
dropped sharply and is expected to continue to fall as its economy
builds up steam.
</P>
<P>
In a media release, Statistics New Zealand said Friday that the
unemployment rate for the first quarter of this year declined to
7.2 percent from 7.7 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The number of people officially out of work fell to 135,000 in
March this year from 143,000 in December last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Statistics NZ, 1,741,000 people were estimated to
be employed in the first quarter of this year. Of these, 950,000
were men and 791,000 were women. The number of people in
employment has increased by 15,000 from the fourth quarter of last
year and by 9,000 from a year ago. The increase over the year has
come solely from an increase in female employment of 14,000 while
male employment declined by 5,000 over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey shows that unemployment in the Wellington
region fell to 6.5 percent from 6.9 percent, but that in the
Auckland region rose from 6.5 percent to 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local economists hold that the drop in unemployment in New
Zealand was far bigger than expectations and reflected a wider
economic recovery. They are of the view that the labor market in
the country is responding quite rapidly to the general recovery in
the economy, and it likely to continue to improve.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Many Large U.S. Companies Lag Behind Y2K Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Many large companies in the
United States are not spending enough to complete their year 2000
computer(Y2K) compliance, according to a study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study conducted by research firm Triaxsys examined the
spending of the companies through the end of last year on Y2K
technology, as disclosed in their quarterly financial reports
submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
Although many companies have made major progress in their Y2K
efforts, Triaxsys said, "there are a significant number of
companies that have a tremendous amount of work to do and they
might not make it."
</P>
<P>
Of the 647 Fortune 1000 companies examined, 231 companies may
achieve Y2K compliance, but 241 companies have made only 41
percent to 60 percent progress, and 175 companies are at or below
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among the companies showing the least progress, as measured by
percentage of total budget spent, are the computer networking
giant 3Com which spent just 7 percent of its budget, and
TeleCommnications Corporation, with just 10 percent spent.
</P>
<P>
According to the research firm, the average Fortune 1000
company is about 56 percent done with Y2K work. The SEC filling
also indicated that the companies' estimates of the total cost of
the Y2K problem continue to rise. Total estimated spending by
companies is now projected to be at least 53 billion U.S. dollars,
according to the study.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "conventional wisdom" lately is that all large U.
S. companies have the Y2K problem under control. "That kind of
generalization is not only inaccurate but overly complacent,"
Triaxsys said.
</P>
<P>
The research firm expects to see a surge of spending over the
next few months as companies try to accelerate projects to meet
year 2000 deadlines. However, the firm said, in the information
technology industry, throwing more money and bodies at major
projects do not necessarily mean success and in some cases can
hamper progress.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Provides More Help for Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand is to give a further

450,000 NZ dollars (248,000 U.S. dollars) to help refugees from
Kosovo and will accept a number of them into the country very
soon.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Prime Minister Jenny Shipley said Friday in a
statement that New Zealand's aid to the region will be delivered
by
two U.N. agencies. 250,000 NZ dollars will go to the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to buy tents, blankets, sleeping

bags and other essentials for families arriving in refugee camps
in
Albania and Macedonia. And a further 200,000 NZ dollars will go to

the U.N. food agency, the World Food Program (WFP), in response to

its emergency appeal for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand is concerned to see that the basic needs of
refugees,
such as food and shelter, are met," Shipley said. "New Zealand has

now provided 650,000 NZ dollars in aid, following earlier grants
of
100,000 NZ dollars each to the Red Cross and UNHCR."
</P>
<P>
She also announced that a three-person New Zealand Immigration
Service team is to leave tomorrow for Skopje to identify and
select
Kosovo refugees with family links in New Zealand, in line with the

government's decision to offer permanent places for people with
relatives in the country.
</P>
<P>
The first group of up to 50 refugees is expected to arrive in
New
Zealand on May 22 and the second group to arrive in early June,
Shipley said.

<HEADLINE> UAE Airline in Talks to Join Oneworld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Oneworld, the giant alliance of
five major airlines, is holding talks with the United Arab
Emirates Airline for the possible entry of it as a member, the
Gulf News daily reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"If it goes ahead, Emirates Airline will join a club which
includes five of the world's largest airlines," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
David Rousham, sales and marketing manager of British Airways
for Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia, said they had been
discussing the membership issue with Emirates Airline for the past
five months.
</P>
<P>
"Should the proposed deal with Emirates Airline materialize,
the carrier would join the five-airline league composed of
American Airlines, British Airways, Canadian Airlines, Cathay
Pacific and Qantas," Rousham said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Emirates Airline, they were also talking with three
major airlines in the Middle East, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ministers Meet on Financing Africa's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A joint conference of African
ministers of finance, economic development and planning opened
Thursday here at the United Nations Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
This conference, the first joint meeting organized by the
United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) since its
structural reform in 1997, is taking place against the background
of a number of important developments that pose serious challenges
to financing Africa's economic and social development and thereby
alleviating poverty on the continent.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
said Africans today are at a very critical juncture in their
history and the challenges Africans face are complex and the task
they face to ensure sustainable development is indeed herculean.
</P>
<P>
"Our prospects for development hinge on our ability to mobilize
resources for that task, and on our ability to make that
mobilization sustainable," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Africa's debt burden, Meles said "obviously the debt burden
of Africa which has now reached over 350 billion U.S. dollars and
representing a debt stock to export ratio of well over 300
percent, is by consensus beyond debt sustainability."
</P>
<P>
ECA Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako recalled that the 1995
World Summit for Social Development ratified the plan to reduce
poverty in Africa by half by the year 2015, which requires a four
percent reduction in the number of people living in poverty each
year.
</P>
<P>
To reduce poverty by half by the year 2015, an average growth
rate of seven percent per year is required, he said, adding the
growth rate requires an investment rate equal to 33 percent of
gross domestic product, which in turn needs 15 percent of domestic
savings and nine percent of official development assistance.
</P>
<P>
Vijay S. Makhan, Assistant Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), said official development
assistance has fallen for six consecutive years, from 0.33 percent
of the combined gross national product (GNP) of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)--Development
Assistance Committee (DAC) donors in 1992 to 0.22 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is now less than one third of the agreed U.N. target of
0.7 percent of the GNP, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 participants, including ministers of finance,
ministers of economic planning and development and governors of
national banks, from 53 African countries as well as
representatives from U.N. agencies, inter- governmental and
bilateral partners sectors are attending the three-day meeting
which will focus on challenges of financing African development.

<HEADLINE> Financial Sector Moves Smoothly On Solving Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China's financial sector has won
initial success in solving Y2K, and is striving to reduce
financial risks aroused by the problem to the lowest possible
level.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank,
has so far allocated over five billion yuan to deal with the 2000
glitch, and is going to input more for related efforts, said Chen
Jing, director of PBOC's Payment and Technology Department.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's symposium sponsored by the Ministry of
Information Industry (MII), Chen said that China's banking system
has basically completed revisions, and is undergoing tests and
contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
He said that the financial sector plans to complete internal
system tests by May, settle contingency plans by June and end
closed-door testing by September.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the sector is strictly following the timetable set
by China's State Council on solving Y2K .
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi, the official in charge of China's Y2K panel, said
that PBOC started revising its computer systems in 1996, and is
the first Chinese organization to deal with the 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
An official with U.S. Federal Reserve said that the progress
made by China's financial sector is "beyond our estimation".
</P>
<P>
Chinese banks plan to conduct three comprehensive tests in
June, July and September, and suspend operations for a whole day
during the check. The specific schedule is now under approval of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that when the PBOC gets the approval for closed-door
tests, it will issue circulars nationwide, informing of the exact
testing date, business outlets and related business.
</P>
<P>
China will also enhance information transparency by releasing
information on the Financial News and Internet about China's
latest progress in solving the bug problem, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen noted that the job will become tougher as it
moves forward, especially in conducting closed-door tests and
settling contingency plans because of lacking of experience.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Sign Initiative on Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Seven African ministers signed an
initiative on water supply and management with the United Nations
Center for Human Settlements (Habitat) and the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) here Thursday, in a bid to address the
looming water crisis in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are from Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya,
Senegal, South Africa and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony, Klaus Toepfer, acting executive
director of Habitat and executive director of UNEP, announced that
he would soon set up an annual award for best practices in urban
water resource management.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer revealed that he was considering to appoint Goodwill
Ambassadors for Water in African Cities who could take the message
of conserving water for the urban poor to all parts of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is the first of its kind to help African
countries in managing the growing urban water crisis and protect
the continent's threatened water resources and aquatic systems
from the increasing volume of land-based pollution.
</P>
<P>
The project is a follow-up to the Cape Town Declaration in
1997, adopted by African ministers to address the urgent need for
managing water for African cities. It is also a joint initiative
of the Habitat and the UNEP within the framework of the U.N.
system-wide Special Initiative on Africa.
</P>
<P>
The project will be implemented in collaboration with the
ministers of water resources, environment and urban development in
the participating countries.
</P>
<P>
Other agencies involved in the project include the Water Supply
and Sanitation Collaborative Council, the Southern African
Development Community and the Water Utility Partnership for
Capacity Building in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to be funded by the German government
and the United Nations Foundation for International Partnerships.
</P>
<P>
The on-going 17th session of the Habitat Commission on Human
Settlements is focusing mainly on the revitalization of the
Habitat, work program and budget for the biennium 2000-2001,
security of tenure for all residents in cities.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Africa's Growth Prospects Better in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA) said here Thursday that Africa's
economic growth prospects in 1999 would be better than in 1998 and
forecasted that Africa's growth rate would increase to four
percent from 3.3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The "Economic Report on Africa in 1999" issued by the ECA said
the 3.3 percent growth rate in Africa last year, compared with 2.9
percent growth in 1997, was the highest among regions of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"For the fourth consecutive year, gross domestic product (GDP)
in Africa grew faster than population, contrasting markedly with a
decade and a half of declining per capita income," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
On performance at sub-regional level, the report said North
Africa doubled its growth rate from 2.1 percent in 1997 to 4.4
percent last year, while central African countries improved their
performance to 4.9 percent last year from 4.0 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"In the remaining three (regions), there was definite
deceleration in growth momentum," the report said, adding that
West Africa declined from 4. 1 percent to 3.6 percent, East Africa
from 2.8 percent to 2.5 percent and Southern Africa from 2.5
percent to 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
For sub-Saharan Africa, recovery was robust, at 2.6 percent,
from two percent in 1997, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Africa's 11 oil-exporting countries
obtained their 3.7 percent growth rate in 1998, compared with 3.6
percent in 1997, while 42 non-oil exporting countries increased
their growth rate from 2.3 percent in 1997 to 2.9 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The 33 least developed countries in Africa continued to
increase and deepen their growth momentum and they managed to
boost their growth to 4.1 percent in 1998 compared with 2.4
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Africa's agriculture grew by 3.5 percent compared with 1.7
percent of the previous period while industrial sector grew by 3.2
percent in 1998, down from 3.8 from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Africa's export revenue declined by 17 percent, down to 95.6
billion U.S. dollars in 1998. "For the first time in the decade
of the 1990s, the trade balance turned negative, boosting the
current account deficit to a high of 16.5 billion U.S. dollars,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Resource flows into Africa declined to three billion U.S.
dollars from 4. 5 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 as the result of
reduced private flows and bilateral credit, the report said. For
sub-Saharan African countries net transfers declined by nearly 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Africa's total debt was 350.1 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 and
the debt service at the same period was 35.7 billion dollars,
raising the debt service ratio to nearly 31 percent of goods and
service exports in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"If Africa is to reduce poverty by half over the next decade
and half, it would need to attain and sustain an average growth
rate of seven percent per annum," the report said, adding "this is
the major challenge for African policy-makers and their
development partners."

<HEADLINE> Thai Pork Safe to Eat: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai officials have said that pork
in the country is free from the Nipah virus, which is raging
through neighboring Malaysia's pig herds, and is safe to eat, The
Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Health and livestock officials made the remark after demand for
live pigs continued to nose-dive in the southern provinces of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Demand for pork in 14 southern provinces, especially the five
nearest to Malaysia, has slumped from as much as 20,000 head to
5,000 per month.
</P>
<P>
Officials said fears of a possible spread of the virus in
Thailand were unfounded and they urged the public to remain calm
over the reported disease incidents.
</P>
<P>
People in the southern provinces have been asked to avoid
purchasing live pigs or their by-products which have been smuggled
from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Agencies concerned have also taken several measures to cut the
smuggling of pigs and other animals including horses, cats, dogs
and goats from Malaysia.

BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Electronic-commerce in Thailand,
valued at 40 million baht (1.09 million U.S. dollars) last year,
will see a boost to 600 million baht (16.4 million dollars) by
2003, a seminar here was told Friday.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce, which includes every business transaction done
electronically in addition to on-line trading and on-line
shopping, has been adopted worldwide as a weapon by companies to
stay competitive, participants at the seminar on E-Commerce Law
agreed.
</P>
<P>
Many governments are lagging behind the private sector in this
regard, according to the seminar, which opened Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It also said that worldwide e-commerce transactions will be
worth 300 billion dollars by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Thai Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda, who attended
Thursday's meeting, said Thailand needs to step up efforts to meet
the world's new economic order by fully adopting e-commerce to
improve fiscal and monetary systems and production.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Thai government is working on six new laws on
e-commerce, consisting of E-Commerce Law, EDI Law, Privacy Data
Protection Law, Computer Crime Law, Electronics Digital Signature
Law, Electronics Fund Transfer Law and Universal Access Law.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has said he believed three of them
would be ready for consideration by the cabinet by the end of this
year.

equipment built in China over the past three years can save 15
billion cubic meters of water annually.
</P>
<P>
The 25 billion yuan put into the sector during that period has
helped expand the acreage of water-efficient irrigation area by 5.
6 million hectares, according to the Ministry of Water resources.
</P>
<P>
China has an acute shortage of water resources. The water used
for irrigation accounts for more than 70 percent of water use, but
only 40 percent of the water is really used effectively. Since
1996, China has increased efforts to save water and has spread the
use of water-saving irrigation in 300 counties, increasing the
amount of land by more than 1.3 million hectares annually.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Brokerages Urged to Get Y2K Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET)
could punish brokerage firms which fail to solve the Year 2000
computer problem, Somkid Jiranuntarat, SET senior vice president,
confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Somkid said brokerage firms could be suspended from trading
local securities if they fail to pass a system-wide Y2K testing
scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of SET member brokerages have already spent
about 150 million baht (4.1 million dollars) to upgrade computer
systems to cope with the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Regulators have placed a priority on guarding against
settlement and trading problems in the new year. Brokerages must
now submit monthly Y2K progress reports to the SET.
</P>
<P>
The SET has also asked listed companies to detail their Y2K
progress every quarter, to keep investors informed about the
potential risks in the event of computer failures, either
internally or with their trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The 400-plus listed companies are said to have spent 5.6
billion baht (153.4 million dollars) so far on solving the Y2K
problem. The SET estimates that between 70 percent and 80 percent
of the companies are now compliant.
</P>
<P>
The SET will run a test on May 22. It will be an industry-wide
test which will also involve external users and members. Another
round of tests is scheduled for January 1, 2000.

<HEADLINE> May 4th Movement's Spirit Never Out-Of-Date, Chinese Scholars Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS) held a forum today to mark the 80th anniversary of
the May 4th Movement.
</P>
<P>
Scholars attending the forum said they agree that the spirit of
the Movement will never go out of style and that it will influence
young Chinese for generations.
</P>
<P>
On May 4th, 1919, several thousand students from Beijing
University and a dozen other colleges, universities and schools
gathered in Tian'anmen Square to demonstrate and demand that
China's sovereignty and rights be fully respected. The movement
was firmly supported across the country and grew into an anti-
imperialist and anti-feudal political and cultural movement.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Wenhong, an associate research fellow in world history,
said at the forum that the democratic and scientific spirit
represented by the movement can benefit the current socialist
market process because free and fair competition and a scientific
way of thinking are basic market demands.
</P>
<P>
He said that the May 4th Movement showed the noble spirit of
sacrificing oneself for the whole of society and the people and
that this sense of responsibility and noble spirit should be
carried on.
</P>
<P>
A 34-year old scholar, Zhang Ximing, said at the forum that the
tradition, patriotism, and scientific and democratic spirit of the
May 4th Movement will be a valuable inheritance for all young
Chinese, while Wang Luolin, a vice-president of CASS, told the
forum that the essence of the May 4th Movement is patriotism: "At
present, when the reforms and opening-up are at a crucial period,
the younger generation should stir up their enthusiasm for
patriotism to advance the socialist modernization process."

LOS ANGELES, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Internet-related companies in
the United States received a total of 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in
venture capital in the first quarter, a market research firm said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Investments in net firms represented 58 percent of all venture
capital investment in the past quarter, said San Francisco-based

32 percent from a year ago.
</P>

According to VentureOne's earlier releases, venture capital
investments in the United States reached an all time high of 12.52
billion dollars in 1998. Information technology remained the
strongest component of investment growth, accounting for 62
percent of the dollars invested, raising 7.77 billion dollars in
more than 1,000 deals. Its strength was fueled largely by
investment in communications and information services companies,
the market research firm said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia Faces E-Commerce Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- As its Internet subscriber growth is
becoming the fastest in the world, Asia is warming to
electronic-commerce, which is projected to offer a great promise
to the region's economies.
</P>
<P>
Compared with their American and European counterparts, Asians
are lagging behind in the development of e-commerce at present.
</P>
<P>
While consumers and business purchasing goods and services over
the Internet in the West spent 50 billion dollars last year, a
mere 723 million dollars in on-line retail sales were booked in
the whole Asian region, according to the Internet market research
firm Keenan Vision.
</P>
<P>
But with the world's fastest growth in Internet subscribers,
Asia has great potential for e-commerce expansion. With 10.5
million Internet accounts, subscriber growth in non-Japan Asia is
rising 39 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
The Market research firm International Data Corp. estimated
that China will surpass Australia in 2001 as non-Japan Asia's top
Internet user and by the end of 2002 will have about 9.4 million
Internet users, up from a mere 1.4 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2002, Australia is expected to have 5.8 million
users up from just over 3 million now, while South Korea will be
the third biggest Internet user with about 4 million people
logging on, up from less than two million now.
</P>
<P>
With the fast development of Internet, e-commerce is expected
to grow significantly in the next few years, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey conducted by PwC for the World Economic
Forum, 60 percent of Asia's business executives said that
e-commerce will contribute more than 5 percent of their company's
total revenues by 2003, with one fifth projecting a revenue
contribution of over 20 percent, although e-commerce makes little
or non-contribution to their companies at present.
</P>
<P>
What has prompted Asia's business executives to promote
e-commerce? Some of them said e-commerce could sweep away market
inefficiencies, such as excessive transaction costs, asymmetric
information, and natural monopolies, breaking up arcane market
barriers.
</P>
<P>
As e-commerce is regarded as the future of business, Asians are
also getting pushed by Western companies demanding for business
over the Internet to save cost, they said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the recent Asian recession has made business
executives more aware than ever of the pressing need to cut their
costs, increase efficiency and stay in touch with their customers.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Asia's e-commerce expansion still faces great
challenges. Many developing economies in the region lack reliable
communications, and state-monopoly of telecommunications in some
countries leads to high cost for consumers. Legal frameworks and
taxation issues governing e-commerce are also uncertain.
</P>
<P>
There are other barriers to consumer e-commerce. Not many in
Asia have credit cards, and many prefer face-to-face buying and
most of the region is served by corner shops. For many Asian
banks, they mistrust on-line transactions, according to the
Economist weekly.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the importance of e-commerce and its challenges,
Asian countries are trying to remove these barriers. In Vietnam,
where just 15,000 people are on-line, the government has slashed
40 percent of access charges to make its use more affordable.
</P>
<P>
For years, India's telecommunications company VSNL charged its
customers 500 U.S. dollars for 500 hours of slow Internet service.
But recently, the government opened the market for competition,
10,000 subscribers signed up for rival Satyam Infoware's service.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that India's Internet subscribers could reach
10 million in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, law makers have adopted laws for e-commerce
activities and the government is encouraging people to use
Internet for business.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor, Singapore's
Singapore-One, and Hong Kong's brand new cyberport are examples of
major government-sponsored projects that demonstrated the
determination of Asian leaders to make the information technology
revolution, and e-commerce," said the Asian Business in its May
1999 issue.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Extensive Use of Briquette </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Myanmar official has called
for extensive use of briquette, a kind of firewood substitute
fuel, saying it is the most effective means for reduction of
firewood use as well as for conservation of forests in the
country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here Thursday of a committee for organizing
extensive use of the substitute fuel, Lt. Gen. Tin Oo, second
secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, said
plans were being drawn for the extensive use of the briquette in
the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need for extensive supply and utilization of
the firewood substitute fuel, calling for an end to felling of
trees.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar started a project of greening nine arid districts in
the central part of the country in 1993, designating 1995 as the
firewood substitute fuel year with some progress reportedly made
in the implementation.
</P>
<P>
Some departments have innovated and demonstrated some kinds of
stoves and solar-powered stoves as a substitute.
</P>
<P>
In addition, coal, paddy-husk and saw-dust briquette are also
being introduced as other kinds of substitute fuel.
</P>
<P>
Firewood, along with charcoal, has been used in Myanmar with an
annual consumption of more than 24 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The indiscriminate felling and cutting of trees including
firewood plantations for fuel and burning of charcoal have been
the cause of forest depletion in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's forest area is shrinking year by year, dropping by 7
percent compared with 36 years ago. The 1962 data showed that 57
percent of the country's total area was then covered by forests,
but the percentage dropped to 50 in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese demand for equipment used
for environmental protection is expected amount to 31 billion yuan
by 2010, according to a recent edition of China Reform News.
</P>
<P>
By then, spending on urban sewage treatment will reach 18
billion yuan, on urban garbage treatment, over 3 billion yuan, and
on water supplies, some 100 billion yuan, which will mean a very
large market for equipment.
</P>
<P>
Central government efforts to stimulate domestic demand has
also contributed to a booming market in environmental protection
equipment, the paper says.
</P>

<HEADLINE> A Tribute to Indonesian Badminton Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The sixth Sudirman Cup, to be held
in Denmark next week, may be less popular than the men's Thomas
Cup and the woman's Uber Cup, but Indonesia takes a special pride
in winning the trophy named after a national badminton hero.
</P>
<P>
But who was Sudirman?
</P>
<P>
Born in Pematang Siantar, North Sumatera, on April 29, 1922,
Sudirman was a pharmaceutical entrepreneur who became renowned for
his dedication to badminton.
</P>
<P>
"My involvement in badminton is a mission while my work in
pharmacy is a mere hobby," he once said.
</P>
<P>
Sudirman chaired the Badminton Association of Indonesia from
1952 to 1963 and from 1968 to 1981. During his tenure, Indonesia
reached the headiest heights of the sport time and time again.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won the Thomas Cup for the first time in 1958 and
regained it in 1975. Two years later Indonesia also clinched its
first Uber Cup trophy.
</P>
<P>
Under Sudirman, Indonesia emerged as the world's strongest
men's team, a team comprised of the magnificent seven of Rudy
Hartono, Liem Swie King, Iie Sumirat, Christian Hadinata, Ade
Chandra, Tjun Tjun and Johan Wahyudi.
</P>
<P>
Rudy, badminton's living legend, won a record eight All England
titles, seven of them in successive years from 1968 to 1974. He
last took the tournament's singles crown in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Sudirman was named a member of the International Badminton
Federation's (IBF) executive board in 1973 and went on to serve as
the organization's deputy chairman under Stellan Mohlin two years
later.
</P>
<P>
It was Sudirman, along with Mohlin and another leading
Indonesian figure in the badminton world Suharso Suhandinata, who
campaigned for a reconciliation of the two badminton federations,
the IBF and the World Badminton Federation. The two bodies were
reunited in 1980 and retained the name of the IBF.
</P>
<P>
Sudirman retired from the IBF in 1983 and died on June 10, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his death, he was awarded an IBF Distinguished
Service Award and the golden star for his devotion to badminton.
</P>
<P>
The accolades did not stop there, and to mark his contribution
to the development of the sport it was eventually decided to name
a mixed team cup in his honor. A number of European countries
lobbied to have the trophy named after Herbert Scheele, a former
IBF president, but eventually Indonesia prevailed and Sudirman
received the posthumous honor many thought fitting to his
contribution to the sport.
</P>
<P>
The Sudirman Cup, which cost 27 million rupiah (then worth
approximately 13,500 U.S. dollars) was crafted by Rusnandi, a
student at Bandung Institute of Technology. The design features a
replica of Borobudur temple atop the body of a shuttlecock.

Meeting in Bangkok to conduct a survey of the two countries'
common boundary which stretches 2,096 kilometers.
</P>

<P>
MOSCOW, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Latvian Foreign Ministry hailed
the disarmament of Russia Thursday in its northwest border area.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry said Russia's move has conformed
with the historical tide following the cold war's end, and it has
been helpful in boosting trust among European countries.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev was quoted by a Latvian

He said 19 percent of the North Fleet and 29 percent of the
Baltic Sea Fleet had also been trimmed, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the military forces in the northwest of Russia
were only of a "defensive" nature after the disarmament and would
not pose any threat to neighboring countries.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has formulated a National
Film Policy to restore the film industry to its "pristine glory"
through far reaching policy changes, said a press release from the

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Condemn NATO's Air War on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and
his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin on Thursday denounced NATO's
air war against Yugoslavia in a statement issued at the southern
Ukrainian port of Sevastopol, hoping to restore peace to the
Balkans, the Ukrainian Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Sevastopol, where the Black Sea fleet is
located, celebrated its 55th anniversary of Germany's defeat.
Yeltsin dispatched Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev to attend the
celebration and sent a congratulatory message.
</P>
<P>
He said in the message that upon entrance into the 21st century,
the fate of people cannot be decided by force. NATO's aggression
against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia has cast the shadow of
war over Europe. It has also resulted in the death and casualties
of innocent civilians, to which those who have experienced the
horror of war cannot turn a blind eye.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president noted that as times are no longer what
they used to be, people should not only value peace but also work
toward it. People should not handle interstate relationships on
the basis of "narrow-minded will" but on the internationally-
acknowledged principles stipulated in the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma pointed out that Ukraine has suffered great losses and
sacrifices during the past wars and understands the sharp
conflicts between war and peace. He called on all countries
involved in armed conflicts to act cautiously and be responsible
for their deeds.
</P>
<P>
He noted that historical mistakes should not be repeated in the
Balkans since all arguments and rhetoric will not be able to
justify human suffering, deaths and tears.
</P>
<P>
He also affirmed that Ukraine would not get involved in the
Kosovo military conflict.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on Thursday
passed legislation which would lift Depression-era barriers and
let banks, securities firms and insurance companies get more
deeply into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
Senators voted 54-44 for the bill on a party-line basis.
</P>
<P>
The bill includes a provision that would make it a federal
crime for anyone to misrepresent himself to obtain someone's
private financial data.
</P>
<P>
In principle, the Clinton administration supports the
legislation. But it has threatened a presidential veto of the bill
unless there are major changes, including the removal of
provisions that Democrats view as an attack on the 1977 Community
Reinvestment Act.
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the financial overhaul legislation maintain it is
needed to keep the U.S. financial industry competitive in global
markets and that it would save consumers millions by providing one-
stop financial shopping.
</P>
<P>
In a setback for the administration Wednesday, the Senate
defeated, 52-45, an amendment that would have removed the
provisions.
</P>
<P>

bolster consumers' rights when banks and other financial companies
seek to share or sell information about them.

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Project Appraisal System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China is trying to improve its
project evaluation expertise by introducing a project selection
and appraisal system to avoid duplication of construction as well
as reducing investment risks, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
An international seminar on project analyses held on May 6 in
Beijing pioneered the move.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar Edward Merrow, president of the U.S-based
Independent Project Analysis Inc (IPA), pledged to bring the most
advanced project selection, development and execution practices to
China.
</P>
<P>
Merrow introduced approaches and systems known as PES and
benchmarking to participants at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was sponsored by the China National Chemical
Construction Corp.(CNCCC) and Beijing Mairuo Industry Technical
Consulting Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Chen Lihua, president of CNCCC, said blind investment and
duplication of projects had caused overcapacity and affected
profitability.
</P>
<P>
"Project evaluation and scientific analysis are a very
important challenge for domestic enterprises seeking durable
profits," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many domestic enterprises, especially state-owned ones,
suffered losses upon completion of projects into which they had
injected huge amounts of fund.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed this to the lack of a standardized
feasibility studies and analysis prior to construction.
</P>
<P>
The central government is taking tough measures to overhaul the
management of some large state-owned enterprises and requiring
newly-appointed corporate leaders to take full responsibility for
the investment they make.
</P>
<P>
Meng Quansheng, director of the Planning and Development
Department of the State Administration of Petroleum and Chemical
Industries, said that reliable project evaluation and accurate
forecast are "absolutely indispensable" for the strengthening of
structural adjustment in the industry as well as improvement of
project management level.

<HEADLINE> Aquiculture Boosts Paddy Field Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Aquatics like crustaceans, grass
carps, chubs, soft-shelled turtles, crabs and eels are now bred
not only in ponds but also in paddy fields in more and more
Chinese rural areas.
</P>
<P>
A technology to develop the aquiculture in paddy fields has
found growing favor among Chinese farmers, especially those living
in eastern and central-southern parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Agrotechnicians of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
believe that popularizing the technology could help increase
farmers' income by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The technology was developed some 30 years ago but it was only
put into large-scale application in recent few years, said Shen
Zufang, an official of the aquiculture bureau of the province.
</P>
<P>
Considering the advantages, aquatic breeding could help
fertilize the paddy fields and help make water oxidization, which
will lead to increased output.
</P>
<P>
Even better, pests in paddy fields are the ideal food for
aquatic creatures, helping reduce the production costs by a big
margin, said Shen Zufang.
</P>
<P>
Farmers rarely spray pesticides or scatter fertilizers in the
paddy fields used for aquatic produce, thus both the rice and
acquatic produce are not contaminated and sell well.
</P>
<P>
The technology has been widely used in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan,
Hubei, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang Provinces and brings in
relatively stable economic returns for local farmers.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu Province, one of the country's leading forces in
agricultural advancement, has set an example for other
agricultural producers across the country with its success.
</P>
<P>
Paddy fields cultivated for aquatic products in the province
has risen to the current 133,333 hectares from the 96,666 hectares
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Output value of local aquatic products in paddy fields hit 3.38
billion yuan in 1998, including 1.66 billion yuan of profits.
</P>
<P>
Average economic returns for each mu (one hectare is equal to
15 mu) were 1,145 yuan for the aquatic products, with the figure
for the breeding of soft-shelled turtle and crabs as much as 2,700
yuan.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Police Reports 14 Missing in Guerrilla Ambush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen Colombian police
agents were reportedly missing on Thursday after being ambushed by
a group of armed guerrilla forces in the northeastern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities said the ambush was carried out by the
Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC), the country's largest
and oldest guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
They said the guerrillas blew up several mines planted on the
road of police patrols in the northeastern city of Pensilvania and
then continued the attack with guns.
</P>
<P>
The alleged action of the FARC happened on the same day when
the Colombian government and the FARC resumed their peace talks to
seek an end to the longest armed conflict in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old war has cost the South American country at
least 35,000 lives. The government and the 15,000-member FARC
group started the peace talks in January, which however were
suspended later.

JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Sports Council (KONI)
chairman Wismoyo Arismunandar Thursday hoped that the Indonesian
badminton squad would be able to pick up the prestigious Sudirman
Cup for the sake of the national pride of the ailing country.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo bade farewell at his office to the Indonesian badminton
squad who are bound for the Sudirman Cup and the World
Championship in Copenhagen, Denmark, on May 10-22.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been desperately struggling to recover from the
ongoing unfortunate political and monetary condition.
</P>
<P>
A win, Wismoyo said, will mean the badminton players will
deserve another award, this time for being able to the country's
dignity which, along with the Indonesian rupiah, has taken a nose
dive over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"You must prove you can do it," Wismoyo said in his reception
speech.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia won the trophy in Jakarta in 1989 when the biennial
mixed event tournament commenced. So far it is the only occasion
for triumph for the country which founded the tournament.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sets up Anti-Drug Base in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadorian port city of Manta is
becoming a strategic place for the U.S. anti-narcotic war, as the
Pacific coast city has lately been used as one of the U.S. Army's
anti-drug centers in Latin America, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The reports confirmed that the first American plane arrived in
Manta last Saturday. On Thursday afternoon, a group of 25 persons -
- army officials and members of the U.S. Anti-drug Agency -- are
expected to arrive at the air base.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. diplomat in Quito, Curtis Struble, said that Manta will
be used to land American aircraft that were previously used in
Panama localities.
</P>
<P>
The United States chose Manta as the anti-drug center after
negotiations failed with Panama's government on operating U.S.
surveillance equipment from the Panamanian isthmus.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Ecuador and the United States, signed in
December 1998, has been in force since April 1. The agreement has
a duration of six months, during which there will be an attempt to
negotiate another 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
The center of anti-narcotic operations for the U.S. Army in
Panama ended their activities Wednesday in order to move to other
places throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
The United States is also establishing similar operation
centers in the Caribbean islands of Aruba and Curazao.

JINAN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
decided to put the provincial government and all its departments
on the Internet by August, according to a provincial government
source.
</P>
<P>
The source says that this is part of China's ambitious campaign
to increase government presence at all levels.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial plan, all government offices at the
provincial level in Shandong will have their own websites by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The move was started by the State Economic and Trade Commission,
the Ministry of Information Industry, and other ministries to
share their information resources with each other and to improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission opened a website on
December 1, 1998, and an increasing number of visitors have
expressed their opinions on the site on everything from
environmental pollution to a medical insurance system.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government made its debut earlier this
year with a website called Window on the Capital that provides
information about the economic situation, job possibilities, and
air-quality reports. The Guangzhou and Shenzhen governments in
Guangdong Province have also opened trial websites.

<HEADLINE> More People In Beijing Applying For Individual Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's City Commercial Bank was
the first bank to offer individual loans to consumers this March
and more than 200 people went to a participating shopping center,
Parkson, in the first month to apply for the loan.
</P>
<P>
The bank's Yanjing branch has provided 270,000 yuan (32,500 U.S.
dollars) worth of loans and 10 other branches recently signed
similar contracts with 16 large department stores.
</P>
<P>
The new spending pattern has been advertised as "spending
tomorrow's money for today's dream", but a lot of people can still
not get used to it because it is so different. The Chinese have
always been quite frugal and careful about every penny. "We used
to be encouraged to add to our bank savings as much as we could,
but now we are being asked to borrow money from the bank and being
told that consuming more will help the economy. It is really hard
for me to accept," said one middle-aged woman.
</P>
<P>
Bank personnel point out that, in applying for loans, customers
need a stable income to cover the loan. Most loans are used to buy
computers. A 9,800-yuan computer requires a down payment of 2,000
yuan, and, with monthly installments of 300 yuan with the interest
added in, the total over a two-year period comes to 10,352 yuan.
</P>
<P>
This is both affordable and worthwhile, one female customer, a
teacher, said, because the computer will undoubtedly increase
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Most people applying have a monthly income of around 1,000 yuan
and are applying for 2 to 5-year loans that range from 8,000 to 10,
000 yuan.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's first futures
commodities exchange will begin operation in August this year
after several delays in its opening, The Jakarta Post reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president of state-owned commodities clearing house PT
Kliring and Jaminan Bursa Komoditi A. Djunaidi said preparations
for the operation of the futures exchange were completed.
</P>
<P>
The futures exchange will be called Indonesia Futures Exchange
(IFEX) and will have its trading floor at the Menara Kadin
building in South Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"IFEX will be legally established by the public notary in
mid-May," he said.
</P>
<P>
PT Kliring, which operates as the clearing house for the
existing commodities exchange, is one of the main sponsors of the
futures exchange.
</P>
<P>
Other sponsors include the Association of Indonesian Coffee
Exporters and the Federation of Indonesian Vegetable Oil and Fat
Associations.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the futures exchange had been scheduled for the
beginning of 1998 but was postponed several times.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1999 government regulation on the IFEX, the bourse
needs at least 11 members before it can be established.
</P>
<P>
"To date there are about 30 companies who have registered to be
IFEX members," Djunaidi said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Presidential Decree No. 12/1999, palm oil and coffee
can be traded on the exchange.

JAKARTA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's three Advanced Mobile
Phone System (AMPS) operators have joined forces in competing with
operators in other systems, The Jakarta Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The three AMPS operators are PT Komselindo, PT Metrosel
Nusantara and PT Telesera.
</P>
<P>
Komselindo director for marketing and business development Zen
Smith said that under an agreement signed early last month, the
three companies, which operate in different locations, would share
transmission facilities to enable them to expand their coverage
area.
</P>
<P>
The three AMPS operators will be better equipped to compete
with operators in other systems which offer wide coverage.
</P>
<P>
"We can now offer more value-added services to our subscribers
because this cooperation will enable us to improve our coverage
nationwide without massive investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Previously, AMPS subscribers could only use their cellular
phones in the areas covered by their operators. They had to change
to other operators if they went to other regions.
</P>
<P>
Under the cooperation agreement, AMPS subscribers will be able
to use their mobile phones in all areas served by the three
companies.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has seven cellular phone providers operating three
systems: AMPS, the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM)
and the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT).
</P>
<P>
AMPS currently has some 101,000 subscribers, accounting for 12
percent of the country's 900,000 cellular subscribers. Over 80
percent of mobile phone users in Indonesia are GSM subscribers.

<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Two major Chinese securities firms,
Guotai Securities Co. Ltd. and the Jun'an Securities Co. Ltd.
today announced a merger plan that will result in the largest
securities firm in the country.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai-based Guotai had net assets of 1.55 billion yuan by
the end of 1998, making it the fifth largest securities firm in
China, and Shenzhen-based Jun'an is now the second largest, with
assets of 1.86 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The new firm will have assets of 3.4 billion yuan, well above
Shanghai's Shenyin &AMP; Wanguo Securities Co. Ltd., China's top
securities now, which has assets of 2.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guotai had profits of 735 million yuan in 1998, while Jun'an
ranks 9th, with profits of 290.7 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The merger was approved at a general conference of shareholders
of the two companies on April 13. Analysts here say that it means
a reshuffling of the market, with the country's first securities
law expected to take effect in less than two months and the
capital market set to open to foreign competition because China's
membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) seems to be only
a little ways away from approval.

<HEADLINE> Italian Coach 'Offered England Job' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Former AC Milan boss Fabio Capello
was made an offer for the job of England coach, an Italian
newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Capello could become the first foreigner to
manage England if Kevin Keegan decides not to continue once his
current tenure ends.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper claimed that FA Technical Director Howard
Wilkinson made him an offer during a visit to Milan on 21 April -
the day before Manchester United's European Cup match with
Juventus.
</P>
<P>
Capello is still under contract to the Italian Serie A side,
despite being replaced as manager last summer.
</P>
<P>
The Gazzetta reported that if England failed to qualify for
Euro 2000 by losing its forthcoming qualifying matches against
Sweden and Bulgaria, Keegan would return to coaching Fulham and
the Italian would get the job.
</P>
<P>
Keegan has expressed interest in staying on as England manager,
but he has yet to make it clear if that means under his current"
part-time arrangement, which allows him to continue coaching
recently-promoted Fulham, or if he is prepared to make a full-time
commitment.
</P>
<P>
As coach at Milan, Capello took four Italian league
championships and the 1994 European Cup. He also managed Spanish
side Real Madrid to championship victory.
</P>
<P>
He returned to AC Milan for a less successful tenure in 1997-8
that saw him replaced by current manager Alberto Zaccheroni.
</P>
<P>
Milan are currently lying second in Serie A behind leaders
Lazio.

<HEADLINE> Ginola Takes Player of the Year Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur striker David
Ginola has been voted Footballer of the Year by the Football
Writers' Association.
</P>
<P>
He adds it to his recent player of the year award from the
Professional Footballers' Association, repeating Dennis Bergkamp's
FWA-PFA double last year.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham's French winger beat the Manchester United duo of
Dwight Yorke and David Beckham into second and third place.
</P>
<P>
Despite helping Spurs win the Worthington Cup and secure a
place in the UEFA Cup, Ginola said he was amazed the award had not
gone to a player from a team in contention for the Premiership
title.
</P>
<P>
"I am absolutely thrilled. This is a great honour not only for
me, but also for Tottenham Hotspur," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The writers asked me - 'what is your feeling to be alongside
Stanley Matthews, Bobby Charlton, players like that?' - and I'm
very proud."
</P>
<P>
Tottenham manager George Graham said: "David has had an
excellent season for Spurs and has exhibited his class and talent.
</P>
<P>
"People love to see individuals. When he runs at defenders he
is unstoppable. He has been a big bonus for Tottenham, " he added.
</P>
<P>
It is the fifth year in succession that the award has gone to a
foreign player, with Bergkamp getting the nod in 1998, Gianfranco
Zola in 1997, Eric Cantona in 1996 and in Jurgen Klinsmann 1995.
</P>
<P>
England captain Alan Shearer was the last English player to win
it, taking the award in 1994.

LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea star Gianfranco Zola has
admitted that he may be coming to the end of his illustrious
career.
</P>
<P>
"Next season might be my last as a player," The London Evening
Standard newspaper quoted the 32-year-old as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We will see because from now on I have to consider my
condition and my strength.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately it is getting harder and harder. At the end of
next season I am going to make a decision because it is very
important to give my best and if I can't give something to the
team, then it might be the right moment to give up."
</P>
<P>
The Italian international was signed for Chelsea in 1996 by
then boss Ruud Gullit.
</P>
<P>
He has scored 13 league goals for Chelsea this season. His
goals and assists have helped the London side qualify for next
season's European Champions League.

WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Philadelphia 76ers president Pat

According to a press report here today, Croce had promised to

</P>
<P>
Croce got the haircut Thursday as the Sixers prepared for their
first-round series against Orlando. It was the latest stunt by the
self-made millionaire whose antics and enthusiasm finally have
been rewarded with a successful season.
</P>

On Wednesday night, Croce surprised everyone when he slid down

<HEADLINE> China to Make Full Use of Crop Stalks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China will launch a pilot project in
five provinces to promote comprehensive utilization of crop stalks
in order to save energy and protect the environment, according to
the Ministry of Science and Technology (MST).
</P>
<P>
The new program will be initiated in Hebei, Henan, Shandong,
Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces this year, the Modern Agriculture
Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
Han Deqian, vice minister of the MST, was quoted by the
newspaper as saying the ministry will list the program as one of
the key projects this year and will change the old heavily
polluting method of burning crop stalks in the five provinces
within two years.
</P>
<P>
China now turns out some 600 million tons of crop stalks each
year, 20 percent of which are burned as garbage.
</P>
<P>
The MST has been devoted to addressing the issue for nearly two
decades and has worked out a number of solutions including the
application of crop stalks as manure, fodder, and raw materials
for the chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have also developed a technique of using
crop stalks to generate electricity in Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The technique now is being applied by the Huagang Rice
Corporation Ltd. in Putian in eastern Fujian Province.

<HEADLINE> Playoff Preview: Knicks, Heat Highlight First Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Following is the Playoff preview
from the Sporting News here today:
</P>
<P>
Western Conference
</P>
<P>
San Antonio vs Minnesota: No one is playing with greater
confidence or purpose than San Antonio right now, and no one out
West has more of the necessary ingredients -- size, post power,
defense rebounding differential -- for postseason success. The
Spurs are a gathering storm, and no eight seed is going to change
that reality. Though the Wolves held Tim Duncan to 14 points per
game in their four encounters (2-2 split), three of those games
were played during the bygone Stephon Marbury era.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles vs Houston: Proof that two negatives can make a
positive. Both teams had disappointing seasons, both are still
searching for the best way to play, both are still trying to
incorporate their big acquisitions, both could be facing roster
makeovers after their elimination.
</P>
<P>
We do love our subplots. In the end, it will come down to the
basic playoff elements: Who makes stops, who makes shots --
particularly in crunch time of Game 5. Just a hunch, but the
Rockets have more guys equipped to make plays. But if it comes
down to one shot, make-or-miss to advance, the ball's in Kobe's
hands, all bets are off. Houston in five.
</P>
<P>
Utah vs. Sacramento: The Kings wanted the sixth seed so that
they would match up with Utah. They played them well enough during
the regular season, taking the Jazz into overtime three times (
winning one). Jazz sweep.
</P>
<P>
Portland vs. Phoenix: It is the third-best rebounding against
the one ranked 22nd., and that should decide it. Perhaps Rex
Chapman can return to a previous postseason incarnation and drive
J.R. Rider off the deep end. But there are too many unfavorable
matchups here for Phoenix, and too much quality length for it to
deal with. Damon Stoudamire says the Suns will never win a title
with Jason Kidd at point guard, because he is playing all by
himself. Blazers in four.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Conference:
</P>
<P>
Miami vs. New York: This is the most intriguing encounters of
the first round, because it's one of few one-vs-eight matchups in
which most folks actually favor the underdog. If Patrick Ewing has
problem with his sore Achilles, New York will be dead. Heat in
five typically grueling games.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta vs. Detroit: The Hawks are more stable. If Mookie
Blaylock stays under control, they'll play good defense, and
they'll run the most predictable stuff in the league. Grant Hill
will be a big factor. Piston in four.
</P>
<P>
Orlando vs. Philadelphia: This is a series Orlando should get,
but it hasn't distinguished itself on the road (12-13) this year,
so it had better not muff one of the first two. The Sixers are an
admirable little pack, composed of one uncoachable pocket rocket
who gets every shot and an abundance of tough-minded role players,
but if it comes down to stopping just one score, Chuck Daly will
find a way. Orlando in four.
</P>
<P>
Indiana vs. Milwaukee: Indiana was just bore. No team in the
East comes close to matching its depth, its length, its halfcourt
execution, its shooting ability. But Bucks led the conference in
scoring with 46 percent shooting, and they were the best team in
the league from the arc. They're a physical wreck right now,
however, with Glenn Robinson nursing a knee and Sam Cassell still
hobbled by an ankle. Pacers sweep.

MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in

Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The World Bank, which is prepared to extend up to 1.5
billion U.S. dollars in loans to the Philippines through the year
2002, said Thursday it supports the government's strategy of
restoring economic growth while reducing poverty.
</P>

Business World:

monetary authorities to encourage banks to increase their lending,
bank loans fell again in March, the Central Bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Post:

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Exports Boost Current Account Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Robust exports coupled with slowing
imports helped boost a surplus in the current account of the
Philippines, the Manila Times said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, governor of the Central Bank, was quoted as
saying that the current account surplus rose to 570 million U.S.
dollars in January 1999, 10 times higher than 57 million U.S.
dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The hefty current account surplus pushed the balance of
payments to a surplus of 881 million U.S. dollars, a turnaround
from the deficit of 145 million U.S. dollars in January 1998, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The current account is made up largely of the balance of trade
in goods and services, including transfers, profit remittances and
interest payments.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports grew by 22 percent in January to 2.6
billion U.S. dollars as the weak peso makes local goods cheaper
abroad, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, imports fell by 12.7 percent to 2.4 billion U.S.
dollars as demand for goods made overseas becomes more expensive
due to the depreciated local currency, it said.
</P>
<P>
Weak domestic demand caused manufacturers to lower the
importation of raw materials for their production, the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Hit by 519 Earthquakes So Far This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua has recorded a total of
519 earthquakes this year, of which 473 took place in the Pacific
Ocean and only 12 were felt by the population.
</P>
<P>
These quakes were a result of tectonic plates Coco and Caribe
colliding, Zoila Hernandez, an expert from the Nicaraguan
Institute of Territorial Studies (INETER), explained.
</P>
<P>
The seismologist indicated the probabilities of a seaquake
occurring on the Pacific Ocean's coast were minimal due to the
surface and the low strength of the quakes reported.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said that INETER will provide information and
training to the heads and directors of various centers of study,
to prevent greater disasters following a natural phenomenon such
as an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"The population must be certain that Nicaragua is a seismic
country and it needs to create a culture of prevention before
natural disasters occur," she added.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican National Counsel of
Population (CONAPO) said Thursday that Mexico's population will
reach 100 million in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
CONAPO predicted that in the first 10 years of the forthcoming
century, the population in Mexico will top 112 million, while by
year 2050 it will be 131 million.
</P>
<P>
A study in perspective said the average life span of Mexicans
in the middle of the 21st century would be 84 years, nine years
longer compared with the current life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed a tendency toward a lower birth rate
among Mexican women following increased family planning.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, one Mexican woman will have an average of 2.1
children; that figure will be reduced to 1.7 in the following
years of the new millennium.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives
on Thursday approved a 13.1 billion U.S. dollar package to pay for
the air war against Yugoslavia and increase the nation's military
readiness.
</P>
<P>
The move would more than double the six billion dollars
requested by President Bill Clinton last month to continue the war
until September and care for the refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Most of the bill will be paid for from this year's expected
federal surplus of 111 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has not produced its own version of the legislation.
GOP leaders there have said they prefer a package closer in size
to Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the House and Senate may reach a compromise
of about nine billion dollars next week.

<HEADLINE> Modern Urban District Taking Shape in Shanghai's Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Pudong New Area, a
rising financial and trade zone, has maintained an average annual
economic growth rate of 21 percent for nine consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show its gross domestic product (GDP had increased
to 70.9 billion yuan last year from only six billion yuan nine
years ago.
</P>
<P>
With around 8.3 percent of Shanghai's total area and 10 percent
of the municipal population, Pudong accounted for 20 percent of
the city's value of GDP last year.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth rate for all of Shanghai was 10.1 percent while
the national figure was 7.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute Pudong's fast growth to an improved business
environment and the high quality of overseas-funded enterprises
based in the area.
</P>
<P>
Since it was set up in 1990, the Pudong New Area has already
completed ten major infrastructure projects, with another ten
under construction, including an international airport, a subway
and a pedestrian tunnel across the Huangpu River that separates
the area from downtown Shanghai. At least 200 billion yuan has
been used for infrastructure construction to date.
</P>
<P>
The framework of a financial, trade and manufacturing center is
taking shape in the area.
</P>
<P>
Pudong now has 72 overseas-funded financial institutions and
108 foreign trade firms set up by corporations from other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Investors from more than 60 foreign countries and regions have
launched more than 5,400 projects in Pudong, with total investment
hitting 28 billion U.S. dollars. Eighty-eight of the top 500
multinationals in the world have opened 140 subsidiaries in the
area.
</P>
<P>
These projects cover such sectors as telecommunications,
electric appliances, biological engineering, automobiles,
computers, machinery and electronics, turning the area into a new
and high-tech industrial center of the city.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is now focusing on becoming an international center of
finance, trade, tourism, and conference and exhibition in the
coming century.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Bank Loans Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite policy moves by the
Philippine government and monetary authorities to encourage banks
to increase their lending, bank loans fell again in March, the
Business World newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Central Bank were quoted as saying that total
loans released by local banks shrank by 0.72 percent on an annual
basis in March, after dropping by 0.16 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The continued contraction has become a worrisome issue for the
government, which is hoping for an increase in bank lending to
speed up the country's economic recovery this year, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the goal, the government has pursued a policy of
lower interest rates since last year to encourage banks to lend to
business.
</P>
<P>
Despite the overall decline in bank lending, the Central Bank
sees some positive signs, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Loans to the private sector, comprising 79 percent of the net
domestic credit, fell by only 4.17 percent during March, compared
with a decline of 5.37 percent in February.
</P>
<P>
Loan quality, not profits, is still the main issue for bank
credit right now, analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of Representatives
on Thursday approved a 13.1 billion U.S. dollar package to pay for
the air war against Yugoslavia and increase the nation's military
readiness.
</P>
<P>
The measure, approved by a vote of 311 to 105, would more than
double the six billion dollars requested by President Bill Clinton
last month to persist the war until September and care for the
refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Most of the bill will be paid for from this year's expected
federal surplus of 111 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has not produced its own version of the legislation.
The Republican leaders there have said they prefer a package
closer in size to Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
Congressional leaders have set a May 14 deadline for final
passage. Analysts say that the House and Senate would reach a
compromise of about nine billion dollars next week.
</P>
<P>
The House-approved package includes three billion dollars for
spare parts, depot maintenance and to address other service
shortages, 1.8 billion dollars for a military pay raise and more
than one billion dollars for military construction.

<HEADLINE> Tamed White Storks Returned to Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Three tamed white storks in the
Xianghai Nature Reserve, northeast China's Jilin Province, have
recently been returned to nature.
</P>
<P>
They are now contentedly living with their wild cousins and
looks as though the may even start breeding together. The managers
of the reserve said that the three birds, which were raised in
captivity, were used for study soon after they were born.
</P>
<P>
The reserve made a decision last winter to release the birds
back into the wild this spring.
</P>
<P>
White storks, just one kind of wading bird, are under the
state's first-class protection. One manager revealed that about 50
wild white storks have visited the reserve every year in the past
dozen or so years.
</P>
<P>
The reserve has also set up taming labs for rare birds
including red-crown cranes and golden eagles. They gained success
in helping the white storks with the reproduction in 1989, and the
reproduction between the tamed red-crown cranes and the wild ones
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, with an area of 105,467 hectares, was ranked among
the state-level reserves in 1986. And the number of bird species
in the reserve have now reached 286 from the 175 in the beginning,
and species of animals including Mongolian gazelles and roe deer
now number 37.

<HEADLINE> Tracks of South China Tiger Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese scientific survey group
found the tracks of a south China tiger during a recent trip to
Fobao primeval forest in southwest Chin.
</P>
<P>
In late April, the 12-member survey team saw a dozen new paw
prints of what is reckoned to be a tiger when it came to a
vegetable plot at a mountainous area which covers a 600 square
kilometer area at the juncture of Sichuan and Guizhou provinces
and Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
A forest worker named Tao Jiahai told team members that he had
heard the sounds of an animal at night a few days before the
arrival of the survey team and saw a string of tiger footprints
the following morning.
</P>
<P>
Yang Changgang, from Xinqian Village in Guizhou Province, told
team members he had seen the remains of four sheep which he
assumed had been eaten by a tiger in January last year.
</P>
<P>
An earlier study reported that wild tigers have been completely
extinct in China since 1960s but this exciting discovery suggests
that may not be the case.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are only 53 South China tigers still in
existence, all of them in 21 Chinese zoos and most are sick,
handicapped or aged.
</P>
<P>
The South China tiger is rarer than the Giant Panda and is
listed among the 10 species in extreme danger of extinction by
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
It was usually found in Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Fujian
provinces. In the 1950s, China had more than 4,000 of them but 675
were killed by illegal hunters between 1952 and 1964.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Tackle Acid Rain in Pearl River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 7 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to tackle the acid rain
problem in the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong Province in south
China has decided not to build any more coal consuming power
plants in the area.
</P>
<P>
All cities in the area have begun to take measures to control
exhaust emission by motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 23 million tons of sulfur dioxide are
discharged into the atmosphere in China every year, causing acid
rain to fall over 40 percent of the nation's territory, according
to the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
A report from the Provincial Environmental Protection
Monitoring Center said that the Pearl River Delta in south China
has been seriously plagued by acid rain in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong
Province, had more frequent occurrences of acid rain last year,
with an average rate of about 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall with a pH (a measure of acidity and alkalinity) lower
than 5.6 is regarded as acid rain in China.
</P>
<P>
High-sulfur coal fuel consumption by thermal power plants and
exhaust emission by motor vehicles are believed to be the main
causes of acid rain in the area. From Shenzhen to Zhuhai, a
coastal city in Guangdong, there are 10 large thermal power plants.
</P>
<P>
So far, 17 cities in Guangdong and all cities in the delta have
been included into the State's acid rain control plan.

GENEVA, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Association of South
East Asian Nations (ASEAN) have reaffirmed their support for
Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand to become the new
director-general of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
In a statement delivered at the Thursday meeting of WTO's
ruling General Council, the ASEAN countries said that they support
the formal proposal made by Kenya on Tuesday to form consensus
around Supachai because there is now no chance to build consensus
on the other contender, Michael Moore of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Still divided over which of the two candidates would be their
new leader, trade envoys of the 134-member WTO ended the
six-hour-long meeting, mainly on procedural matters, with no
result and no date for the next meeting set.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made public here Tuesday, former
Director-General Renato Ruggiero, whose four-year term of office
expired on April 30, expressed disappointment that his successor
has not yet been selected.
</P>
<P>
"This organization needs now a director-general who is fully
empowered to help the preparation for the ministerial conference
and the subsequent negotiations," said Ruggiero. "I emphasize that
the strength of this organization is largely based on our reaching
decisions by consensus and it appears to me that there is no
reason why a consensus could not be reached on this issue."
</P>
<P>
On April 30, Ruggiero selected WTO Services Director David
Hartridge to handle the day to day affairs of the secretariat
until the new director-general assumes office.

The credit will provide quick-disbursing budget support to
allow the government of Albania to resume critical public
expenditures which were frozen to allow for the unbudgeted
expenditures incurred as a result of the massive inflow of
refugees since NATO launched airstrikes against Yugoslavia in
March 1999, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It also will help alleviate the budgetary pressure as a
consequence of increased demands on the government and of revenue
losses which will result from the continuing crisis.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the project will safeguard Albania's functioning
public institutions during the period of crisis so that the
adopted reform agenda can be maintained, and help the government
maintain macroeconomic stabilization during a period where serious
shocks will affect orderly economic activities, put exceptional
demands on public expenditures, while reducing possibilities for
revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
The budget support provided by the credit will disburse through
the Public Expenditure Support Program set up in response to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association, a member of the World Bank, and will be payable in 40
years, including a 10-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economists See Easing of Global Economic Slides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Global economic slides are
easing; multilateral lending institutions are playing a favorable
role in Asia; and China is the most attractive Asian market in
1999 from the standpoint of U.S. exporting.
</P>
<P>
These are some of the results of two economic outlook surveys
released Thursday by the Business Council, a voluntary association
representing a broad range of large American corporations from all
major industries and regions. The 300-member council meets three
times a year for the free exchange of ideas among themselves and
representatives of the government.
</P>
<P>
One of the released surveys was among the council membership,
and the other was a consensus forecast of business economists who
serve as technical consultants to the Business Council.
</P>
<P>
"A large majority of active Business Council members believe
the worst of the global economic downturn is now over, a sentiment
shared nearly unanimously by the panel of economists," said the
council.
</P>
<P>
About half of the council members and economists believe the
prospects for business activity in the United States are
"stronger" in 1999, relative to 1998. And about half feel the
prospects are "little changed." They also have a mixed view of the
prospects for business activity outside the United States in 1999,
compared to 1998, although a majority of the council members
expect "little change."
</P>
<P>
The probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession at
some point over the next two years is less than 50 percent,
according to a large majority of the economists. Over the next 10
years, a large majority of economists and a majority of council
members expect the average inflation rate to be between 2 percent
and 2.9 percent in the United States -- only modestly higher than
the current rate.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Asia, half of the economists have a favorable
overall assessment of the role that multilateral lending
institutions are playing in the region, although a large minority
believes it is too soon to judge.
</P>
<P>
Reducing direct investment in the region and capital spending
in general were among the cost-cutting initiatives cited by a
majority of council members as a response to the economic crisis
in Asia. But a large majority of economists and nearly half of the
council members characterized the level of business activity for
their firms in the Asian region as "slightly higher" than six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
China received the greatest number of votes from the economists
as the most attractive Asian market in 1999 from the standpoint of
U.S. export. The region of Taiwan was close second. Among the
council members, China received the most votes, followed by South
Korea. A large majority of the economists cited Indonesia as the
least attractive export market in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Reaches Agreement With AT&AMP;T </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. agreed Thursday to
invest 5 billion U.S. dollars in AT&AMP;T in exchange for a bigger
role in AT&AMP;T's digital future.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement announced here, AT&AMP;T will double its
purchases of Microsoft software to 10 million copies, giving the
software giant up to 40 percent of AT&AMP;T's cable business.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after AT&AMP;T made a deal with its bidding
rival Comcast Tuesday to pave the way for the MediaOne merger.
Comcast dropped its bid for MediaOne after AT&AMP;T allowed the cable
company to buy two million of AT&AMP;T's cable subscribers.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, MediaOne accepted an offer for 54 billion dollars to
be acquire by AT&AMP;T, abandoning a previous deal to merge with
Comcast for 48 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Microsoft secured AT&AMP;T's acquisition of
MediaOne since the deal indicated that Microsoft dropped its
consideration to team up with Comcast to counter AT&AMP;T in the
bidding war for MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also gave Microsoft more role in AT&AMP;T digital
future and the company would burst its business in cable industry.
Since 1993, Microsoft has been seeking a role in consumers' living
rooms as well as their offices and is now counting heavily on
software for non-PC devices to fuel its future growth.
</P>
<P>
The two companies will deploy Microsoft's TV software, based on
the Windows CE operating system that will deliver television,
telephone service and high-speed Internet access.

UNITED NATIONS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Government
approved on Thursday a humanitarian mission that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan plans to send to Kosovo and other
parts of the Balkan country, a senior United Nations official
announced.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Vieira De Mello, U.N. under-secretary-general for
humanitarian affairs, said in a statement that he has received the
news from Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav
Mission to the United Nations, "confirming that his government
would facilitate the conduct of the mission."
</P>
<P>
U.N. relief workers have not been in Yugoslavia since the March
24 beginning of the NATO air strikes for the sake of safety and
security.
</P>
<P>
An advance team of about five people would leave for Belgrade
at once to make arrangements and another team of about 15 would
follow in one or two weeks, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
Annan on Thursday said he planned to send a U.N. mission to
"assess the situation on the ground, determine the magnitude of
the refugees to go back to Kosovo," a Serbian province where
conflicts broke out in February last year after local ethnic
Albanians started fighting with Serbs for independence.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief also said that he had not asked for a pause or
lull in the NATO bombing while the team was in the Balkan country
but indicated some arrangements might be made.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Eases with Falling Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- International benchmark Brent crude
oil futures lost nearly 50 cents to dip to as low as 16.55 U.S.
dollars a barrel, shedding the gains that took the June contract
to a 16-month high of 17.09 dollars on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil's recent price rally has increased costs for
refiners, who have started cutting back their consumption and
depressing demand for crude.
</P>
<P>
Traders said crude oil hoarded in storage tanks around the
world during last year's price crash was beginning to be sold off,
piling further downward pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, oil's rapid rally has brought crude flooding
out of the giant tanks at the Saldhana Bay storage facility, used
last year to offload excess supply, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
But some brokers dismissed the slide, suggesting an upward
march would continue on signs that the OPEC cartel has stuck to an
agreement reached in March to cut oil production by 2.1 million
barrels per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have risen steadily since mid-February, when they
dropped below 10 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters survey of OPEC and industry officials, analysts and
consultants published on Thursday found the cartel had completed
the majority of the cutback package.
</P>
<P>
OPEC had cut April output by 1.34 million bpd to 26.38 million
bpd from a revised 27.72 million bpd in March, according to the
survey.
