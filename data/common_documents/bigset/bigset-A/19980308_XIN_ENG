<P>
CAIRO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Saturday the escalating
conflicts in the troubled Kosovo province, Yugoslavia, may lead to
a "virtual explosion" in the region.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement condemned the killing of many
civilians in the violence which broke out last weekend.
</P>
<P>
At least 45 Albanians and six Serb police were killed in Kosovo
since an armed conflict between ethnic Albanian separatists and
police took place on March 1.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged the world community to help hold a dialog
between the authorities in Belgrade and Kosovo to settle the issue
and to exert all needed efforts to achieve justice and stability.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population
in Kosovo, have been seeking independence from Yugoslavia since
1981.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Illegal Gold Panners Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (xinhua) -- More than 200,000 Zimbabweans are
believed to be surviving solely on illegal gold panning, the
Zimbabwean News Agency Ziana reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President of the National Minerals Association of Zimbabwe
Giles Munyoro Saturday told Ziana that Zimbabwe could be losing
millions of Dollars through illegal gold panning as some
companies are taking advantage of the ignorance of panners from
whom they buy the gold at low prices.
</P>
<P>
Munyoro said his association had also noticed that most of the
miners who had licenses were foreigners at the expense of locals,
raising fears that some of the gold was being smuggled out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said it was also disturbing that some individuals in
leadership positions in the rural areas were ignoring the
environmental damage arising from gold panning because they were
benefiting from the illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the government should intervene and severely punish
those culprits.''
</P>
<P>
Some private companies recently called on small scale miners
and other gold dealers to sell their gold to them to avoid
problems faced when they sell it to a few selected and licensed
dealers.
</P>
<P>
However, it is feared that this could encourage intensive gold
panning and criminal activities because no license would be
required to sell the gold.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the third largest gold producer in Africa after
South Africa and Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Banks' Profit Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadian banks' profit growth has
slowed from last year though they turned in another solid quarter
of earnings in the period ended on January 31, reports said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In total, Canada's six biggest commercial banks reported 1.89
billion dollars (1.3 billion USD) in profit in the first quarter
of 1998, up eight percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
But that was down nearly 10 percent from 2.06 billion dollars
in the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Of all six banks, the National Bank of Canada posted the
highest earnings growth of 20 percent year-over-year, followed by
Royal Bank of Canada at 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Montreal ranked third with an earnings growth rate
of 12 percent, while both Toronto Dominion Bank and Bank of Nova
Scotia fourth with growth rates of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The one disappointment was Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
where earnings fell eight percent because of trading losses in
Asia and acquisition costs.
</P>
<P>
The country's Big Six banks are expected to have good, if
unspectacular, earnings growth over the rest of the year for the
industry, the reports said.

JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma said in Windhoek Saturday that his country is a
multi-racial and multi-cultural society, and the German language
cannot be given special status above others.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said Namibia become independent in 1990 and chose
English as the official language in order to establish means of
communication which would unite the people and not divide them.
</P>
<P>
The president was responding to a call by visiting German
President Roman Herzog to make German an official medium of
institution in Namibian schools, the Southern African
Broadcasting Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said choosing German as an official medium of
institution for schools may cause division within society.
</P>
<P>
When English was chosen as the official language, the
intention was not to diminish the importance of other Namibian
languages, said Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
Herzog is on a seven-day state visit to Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Germany colonized Namibia following the partitioning of Africa
at the infamous Berlin Conference of 1884.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Farmers Commend Land Reform Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean farmers have welcomed
the government's decision to delist farms belonging to indigenous
farmers from over 1,400 farms it has designated to compulsorily
acquire for resettlement of thousands of landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Zimbabwe Farmers Union (ZFU) Emmerson
Zhou Saturday told the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana that the
government had shown its willingness to engage in constructive
dialog with interested parties for an amicable conclusion on the
controversial land issue.
</P>
<P>
"In entertaining alternative land offers the government must
ensure that such land offers adequate opportunities to new
settlers," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The government recently announced that it was to delist five
categories of farms from the 1,471 compulsorily acquired for
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
These categories included farms offered to the government for
resettlement purposes, farms owned by indigenous persons,
plantation farms, those with Zimbabwe Investment Center permits
and farms belonging to missionaries and church organizations.
</P>
<P>
One of the objectives of the land reform program was to
indigenize the large-scale commercial farming sector and to date
only 10 percent of the country's commercial farms belong to
indigenous farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The National Executive Council of
the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) Saturday resolved
that students will go on a nationwide demonstration Monday to
press the government to review their pay-outs.
</P>
<P>
ZINASU Vice President Fortune Mguni said after meeting with 38
presidents representing tertiary institutions here Saturday, the
only way forward after the government's negative response to
their requests was for students in all regions to go on peaceful
demonstrations, the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
"After the demonstrations on Monday, we urge all students to
resume classes, and from Tuesday we will give the government at
most three weeks (up to March 27) to respond to our legitimate
request for increments," Mguni said.
</P>
<P>
In the event of the government failing to respond favorably to
their demands, the ZINASU National Executive Council would meet
again to chart the way forward.
</P>
<P>
Last week, students went on a week-long nationwide class
boycott pressing for a 253 percent pay-out increment for tertiary
students and about 40 percent for university students.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Gasoline Dirtiest Among Major Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadian gasoline has the highest
average level of smog-causing sulphur among major developed
economies, a report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
High-sulphur gasoline reduces the efficiency of catalytic
converters and degrades the performance of oxygen sensors, both
devices used to make car exhaust cleaner.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, the dirtiest gasoline, as far as sulphur was
concerned, was found in the country's most populous province of
Ontario, which relies on aging oil refineries that use a large
amount of high-sulphur crude as a raw material.
</P>
<P>
Ontario gasoline has about 17 times the average sulphur content
allowed in California. It also exceeds average levels in Europe
and Japan by substantial margins, according to the Globe and Mail
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
While international sulphur levels have been declining in
recent years, the amount of this pollutant in Ontario gasolines
has been increasing.
</P>
<P>
"Ontario levels are the highest I've ever seen in the developed
countries," a senior engineer at Environment Canada was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The findings were part of the most extensive studies to date on
the sulphur content of Canada gasolines, the likely health effects
of the pollutant and the costs and benefits of reducing levels.
</P>
<P>
The studies was designed to help federal, provincial and
territorial governments draft new national standards for gasoline
composition, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Claims Total Implementation of Peace Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) Saturday said it has complied with
the Angolan peace pact of 1994 by demobilizing its 70,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan former rebel movement said in a statement issued
here that about 6,000 of the 8,000 troops who were still armed in
December have laid down their arms.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as diplomats overseeing Angola's peace
process are stepping up efforts to salvage the accord after
another deadline in late February passed without its full
implementation.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations mediator, Behrrooz Sandry, has held
closed-door talks in Luanda after UNITA failed to meet its
deadline on Thursday to declare it had fully demobilized its
troops.
</P>
<P>
Demobilization of UNITA soldiers was laid down in the 1994
Lusaka peace accord which ended the nearly 20 years of civil war
of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the government complained that UNITA had not
demobilized its soldiers, given up its territory to the
government and renounced its private radio as laid down by the
Lusaka pact.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the opposition movement has assured the
Angolan government and the United Nations that its remaining
troops will complete handing in their weapons by the 15th of this
month.

<HEADLINE> Minister: UN Inspections to Prove No Banned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said Saturday that the
upcoming U.N. inspections of its presidential sites will prove
that it has no weapons of mass destruction and lead to the lifting
of U.N. economic sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
"It is just impossible" for Iraq to hide biological, chemical
weapons and components or factories producing the weapons in its
presidential palaces, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid told
Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have agreed to open these sites to (arms inspectors and
diplomats) to make sure that they will realize what the Americans
have said is a big lie," Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq reached an agreement with the United Nations on February
23 to grant free and unconditional access to eight presidential
sites to a special team comprising U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq
and senior diplomats appointed by the U.N. chief Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The arms inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed all
its weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council
lifts the crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said the allegations made by the United States that Iraq
has weapons of mass destruction in presidential palaces are
pretexts for military aggression and continued sanctions against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1996, Rolf Ekeus, the then chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, said that Iraq was hiding five
to 15 missiles and two missile launchers, and he and American
officials made a lot of fuss about it, he said.
</P>
<P>
But excavation of destroyed missile parts proved that Ekeus'
allegations were baseless, said the minister, who is one of Iraq's
top negotiators dealing with the U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
"Now they are accusing Iraq of hiding biological and chemical
weapons inside presidential sites," Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
The sites are now open to the arms inspectors, who will find
nothing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq will have no problem with the U.N. inspectors, if they
behave as technical experts, Rashid said.
</P>
<P>
But he warned of "problems" if the inspectors are influenced by
the "political agenda and objectives" of Washington.
</P>
<P>
The United States would try to make problems through its agents
in the UNSCOM, Rashid said, expressing hope that with the active
participation of friendly countries, problems will become less.
</P>
<P>
"We are not saying it will become zero, it will become less, it
will be difficult for the Americans to make a crisis again," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said he hopes the inspection of presidential sites will
be completed within weeks or months, because there are only eight
of them.
</P>
<P>
"We think one of the biggest advantages of the crisis (we have
got) is now all the world is looking at Iraq," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
It "will see what the inspectors are doing," he added
</P>
<P>
U.N. arms inspectors have visited thousands of sites in Iraq,
but they have failed to discover any single weapon of mass
destruction or its components, or any prohibited material, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions should have been lifted long time ago," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We are hopeful, we are optimistic and we hope that with the
support of friendly countries and the intervention of the U.N.
secretary-general, the sanctions will be lifted very soon,"
Rashid said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges World Media to Focus on Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Saturday urged world
media to focus their attention on results of upcoming inspections
of Iraqi presidential sites by U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Mohammed Rashid said the world media should focus on what the
inspectors will find, and not be diverted by new allegations
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said Iraq is confident that U.N. inspectors will not
find a single piece of weapon of mass destruction or its
components in Iraqi presidential sites, because Iraq has destroyed
all those weapons and has nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspection of the presidential sites, Rashid said,
will prove to the world the allegation that Iraq hides banned
weapons in those sites is "a big lie."
</P>
<P>
He said in the summer of 1996, Rolf Ekeus, the then chairman of
the U.N. Special Committee (UNSCOM) in charge of weapons
inspection in Iraq, told the world that Iraq was hiding five to 15
missiles and two launchers.
</P>
<P>
After months of excavation of destroyed missile parts, Rashid
said, the Iraqi side proved to Ekeus with full documentation that
every piece of the missiles and launchers has been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
However, neither a U.S. official nor a leader of UNSCOM talked
about it, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now they are accusing Iraq of hiding biological and chemical
weapons inside presidential sites," the minister said. "The sites
are open now, they will visit them. When they finish it, they
might create another problem so that you do not remember the
original one."
</P>
<P>
Rashid said the world media should not let their focus be
diverted again by possible new allegations against Iraq. The
public opinion should be aware of the fact that the United States
is looking for a new allegation to justify the continuation of
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded
Kuwait. They cannot be lifted unless the UNSCOM verifies that Iraq
is free of weapons of mass destruction.

MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry Saturday
in a press release expressed hope that the Russian-speaker's
protest incident in Riga on March 3 will be "properly assessed in
the world."
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency reported that the ministry hoped that
the world community would make a collective effort to improve the
human rights situation in Latvia as soon as possible and "put an
end to the policy of insults and humiliation in relation to a
large group of the country's permanent residents."
</P>
<P>
The dramatic events in Riga provide one more proof of the
extremely serious situation in Latvia already known to the world,
the document said.
</P>
<P>
"The Latvian authorities' cynicism is limitless. Prime Minister
Guntars Krasts has even gone so far as to accuse Russia of
organizing the disturbances in Riga," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It criticized the Latvian authorities for violation of
political, civil, social, economic and cultural rights of hundreds
of thousands of residents who do not have the status of the
so-called 'title nation'.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry stated that it has drawn the
attention of the U.N., the Council of Europe and the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to these ultrages.
</P>
<P>
On the same day Latvian Prime Minister Guntars Krasts also
stated that "no violations of human rights" took place during the
picket outside the Riga city legislature on March 3.
</P>
<P>
He said following a Cabinet session that "the Latvian police
acted properly and there were no instances of human rights
violations."

About 2,000 ethnic Russians last Tuesday held a picket in front
of the building of the city legislature in Riga in protest against
rising tariffs. The Latvian police used force against them,
thereby eliciting a strong negative response in Moscow, which
considered the incident as an instance of gross violation of the
ethnic Russian's rights.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process Moving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said Saturday that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process is moving backward and the
situation is very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of Palestinian Council in Gaza Strip,
Arafat warned that the peace process, which has been stalled for a
year over next Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank, is "about
to breathe its last breath."
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Israel Radio, Arafat again blamed
Israel for the breakdown in the peace talks, charging that the
Israeli government is willing to see "the peace process become
part of the past."
</P>
<P>
Arafat also hinted at reforms in his authority, saying that
"while all of us make mistakes," the PNA is merely experiencing
the growing pains of any new democratic government. He noted that
he is open to some change and reorganization in the authority.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has been suffering from mismanagement and
corruption. The Council members were seriously critical of it and
even threatened a no-confidence notion at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Before Arafat began his speech, the council had reelected Abu
Ala as its speaker for a third one-year term. Abu Ala defeated two
challengers in the election, wining 55 of 70 votes cast by the
88-member council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said that more than 2,000 Palestinians
rallied in the West Bank city of Hebron Saturday to mark the
massacre of 29 Muslim worshippers at a Hebron mosque by a Jewish
gunman four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Protesters carried coffins, which were inscribed with words
"peace process," "security council resolution," and "Israeli
justice."

<HEADLINE> Diplomats, Refugees Trickle Back to Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Diplomats and refugees are
trickling back to the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown, ahead of
the return of ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said Saturday that British High
Commissioner Peter Penfold and European Community Representative
Emilio Perez Porras returned to Freetown Friday night with
Kabbah's Foreign Minister Shirley Gbujama.
</P>
<P>
The two were the first foreign diplomats to return since the
west African peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG drove the
military junta led by Major Johnny Koroma from the capital in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials at the Freetown Port said a boat brought
home 700 refugees from neighboring Guinea early Saturday and was
due to leave to repatriate more. Relief officials estimated that
there are about 300,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has captured most major towns in Sierra Leone, although
troops loyal to Koroma remained active in the south and east.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG sources said they are planning to deploy forces heavily
in Freetown to protect Kabbah, who has been in Guinea since
ousted by Koroma's coup last May.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Seeks US Aid in Post-War Rebuilding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
has appealed to U.S. assistance to help rebuild his country after
seven years of civil war, a report reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Receiving a U.S. fact-finding team in Monrovia Friday, Taylor
reportedly complained that Mozambique received lots of aid after
its civil war, while Liberia received next to nothing.
</P>
<P>
He argued that he has put in place checks to ensure respect
for basic rights and it is now time for the U.S. to come out and
help him rebuild Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who started the civil war in 1989, said that "the
private sector is our hope and we need assistance to sustain
peace and to develop our natural resources, banking systems etc."
</P>
<P>
The 10-member U.S. team, led by President Bill Clinton's
special envoy Howard Jeter, arrived in Monrovia Thursday on the
first such visit since Taylor's inauguration last August.
</P>
<P>
"We bring a message of goodwill and we are here for very
intensive discussions with the government and other individuals,"
Jeter said on arrival.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Calls for "Responsible" Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- After several run-ins with domestic
newspapers, the Egyptian government Saturday called for a
responsible press that places national interests as a high
priority.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak outlined the guidelines for being a
"responsible press" at his meeting Saturday with the newly-elected
Higher Press Council, which groups the country's top media
administrators.
</P>
<P>
"Journalists are guided only by their conscience and the law,"
the president was quoted by Council Chairman Mustafa Kamal Helmi
as telling reporters.
</P>
<P>
"So respect of law, constitution, social values, traditions and
the supreme national interests should be the key tenets needed to
enable pressmen to proceed in their sublime message," he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters, Helmi also lashed out at the writings
"harming values, traditions and higher interests of the Egyptian
society."
</P>
<P>
"Veteran journalists, either at national or party newspapers,
have denounced writings made by intruders to the press community,"
he said after the meeting, which was attended by Prime Minister
Kamal el-Ganzouri, Information Minister Safwat al-Sherif and Head
of the Presidential Cabinet Zakaria Azmi.
</P>
<P>
The Higher Press Council will provide the atmosphere favorable
for responsible press heeding values and principles of the society
and stand against any violation of these principles, said Helmi,
also speaker of the Shura Council.
</P>
<P>
Three journalists of the Misr al-Fataa weekly newspaper were
charged Wednesday with libeling Egypt's finance minister in
articles that accused him of corruption. If convicted, the three
men can face up to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
On February 26, the government banned publication of the
independent weekly Al Destour three days after it printed a faxed
statement from Gamaa Al Islamiya, Egypt's main militant group.
</P>
<P>
A Cairo court on February 24 sentenced two reporters at the
Islamist Al-Shaab newspaper to one year in jail with labor and
fines for libeling former Interior Minister Hassan Al Alfi and his
sons.
</P>
<P>
Opposition and independent editors have criticized these
developments as blows to the freedom of press in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian laws allow only the government, political parties and
government-approved companies to publish newspapers here. Other
off-shore publications have to obtain a three-month renewable
permit from the Ministry of Information to go to print in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambian Govt, Labor Dispute Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- There is no signal that the Zambia
Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) will call off the nation-wide
strike planned for Monday to protest a government plan to freeze
the wage of public service workers for this year.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the work stoppage, President Frederick Chiluba
promised Friday not to de-register the trade unions even if they
organize the strike.
</P>
<P>
He also said that trade unions have the right to go on strike
but the situation should be justified, adding that there is no
valid ground for a strike on March 9 because what good labor
leaders should do is to plan other tactics to resolve the impasse
between their members and the government.
</P>
<P>
The president further said the freeze on wage increments is
restricted only to public service workers while others in the
private sector are free to negotiate better conditions of service
with their respective employers as they are not affected by the
government plan.
</P>
<P>
He asked government ministers not to intimidate workers but
convince them about the importance of the government decisions
like the freeze on wage increments.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba argued that the wage freeze is meant to enable the
government to down-size the bloated civil service which has
become unmanageable.
</P>
<P>
But he stopped short of meeting workers' demand.
</P>
<P>
Although ZCTU welcomed Chiluba's statement as positive, it
maintained that the strike will still go ahead as planned because
their demand for rescinding the wage freeze has not been met.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Labor Minister Newstea Zimba said that the
government will not yield to demands for discussions under
duress.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said the government is willing to have dialog with the
unions but will not do so until the Zambia Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) withdraws its threats to strike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Zambia Federation of Employers (ZFE) told its
members Friday to discipline workers who will show solidarity
with the public service workers.
</P>
<P>
ZFE President Francis Simenda has appealed to ZCTU to avoid
the work stoppage, saying that the Tripartite Consultative Labor
Council meeting scheduled for later this month should be used as
a forum to discuss all grievances the labor movement may have.
</P>
<P>
"Dialog is the only way in issues of industrial relations if
we have to resolve our problems. Threats and confrontations
should be avoided," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Labor Minister Zimba warned the public service
workers of instant dismissal if they take part in the strike. He
also warned that unions organizing the strike risk being
de-registered.
</P>
<P>
However, ZCTU General Secretary Alec Chirwa said early this
week that "it is unthinkable to impose a wage freeze on workers
in a liberalized economy."
</P>
<P>
"The government is imposing a wage freeze on workers who are
earning far below a living wage," he noted, adding, "this is the
most inhuman treatment the government can inflict on workers."
</P>
<P>
Chirwa lamented that the cost of living is already beyond the
reach of the majority of Zambians and the government is adding
salt to injury by taking away the little the workers in the
public service are getting.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition parties have expressed their solidarity with
the public service workers. The Party for Morality and Economic
Progress said the wage freeze is not synonymous with the
government policy of a liberalized economy.

<HEADLINE> Iran: No Nuclear Agreement With Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Stressing that it has no nuclear
cooperation program with Ukraine, Iran Saturday expressed
"surprise" at Kiev's announcement to cancel a nuclear contract
with it, the Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has no agreement with Ukraine on manufacturing turbines
for (its) nuclear reactors and it is surprising that Ukraine has
made such a claim," Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said on Friday
that Kiev has decided to annul a contract to supply turbines to
the Russia-built Bushehr nuclear power plant in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
Russia's assistance for Iran in the field has triggered
accusations from the United States and Israel that Iran is seeking
the technology for developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
It is noted Ukraine's move was made when U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright was visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
Iran's nuclear activities are for peaceful means, Mohammadi
said, stressing that it complies with international regulations
and puts the nuclear activities under the supervision of the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
The baseless ballyhoos of the U.S. and Israel are aimed at
blocking the development of other countries, which is their
legitimate right, he said.
</P>
<P>
He contended that Iran will not deprive itself of utilizing
nuclear technology for its development drive.

<HEADLINE> 2 Tanzanians Die from Poisonous Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Two Tanzanians have died,
while the other two of the same family have been sent to
hospital, after they ate porridge suspected to be poisonous, the
police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Police Commander Alfred Geww, named the two
people who died of the poisonous porridge Friday at Goba Village
in Dar es Salaam as Mpuya Mwandu, 30, and Juma Lushingo, 23.
</P>
<P>
One survivor, Mange, admitted that the deceased Mpuya Mwandu
was preparing the porridge with traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
"Mpuya was unable to have sex, so he cooked the porridge with
the soup of some roots given by traditional healers in the belief
that it would cure his impotence," Mange said.
</P>
<P>
"We all abandoned the meal in a few minutes, except for Mpuya
who continued eating until he was satisfied," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mpuya fell down suddenly after 10 minutes and so did Juma
later. Both of them died soon.
</P>
<P>
The police are still investigating the specific reason for the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Seek Investment from UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Deputy Minister
of Energy and Minerals Manju Msambya will leave Sunday for London
to attend a conference on mining in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Msambya told reporters Saturday that the conference aims to
provide British companies with business opportunities in the fast
growing mining sector in tropical Africa, especially in Tanzania,
Ghana and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said the conference, organized by Britain's Department of
Trade and Industry, will be a chance for Tanzania to attract
investments.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's output of mineral exploration surpassed 80 million
U.S. Dollars in 1997, making the country the fourth largest in
sub-Sahara Africa in mining terms, after South Africa, Ghana and
Zimbabwe, statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
The government has provided legislation and tax and fiscal
incentives to attract further mining investment, Minister of
Energy and Minerals Abdallah Kigoda told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
With the new mineral policy in 1997 already implemented and
the new Mining Act tabled in parliament awaiting approval, the
investment in Tanzania's mining sector is expected to triple by
the turn of the century, Kigoda said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister, to be accompanied by a senior geologist
at the ministry, Godwin Nyello, will take part in a two-day
program of visits and meetings next week in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Off to Ethiopia to Attend Forum on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yweri Museveni
left here Saturday afternoon for Addis Ababa to attend a forum
which will focus on the economic potential and investment
opportunity in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The forum will be opened Sunday morning by Meles Zenawi, prime
minister of Ethiopia, after which Museveni will give a
key-address on "investment as the shortest route to development
in Africa", according to a release from the presidential office
here.
</P>
<P>
The forum will address ways in which investment is already
taking place on both the national and regional level. Various
speakers from international and domestic companies and
institutions will discuss and debate their experiences and
strategies.
</P>
<P>
It is taking place against a background of economic and social
change happening in many African countries. Since 1993, 12
African stock markets have been opened to foreign investments and
the trade volumes in those stock markets have risen six-fold from
600 million U.S. Dollars to 4.5 billion Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the forum is the first of what will
be a series of conferences highlighting Africa as an investment
opportunity area for the international business community.
</P>
<P>
The objective of this and subsequent fora is to examine and
debate ways in which economic investment can be promoted, the
release said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Anglo-Saxons Still Dominate Inspection Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 7 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid said Saturday the U.N. arms inspection team headed by
American Scott Ritter is still dominated by Anglo-Saxons.
</P>
<P>
Rashid told Xinhua that the 50-member arms inspection team,
which arrived here Thursday, includes 12 Americans, six Britons,
and 10 Australians.
</P>
<P>
"Anglo-Saxons are the dominant core of that team and they
account for more than half of the team's 50 inspectors," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
In mid-January, a 16-member weapons inspection team headed by
Ritter was barred by Iraq from carrying out any activities in Iraq
on grounds that its composition is imbalanced. That team included
nine Americans and five Britons.
</P>
<P>
But the minister noted that Ritter's team has nothing to do
with Iraqi presidential sites, which had been the core of a crisis
defused late last month. "He (Ritter) is inspecting sensitive
security sites," he said.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered when Iraq refused entry of
presidential sites to U.N. weapons inspectors, citing national
sovereignty. The U.S. and Britain threatened military action
before the U.N. chief Kofi Annan signed an accord with Baghdad on
February 23 to allow a team of inspectors and diplomats free
inspection of the sites.

<HEADLINE> S. African C. Bank Introduces Repo Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Governor of South African
Reserve Bank Chris Stals Saturday announced the introduction of
the new repurchase rate for banks, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Stals as saying that the repo rate would be fixed
at 15 percent from March 9 to 13. This will reduce the effective
cost of borrowing from the Reserve Bank by one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
From March 16, 1998, the bank will only announce a maximum
amount for the daily tender of repos, and the average rate will
be determined through the tender mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Stals said the marginal lending rate would be fixed at 16
percent, which is at the level of the old bank rate, for at least
two weeks as from March 9.
</P>
<P>
He said in changing the monetary policy framework, the Reserve
Bank, the country's central bank, had given recognition to the
relatively high level of real interest rates in South Africa by
fixing the first repo rate one full percentage point below the
current bank rate.
</P>
<P>
This is, however, not necessarily part of a continuing process
of a relaxation of monetary policy measures. The high rates of
growth in money supply and bank credit extension, the Southeast
Asian crisis and recent developments in the current account of
the balance of payments, caution against a premature excessive
relaxation in the existing restrictive monetary policy measure.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that a new averaging provision would be
introduced in the application of the minimum cash reserves which
banks had to maintain at the Reserve Bank from March 20.
</P>
<P>
To simplify the current cash reserve requirements, the Reserve
Bank has decided to apply only one reserve ratio of 2.5 percent
on the total liabilities of banks, beginning from the maintenance
period starting April 23, 1998. This will slightly reduce the
amount of the minimum cash reserves, but no interest will be paid
on any part of the minimum cash reserve balances.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank debentures for the management of bank liquidity
would also be issued from time to time. The issue of these
debentures will partially compensate banks for the loss of
interest that they currently earn on part of their cash reserves,
and will establish a role for Reserve Bank debentures in the new
system of accommodation.

TEHRAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko expressed Minsk's readiness to remove all
obstacles and promote its growing cooperation relations with Iran
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, Lukashenko promised that Belarus will remain committed
to the agreements signed between the two countries, the Iranian
official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He said his country is intended to boost the bilateral trade
fivefold.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said Iran and Belarus are boosting their trade and
economic cooperation, which he maintained will be beneficial for
them.
</P>
<P>
Iran seeks to strengthen relations with countries which are
steadfast in pursuing their legitimate interests, he said, adding
that Tehran rejects a unipolar world and welcomes similar stance
adopted by other countries.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that nations should enjoy equal rights in the world,
Khamenei called for closer cooperation among countries which
recognize and respect all nations' rights.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian president expressed a similar point of view
concerning the world order and voiced Minsk's opposition to a
unipolar world.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko arrived here Friday night and held a round of talks
with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Khatami on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Both of them called for a promotion of bilateral cooperation in
industrial, economic and technical fields.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Urges Belgrade to Solve Kosovo Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said on Saturday that the present violence in Kosovo must be
dealt with in a proper manner, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in the central Turkish city of
Kayseri, Cem said that Turkey, as a power in the region, is
extremely sensitive over the tensions in the southern Yugoslav
province.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the Balkan region as a historical hotbed of war, Cem
warned that the Kosovo unrest might spread to other Balkan
nations and will damage stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey wants a peaceful solution to the crisis in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we respect Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity, but Turkey cannot remain indifferent to oppression,
torture and killing of people," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether he will present a proposal to Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic during his trip to Belgrade, Cem said
that this is not the aim of this visit.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We will convey our own concerns and ideas."
</P>
<P>
Pointed out that Ankara has been closely following
developments in Kosovo, the Turkish foreign minister said that
Turkey hope calmness could be restored soon in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will meet his Yugoslavian counterpart in
Belgrade and then convey to Milosevic a letter from Turkish
President Suleyman Demirel concerning the Kosovo clashes.
</P>
<P>
Cem is scheduled to fly to the Yugoslavian capital on Saturday
evening, according to an early official press release.
</P>
<P>
At least 45 Albanians and six Serb police were killed in Kosovo
since an armed conflict between ethnic Albanian separatists and
police broke up on March 1.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told Milosevic
by telephone that Turkey was concerned about the bloody clashes
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has shared historically close ties with Albania and
ethnic Albanians in the Balkans.

The products concerned are maize strains produced by the U.S.
chemicals company Monsanto, Swiss drugs firm Novartis and German
group AgrEvo, and an oilseed rape variety produced by AgrEvo,
sources said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
All four were approved by an EU scientific advisory panel on
February 12 in a move welcomed by the biotechnology industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the panel's advice is not final and the EU states
will have to endorse it formally before marketing can go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Green Euro-MPs and scientists called on Friday for a moratorium
on all authorizations of genetically modified organisms (GMO)
until solid research data could prove they posed no long-term
danger to health or the environment.
</P>
<P>
Two of the new varieties, the new Monsanto and Novartis maize
strains, have been engineered to resist the European corn borer by
the addition of a gene which causes the plant to produce a protein
that kills the insect.
</P>
<P>
The European Association for Bioindustries said this was a new
and environmentally friendly way to control devastating insect
pests and ensure yield.
</P>
<P>
But environmentalists and the authorities in Austria, Denmark
and Greece have voiced concern that the additional gene could
initially kill benign insects as well as the corn borer and over
time lead to the pest developing a resistance to the toxin.
</P>
<P>
Austria and Luxembourg have imposed domestic bans on another
strain of Novartis GMO-maize carrying the gene, in defiance of an
EU decision in 1996 to authorize it.

Cem flew to Belgrade on Saturday evening on a mission to help find
a solution to the violence in Kosovo province of Yugoslavia.
</P>

stopped."
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Cem as saying

contributions to a peaceful solution to the crisis."
</P>
<P>
Cem said that Turkey has conveyed such views of point to the
governments of Albania, Macedonia as well as Bulgaria, adding that
Ankara is worried that the disturbances in Kosovo could spread to
the whole Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that he will meet President of the
Yugoslavian Federation Slobodan Milosevic on Sunday morning and

<HEADLINE> Private Car Registrations Rise in CEEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- No fewer than 373,000 private
cars were registered for the first time in nine countries of
Central and Eastern Europe during the first half of 1997, it was
learned here today.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic accounted for a third of the total, with
119,800 registrations during the first half of 1997 and 62,900
during the third quarter, European Report, a twice-weekly
newsletter published here Saturday, quoted Eurostat as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania was in second place with 94,200, after placing first
in 1996 with 186,900. Romania took the last place with 7,500.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, comparing the first halves of 1996 and 1997, observes
that the most registrations were in Latvia, Lithuania and Slovenia
and the least in Bulgaria, Estonia and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that Bulgaria and Romania, where inflation rates
are high, saw a large drop in turnover volume in both the retail
and motor trade between the two periods surveyed.
</P>
<P>
While employment in the motor trade has remained stable, most
countries experienced a decline in retail employment, according to
Eurostat.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Appeases Germany Following PM's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is trying to appease
Germans after remarks by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz in
an interview with Britain's Financial Times annoyed Bonn, local
newspaper reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Umit Pamir, a senior advisor to Yilmaz, was quoted as saying
that the prime minister was misunderstood when he said Germany was
still seeking "Lebensraum," a term used to describe Nazi dictator
Adolf Hitler's aggression polices.
</P>
<P>
He said that what Yilmaz meant with the word was that Germany
is continuing to exploit its "areas of interest," saying that the
prime minister's words had nothing to do with the Nazi period.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister wanted to pass across the message that
Germany does not give importance to Turkey, but to central and
eastern Europe," Pamir said.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who has repeatedly criticized Bonn's policy towards
Turkey, compared the German approach to the European Union (EU)
expansion with Hitler's "Lebensraum" plans, according to the
Financial Times reports.
</P>
<P>
He was also quoted as saying that Germany, the most powerful in
the EU, should be held responsible for the discriminative EU
attitude toward Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The journalists who conducted the interview for the
London-based paper had apparently misunderstood the Turkish prime
minister, Pamir said.
</P>
<P>
German Ambassador to Ankara Hans-Joachim Vergau, when asked to
comment on the reports, said that he did not believe Yilmaz had
said this to the media.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot imagine a responsible politician would resort to
such an ill-considered assault on the honor of the people whose
friendship with Turkey remains irreversible," the German official
said.
</P>
<P>
Ankara was extremely angered by the EU when the EU Luxembourg
summit last December excluded Turkey from the prospective
candidate nations for the upcoming EU enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders held that the serious shortcoming in Turkey's
human rights record, economy as well as tense relations with
neighboring countries made it improper for the involvement in the
current process.

BONN -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and her
German counterpart Klaus Kinkel Sunday agreed to act swiftly to
intervene in the Kosovo issue and to force Belgrade to make
concession on it.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Kinkel in Bonn on Sunday, Albright warned at a
news conference that Washington would stop moves to ease sanctions
against Belgrade unless violence stopped.
</P>
<P>
"The time to stop killings is now before it spreads. The way
to do it is to take an immediate action against Belgrade to ensure
that it pay the price for the damages already done and to
encourage it to finally resolve the problems in Kosovo," Albright
said.

Kinkel also stressed that "everything must be done to ensure
that another awful conflagration do not explode in Europe."

JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Security forces
have informed Israel that they uncovered an underground workshop
for making rifles in Gaza, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said that hundreds of rifles have already
been manufactured by the factory.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli security forces said they believed the number of
rifles made there was not as large as that reported by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
There was no report about who operated the factory and whether
some suspects have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been insisting that its next troop pullback from
the West Bank is contingent on the implementation of the
Palestinian commitments to fight against terrorists.

BAGHDAD -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed said on
Saturday that Iraq wants lifting of U.N. sanctions instead of the
oil-for-food deal, a very temporary measure.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Rasheed said
oil-for-food deal under U.N. Security Council resolution 986,
which allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil to buy food and
medicine, was temporary measure supposed to be for only six months.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the deal has existed for three years instead
of six months.
</P>
<P>
"We work with it, we facilitate its implementation, but it is
temporary measure. The proper measure is the lifting of all
sanctions, which we deserve fully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed, top negotiator in talks with the U.N. Special
Commission charged of disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction, said the United States intended to make oil-for-food
deal a sort of permanent measure, so that iraq can only buy
consuming items. (Iraq-Oil Minister)

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Customs Procedures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Director of China's General
Administration of Customs Qian Quanlin today announced that China
will strive to complete the reform on its customs procedures in
three years.
</P>
<P>
The customs office at the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and
three other customs offices have been designated to experiment
with the reform as from April 1 this year, he said at a penal
discussion of the Ninth National People's Congress now in session
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The second group of customs offices will be chosen to
experiment with the reform in the latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Within this year, China will actively and accurately implement
the relevant policies on preferential taxation, tax reduction or
exemption on the equipment to be imported by domestically-funded
projects, which have been encouraged by the central government for
economic growth, and exempt foreign-funded projects from tariffs
and import-related value-added tax within the scope as prescribed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, customs offices will continue supporting the
development of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, the Pudong New
Area and the Suzhou Industrial Park and open more ports of entry
in the country's central and western and border areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the director urged all customs offices to cooperate
still closely with taxation departments in implementing the export
refund system and support the endeavors to increase exports. They
should simplify customs procedures, raise efficiency, cut down the
costs in trading, reform on the related procedures concerning
postal matters and further improve supervision over the exiting
express mails, Qian said.

BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bayi Rockets trounced the

<HEADLINE> HK CPPCC Members Urge Taiwan to Respond to Negotiation Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong members of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National
Committee, China's top advisory body, expressed the hope that the
Taiwan authorities would respond quickly to the mainland's appeal
to start cross-Strait political negotiations under the "one China"
principle.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Sze Chi Qing, chairman of the
board of directors of Hong Kong Hang Tung Resources Holding
Limited and a member of the CPPCC National Committee, said Hong
Kong has maintained stability and prosperity after its return to
the motherland under the "one country, two systems" principle.
Macao's return is close at hand. "Now is a good time to make
progress toward the reunification of the motherland," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sze Cheung Pang, another CPPCC National Committee member and a
Hong Kong businessman, expressed regret that the Taiwan
authorities have not responded earnestly and positively to the
eight-point proposal made by President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities now have again turned down negotiation
offers on the ground that they are opposed to "preconditions." The
key to developing cross-Strait relations at the present stage is
to urge the Taiwan authorities to come to the negotiation table,
Sze said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that, if there should be a precondition or a
premise for cross-Strait negotiations, that is the principle of
"one China."
</P>
<P>
"The 'one China' principle is the key to whether or not
cross-Strait relations can develop smoothly and a peaceful
reunification of the motherland can be accomplished," he said.
</P>
<P>
Member Liang Hin-ying, president of the Chinese Manufacturers'
Association in Hong Kong, said Hong Kong has been serving as a
bridge in promoting cooperation and exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait. Hong Kong CPPCC members will contribute more to the
peaceful reunification of the motherland, he said.

to do it is to take an immediate action against Belgrade to ensure
that it pay the price for the damages already done and to
encourage it to finally resolve the problems in Kosovo," Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also stressed that "everything must be done to ensure
that another awful conflagration do not explode in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Both of them preached a political dialogue between Belgrade and
Kosovo-Albanians with the objective to give Kosovo some form of
what they called self-administration or autonomy.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, both Albright and Kinkel will participate in a
meeting of foreign ministers of the international contact group
for former Yugoslavia in London.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the London meeting will discuss a variety of
measures ranging from economic incentives for Belgrade to threat
of new sanctions. But both of them declined to talk about details.
</P>
<P>
The German news media quoted diplomatic sources as saying that
Albright would bring a bundle of concrete sanction proposals to
the London conference.
</P>
<P>
Before her short visit to Bonn, Albright also held talks with
Ukrainian and Italian leaders and would make a stopover in Paris
before the London conference.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, the two foreign ministers also discussed the situation
in Iraq. Albright warned that the threat of a U.S. military
strike was not yet over and that Iraq's commitment to honoring
U.N. resolutions for arms inspections had still to be tested.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, King Hussein Meet in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
King Hussein of Jordan met here Sunday on propelling the Mideast
peace process and easing the Iraqi-U.N. crisis over arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak met with the Jordanian monarch at a luncheon after
Hussein arrived here Sunday afternoon on a lightning visit to
Egypt, which was decided during a late night telephone
conversation Saturday between them, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that their talks are expected to focus on latest
developments in the region on top of which is the faltering
Mideast peace process notably on the Palestinian-Israeli track and
Arab and international efforts exerted to salvage it.
</P>
<P>
Developments in Iraq and all aspects of Jordanian-Egyptian
relations will also be tackled during Hussein's short visit.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian king, who will visit Washington this week, has
denied that he is commissioned by anybody to propose U.S.-Iraqi
dialog, noting that such a dialog is naturally enough to take
place after Iraq's full abidance by all relevant peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein made the statements Saturday after winding up a
Gulf tour. He is expected to brief Mubarak on his talks with the
United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan
and Sultan Qaboos Bin Said of Oman.
</P>
<P>
The king has called on the United States to have a direct
dialogue with Iraq in order to end their standoff.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch is accompanied by a high-level
delegation, including Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali.
</P>
<P>
The last visit of Hussein to Egypt took place on January
25.

BONN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and her German counterpart Klaus Kinkel Sunday agreed to

<HEADLINE> Somali Women Call for Implementing Cairo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Somali women organizations
Sunday called on the warlords to stick to their commitments and
implement the Cairo Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
At a large demonstration on the eve of the International
Women's Day, Somali women from political factions,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and women organizations
urged the politicians to settle Mogadishu's administration
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of demonstrating women from more than 20
organizations carrying placards and slogans gathered at the
Unknown Soldiers' Monument at the heart of the city where
different speeches were made in commemoration for the Women's day.
</P>
<P>
Hawo Mohamed Ossoble, chairwoman of a local women organization
told the gathering that the faction leaders should now give a
chance to the on-going peace initiatives.
</P>
<P>
"Any further delays to the implementation of the Cairo
agreement is inexcusable," she said.
</P>
<P>
Fadumo Ahmed Qorweyneh who also spoke on the occasion urged
the faction leaders to open the long awaited air and seaports of
the capital.
</P>
<P>
"This would help facilitate the smooth flow of the business
and humanitarian efforts by the international communities," said
Qorweyneh.
</P>
<P>
Also on the occasion, the Save Somali Women and Children
Organization (SSWC) held a performance competition for nine
Somali women poetry. Zakia Abdisalam Alim, Secretary General of
SSWC, said they have also distributed miscellaneous household
utensils to 45 families in three refugee camps in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
"Somali women are ambitious, " said Alim, adding that "We're
ambitious to restore the rights of the Somali women and take
part in any future administration."
</P>
<P>
During the demonstration co-sponsored by the Coalition
Grassroots Women Organization and the Somali Peace and Human
Rights Network, women groups which celebrated for the first time
in seven years the Women's Day together, also expressed concern
over the very slow pace of the Mogadishu administration.

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Calls for Better Care for Masses of People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, today urged leading officials at all
levels to concern themselves with the masses of people and do more
in-depth investigations and studies.
</P>
<P>
Joining in a panel discussion on Premier Li's Government Work
Report with deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)
from Tianjin Municipalities, Li cited the report as "practical"
and "inspiring".
</P>
<P>
"The people are the mainstay in the reform and opening-up, and
we will accomplish nothing without tapping their wisdom, strength
and talents," said Li, who is present as an NPC deputy from Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
At present, the overall level of China's economic growth is not
high, and a host of problems have cropped up during the shift of
economic mechanism. Therefore, some urban and rural people are
leading a relatively hard life, and there is a growing number of
laid-off workers in cities, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he noted, corruption, unfair income distribution,
bureaucratic work style, formalism and frauds among some officials
have caused complaints from the masses of people.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, he warned officials of not losing their position
on the minds of the people they worked for.
</P>
<P>
While reform has greatly raised the overall living standards of
the residents, the interests of some people may be affected for
some time and, with the establishment of the market economy,
layoff and unemployment are inevitable, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should not doubt the general orientation of the reform or
the people's will to carry it out simply because of some
problems that have emerged in the course of advancement, nor
should we ignore the people's practical difficulties under any
excuse," Li Ruihuan said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of China's present material conditions, the people's
basic livelihood can entirely be guaranteed," he said.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the arduous tasks put forward by the Government Work
Report, officials at various levels should not be impetuous and
subjective, but free themselves from meetings and excessive social
activities and, go in for more investigations and studies instead.

<HEADLINE> Premier Calls for Tackling Problems in Small Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng called on
governments at all levels to properly deal with problems faced by
numerous small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Such enterprises constitute the majority of debt-ridden firms,
where most laid-off workers come from, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li made the call in a group discussion attended by Shandong
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), in session here
since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Li said large state firms dominate with economic strength while
small enterprises employ the majority of workers.
</P>
<P>
That is why governments at all levels must handle problems in
small enterprises well in state enterprise reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mixed ownership is conducive to the technical upgrading and
development of small and medium-sized enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said accelerating the development of the service industry is
an important way to create more job opportunities for laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
"Textile and other light industrial factories use relatively
backward equipment and their products lack competitiveness, but
most of them are located at precious downtown sites, a great
advantage for them to develop services, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier also suggested developing community services as a
way to provide jobs for laid-off workers.

<HEADLINE> Albania Willing to Allow Kosovo Refugees to Take Shelter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Albania could allow ethnic Albanian
refugees in Kosovo to enter the country, but would turn away
certain individuals with terrorist background, government
spokesman Ben Blushi said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Albanian government made public its
willingness to accept ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Albania would not close its border to those threatened by war,
Blushi said, adding that so far, there has been no sign of any
exodus of Kosovo refugees toward the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
As early as last year, Macedonian President Kirogli Gorov said
if any crisis erupted in Kosovo, Macedonia would like to open a
safety corridor connecting Kosovo and Albania via the country.
</P>
<P>
His proposal was welcomed by Albanian government but was
opposed by leaders of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, who said they
would never leave their own land.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo was an autonomous province that formed part of Serbia
until 1989 when Serbian authorities revoked the autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Violence in Kosovo has been growing this year following the
non-implementation of an education agreement reached between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the leader of ethnic
Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
Tension heightened there after a Serbian police patrol and
local ethnic Albanians engaged in a fierce cross-fire that killed
four policemen and 16 Albanians on February 28.

<HEADLINE> State Enterprise Reform a Step-by-Step Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Intensifying enterprise reform
will result in another 3.5 million workers losing their jobs this
year, making reemployment tougher, according to Chinese Labor
Minister Li Boyong.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11.51 million workers were unemployed at one time
or another last year throughout the country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Of these laid-off workers, 7.87 million were from state-owned
enterprises, said the minister at a press conference sponsored by
the ongoing annual session of the National People's Congress here
today.
</P>
<P>
While most of the laid-off workers have found new jobs, 4.8
million still need reemployment.
</P>
<P>
The government has been trying hard to expand the coverage of
the existing unemployment insurance system. Factories are required
to contribute more money to unemployment funds; and individual
workers are also asked to contribute to such funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, factories contribute merely 0.6-1 percent of their
total payroll to the state unemployment fund, and the percentage
is going to be raised to two percent, Li said.
</P>
<P>
According Chen Qingtai, a vice-minister in charge of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, though central planning has been
abandoned in China, the country's industries are still plagued by
inefficiency and overstaffing.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, if a state firm is downsized by one
third,it can still operate smoothly; if downsized by half, its
performance will be better," he said at the same press conference.
</P>
<P>
Reform should be carried out in a step-by-step way, and
society's capability to bear the burden of downsizing should be
taken into consideration, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot simply dump redundant workers onto the society,"
said Chen.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the urgency of enterprise reform, however, and
expressed his belief that conditions are ripe for deepening
reform.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese Soldier Testifies About Truth Of War Diary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A former Japanese soldier got 10
documents from a notary office here for a lawsuit against Japanese
soldiers who murdered a Chinese during the Nanjing Massacre in
December 1937.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro, who is now 86, got involved in the lawsuit after
he published his diary from World War II a few years ago. Some of
his fellow soldiers sued him for his disclosure about the murder
of a Chinese citizen.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese was put in a mailbag by the soldiers and set on
fire with gasoline, he wrote in his diary, they then strapped
three hand grenades to it and threw it into a pond.
</P>
<P>
A local court in Tokyo decided that Azuma Shiro was telling
lying when it decided that it would be impossible for the soldiers
to hide themselves before the grenades exploded.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Nanjing were asked to test the possibility of such a
thing and found that the soldiers would in fact have had enough
time to get away before the grenades exploded.
</P>
<P>
Nakakita Ryotaro, the former Japanese soldier's lawyer,
confirmed that the tests were done well and that they
substantiated the soldier's story.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro today gave his five-volume diary of more than 2,000
pages together with some badges and army flags he has kept for
decades to Nanjing's Jiangdongmen Memorial Hall. At a ceremony,
the former soldier described his participation in the war and his
time in China, from September 1937 to July 1939, and from March
1944 to August 1945.
</P>
<P>
When he surrendered in Shanghai, he recalls, he met a Chinese
soldier who was a survivor of the Nanjing Massacre who told him,
"I want to kill Japanese prisoners of war whenever I see you, but
the policy does not allow me to do so."
</P>
<P>
He has given the memorial hall permission to publish a Chinese
version of his war diary.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Xiao Hong, Designer of Macao SAR Regional Flag &AMP; Emblem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- It was three years after the
regional flag and emblem of the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) was adopted that its 38-year-old designer, Xiao Hong,
made his first trip to Macao.
</P>
<P>
"When I was working on my design, I had no idea about what
Macao resembled; and the only material I had got for reference was
a 600-word tourist guide to it," recalled the astute and
lean-faced Xiao, now a deputy to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), China's top legislature that is in session here
since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Xiao, a professor of arts and crafts from central China's Henan
University, attributed his success to the longing for the early
accomplishment of China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Sensory appeal works in artistic creation, but what's more
important is the input of an artist's true feelings and
dedication," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Xiao overwhelmed over thousands of entrants to win the
top prize of a national contest, and his works became the best
design for the regional flag and emblem of the Macao SAR, which
will be officially founded on December 20 next year with Macao's
return to China.
</P>
<P>
He was then asked by the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law
of the Macao SAR to further improve his designs until they were
approved through examinations during the First Session of the
Eighth NPC in early 1993.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Xiao became one of the most popular figures in the
163-member delegation from Henan Province at the ongoing NPC
session after his fellow lawmakers learned about his background.
</P>
<P>
"I have for long known that it was a young designer from our
province who created the Macao SAR's regional flag and emblem, but
I didn't expect to meet him during this session," one Henan deputy
exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said he was looking forward to the grand ceremony marking
Macao's return to the motherland, at which the flag and emblem he
designed will add to the solemn and jubilant mood on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
"That will be the happiest moment in my life," he said
excitedly.

<HEADLINE> China's Reform Pace-Setter to Make New Contributions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Provincial Governor Lu
Ruihua pledged here today that his province would make new
contributions to the nation in the process of continued reform and
opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
This year, the 20th anniversary of China's economic reform,
Guangdong will redouble its efforts to maintain its position as a
pace-setter in reform, said Lu, who is here attending the Ninth
National People's Congress in session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong leads the country in terms of gross domestic product,
import and export volume, overseas investment, tax income and
sales of consumer goods, and it has embarked on the road of a
rapid and smooth economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The province's economic growth is expected to reach 10 percent
to reach 800 billion yuan this year, he said. If the province
grows at the current pace, it will have realized modernization by
the year 2010, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
To boost agricultural development, Guangdong will work out
regulations and adopt administrative measures to curb the
shrinkage of farmland, he said.
</P>
<P>
On strengthening cooperation between Guangdong and Hong Kong,
the governor said, Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao traditionally
have a mutually complementary and cooperative relationship. He
expressed the belief that such mutual cooperation will further
strengthen.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the Asian financial crisis, it will be difficult for
Guangdong to increase its exports this year, but the province will
try every possible means to achieve a growth rate of 10 percent in
this field, he said.

the need to intervene in the Kosovo conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that everything must be done to ensure that another
conflagration do not explode in Europe.... It is vital to initiate
a dialogue between Belgrade and Kosovo-Albanians on the future of
the region. That is a matter of uttermost urgency," said Kinkel
at a news conference after a meeting with Albright in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Albright also told reporters that "the time to stop killings is
now before it spreads. The way to do it is to take an immediate
action against Belgrade to ensure that it pay the price for the
damages already done and to encourage it to finally resolve the
problems in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Both Albright and Kinkel will participate in a meeting of
foreign ministers of the international contact group Monday in
London.
</P>
<P>
According to them, the London meeting will discuss a series of
measures ranging from economic incentives to threat of sanctions
to force Belgrade to make concession on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
However, both of them declined to talk about the details.
</P>
<P>
The contact group consists of the United States, Russia,
France, Britain, Germany and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Top Judge Calls for Continued Crackdowns on Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Top judge Ren Jianxin said here
today that China would unswervingly adhere to the principle of
severely cracking down on major crimes according to law, which is
also known as "Strike Hard", to maintain public security.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of constant 'Strike Hard' efforts in these years,
the current overall situation for public security is stable, and
growth in criminal offences has declined," said Ren, president of
the Supreme People's Court, during a panel discussion with the
Shanxi delegation to the ongoing session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there are still some places where the public
security situation is not good, and just as Premier Li Peng noted
in his government work report to the current NPC session, the
broad masses of the people are still dissatisfied with the current
public security situation.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we must remain sober-minded and make unremitting
efforts to continue the 'Strike Hard' struggle," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all judicial bodies to firmly implement the principle
of cracking down fast, heavily and in accordance with law on
crimes seriously harming public security, wipe out social evils
like pornography, gambling and drugs, and fight against corruption
in a down-to-earth manner by severely punishing criminals in cases
of embezzlement and bribery.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement departments should also resolutely combat
economic crimes, such as sabotaging financial order and tax
collection, smuggling, and producing and selling fake and shoddy
goods, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We must punish crimes, protect the people and provide them
with a stable work, study and living environment," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Party Returns to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) returned to the Jatiya Sangsad
(parliament) Sunday afternoon following a six-month abstention
since August 30 last year.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary crisis, which arose out of continued boycott
by the opposition, was put to an end when the ruling Awami League
and the BNP reached an agreement on March 2, which was endorsed by
the BNP Parliamentary Party Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the result of a four-day negotiation, the
ruling party agreed to withdraw before March 31 "all the
politically motivated cases" filed against BNP lawmakers, leaders
and party workers after investigations, and the opposition would
return to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"All the 113 BNP members of parliament shall be inducted in
parliamentary standing committees on 35 ministries," the agreement
said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament might witness heated debate on the Chittagong
Hill Tracts agreement, which the government and the tribal rebels
signed last December and has attracted strong attacks from the
opposition, reports said.
</P>
<P>
At a public meeting on Saturday evening, Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina thanked the opposition party for its decision to return to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
She said she hoped the BNP would play its due role in making
the parliament effective and meaningful.
</P>
<P>
The Jatiya Sangsad was the center of all activities where all
national issues could be sorted out through debate and discussion,
she said.

<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major business
briefs from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The total budget deficit of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states dropped to 10 billion U.S. dollars in 1996
from 20 billion dollars in 1993, Egyptian newspaper Today's
World reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states, which group Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, had worked out programs
designed to eliminate their deficits by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The 31st Cairo International Fair will open on
Wednesday with up to 3,500 Egyptian and foreign companies
participating.
</P>
<P>
As many as 1,000 foreign companies will showcase their products
at the exhibition, which will provide investors with potential
opportunities to enhance their contribution to the development in
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Gulf Arab oil-producing countries will intensify
their consultations with the aim of finding means to halt the
decline of oil prices in the world markets.
</P>
<P>
Gulf sources believed that it was unlikely for oil officials of
the six GCC states to meet soon before the proposed emergency
conference of OPEC member states in a bid to end the constant
decline of oil prices in the world market which has a direct and
considerable effect on the budgets of the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A delegation from the Kuwait Airways Corporation
started talks in Amman, the capital of Jordan, Saturday with
officials of the General Organization of the Royal Jordanian
Airline on ways of rectifying the flights between Jordan and
Kuwait, which resumed last summer.
</P>
<P>
The talks will also deal with the possibility of redoubling the
flights between Jordan and Kuwait - which are four flights a week
at present - to meet the growing demand for travelling by plane
between the two countries, especially during the summer months.

<HEADLINE> "Science Quality" Should Be Improved in China: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- It is of great urgency to enhance
the "science quality" of the Chinese nation, a member of China's
top advisory body said here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shu, a member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, which is in
session here, urged the government to increase investment in
spreading popular scientific knowledge and building more
scientific facilities.
</P>
<P>
The science-related quality of a nation covers three aspects:
understanding of scientific terms and concepts, understanding of
the process and methods of scientific researches and understanding
of the impact of science on social development, he said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the China Association for Science
and Technology (CAST) shows that 25 percent of the people aged
between 18 and 69 surveyed have never heard of the word
"molecule," nor have 45 percent of them any idea of what DNA is.
</P>
<P>
"What worries me most is that the recent survey has almost the
same result as the one conducted in 1992," said Liu, who is also
CAST vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
In terms of people's "science quality", China legs far behind
the United States, Japan and European countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The most fundamental factor affecting a nation's "science
quality" is the level of education its people receive, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said governments at all levels in China should give priority
to the development of education and quicken the pace of illiteracy
elimination.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, nine-year compulsory
education is now universally provided in 65 percent of areas in
China. The percentage is expected to go up to 72 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
At present, six percent of Chinese adults are illiterate. The
state strives to help 3.5 million young and middle-aged
illiterates learn to read and write this year.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Security Forces Uncover Rifle Workshop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Security forces
have informed Israel that they uncovered an underground workshop
for making rifles in Gaza, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said that hundreds of rifles have already
been manufactured by the factory.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli security forces said they believed the number of
rifles made there was not as large as that reported by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
There was no report about who operated the factory and whether some
suspects have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Palestinian security forces arrested some
members of a Hamas terrorist cell in the West Bank city of Nablus,
who reportedly had been planning a terrorist attack somewhere in
central Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been insisting that its next troop pullback from
the West Bank is contingent on the implementation of the
Palestinian commitments to fight against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Frequent terrorist attacks against Israel in recent years have
seriously hold up the Israeli-Palestinian peace process which has
been stalled since Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem last March.

<HEADLINE> US Delegation Comments On China's Village Election (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Liu Guodong, a section chief in charge of grass-roots political
power at Jilin's Civil Affairs Bureau, said that the village
committee election is important because it helps form the basic
procedures of democratic elections, with its secret ballet, direct
elections, choosing from a number of candidates, and counting
ballots in public.
</P>
<P>
Mobile poll boxes have been used to help the elderly and the
disabled, and boxes are the responsibility of specially designated
people, whose job is to see that the voting process stays legal.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Pastor said that the process was handled in a very good
manner, and that, even in the United States, problems often occur
with mobile boxes. He said that, to ensure impartial and fair
election results, a good method is to ask both the winner and
loser of the election to sign the election results sheet.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that what impressed him the most is
Chinese officials' desire to work with people to find better ways
to reach the common goal of mankind, of turning the desire for
democracy into actual democracy, but that he was impressed by the
hard work in the village elections and the fair competition to
choose leaders that people really believe in.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Favors Policy on Renminbi's Stable Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) in session here voiced their endorsement
to the policy of maintaining a stable exchange rate of Renminbi
(RMB).
</P>
<P>
They shared the view that many Asian nations were plunged into
a regional financial crisis and their financial system and
national economic growth suffered a hard blow, whereas China was
basically not affected in this regard and accorded a good momentum
for high economic growth with low inflation.
</P>
<P>
Many deputies voiced the hope that China will continue to
implement a stable financial policy.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, an NPC deputy and a noted economist, held that RMB
should not be depreciated, nor is there any necessary to do so. If
the Chinese yuan is depreciated, it will aggravate the Southeast
Asian financial crisis and compel the related countries to
continue devaluating their currencies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that the Reminbi's depreciation will have
an impact on China's absorption of investment from overseas as it
will cast a heavier burden on imports though it can stimulate
exports. Enterprises then will have a great pressure in repaying
foreign debts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Xie Qingjian, president of the Zhejiang Branch of the People's
Bank of China (PBC), said the maintenance of a stable RMB is of
great importance to the country's economic growth. With an
unstable currency value, a nation's economy is likely to
fluctuate, he noted. The reform on China's exchange system over
the years has proven successful and accords with the country's
actual conditions.
</P>
<P>
As China has a foreign currency reserve of 140 billion U.S.
dollars, it retained a steady economic growth with a low price
rise rate. All these make the people to confide still more in a
stable RMB exchange rate, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Houjian, head of the Hi-Sense Group, a high-tech firm
based in the port city of Qingdao in east China's Shandong
Province, said, "the maintenance of a stable RMB exchange rate has
brought great benefits and provides a very favaorable outer
environment for new and high-tech enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Chan Yau-hing, an NPC deputy from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and chairman of the Asia Financial
Holdings, said that stable exchange rate of RMB is a matter of
concern in Hong Kong, as it benefits Hong Kong's current practice
of pegging its dollar with U.S. dollar and boosted the residents'
confidence in the HK SAR, which returned to the embrace of the
motherland eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
The international community is following closely with the
trends of development with the RMB, which shows that its stable
exchange rate plays a decisive role in stabilizing economic growth
in Asia and the world as a whole, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from industrial circles were unanimous that the
depreciation of currencies in neighboring countries will not
affect China's exports, especially its processing trade with
supplied materials.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, NPC deputies have also shown a firm support to the
decision of continuing to improve and intensify financial control
and supervision.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Call for Legislation on Non-public-owned Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) suggested that legislative work
be strengthened so as to ensure the sound growth of
non-public-owned economy.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies Chen Hong and Liao Changguang, both from the
newly-founded Chongqing Municipality, have taken the lead in
submitting a motion on the legislation concerning the
non-public-owned economic sector to the ongoing First Session of
the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, more than 100 NPC deputies from different places and
trades have signed on the motion. According to Chinese law, a
motion with more than 30 signatures will be valid.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hong, chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of
Industry and Commerce, said the legislation will be aimed at
standardizing the growth of non-public-owned economic sector,
protecting its legal rights and interests, clarifying its social
responsibilities, creating a more relaxed environment for it, and
make it cope with the demand of building the market economy with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The existing laws are not able to meet the need of this
economic sector's development, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics provided by Chen Hong, there had
been more than 960,000 private businesses across China by the end
of 1997, which employed 13.5 million people and involved fixed
assets totaling 514 billion yuan (61.9 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The total output value of these businesses in 1997 reached
392.2 billion yuan (47.25 billion US dollars), and their combined
business income amounted to 309.6 billion yuan (37.3 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), held in last fall, has made it clear that the
non-public-owned economic sector has contributed significantly to
the national economy.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A visiting delegation from the
U.S.'s Carter Center has witnessed a village committee in
northeast China's Jilin Province and heard an explanation by local
officials about how it works.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Pastor, the head of the 10-member delegation, which
stood in a piercing cold wind for five hours to witness the
election process in the village of Gujialingzi, commented that he
has seen a lot of elections in many countries but has never seen
government officials doing the job so seriously.
</P>
<P>
One of the candidates for village leader, Liu Fu, a bean curd
maker, promised in his speech to teach his people the skills for
making bean curd free of charge, if he is elected head of the
village.
</P>
<P>
"Promising is one thing, but doing a good job is another
thing," was the response of one villager who asked not to be
identified and who took exception with Liu's promise.

<P>
The village committee is a grass-roots organization in rural
China with a rural population of 900 million, and a direct
election system in one million villages was introduced in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Chengfu, a Civil Affairs Ministry official in charge of
political power at the grass-roots level, points out that
fundamental changes have taken place in choosing village committee
members in recent years, having gone from administrative
appointment to direct election. And election methods have changed,
from a village Party committee nominating the candidates to giving
complete freedom to nominate candidates to the villagers.

<HEADLINE> Australian, Canadian Win HK Int'l Golden Mile Races </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Anthony Hill of Australia and
Canada's Cindy O'Krane won the men's and women's international
races at the 13th annual Hong Kong International Golden Mile races
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Hill, 26, clocked a title-winning time of four minutes 10
seconds in the men's race, eight seconds slower than his personal
best time.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by Canada's pre-race favorite Allan Klassen in
4:12 and British Joseph Mills, who clocked 4:14.
</P>
<P>
Hill, ranked third back in Australia, said the victory "paid
off" the painstaking efforts he had made. He had to recover from
injuries he had suffered during the 1995 race here when he was
sixth.
</P>
<P>
He said he enjoyed the race, the first major race for him this
season. Praising the crowd "very inspiring", he said he would try
to come back next year.
</P>
<P>
O'Krane, a Canadian debutante at the race, clocked 4:41 to take
the women's race.
</P>
<P>
Liu Haiyan from Guangdong, China, was second in the close chase
by clocking 4:42 and Indonesia's Supriyati Sutono finished third
in 4:48.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old O'Krane said the win was not easy. "There are
many sharp corners which is really challenging to me. If not with
those corners, I would have run faster," she said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Haiyan, who finished third in last year's race here, said
she had made a tactical mistake in the race by running too slow in
the early stages.
</P>
<P>
"I really should take the lead but poor pre-race training made
me decide just to follow others in the first," the 24-year-old
said.

<HEADLINE> Five West Africans Arrested in Zambia for Cheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Five west Africans have been
arrested by Zambian police for cheating a local businessman of 45
million Kwacha (30,000 U.S. Dollars) in a deal to counterfeit 3
million dollars, reported the Sunday Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The five suspects were picked up by Zambian police last
Thursday in Lusaka, police service spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe
said Saturday, adding that three of them are from Senegal, Ivory
Coast, Guinea respectively and the other two claimed to be from
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian businessman was cheated in a lucrative deal. The
conmen promised to reward him handsomely once he gave them the
money to acquire chemicals to be used to counterfeit the 3
million fake dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the deal turned sour when the five suspects got away
with the businessman's money.
</P>
<P>
The five initially approached the man with a package
containing papers that they claimed, came from the U.S. and
contained three million dollars in paper form, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
They told the businessman that the papers can turn into U.S.
Dollars once processed in chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The conmen dubiously processed a $10 and a $20 note to convice
the man and assured him of five percent of the 3 million dollars
once he gave 45 million Kwacha for chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The local businessman gave them the money and withheld the
package containing the purported 3 million dollars as surety that
they would come.
</P>
<P>
He reported the case to the police last Thusday after the five
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Some more people are belived to be involved into the case and
the investigations are still under way, said the police
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Expects Relief to Fuel Scarcity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The wide fuel scarcity in
oil-producing Nigeria is expected to be partly relieved Tuesday,
when a major refinery in the southern city of Port Harcourt
resumes production after maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The management of the Port Harcourt Refinery said this at the
weekend, when Musa Sheshu, Administrator of the Rivers
State, paid a visit to the refinery.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Africa's top oil producer with a daily crude oil
production of over two million barrels, has been suffering from
persistent fuel shortage due to the poor performances of its four
major refineries.
</P>
<P>
Turn-around-maintenance of the refineries have been overdue
for years but work could not be started for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
The Port Harcourt refinery, with a daily processing capacity
of 150,000 barrels, was shut down in mid-February due to a major
equipment failure.

<HEADLINE> International Seminar on Ganges Barrage Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international seminar on
the feasibility of the proposed Ganges Barrage project in
Bangladesh started here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to ensure the welfare of the country and its people
through proper management and development of the water resources
of Bangladesh," Prime Minster Sheikh Hasina said while
inaugurating the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Ganges water sharing treaty her government signed
with India in 1996 had opened the opportunity of undertaking
projects for the development of the Ganges water resources, she
said.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to act now on the best possible option...for
improving the life and livelihood for our people on the water of
the Ganges," she said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, on "water resources management and development in
Bangladesh with particular reference to the Ganges River," was
attended by some 150 delegates, including 59 from foreign
countries and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the seminar, jointly organized by the
Bangladesh Water Resources Ministry, the Japanese government, the
World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, was free exchange of
views among experts and government officials to find out common
terms and conditions to build the barrage.
</P>
<P>
The much-talked-about barrage near Bhanga, Faridpur, some 112
kilometers northwest of here, has been planned for protecting the
southwest region of the country which reports said has been
seriously affected by the Farakka Barrage of India.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the barrage was needed to utilize the Ganges
water properly, after the signing of the Ganges water sharing
treaty, to protect the world's largest mangrove forest of
Sundarban, maintain environmental balance and ensure
socio-economic development in the southwestern region.

<HEADLINE> S. African Fuel-to-Oil Giant Weighs Arabian Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- OBSOL, the oil-from-coal
giant in South Africa, is studying two foreign projects to
convert gas to liquid fuels, local daily Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
SASOL is expected to make the decision in the next two to
three months as to whether to go ahead with a 24 billion Rand
(2.8 billion U.S. Dollars) diesel-from-gas project in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Using its locally developed slurry phase distillate process,
the plant could be in full operation by 2003, producing 20,000
barrels a day at Rass Laffan in eastern Qatar, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The project also involves the state-owned Qatar General
Petroleum Corporation which will have a 51 percent interest in
the operation and provide the natural gas, while the U.S. based
Phillips Petroleum Company with 14 percent, will provide
marketing expertise.
</P>
<P>
SASOL will hold 35 percent and provide the technology.
</P>
<P>
The process will produce a synthetic diesel fuel with superior
characteristics to those of conventional fuels, free of sulphur,
low in aromatics and with lower emission levels.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the first major venture to convert natural gas to
liquid fuels and could be used in other parts of the world
because it is environmentally friendly," said SASOL managing
director Pieter Cox.
</P>
<P>
Also under investigation is a project to convert gas into
crude oil and liquid fuels with Statoil of Norway. Statoil has
substantial gas reserves in the North Sea.

STOCKHOLM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hans Knauss of Austria won a
super-G race in Kvitfjell, Norway, while compatriot and Olympic
champion Hermann Maier secured the World Cup title in the event
despite staying at home with back pains Sunday, reports said.

medal with Knauss at the Nagano Olympics, was third in one minute
31.25.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Maier, who won the overall World Cup title on Saturday after
his only rival and compatriot Andreas Schifferer crashed out of

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) - Unproportional age group
marriages between girls and men have lowered the family planning
rate in Tanzania to 12 percent, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Catherine Sanga, Assistant Manager of the National Family
Planning Project, told a workshop here that as a common practice
in which many girls married older men qualified to be their
grandfathers, such kind of couples don't discuss family planning
matters.
</P>
<P>
"Studies have revealed that over 50 percent of couples in
Tanzania don't discuss reproductive health or particularly family
planning issues in their life," she said.
</P>
<P>
Though family planning was accepted at the highest 23.7
percent in the Kilimanjaro Region, she said, the Shinyanga Region
was at the ebb with only 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sanga called on the government to update the Marriage Law so
as to safeguard teenage girls against the risks of marrying old
men because it is unsafe as their children's supporting hip bones
are not fully matured till they reach the age of 20.
</P>
<P>
"Adolescent marriages and exposure to unsafe sex have led the
maternal deaths rate risen to alarming levels of from 500 to 700
per 100,000 live births," she added.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Urged to Attack Theft of Electric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian lawmaker has
urged the government to attack the rampant theft of electric
wires which has affected power supplies.
</P>
<P>
Theft of electric wires has forced the Pangani District
Hospital in the Tanga region on the border with Kenya to suspend
services due to power shortage, Mohamed Rished Abdallah, a member
of parliament, told reporters in Dar es Salaam Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The MP, who is from Pangani, said the electric wires which
were stolen in the region were sold in Kenya. Three incidents of
the same nature have been reported this year, according to the
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Such criminal activities took place in remote areas in most
cases, said Rished, who advised the Tanzanian Electric Supply
Company (TANESCO) to install electric cables in densely populated
areas.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the government to collaborate with the
eastern and central African countries to attack the illegal
market of electric wires.

<HEADLINE> Laser Makes Conventional Surgeons Redundant: Journal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) - A new surgery which uses beams of
light instead of scalpels, leaves no scar and is virtually pain
free is being tested in Britain.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the treatment, which uses laser light could
make current techniques of chopping out diseased tissue seem crude
and inhumane and make conventional surgeons redundant.
</P>
<P>
According to a British medical journal, trials have been
carried out in cancers of the breast, cervix, lung, prostate and
mouth.
</P>
<P>
In breast cancer, the technique leaves no scar or cosmetic
deformity and can be performed as an outpatient procedure under
local anaesthetic, the journal said.
</P>
<P>
The technology, which has advanced dramatically in the past few
years, is also being tested in heart disease, as a gentle
alternative to hysterectomy and as a substitute for antibiotic
treatment of infections.
</P>
<P>
Professor Stephen Bown, director of the National Medical Laser
Center at University College of London Medical School, said, "it
is a new world. It is possible it will cut out a lot of
conventional surgery. It is more subtle."
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is mounting that laser treatments can offer
considerable advantages over other options for a range of
conditions," Bown added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa left here Sunday for a week-long visit to Germany and
France.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the airport, Tung said that he will
bring the message to the two European countries that "since the
return of Hong Kong (to China), everything is really going well,
that 'one country, two systems' is now solidly embedded, that the
pride and confidence level is high."
</P>
<P>
Only very recently, the German Chamber of Commerce conducted a
survey which showed close to 85 percent of the Germans here have
a great deal of confidence in Hong Kong, Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
Of course there are "pains and challenges brought about by the
currency turmoil around us", Tung admitted. But "we have been
doing very well in containing these challenges and I am sure we
will come out even better than before," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive will be accompanied by Secretary for Trade
and Industry Denise Yue on the European trip.
</P>
<P>
Tung will spend two days in Germany, visiting Bonn and
Frankfurt. On his tentative agenda are meetings with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and other government officials.
</P>
<P>
On his three-day visit to France, which includes visits to
Paris and Lyon, the Chief Executive will meet French President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

<HEADLINE> Hostage Drama Ends in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The four-day hostage drama in the
Reception and Diagnostic Center of the Davao Penal Colony in
Kapalong, the Southern Philippines, ended Sunday following a
police assault on eight inmates who had been holding five women
since Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All hostage-takers were accounted for after a three-minute
police raid, the official Philippine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the anti-terrorist team members from the
regional police mobile force disguised before the assault as food
servers to both hostage-takers and hostages.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the hostages were hurt in the raid as they
were pushed out of the center area.
</P>
<P>
They were stabbed by the abductors led by Dario Mahumot, who
violently reacted to the blazing guns of the raiding team, which
was assisted by the Criminal Investigation Service Command, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Paulina Corda, chief of the center, was in critical
condition as she was brought down to the Davao Medical Center in
Davao City, along with four other hostages aboard a Philippine
Airforce helicopter, it said.
</P>
<P>
The eight inmates took hostages the five women employees of the
Davao Penal Colony Thursday morning, demanding safe passage to the
rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front's camp, the ouster of the
prison superintendent and the construction of a mosque in the
colony.

<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
today called for readjusting investment structure, cuting down
expenditures, and stopping construction of top-grade office
buildings and luxury hotels and overlapping projects.
</P>
<P>
At a penal discussion of NPC deputies from the northeast China
province of Liaoning to the on-going Ninth National People's
Congress, Zhu said China will strive to increase its investment in
capital construction projects, railways and highways,
telecommunications, environmental protection, new and high-tech
projects, technological upgrading at existing enterprises and
residential housing projects.
</P>
<P>
Hearing the tendency of imposing a heavy burden upon farmers
and rural enterprises, Zhu said this is a kind of corruption.
Though the central authorities have repeatedly reiterated that
farmers' burden should be alleviated, the related policies have
not been implemented in many areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
Energetic efforts will be made in this regard, Zhu said.

<HEADLINE> Qatar: Oil Price Slump Imposes No Threat to OPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Oil Minister Abdullah
bin Hamad Al-Attiyah has said that the current oil price slump
would not impose any threat to the future of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Qatar's Oil Minister was quoted Sunday by the official Qatari
news agency (QNA) as saying that "the present (price) crisis will
not lead to the collapse of OPEC."
</P>
<P>
Al-Attiyah said that OPEC "is a very important organization to
the oil market even from the psychological point of view."
</P>
<P>
Al-Attiyah on Thursday warned other OPEC oil ministers against
hurrying into an emergency meeting this month without careful
preparations on how the group could rescue sagging oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The prices have lost by more than 30 percent to the current 14
dollars a barrel due to abundant supplies and declined demand
caused by a mild winter in the northern hemisphere and Asia's
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The ample supplies was triggered by OPEC's November decision
to raise its combined output ceiling by 10 percent to 27.5
million barrels per day, and compounded by consistent quota
violations by some OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's Secretary General Riwanu Lukman has invited the
group's 11 members to attend a scheduled four-man monitoring
committee meeting to discuss ways of propping up oil prices.
</P>
<P>
But experts predict that the meeting will fail to reach any
substantial breakthrough to tackle the slump in prices due to
the reluctance of the majority of the bloc's members to trim
their output quotas.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, OPEC's biggest quota buster has said publicly that
it would not cut output by even one barrel to turn the market
around if other members take the lead. Saudi Arabia, Iran and
Kuwait have also refused to become the first to lead in reining in
production.

BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng called on
governments at all levels to take care of laid-off workers from
numerous small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Such enterprises constitute the majority of debt-ridden firms,

<P>
Li made the call in a group discussion attended by Shandong
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC), in session here

</P>
<P>
Li said large state firms dominate with economic strength while
small enterprises employ the majority of workers.

<P>
Governments at all levels must handle problems in small
enterprises well in state enterprise reform, he said.
</P>

Mixed ownership is conducive to the technical upgrading and

<HEADLINE> Oil-for-Food Deal Very Temporary Measure: Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 8 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rasheed said on Saturday that Iraq wants lifting of U.N. sanctions
instead of the oil-for-food deal, a very temporary measure.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Rasheed said
oil-for-food deal under U.N. Security Council resolution 986,
which allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil to buy food and
medicine, was temporary measure supposed to be for only six
months.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the deal has existed for three years
instead of six months.
</P>
<P>
"We work with it, we facilitate its implementation, but it
is temporary measure. The proper measure is the lifting of all
sanctions, which we deserve fully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed, top negotiator in talks with the U.N. Special
Commission charged of disarming Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction, said the United States intended to make oil-for-food
deal a sort of permanent measure, so that iraq can only buy
consuming items.
</P>
<P>
What the United States wants to see is that "Iraq cannot
build its health infrastructure, it cannot build its agricultural,
industrial, educational and oil infrastructure, so that it doesn't
develop its capability as a society," said Rasheed.
</P>
<P>
Under the first and second phases of oil-for-food deal, Iraq
was allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
A new U.N. Security Council resolution adopted last month
allows Iraq to pump 5.2 billion dollars worth of oil in six
months in the third phase which started from last December.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq has said it is unable to pump oil of more
than 4 billions dollars in six months.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said there are two reasons behind its unability to
pump that much oil. First, the decline of oil prices. He
said in the first phase of oil-for-food deal, oil price was
18 dollars per barrel; now it is just more than 11 dollars
per barrel and the price is coming down.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, it is the lack of spare parts and chemical
material. "American position within the U.N. Sanctions Committee
was to refuse all the contracts we have presented to them for
approval. They have been holding them now for more than one year,
we only got very, very little amount of spare parts," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said that Iraq has agreed to receiving oil experts sent
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Iraq next week.
</P>
<P>
"We will define with them our requirement in terms of spare
parts and chemical material, so we can increase oil export," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq now can pump 3 million barrels of oil per day and
consumes 0.7 million barrels, so it can only export more than 2
million barrels. "We will explain this to oil experts that there will
be quite a few hundred of millions of dollars we need to the
minimum," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) has
de-registered 161 companies and business houses which have failed
to remit value added tax (VAT).
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia Sunday quoted ZRA public relations officer
Juliet Sibande as saying Saturday that the de-registeration is an
ongoing exercise.
</P>
<P>
Sibande said the de-registered firms should immediately
surrender their certificates to ZRA.
</P>
<P>
She warned that those who will be found using certificates
after they have been de-registered will be charged 10,000 penalty
units or 12 months imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
"The law of the land will take its course and those caught
would be fined 10,000 penalty units which is equivalent to a fine
of 1.8 million Kwacha (1300 U.S. Dollars) or imprisonment not
exceeding 12 months or both," said Sibanda.
</P>
<P>
She added that those who are using certificates after being
de-registered are stealing money from the government.

<HEADLINE> West Knows Little of Religious Affairs in China: Bishop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Countries in the West know very
little about religious affairs in China, according to a well-known
religious figure.
</P>
<P>
"For Western countries, their knowledge of religious matters in
China has remained to be that of 20 years ago," said Fu Tieshan,
head of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and bishop of
the Beijing Diocese, in an interview. Fu is currently attending
the annual session of the Chinese legislature as a deputy here.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government pursues a policy of religious
freedom," he said. "At present, there are more than 100 million
religious believers throughout the country."
</P>
<P>
He said that since the end of the 1970s, more than 5,000
catholic churches have been restored.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pious to God when I participate in the administration of
state affairs," said the 66-year-old Fu.
</P>
<P>
Fu said the common task for the country's five religions,
namely Buddism, Taoism, Catholicism, Christianity and Islam, is to
adapt the religions to socialism, China's national conditions and
the Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
"People may believe in the same God, but the methods of worship
should be different in accordance with difference national
conditions," he said, adding that support from religious circles
is needed for reform, development and stability in China.
</P>
<P>
"Also," he said, "religious development would suffer if the
Chinese economy and society should get into trouble."

HONG KONG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung
 Chee Hwa left here Sunday for a week-long visit to Germany and
France.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the airport, Tung said, he will bring
the message to the two European countries that "since the return
of Hong Kong, everything is really going well, that 'one country,
two systems' is now solidly embedded, that the pride and
confidence level is high."
</P>
<P>
Only very recently, the German Chamber of Commerce did a survey
 which showed close to 85 percent of the Germans here have a great
 deal of confidence in Hong Kong, Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
Of course there are "pains and challenges brought about by the
currency turmoil around us", Tung admitted. But "we have been
doing very well in containing these challenges and I am sure we
will come out even better than before," he said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive will be accompanied by Secretary for Trade
and Industry Denise Yue on the European trip.
</P>
<P>
Tung will spend two days in Germany, visiting Bonn and
Frankfurt. On his tentative agenda are meetings with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and other government officials.
</P>
<P>
On his three-day visit to France, which includes visits to
Paris and Lyon, the Chief Executive will meet French President
Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.

<HEADLINE> Deteriorating Students Health Situation in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Xinhua) -- All students in a high
school in Soweto, Johannesburg, were found to be HIV-positive,
and as a result, health authorities had to destroy about 400
liters of contaminated blood taken from the pupils, City Press
weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
About 920 students at the school are infected with the human
immuno-deficiency virus, which will lead to the deadly disease of
AIDS, the paper said. But it did not name the school in the
largest black township in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted sources as saying that the contamination
is a major problem faced by the South African Blood Transfusion
Service, which invariably stumbled upon liters of infected blood
each time they tried to replenish the blood bank.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't spoken to the press about this incident because
AIDS stigmatizes," the paper quoted one source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The implication is that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is rampant in
South Africa and runs deeper than people want to believe, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
Published figures of South Africans infected by the HIV/AIDS
epidemic at the moment range between 2.2 million and 3.5 million.
Working on these figures means between 220,000 and 350,000 South
Africans, especially young people, will die each year for the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma said last month that the
disease is "gnawing away at our population," with 1,500 people
now infected every day.
</P>
<P>
A South African life insurer, Southern Life, predicted last
year that 25 percent of South Africans will be HIV-positive by
the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Maintains Good Public Security: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is one of the world's
best cities with public security, director of the Beijing Public
Security Bureau Zhang Liangji said today.
</P>
<P>
"It is absurd for someone to say that the crime rate in Beijing
is high as in New York," said Zhang, who is attending the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) as an NPC
deputy.
</P>
<P>
The number of criminal offenses has been on the decline, and
the capital's public security keeps improving, the director told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
With regard to some major cases, public security departments
have gone all out to step up investigations and prosecutions. Some
absurdities about some crime cases in Beijing spreading overseas
are untrue, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we cannot lower our guard as economic reform is
unfolding in a deep-going way," he said, adding that the flux of
immigrants from elsewhere in China imposed a pressure on public
security situation in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In addition, hundreds of thousands of workers will have been
laid off by the year 2000. They might affect public security if
the problem is not handled appropriately, he said.
</P>
<P>
So there lies ahead the arduous task of cracking down on
drug-related crimes and organized crimes, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
As China is in the primary stage of socialism, he explained,
crimes cannot be done away with overnight, and some cases might
be on rise sometimes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Quoted Premier Li as saying in his government work report on
Thursday,"It is entirely necessary to strengthen armed police, and
public security and state security departments," Zhang said that
"it is of major importance to maintain stability in Beijing as
China's capital city."

of China (CPC) Central Committee, in a group discussion attended
by deputies from Heilongjiang Province to the National People's
Congress (NPC), in session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to guard against the erroneous practice of a
few leading officials deciding to merge or sell an enterprise
without consulting workers before hand," Wei said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not merely an issue of procedure or working methods,"
he said. "It concerns the result of state firm reform and social
stability."
</P>
<P>
Leading cadres of debt-ridden enterprises must keep the style
of hard struggle and plain living and should set examples by
sharing hardships as well as comforts with the masses, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will never allow a few leading cadres of enterprises to
squander money and live in extravagance, or even seek personal
gains by abusing their powers, while some workers are laid off and
live a difficult life," he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Party official noted that the organization and
readjustment of leadership lineup in state firms must be based on
popular agreement from workers and the system of evaluating
leading cadres of enterprises annually by workers must be
maintained.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Central Bank Establishes Deposit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia (BOZ), a
central bank, is establishing a deposit protection scheme for
savers, a measure designed to protect depositors in the event of
a bank failure, Times of Zambia reported sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed Saturday in Lusaka by Abraham Mwenda, BOZ
deputy governor in charge of operations.
</P>
<P>
When discussing at a fund-raising dinner the impact of bank
closures on the economy and steps the central bank is taking to
arrest the situation, Mwenda said the scheme is one of the
central bank's measures to improve the country's banking
industry.
</P>
<P>
However, Mwenda gave no further details on the scheme.
</P>
<P>
The BOZ is also revising the country's 1994 Bank and Financial
Services Act by introducing additional regulations that are aimed
at empowering the central bank to swiftly deal with ailing banks,
improve corporate governance in banks and ensure that managers
run their banks prudently.
</P>
<P>
As for the argument by some quarters that the banking industry
is collapsing, the deputy governor said it is an exaggerated
assertion with no firm basis whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
He said the size of the banking sector has remained largely
unaffected as the banks that have gone under accounted for only
five percent of the industry's assets.
</P>
<P>
Although confidence in local small banks has been severely
eroded, this is not the case for the entire banking system,
Mwenda stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also assured that monetary authorities and the Zambian
government will remain committed to the pursuit of prudent fiscal
and monetary policies which will contain bank failures which
Zambia suffered much in the past year.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang People Aspiring for Stability, Development: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Social stability, ethnical unity
and economic growth are the aspirations sought after by the 16
million people of various ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, chairman of the regional people's government
said.
</P>
<P>
The aspirations are a driving force to promote the reform and
opening-up of Xinjiang, said Ablait Abdurexit, chairman of the
autonomous regional people's government who is here attending
the First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress as an
NPC deputy.
</P>
<P>
He called on regional officials to take active measures to
safeguard social stability and boost economic development.
</P>
<P>
"At the time being, Xinjiang witnesses a stable situation,
rapid economic growth and marked improvement in the local people's
living standards," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is that people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will
lead a fairly comfortable life by the end of the century, and this
year will be crucial for Xinjiang's development," the 56-year-old
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Xinjiang's agriculture scored bumper harvest for the
20th year in a row, the per capita income of farmers rose by 17
percent over the previous year, and the total industrial output
value increased by 13 percent which was higher than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the autonomous region's fiscal revenue
exceeded 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
At present, the central government is giving more support to
the country's western areas including Xinjiang to promote local
industry, infrastructure, finance, loans and opening-up. "We will
seize the opportunity and turn Xinjiang's advantage in resources
into an economic edge," Ablait said.

<P>
Moreover, he noted, Xinjiang has been receiving considerable
support from the central government and other areas of the
country.
</P>
<P>
A drinking water project completed last year enabled 4.5
million residents of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang to have
access to limpid water. The project cost a total of 900 million
yuan (108 million US dollars), one-third of which came from the
central government.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the central government has
appropriated tens of billions yuan to a number of key projects in
Xinjiang, including a crude oil and petroleum chemical base,
cotton production centers and water conservation, railway and
airport projects.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the autonomous region receives more than 6.5 billion
yuan (783 million US dollars) of fiscal subsidies from the central
government. Over the past five years, Xinjiang has attracted 4.7
billion yuan (566 million US dollars) from other areas of the
country.
</P>
<P>
"We also implemented the policy of freedom in religious belief
and protect the legitimate rights and interests of believers," the
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
In Xinjiang, there are more than 28,000 clergies with some
20,000 mosques and 4,000 scripture recitation sites. The number of
mosques for every 10,000 moslems is higher than that in any Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to implement the Law on Regional Autonomy for
China's Minority Nationalities in real earst, so as to consolidate
the equal, united and mutually-beneficial relationships between
ethnic groups," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Ablait was born into a common family. His father was a shoe
maker.
</P>
<P>
I never dreamed that I could attend college, become an
engineer, serve as chairman of the Xinjiang regional people's
government and act as an NPC chairman," he said. "Because China
carries out the policy of ethnic equality, unity and common
prosperity, and the central government pays attention to selecting
officials from among minority ethnic groups."
</P>
<P>
In the government departments of Xinjiang, officials from
minority ethnic groups account for 60 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Ablait said friends and businessmen from overseas are welcome
to Xinjiang to acquaint themselves with local realities.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Call for Tighter Control of Auto Exhaust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese legislators worried
by the country's worsening air pollution have called for tighter
control over exhaust emissions from cars through law amendments
and administrative measures.
</P>
<P>
"The number of motor vehicles in some large and medium-sized
cities has surged in recent years, and air pollution caused by
auto emissions is damaging urban environment and harming people's
health," said Cao Youxuan, a deputy to the Ninth National People's
Congress, in session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China now has approximately 13 million motor vehicles, and the
number is expected to exceed 20 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Urban air quality reports regularly released by the National
Environmental Protection Agency show that auto emissions have
become a main source of air pollution in some major cities.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts estimate that the annual emission of
harmful gas by motor vehicles across China can reach tens of
millions of tons.
</P>
<P>
Though a law was enacted on air pollution prevention in 1987,
Cao said, the law mainly aims at curbing pollution caused by coal
burning, and can't effectively control auto emissions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the law only stipulates that enterprises
and social institutions will be punished for polluting the air,
while owners of private cars seem to be exempt from any penalties
even if their vehicles have caused pollution.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has won the support of dozens of his fellow
lawmakers to submit a proposal to the ongoing First Session of the
Ninth NPC, asking for an amendment to the law.
</P>
<P>
He also urged relevant government departments and auto makers
to work out stricter standards for auto emissions, carry out more
inspections, and impose more severe punishment on owners of
vehicles that fail to meet standards.
</P>
<P>
As a result of growing public complaints, the government in
recent years has paid increasing attention to air pollution caused
by motor vehicles. Use of leaded gas has been forbidden in several
cities including Beijing and Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Conglomerates On Lookout For Possible Pitfalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The move to reorganize state-owned
enterprises (SOE) into conglomerates suits realities in China and
is not likely to result in disastrous consequences that have
bankrupted some industrial giants in the Republic of Korea,
according to a senior Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
Merging small factories into big enterprise groups is a very
important measure China is taking in SOE reform and the purpose is
to make SOE more competitive, said Chen Qingtai, a vice-minister
in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, at a press
conference hosted by the on-going NPC session here today.
</P>
<P>
"The SOEs are huge in number but weak in strength," said Chen,
saying that capital assets average 10-12 million yuan for the
country's 300,000 SOEs.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible for enterprises with such a small scale to
take part in market competition," noted Chen.
</P>
<P>
China has made a point of guarding against pitfalls that may
come from going big, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first and foremost thing to do is to ensure that they have
a rational liability-to-assets ratio and do not expand their
business lines blindly.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out mergers, enterprises should take
into consideration their actual strength and make sure that
mergers result in strengthened competitiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, these conglomerates should have a stringent internal
management mechanism to prevent chaos, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Moi Briefed on Results of E. African Ministers' </HEADLINE>

<P>
NAIROBI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has received a report from an East African ministerial delegation
on its tour to Belgium, Japan, the U.S. and Britain, reported the
Sunday Nation.
</P>
<P>
Ministers in charge of regional co-operation from east African
countries last month visited the capitals of the above-mentioned
nations to seek support for regional infrastructure development
and a donors' conference on the regional road network project to
be held in May.
</P>
<P>
The report was presented to Moi at his home in Kabarak, about
290 kilometers northwest of Nairobi, by the Chairman of the
Permanent Tripartite Commission for East African Co-operation,
Jakaya Kikwete, who is Tanzanian Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said that during the tour, they received with a great
deal of goodwill from the World Bank, the European Union,
investors and government institutions.
</P>
<P>
President Moi who is the current Chairman of the East African
Co-operation Authority, commended the ministers for the trip and
urged them to work tirelessly to ensure the success of the
donors' meeting scheduled for Arusha, northern Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Weed Chemical Causes Reproductive Defects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The chemical 2.4D, that will be
sprayed in Lake Kariba in north Zimbabwe to destroy the
fast-spreading water weed, causes reproductive defects in both
humans and animals, the Sunday Mail reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lake Kariba, now heavily polluted as a result of direct
inflows of raw sewage from hotels or lodges and from Nyamhunga
and Mahombekombe townships, had been invaded by water hyacinth, a
noxious weed.
</P>
<P>
The weed, now covering about 80 percent of the lake, which is
a source of hydro-electricity for both Zimbabwe and Zambia, was
being fed by nutrients in the lake.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Biological scientists of the University of
Zimbabwe as saying that 2.4D reduced male hormones in those who
drank the contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
In the long term, the paper said, this often resulted in
population losses as has happened in some western European
countries now frantically trying to bring up their population by
offering "incentives"' to couples who bore children.
</P>
<P>
The chemical, also known as "gender bender", had the potential
of interfering with sexual hormones resulting in low sperm count
in males. This had the long term effect of causing barrenness.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chris Magadza, scientist and researcher with the
Department of Biological Sciences of the University of Zimbabwe,
said the loss of the male species occurred even among the fish.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary research had indicated that there were lots of
female fish species in Lake Chivero near Harare as the males had
either low sperm count to fertilize or had become unproductive,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In some fish populations it has been seen that there are no
males at all," said Magadza, who together with his team of
scientists, has undertaken extensive research on the effects of
pollution and industrial effluent into Lake Chivero and Lake
Kariba.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Following is a brief introduction
to the Three Gorges Water Control Project mentioned in Chinese
Premier Li Peng's government work report to the First Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Water Control Project is a key state project
for harnessing the Yangtze River, the world's third longest, in a
comprehensive way. It has many functions including flood control,
power generation and facilitation of shipping on the river. It is
divided into three parts -- construction of a dam, resettlement of
affected people and power generation.
</P>
<P>
The water control project, located near Yichang, central
China's Hubei Province, is the largest project ever built in China
and one of the 1,500 largest projects in the world. It has a
budgetary estimate of 50.09 billion yuan (calculated according to
May, 1993 prices).
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the hydropower station is to have 26
generating units with a combined installed capacity of 18.2
million kw and an annual electricity output of 84.7 billion kwh,
making it the biggest hydropower station in the world. The Yangtze
River was dammed at the project site on November 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement of affected people started in October 1992. The
entire project is scheduled for completion in the year 2009.

BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Following is a brief introduction
to the Xiaolangdi Water Control Project mentioned in Chinese
Premier Li Peng's government work report to the First Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Control Project is the largest of its kind
on the Yellow River. In terms of workload, it is second only to
the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
The project, located 40 km north of the ancient city of Luoyang
in central China's Henan Province, controls an encatchment of
694,000 sq km, 92.3 percent of the total along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
It aims to prevent flooding and ice runs as well as to reduce
silting. It will also have the functions of water supply,
irrigation and power generation.
</P>
<P>
Its estimated cost is around 40 billion yuan, and there is a
plan to use more than one billion U.S. dollars in overseas-sourced
funds. The Yellow River was dammed at the project site on October
28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the project started in September 1991 and is
scheduled for completion in the year 2001.

BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Following is an explanation of the
system of provincial governors assuming responsibility for the
"rice bag", a term mentioned in Chinese Premier Li Peng's
government work report to the First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
To ensure stable supplies of grain, the central government
requires that the government heads of provinces, autonomous
regions and centrally-administered municipalities assume the
responsibility of maintaining grain supplies for their respective
areas.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, a governor must see to it that his or her
province:
</P>
<P>
-- Keeps a stable area of grain fields and a grain reserve
level meeting demand, and increases grain yield;
</P>
<P>
-- Fulfills a grain purchase target and a grain and cook oil
reserve plan set by the central government, and local grain
purchase plans;
</P>
<P>
-- Establishes a local risk fund for grain reserve;
</P>
<P>
-- Meets the target for inter-province grain flow target set by
the central government if the province is a major grain producer,
or fulfills the target of importing grain or buying grain from
other provinces if the province is not self-sufficient in grain
supply.

To ease strains on the supply of vegetables and foodstuffs,
China's Ministry of Agriculture initiated the so-called "vegetable
basket project" in 1988, which aims to: improve production and
marketing of vegetables and foodstuffs, develop and utilize land
resources rationally, adjust the structure of supply and demand of
such products, popularize production techniques, and improve basic
facilities, all for the purpose of increasing the supplies of
vegetables and foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The central government requires that mayors shoulder the
responsibility of properly filling residents' baskets with
vegetables and foodstuffs, to make a success of the project.
</P>
<P>
From 1988 to 1996, the output of meat, dairy products, eggs,
aquatic products, fruits and vegetables increased remarkably,
helping to improve the standard of living of urban people.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the average amount of meat, aquatic products,
vegetables and the average number of eggs available for each

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Environment Better Than Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The quality of environment in the
Chinese capital keeps improving, not deteriorating, said a Chinese
environmental scientist here today.
</P>
<P>
"What overseas media has reported on Beijing's deteriorating
environment are exaggeration," said Jiang Xiaoke, chairperson of
Beijing Environmental Science Society.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is a female deputy to the First Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), said chimneys were seen emitting
black smoke anywhere in Beijing but such scenes are rare today.
</P>
<P>
Seniorer residents remember very well that they had to wear
gauze masks and scarves to cover up their faces whenever they went
outside, but there is no such a need now, said Jiang, who is also
president of Beijing Environmental Protection Foundation.
</P>
<P>
She quoted the monitoring results as saying that dust pollution
has kept reducing year by year. The discharge of sulphur dioxide
remained the same level as before. She acknowledged that exhaust
discharge by motor vehicles poses a new hazard.
</P>
<P>
The expert said air pollution in Beijing has been mainly
produced by coal burning, which produced a lot of sulphur dioxide
and dust. Some 27 million tons of coal is burnt annually in
Beijing. But the supply of the piped natural gas from northwest
China will help cope with this problem, she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang said, pollution control in the capital's large
enterprises has paid off. the Capital Steel Complex (or Shougang
Company Group), 30 km west of Beijing, injected 100 million yuan
of funding for pollution control last year, and the Beijing
Chemical Industry Group, another major polluter in Beijing, has
resorted to the use of loans from the World Bank in pollution
control, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another major measure is to introduce lead-free oil as fuel
construct a number of sewage disposal and garbage burying plants,
she said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Beijing plans to increase 520 ha of green land in
urban areas and add 28,000 ha of woods on its outskirts, she said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Beijing remains to be one of the world's most
polluted cities, which is attributed to its natural conditions as
well as an issue left over by history, Jiang said. And more time
is need to bring the city's pollution under complete control.

<HEADLINE> Toshiba Disqualified from Whitbread 5th leg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The yacht Toshiba has been
disqualified from the fifth leg of the Whitbread Round the World
Race after the engine was used to clear weed from the keel and
rudder, according to reports from Sao Sebastiao, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
A five-man international jury heard a protest by the race
committee, and found that the crew of Toshiba had started their
engine, breaking the seals on the propeller shaft, and failed to
report their actions to the race organisers at the right time.
</P>
<P>
The boat had finished the leg in sixth place, and was lying
fifth overall in the race, but this disqualification drops Toshiba
to sixth place overall in the race.
</P>
<P>
Benefiting from Toshiba's misfortune is the Norwegian entry
Innovation Kvaerner, skippered by Knut Frostad, which moved up to
sixth place for the leg, and fifth place overall.
</P>
<P>
The fifth leg of the Whitbread Round the World Race was a 6,670
mile trip from Auckland to Sao Sebastiao in Brazil, via the
Southern Ocean and Cape Horn.

<HEADLINE> Diplomacy Seen as Possible way to Solve Kosovo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Italy still see
diplomacy as the possible means to solve the crisis in the
province where violent conflict between ethnic Albanians and
Serbian police erupted on March 1, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the remarks during a joint press conference with
her Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini after she wound up a two-day
visit Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will attend a conference convened by the
Contact Group for ex-Yugoslavia in London on Monday to put
together a diplomatic strategy.
</P>
<P>
Describing the situation in the region as "very worrying," Dini
said Kosovo should be given back its autonomy, which it had
enjoyed until 1989.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the population of
Kosovo, have been seeking independence since early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Dini also discussed Iran's new moderate positions.
</P>
<P>
Dini, who was in Tehran last weekend, said it is time for the
U.S. and other Western countries to "restore relations" with the
country.
</P>
<P>
As the first senior Western leader to visit the country since
President Mohammad Khatami was elected, Dini noted that the new
Iranian government is different from its predecessors, and that
Western countries should grasp the opportunity to alter their
policies toward Iran.

<HEADLINE> Former SS Officers Receive Life Sentences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Italian military court of appeal
Saturday handed down life-sentences to two former SS officers in
connection with a Massacre in Rome during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
Erich Priebke and Karl Hass, both in their mid-80s, were
involved in the massacre known as the Ardeatine Caves atrocities
in 1944, in which 335 men and boys were rounded up and shot dead
on Rome's outskirts in reprisal for a partisan bomb that killed 33
German soldiers in the city.
</P>
<P>
The two defendants were not on hand for the reading of the
sentences, which was greeted by cheers and applause from the
audience.
</P>
<P>
The appeal hearing opened on January 27. In the original
trials, both men received more lenient sentences because of their
old age and poor heath. With time already spent in detention, they
ended up having only a few months left to serve in the previous
trial.

fauna present in the Costa Rican tropical forests.
</P>
<P>
He also signed an agreement on the disbursement of 500,000
dollars to the Costa Rican National Biodiversity Institute.
</P>
<P>
The half-million-dollar donation by Japan will assist the
programs of this country to plant 15 million trees every year in
7,000 hectares of natural forests, and to protect other 50,000
hectares of forests in natural regeneration.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said Costa Rica "has demonstrated that the
protection of the environment is not a luxury, but an activity of
life."
</P>
<P>
Approximately 25 percent of the Costa Rican territory have been
classified as national parks, natural forests, and other forms of
reserve since 1970.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, 40 percent of the Costa Rican territory is now
covered with trees.

<P>
BELGRADE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Serbian anti-terrorist police
units killed 40 "terrorists" and captured some weapons during
recent offensives against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, a
Serbian official said Saturday in Pristina, capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ljubinko Cvetich, spokesman for the Ministry of Interior, told
a news conference that among those killed was Adem Jassari, an
alleged separatist leader.
</P>
<P>
Cvetich also said that from 1991 to March 5, 1998, ethnic
Albanian separatists had launched 200 terrorist activities,
killing 9 policemen and 24 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism in Kosovo was on a rise in the two years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Serbian police this week attacked the alleged Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) bastions of Prekaz and Lausha in the mountains of
central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The KLA emerged as a military threat in response to growing
impatience with the lack of progress made by political leaders
demanding independence for Kosovo, where 90 percent of the 1.8
million population are ethnic Albanians.

<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China is considering loosening the
restrictions imposed on foreign banks wishing to deal in the local
currency, according to a senior central bank official.
</P>
<P>
"The bank is studying ways to give more channels to foreign
banks to raise renminbi funds," said Di Weiping, vice-president of
the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Di as saying that detailed

<P>
On the subject of recent financial crisis in Southeast Asia, Di

According to Di, nine foreign banks have been conducting local
currency business on a trial basis in Shanghai since early 1997,
and the central bank is considering giving approval for a second
group of foreign banks to conduct local currency business.
</P>
<P>
After nearly one year of experience, these banks are moving
forward in accepting renminbi deposits and issuing loans.

<HEADLINE> Russian Women Play Greater Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Women hold up half the sky. This is
true in Russia where women, which make up 53 percent of the
country's population, are playing a greater role in socio-economic
life, especially in state administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
Russian women are more educated than men. In colleges and
universities, 55 percent of the registered students are female
while in polytechnic schools, the rate is as high as 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
About half of the employed in Russia are women who maintain a
dominant presence in government departments dealing with health,
sports, social security, culture, education and arts.
</P>
<P>
Compared with its 11 percent presence in the State Duma (the
lower house of Russian parliament), women make up 56 percent of
Russia's public servants, including nine percent of government
officials.
</P>
<P>
However, more Russian women are jobless than men. Of the
unemployed women, 40 percent are below the age of 30 and 47
percent are well-educated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, every 100 Russian women give birth to only 123
children, which is much lower than the minimum of 215 children
needed to maintain the simple reproduction of the country's
population.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Officers on Army Building and Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some military deputies to the
First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) said
the Chinese army will hold high Deng Xiaoping Theory and safeguard
the authority of Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core in the new historical period.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou, Yu Yongbo, Wang Ke and Wang Ruilin, all members of
the Central Military Commission (CMC), said at the panel
discussion of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) delegation that
to comply with the command of the CPC Central Committee and the
CMC is the guarantee for scoring new victories of China's
socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
Under the new situation in the new period, the army will act as
a powerful guarantee for China's reform, opening-up and
modernization drive, Fu Quanyou said.
</P>
<P>
In army building, emphasis should be placed on training
qualified personnel, managing the army with strict rules,
developing high-tech weaponry and military equipment in an effort
to raise the fighting competence at the modern times, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yongbo said all officers and men should be distinctly aware
of the importance of serving the country's overall task and
supporting reform, and have adopted firm attitude in this regard.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of streamlining and readjusting the PLA,
disciplines must be emphasized so that individuals should be
submitted to organizations and local units are to the overall
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
In following the overall task of China's economic growth, Wang
Ke said, army building should be carried out with thrift.
Logistical departments of the army should enhance management and
reform so as to raise the efficiency of logistical supply, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In particular, leading officers and military departments, which
are vested with power financially, materially and in management of
related affairs should play an exemplary role in army building
through thrift, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Wang Ruilin said, in streamlining the army and taking
the path of fewer but better troops, leading officers should be
models in carrying on the army's fine traditions of hard work,
opposing extravagance and guarding against and preventing any
corrosion of corruption and degeneration.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Still Prefer Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines still managed to
pull in a bigger chunk of foreign capital compared with other
Asian economies last year, an indication of greater investor
confidence in the country's economic climate, the Philippine Star
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Citing central bank figures, the paper said that net private
capital flows into the Philippines last year accounted for 6.3
percent of gross domestic product (GDP), comparatively higher than
Malaysia's 4.7 percent, Indonesia's 1.6 percent and South Korea's
2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, there was a net outflow of capital last year,
nearly 11 percent of its GDP, a marked turnaround from a net
inflow of 9.3 percent in 1996, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The net flow of private capital refers to the movement of
direct investments, portfolio investments and other investments
such as those in the short-term to long-term debt market.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that direct investment in the Philippines
reached 1.6 percent of GDP last year, the same level as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But portfolio investments in the Philippines dropped to a net
outflow of 5.2 percent of GDP last year, the highest in the
region, although no country experienced a net portfolio inflow
greater than 0.4 percent of GDP in 1997, it said.

<P>
Deputy Deng Jian, a prefecture commissioner from Sichuan,
another big agriculture province, said he is worried about China's
still weak agriculture foundation, emphasizing that the government
should always give the first priority to agriculture and rural
work.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Wang Yulin, director of Heilongjiang Land Reclamation
Bureau, said he supports the establishment of an agriculture and
rural affairs committee under the NPC Standing Committee, adding
the committee could play a great role in solving existing problems
in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, agriculture-related legislation will be
accelerated," he said. "This will allow key policy measures to be
written down in the form of laws and be implemented through law
enforcement and supervision."
</P>
<P>
Wang is confident that the committee will play an important
role in increasing agriculture input, sorting out the pricing
system for farm produce, and improving the grain sales structure.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Wang Weiyi, a professor from Nanjing Agriculture
University, expressed the hope that the newly established
committee will help better implement the farmland contracting
policy, ease farmers' financial burdens, promote the use of
agriculture-related science and technology and protect
eco-environment in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The move, he said, will boost farmers' enthusiasm in farm
production while protecting their intermediate interests. "It will
benefit the long-term development of rural areas," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture has been a hot topic
among deputies to China's top legislature, the National People's
Congress, in session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is despite the fact the country has had good harvests for
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Deputies expressed appreciation for a decision made by the NPC
to establish a committee on agriculture and rural affairs to step
up agriculture-related legislation and supervision.
</P>
<P>
"For China's agricultural sector, concerns should not be
limited to how to maintain a steady increase in grain production,"
said Lu Xueyi, a deputy from the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences. "They also cover how to bring about progress in backward
farming practices, income increases for the 800 million rural
residents and improvement in their living standard."
</P>
<P>
These have a bearing on the stability and development of rural
China and even those of the entire nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
China started its economic reform program by adopting a
household-based farming system in rural areas. The move has led to
impressive growth in agricultural production and farmers' incomes.
In his government work report, Premier Li Peng announced that the
government allows and encourages farmers to renew their land
contracts for a term of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Wang Maolin, secretary of the Provincial Committee of
the Communist Party of China in Hunan, a major grain producer,
said China is weak in agriculture infrastructure and has an
irrational agricultural structure and a backward farm produce
processing industry. "These problems must be addressed," Wang
said.

BUENOS AIRES, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos

country, in which he highlights the efforts made by the feminine
sector in its perennial struggle against social inequalities.

The Argentine president paid homage to the 129 women who died
March 8, 1908, in the defense of their rights of equality, and to
all those who struggled for reaching that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The president underscored the life of Eva Peron, former
president Juan Domingo Peron wife, considering her "the great
architect of the daily life of women in the last 50 years."
</P>
<P>
Menem said that thanks to Eva Peron, Argentine women voted for
the first time in the political life of Argentina," since at that
time only men had the right to vote.

He said the efforts of his government to preserve women's
rights in the economic and political fields, emphasizing "the law
of feminine presence," approved during his mandate.
</P>
<P>

women, "for their everyday work, for their continuous struggle
against inequalities and exclusions, and for the courage they
cover themselves with."
</P>
<P>
Finally, Menem expressed his recognition to all the women for
"all the effort and dedication they apply every day in their
labor, in the building of their families," and "in making of
Argentina a country where to live is dignifying."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese Party official Hu
Jintao today urged officials and people in the less-developed
central and western regions to improve their understanding of
economic regularities and seek a rapid and sound development.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China's Central Committee, made these
remarks during a panel discussion with the delegation to the
ongoing session of the Ninth National People's Congress from
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
"The current situation provides very good opportunities for the
reform, opening-up and growth of the central and western regions.
As long as we give full play to the local advantages and work hard
with confidence, the central and western regions are full of
hopes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged people in Guizhou to increase their awareness of the
regularities in local economic growth and focus on solving major
problems that hinder the province's development.
</P>
<P>
He put forth suggestions for Guizhou on agricultural growth,
poverty alleviation, infrastructure construction and adjustment of
the ownership structure.
</P>
<P>
"We must go in for the reform of large and medium-sized
state-owned enterprises on one hand, and further ease controls on
small state enterprises to increase their vitality on the other
hand," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, it is also essential to encourage and
support the growth of non-public economy if Guizhou wants to
attain its goal of development and solve the problem of
re-employment of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
He also underlined the importance of training a contingent of
highly-competent leading officials, especially Party and
government leaders at the county (city) level, for the development
of the central and western regions.

MOSCOW, March 7 (Xinhua) -- In a major step to streamline its
armed forces, Russia plans to reduce 300,000 military officers
this year, Interfax news agency has reported.

<HEADLINE> China Acts to Combat Acid Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- China has declared war on acid
rain by establishing two special control zones and enforcing
charges on enterprises that discharge sulphur dioxide, the main
pollutant responsible.
</P>
<P>
The control zones, located in southern and central parts f the
country, cover 11.4 percent of the national territory, but they
discharge 60 percent of the sulphur dioxide in China, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the establishment of the two zones is in
line with the special requirements of the revised Law on Air
Pollution Prevention and Control passed August 1995.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to curb the deteriorating trend of acid rain and
sulphur dioxide pollution in these areas by 2000. Industrial
pollution sources located there are to achieve state standards in
treating sulphur dioxide before discharge by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
The Paper quoted Xie Zhenhua, director of the National
Environmental Protection Agency, as saying that no new mines for
high-sulphur coal -- whose sulphur content exceeds 3 percent --
will be dug in these two zones.
</P>
<P>
In another move, China is likely to subject more areas to
charges for sulphur dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
The practice has been applied experimentally since 1992 in
Guangdong and Guizhou provinces and the cities of Liuzhou,
Nanning, Guilin, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Chongqing, Changsha, Yihang
and Yibin.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Today is Macao Tomorrow: Macao NPC Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's smooth return on July
1 last year and its steady growth in the subsequent eight months
have greatly increased Macao people's confidence in the good
prospects for Macao after its own return to the motherland in
1999.
</P>
<P>
These consensus was reached here today by deputies from Macao
to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the country's top
legislature which is now in its first annual session.
</P>
<P>
The deputies agreed that the smooth return of Hong Kong and
Macao, which signifies a great success for the "one country, two
systems" concept initiated by the late leader Deng Xiaoping, would
add impetus to the ultimate accomplishment of the great cause of
China's peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has returned, and Macao will soon come back too. I
have been staying in the two places for more than 70 years, and I
was in a most happy mood in the past several years," said O
Ching-ping, who is approaching 90 and has been elected to the NPC
for the sixth time.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Hau Wah Ho, vice-chairman of the Macao Chinese General
Chamber of Commerce, said that the smooth return of Hong Kong can
serve as a vivid example for Macao.
</P>
<P>
"It has become a common understanding among the Macao people
that Hong Kong today is Macao tomorrow. With the powerful backing
of the motherland, Macao will have brighter prospects in the next
century," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The most crucial and urgent work at present is to set up the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR), he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Tong Seng Chiu, president of the Federation of Trade
Unions of Macao, said the masses of workers in Macao love the
country and their home, and have shown great concerns about the
return in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We all hope that the SAR Preparatory Committee will be founded
at an early date, to lay a solid foundation for various work in
the transitional period and the operation of the future SAR
government," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Macao has five Ninth NPC deputies, who have joined in the
Guangdong delegation to the current session.

<HEADLINE> Operation Allows Man With Three Tongues To Speak Normally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer who was born
with three tongues, can now eat and speak normally after having
received an operation at a military hospital in Chongqing recently.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old farmer, Xiang Shihua, from Sichuan province in
southwest China, was born with one tongue, but a second smaller
one appeared when he was five, followed by a third.
</P>
<P>
His largest tongue was 35.5 cm long, 15 cm wide, and 11 cm
thick, while the other two were 9 cm long and of varying widths
and thicknesses.
</P>
<P>
For the past 20 years, Xiang could not speak to others normally
and had to subsist on a liquid diet.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Chongqing's Southwest Military Hospital said that
Xiang's disease was a kind of fibroma, or benign tumor, and
performed an operation to remove the two extra tongues for him
last month. Medical authorities say they've found no record of a
similar case, and that Xiang's family had no history of related
diseases.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Response Positively to Institutional Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's leading
advisory body said it is imperative to press on with the
government structural reform so as to establish an efficient,
coordinated and standardized administrative system.
</P>
<P>
Over the past days, members of the Ninth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
have discussed the Plan Concerning Institutional Restructuring of
the State Council delivered by State Councillor Luo Gan Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The overstaffing of governmental institutions will surely
result in low efficiency, whereas institutional restructuring can
reduce the size of staff and raise efficiency," said Li Hanqiu, a
CPPCC Ninth National Committee member with the China Peasants and
Workers Democratic Party (CPWDP) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The change of government functions is the major target of
institutional restructuring this time. Many specialists with the
CPPCC said that the restructuring should readjust four types of
relations: namely those between government and market, government
and enterprises, government and society, and central government
and local government.
</P>
<P>
Dong Fureng, a noted economist, said that in the past planned
economy, the government took charge of the allocation of resources
and had to handly all things, big or small. Therefore, the
government is huge and unwiedly with a concentration of power.
</P>
<P>
"In the shift from the planned economy to market economy, it is
easy to trade much government power for money," the economist
said. "To eradicate corruption in the government, institutional
restructuring can be taken as a fundamental way out."
</P>
<P>
In today's market economy, the government should play the role
of stabilizing the market, safeguarding market rules and ensuring
justice in the market, instead of making decisions for the market,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Many CPPCC members held that there will surely be difficulties
in downsizing government the institutions and cutting staff. But as long
as there is a will, there will be a way and the prospect is bright.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xiongjian, who works with the China Institute of
Telecommunications, noted that in the process of institutional
restructuring, the state-owned assets of the existing ministries
and commissions must be supersized and managed well.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Improves Social Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province, has improved its social security
system based on old-age pension and unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
The past 12 years of reform has witnessed the evolution of
Guangzhou's social security system from simply enterprise
insurance to actual social insurance. Proposed regulations on
worker's medical compensation insurance will be issued by the end
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 710,000 workers were covered by
old-age pension insurance by the end of last year, including some
400,000 retirees.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou established its social security bureau in 1996 as
part of an effort to strengthen the unified management of social
security.
</P>
<P>
However, a city official noted that the existing social
security system mostly covers people with ties to state-owned
enterprises. Most employees from foreign-funded and private
enterprises are not as yet covered by the city's social security
system.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou government has set a 1998 goal of expanding
coverage of the social security system, and will place special
emphasis on issuing detailed regulations governing employees from
private and rural enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Spark Program Benefits Sichuan Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 55,000 farmers in southwest
China's Sichuan Province escaped poverty during 1997 and this can
be attributed to the implementation of the Spark Program.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, a traditionally agricultural province, invested over
two billion yuan in 645 Spark Program projects during 1997, with
said projects yielding a total output value of 4.22 billion yuan
and pretax profits of 700 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government introduced the Spark Program in the
1980s as part of an effort to introduce farmers to advanced
technology needed to promote the rural economy.
</P>
<P>
The province focused efforts on profit-making agricultural
operations, including the production of vegetables, fruits,
traditional Chinese herbs, livestock and aquatics. The extensive
effort yielded a total output value of 900 million yuan and pretax
profits of 70 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has also attempted to train farmers by sponsoring
diverse training classes which encourage the full use of science
and technology.

<HEADLINE> German Greens Party Sticks to Demand to Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's opposition Greens party
today decided to hold on to its controversial demand for a radical
increase in the country's gasoline price despite warnings that it
would undermine the party's bid to come to power in Bonn after the
September general elections.
</P>
<P>
After a heated debate at a party congress in the eastern German
city of Magdeburg, the ecologically-minded Greens voted to
campaign for a ten-year gradual increase of the gasoline price to
about five marks (2.7 U.S. dollars) per liter from the current
level of about 1.65 marks (0.90 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fund raised would be used to finance big cuts in the
country's huge labour costs, the party said.
</P>
<P>
The Greens is seeking to form a coalition with the largest
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) to replace Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's center-right ruling coalition at the general
elections on September 27 this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts, however, say that the two parties still have much to
do to reconcile their policies in order to form a viable alliance.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the SPD today did not hesitate to distance itself from
the Greens demand for the gasoline price hike.
</P>
<P>
"It is nonsense and we will not do that," SPD chancellor
candidate Gerhard Schroeder was quoted by the German press as
saying.
</P>
<P>
SPD party chairman Oskar Lafontaine also indicated that his
party would pursue a more realistic eco-policy.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Schroeder today also set a goal for the SPD to win
40 percent of the vote at the general elections in order to become
the largest single party in the federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
At Germany's 1994 general elections, the SPD came in at 36.4
percent and the Greens 7.3 percent, compared with 48.4 percent won
by Kohl's ruling coalition consisting of Christian Democratic
Union (CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU) and the junior partner
Free Democratic Party (FDP).

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King in Measured Tone Over Iraq-US Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan has
appeared low-key in talking his proposal to hold direct dialog
between the United States and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his return from a Gulf trip
Saturday, Hussein said that he was not entrusted by any party to
make such a proposal to Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I just said what I believe is right and what might sometimes
come, of course, after strict and full implementation of the
existing agreements to remove completely the Iraqi people's
suffering," the king said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman
shared the stand with Jordan on regional issues, including the
opening of direct dialogs between Iraq and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Hussein began his five-day visit to the UAE and Oman last
Tuesday to sell the idea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., however, said on Wednesday that it had "no plans and
no interest" in opening a direct dialog with the Iraqi leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali, who
accompanied Hussein in his Gulf trip and returned here, said the
king has not officially presented the idea to the U.S.
Administration.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Hussein would make such a proposal to U.S.
President Bill Clinton during their meeting in Washington
scheduled for next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"When he meets President Clinton and puts forward such ideas,
we will see whether there will be an American response or not,"
said Majali.
</P>
<P>
Referring to how Arab nations have responded to the proposal,
Majali said that "everyone is with this dialog."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been accusing Iraq of not complying with the
United Nations resolutions and hiding weapons of mass destruction,
and Iraq denounces U.S. manipulation of arms inspections in an
attempt to prolong international sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's refusal to grant free access to the U.N. Special
Commission charged with eliminating its banned weapons brought the
country to the brink of a military attack by the U.S. last month,
which was averted by U.N. chief Kofi Annan's success in mediating
a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. commission must certify that Iraq has destroyed all
its weapons of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council
lifts the crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait.
