<HEADLINE> Indian Society Proposes Ban on Crackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Amid reports of deaths and
injures by crackers on the eve of an Indian major festival, a
Delhi-based society has proposed ban on crackers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi Ophthalmology Society (DOS) said Thursday that it was
time to bring an effective legislation banning dangerous crackers
and to ensure these crackers do not fall into the hands of
children.
</P>
<P>
With Diwali, the festival of lights, approaching next Monday,
the number of patients queuing up at the hospital emergency
centers has increased in New Delhi and others parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that four children were burnt alive and six others
received serious burn injuries when a crackers shop caught fire in
a village in the north Uttar Pradesh Thursday.
</P>
<P>
DOS secretary Lalit Verma said that the 24-hour trauma center
at the All India Institute of Medical Science and other major
hospitals as well as private clinics were each receiving at least
seven to eight cases of children who had their eyes injured while
playing with bow and arrow and "missile" crackers.
</P>
<P>
There must be quality control for crackers which result in
burns and severe injuries to eyes during Divali every year, said
G. Mukherjee, president of the society.
</P>
<P>
The organization has issued a list of major do's and don'ts
asking people to burst crackers in open space only and wear cotton
clothes while doing so.

<HEADLINE> China Should Strive to Further Improve Export Structure: Vice-Trade Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China wants to accelerate
improvements in the structure of its exports in a bid to increase
its competitive ability in international markets, according to Sun
Zhenyu, vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
today.
</P>
<P>
Sun told a seminar on international market strategies here that
China has adopted some policies over recent years to support and
encourage high and new technologies.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, China's technical exports with high added
value merely accounted for 5.3 percent of the total exports in
1997 and the country's traditional textiles and hardware could
hardly cope with the world market demand.
</P>
<P>
China should try hard to increase the scale of highly technical
products, improve the quality of traditional export goods, and
develop more brand-name products, Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Stresses Women's Role in Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday urged the international community to recognize
women's contribution to food security and adopt new approaches
enabling them to play their part.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of poverty, natural disasters and war, it is the
resilience and ingenuity of women that enables families and
communities to survive," said Annan is his message on the World
Food Day which falls on October 16.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Food Day is dedicated to "the women who feed
the world."
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to do justice to the daily struggle of rural women
and the multitude of obstacles and discriminatory practices they
face in accomplishing their daily workload," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the opportunities are being lost for growth
and development for many women and agricultural development
policies still do not reflect the needs of women adequately.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said the right to food is "the most fundamental
of human rights," yet there are still 800 million people suffering
from chronic hunger or malnutrition with 200 million of them being
children.
</P>
<P>
He urged the international community to adopt innovative
approaches to development and agricultural development to take
women's contribution fully into account.

<HEADLINE> Huge Iceberg Breaks Away From Antarctica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- An iceberg, one and a half
times the size of Delaware and called A-38, snapped off
Antarctica's Ronne Ice Shelf this week and is floating free in the
sea, The Washington Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A-38, which is 92 miles long and 30 miles wide, has now moved a
couple of miles away from the parent ice mass since it cracked off
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Ice Center said the last huge iceberg called
B-9 broke off Antarctica in October 1987, and it was 96 miles
long.
</P>
<P>
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which
operates the NIC jointly with the Navy and Coast Guard, regards
the calving of icebergs as "a possible indicator of global
warming."
</P>
<P>
The Antarctic glaciers and ice sheets are the subject of
intensive on-side study by scientists from the United States and
other nations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Remain Unchanged in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer prices
index (CPI) remained unchanged in September thanks to falling
prices for gasoline, clothing and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted CPI stayed where it was after five
small increases from April through August, said the U.S. Labor
Department in a report released Friday.
</P>
<P>
This helped lower the inflation to merely 1.4 percent in the
first nine months of the year, better than the 11-year low of 1.7
percent for all of 1997, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The latest price report shows that inflation remains
substantial in some areas where the elderly incur disproportionate
expenses.
</P>
<P>
The cost of medical care jumped 0.3 percent in September and
was up at a 3.7 percent rate so far this year. But their benefits
from the social security will increase just 1.3 percent next year,
the smallest raise since 1987.
</P>
<P>
Prescription drug costs shot up 0.7 percent last month and have
risen at a 5.4 percent rate from January through September.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices in September fell 1.3 percent, pulled down by a 2
percent drop for gasoline and smaller declines for fuel oil,
electricity and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices have fallen at an 18.8 percent annual rate this
year. Though analysts do not expect a big increase any time soon
because of falling world demand for energy, they do not expect
prices to fall much more either.
</P>
<P>
Food prices were unchanged last month, but are up at a 2.1
percent rate year-to-date. In September, pork costs fell 1.4
percent, the largest drop in nine years. Fruit, vegetable and
coffee prices also fell.
</P>
<P>
In September, tobacco prices jumped 3.3 percent. They're up at
a 16.8 percent annual rate as tobacco companies seek to recoup the
cost of multimillion-dollar liability lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
Clothing costs, heavily influenced by the increasing
availability of inexpensive imports from Asia, fell 0.7 percent,
the largest decline in 19 months.
</P>
<P>
Computer prices in September fell 3.7 percent. Airline fares
slipped 0.9 percent, but are still 4 percent higher than a year
ago.

<HEADLINE> Kohl to be Awarded America's Highest Civilian Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday he is to award outgoing German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
a Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor.
</P>
<P>
"It is a fitting tribute to the extraordinary accomplishments
of Chancellor Kohl," Clinton said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
He said Kohl will "rank among those who changed the course of
history" for his leadership in reunifying Germany after the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In Germany's September elections, Kohl's Christian Democrats
posted their worst showing in 50 years, and the Social Democrats'
leader Gerhard Schroeder won the chancellorship and is to assume
the office at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"Helmut Kohl has been a lifelong friend of the United States
and has personally committed himself to the enduring partnership
of our two countries," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of all Americans, it is my profound pleasure to
honor him with this symbol of our nation's high esteem and deep
appreciation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Conclude First Day of Talks  By Yang Shilong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani and Indian Foreign
Secretaries concluded their first day of talks with a rather
optimistic note here on Friday and the two sides agreed to "review
existing confidence building measures in order to enhance their
efficacy."
</P>
<P>
"They explored a full range of peace and security issues
including Confidence Building Measures and identified areas of
convergence," Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman Tariq Altaf told
reporters at a briefing at the end of the first session.
</P>
<P>
The talks covering issues of peace and security were held in a
"frank and cordial" manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the two foreign secretaries "agreed to
review existing confidence building measures in order to enhance
their efficacy" and they also explored ways and means to continue
discussion.
</P>
<P>
"The discussion will continue at the technical expert level on
Saturday," he said, adding a joint statement would be issued at
the end of talks on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We should not be expected to produce results after every
session," Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad said as he
emerged from the opening session of the talks with his Indian
counterpart K. Ragunath.
</P>
<P>
"We can come up with something categorical at the end of the
talks on Sunday," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Foreign Secretary did not make any comment except
that "I endorse the remarks of my (Pakistani) counterpart."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, before entering into the talks, Shamshad expressed
optimism about the dialogue process but said "no quick-fix"
solutions should be expected as it is the initiation of the
process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, he said, are dealing with "very complex issues
and one has to be patient and no quick fix solutions" should be
expected from a few hours meeting.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary reiterated that the new challenges for
both Islamabad and New Delhi are to avoid an arms race in nuclear
and ballistic fields.

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges NATO to Drop Decision on Force Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia Friday urged NATO to drop
its "erroneous and regrettable" decision on military action
against Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Chizhov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's Europe
III Department, said that if NATO does not abolish its decision in
favor of military action, it may complicate the formation of a
mission of observers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's part in the monitoring operation may only be
discussed after NATO has canceled its decision on military
intervention," the Interfax news agency quoted Chizhov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"From the very beginning Russia has categorically opposed using
force to settle the Kosovo problem," Chizhov said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the NATO Council announced its political consent to
the use of force against Belgrade with a 96-hour delay of military
actions.
</P>
<P>
The ultimatum expires on Saturday, October 17.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on Moscow's position if NATO troops
are sent to Kosovo to protect OSCE civil observers in the area, he
said, "There has been and there will be no talk about deploying
any foreign troops on the territory of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Russia will be part of the leadership of the OSCE mission and
will fund a portion of its budget, Chizhov said.
</P>
<P>
"It makes more sense to pay for peace than for war," he added.

</P>
<P>

said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the economic and social welfare of the peoples
of Pakistan and India was a matter of prime concern and urgent
priority.
</P>

a nuclear and conventional stabilization regime which would

secretary level talks was mandated to discuss issue of peace and

<HEADLINE> UK to Urge Kosovo Albanians to Support New Kosovo Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook is to urge ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to back a new agreement
designed to end the current Kosovo crisis, according to British
government sources.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Kosovo Albanians have so far refused to support the
Kosovo agreement reached between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Yuogoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, insisting on total
independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A British government official told reporters Friday that the
new Kosovo deal "is a good and promising agreement and the key now
is to make it work. The agreement needs the support of the Kosovo
Albanians and that's what we expect of them."
</P>
<P>
Cook is expected to hold informal talks next with a Kosovo
Albanian delegation led by Fehmi Agani, the Kosovars' chief peace
negotiator during a visit to Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the meeting is one where we agree to take forwards the
Holbrooke agreement and not one where we argue about
independence," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The official also made it clear that the Kosovo Liberation Army
should not try to take advantage of the deal by moving into areas
vacated by security forces.
</P>
<P>
Cook is also due to visit Bulgaria and Romania next week to
assure them of Britain's continued political support and to
encourage them to press ahead with reforms which would increase
their chances of joining the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Hold Military Exercises Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus announced Friday that
the armed forces will hold the annual exercises code-named
"Nikiforos '98" next week in conjunction with the war games
code-named "Toxotis" conducted by the Greek Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
National Guard General Command officer Panayiotis Tatsiopoulos
told a press conference that the six-day joint exercises will take
place according to a joint defense pact between Cyprus and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact signed in 1993, Greece will provide military
assistance to Cyprus in case the Mediterranean island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Tatsiopoulos said the exercises and a search and rescue
operation off the western coast are aimed at assessing the
competence of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Advanced T80 and BMB3 tanks and parachutists will take part in
the maneuvers joined by the Greek naval and air forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The major part of the exercises will take place in the
southeastern district of Larnaca with the use of live ammunition,
the officer said, adding that Greek warplanes may land at the
"Andreas Papandreou" air base near the southwestern town of Paphos.
</P>
<P>
Last year, after participation of Greek naval and air forces in
an identical annual exercise in Cyprus, Turkey sent military
aircraft and warships to the Turkish Cypriot-controlled northern
part of the island for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus to protect
the Turkish Cypriots, who declared unilaterally in 1983 a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by
Ankara.

from China's guard Li Xiaoyong and passed it to Dantley, who
tossed the shot just before the buzzer some 12 meters (35 feet)
away and it bounced on the rim a several times before sliding
aside.
</P>
<P>
Dantley and former NBA scores title winner Alex English each

<HEADLINE> Lewis Poised To Sign For Unification Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain's WBC heavyweight
champion Lennox Lewis is ready to put pen to paper for his
multi-million heavyweight unification fight against Evander
Holyfield on February 27 or March 6.
</P>
<P>
Lennox's promoter Panos Eliades said, "Now Holyfield's signed,
there's no problem with Lennox signing, which will probably be
done on Monday. I've spoken to Holyfield's lawyer Jim Thomas and
everything looks good."
</P>
<P>
Lennox is waiting to see if the television deal, which is
being negotiated by American promoter Don King, is completed with
cable network Home Box Office.
</P>
<P>
A TV hitch has still to be ironed out -- not over Lewis v
Holyfield itself but on Holyfield's future fights if he beats
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
HBO wants to sign up the WBA and IBF champion Holyfield if he
becomes the undisputed champion, as do their pay-per-view rivals
Showtime.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects Syria's Offer for Wide-range Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Friday rejected an
offer from Syria for wide-range talks with Turkey, saying what
concerns Ankara now is only the issue of Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment Turkey wants to see whether Syria has put an
end to her support to terrorism," a written statement issued by
the Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Syria said that it was waiting for Turkey's reply for
the reconvention of the Syrian-Turkish joint committee, a
mechanism set up in 1992 to solve a wide range of issues between
the two countries, including the dispute of sharing water
resources from the Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
"The only issue on Turkey's agenda is support given to the
Kurdish rebels," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of backing Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), but Damascus has denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said that
Turkey would take decisive measures if Syria continues supporting
the PKK which has been fighting for autonomy in southeast Turkey
since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Greece Opposes Release of EU Funds to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece Friday expressed its
opposition to the release of European Union (EU) funds to
neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that European Foreign Affairs
Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek was considering releasing EU funds
to Turkey through some different channel, Greek government
spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that any attempt to release EU
funds to Turkey by a different path would be "legally groundless
and politically unorthodox."
</P>
<P>
He warned that apart from the veto exercised by Greece on the
release of EU funds allocated to Turkey under the 4th financial
protocol, Greece could also have recourse to the European court.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits, the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Athens has insisted that it will not lift its veto on the
release of EU funds to the neighboring country unless Ankara
improves it human rights record and relations with Greece.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday "warmly congratulates" the co-winners of the
1998 Nobel Peace Prize, John Hume and David Trimble, saying the
award "is a tribute to their personal courage and leadership and
their contribution to putting Northern Ireland onto the path of
peace."
</P>
<P>
The remarks were contained in the U.N. chief's statement issued
through his spokesman's office here. Annan, in the statement,
praised the two winners' efforts to facilitate the signing of the
landmark Northern Ireland Peace Agreement last April.
</P>
<P>
Annan wishes the co-recipients of the 1998 award every success
as they continue to work for peace in Northern Island, the
statement said, adding that he hopes that the award will also
encourage those who may still have reservations about the peace
agreement which the two winners have worked so hard to achieve to
now lend their unremitting support to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Annan paid a one-day visit Friday to Washington, where he is
scheduled to address the Empower America Fall Conference and the
World Press Freedom Committee. He will return to New York late
Friday, the U.N. spokesman, Hiro Ueki, said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Extends Air Strike Ultimatum Till Oct. 27 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- NATO extended Friday its
ultimatum for air strikes in Kosovo to October 27, a senior NATO
official said.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea told the press that the North
Atlantic Council, the decision-making body of the 16-nation
Western military alliance, Friday decided to maintain NATO's
readiness to launch air operations against Yugoslavia, including
the deployment of substantial air forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
But the council decided that the period before execution of air
strikes will be extended until October 27, or for 10 more days.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the council will monitor developments
in Kosovo closely.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, the North Atlantic Council urged
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to take urgent steps to
ensure that full compliance is achieved in this time period.
</P>
<P>
Shea said that the allies have found clear evidence that there
is still some distance from full compliance on the ground. Many
army and special units, that normally based outside Kosovo, are
still deployed in Kosovo, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The ultimatum was originally set for Saturday for full and
verifiable compliance by Belgrade with United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1199.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana went to
Belgrade to sign an air-borne surveillance agreement with
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Yugoslavia agreed to set up a liaison mechanism for
the implementation of the air surveillance that will use unarmed
NATO airplanes.
</P>
<P>
The agreement required Yugoslavia to shut off radars that would
otherwise illuminate or lock down surveillance planes.
</P>
<P>
NATO warned that Yugoslavia will have to bear "grave
consequences" should it choose to breach the agreement and use its
radars against surveillance planes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: United Actions Called for in Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Chen Cailin
</P>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- October 17 will mark the
International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, a day which was
set aside by the United Nations to galvanize support both at the
national and global levels for eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that significant gains have been achieved in
economic growth and living standards worldwide over the past
three decades. However, there are over 1.3 billion people around
the world, almost one-third of humanity, who still live under
extreme poverty with less one U.S. Dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
Despite a dramatic surge in global consumption, with real
expenditures doubling over the past 25 years, more than one
billion people can not still meet their most basic needs, a 1998
U.N. report said.
</P>
<P>
These people lack especially the access to the fundamentals of
a decent life, such as sufficient food, safe water, reliable
health care, adequate shelter, basic education and opportunities
to sustain livelihoods and to participate in decisions that
affect their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
Among the 4.4 billion people who live in developing countries,
almost three-fifths live in communities without basic sanitation
facilities; almost one-third are without safe drinking water; one
quarter lack adequate housing; one-fifth live beyond the reach of
modern health services; and one-fifth of the children are
undernourished, figures released by U.N. agencies said.
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of poverty. It is not only
the region with the highest incidence of poverty in the world,
with over 40 percent of its inhabitants living below the one
Dollar a day poverty line.
</P>
<P>
More and more countries are trying to develop anti-poverty
strategies. At the World Summit for Social Development in
Copenhagen, Denmark in March, 1995, Heads of State and senior
officials from over 180 countries acknowledged the worsening
problem of global poverty and pledged to take actions to combat
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The delegates to the summit agreed to develop national
anti-poverty strategies to eliminate the worst aspects of poverty
in their countries on a time bound basis. The U.N. system, on its
part, was mandated to assist the member countries towards the
realization of such a goal and thus the International Decade for
the Eradication of Poverty was established.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate poverty, it is firstly needed to stop and control
armed conflicts and civil strife in many developing countries
where almost 100 million people are caught in a cycle of civil
strife and hunger. Armed conflicts handicap especially the African
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
According to the report by U.N. chief Kofi Annan, on April 16,
this year, 14 of the 53 African countries were afflicted by armed
conflict in 1996, and over 30 wars have been occurred since 1970,
mostly within states.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, international community, especially the developed world,
has the responsibility to help the highly-indebted poor countries
to reduce their debt burden and increase development assistance
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in the report that Africa's debt burden remain
unsustainable, noting that Africa paid 33 billion Dollars in debt
repayment in 1997, eight billion dollars more than it paid in
1995.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that the international community has made
and is making efforts to help the poor to combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has repeated its calls for partnerships between
governments, the donor community, civil society, non-governmental
organizations, and the poor themselves in the fight for building
a world without poverty.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Urges Speedy Ratification of START II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Friday urged the State Duma, or lower house of parliament,
to ratify the START II arms reduction treaties as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting in St. Petersburg commemorating Alexander
Gorchakov, a Russian career diplomat in the 19th century, Ivanov
said a speedy ratification of the treaty corresponds with Russia's
national interests.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, it is also important that the United States ratify
all documents pertaining to the treaty," the Interfax quoted
Ivanov as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov's speech covered a wide range of topics on Russian
foreign policy, from Kosovo to arms reduction to cooperation among
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
"Russia's foreign policy today aims to resolve two tasks
simultaneously: to ensure the most favorable external conditions
for domestic reforms and to prevent Russia's positions in the
international arena from weakening," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
This may be achieved only by implementing an energetic,
multifaceted foreign policy like the one Russia is pursuing now,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Our strategic course is clear: to create a multifaceted and
democratic world and closely cooperate with other countries for
resolving world problems only by peaceful means," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, Ivanov said possible political and military
scenarios are being developed in the Balkans which may
predetermine further development of the international process.
</P>
<P>
"Resolution of Balkan problems and primarily the Kosovo issue
is one of the most complicated tasks for international and
European policy-makers."
</P>
<P>
"Russia is firmly and definitively insisting on a political
solution to the Kosovo problem," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The potential of constructive energetic diplomacy is far
greater than that of military force, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also called for comprehensive efforts to ensure the
nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means for
their delivery should be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"Russia, as a depository of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation
of Nuclear Weapons, is trying to make it universal," Ivanov said.
"We also support having all countries join the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty."
</P>
<P>
"Russia is ready to continue its resolute movement towards
further reduction of its nuclear arsenals and maintenance of
strategic stability at lower military levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
On European security and cooperation in the next century,
Ivanov said the new system should ensure the security of all
countries on the continent "without exception."
</P>
<P>
"This should be the underlying principle of the European
Security Charter that is being prepared by the OSCE (Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The new Europe cannot be based on any sort of NATO-centered
models," Ivanov stressed.

<HEADLINE> Palestine-Israel Summit Enters Second Day in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators Friday started a second day of tough talks in Wye
Mills, Maryland, aimed at breaking the 19-month impasse in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The delegations broke up into groups specializing in security,
economic issues, the Palestinian airport in Gaza and setting up of
a safe passage for Palestinians between Gaza and the West Bank,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to close a deal on Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank, coupled with Palestinian security measures to protect
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The central issue is a U.S. proposal for Israel to pull back
troops from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
specific Palestinian assurances to crack down on militants and
give cast-iron security commitments.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is overseeing
the talks, is expected to hold a three-way meeting later in the
day with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
"There is hard work ahead if we are to reach an agreement....
Our entire team (is) ready to do whatever we can. We are ready to
get to work," Clinton told the opening session.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met the two leaders at the White House before he
formally opened the summit in Wye River Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
In a Rose Garden statement following the White House meeting,
Clinton urged the two leaders to "break the logjam" in the peace
process. "Too much time has already been lost," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As in any difficult problem, neither side can expect to win
100 percent of every point," he said. "But concessions that seem
hard now will seem far less important in the light of an accord
that moves Israelis and Palestinians closer to lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
Thursday afternoon, Clinton had five meetings with Netanyahu
and Arafat, either separately or together, and committees worked
late into the evening, Palestinian spokesman Marwan Kanafani said.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders shared dinner before Clinton headed home to
Washington around midnight.

held on the bicentennial of Alexander Gorchakov, a famous Russian
career diplomat who was once Russia's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's voice was heeded," he said. "Such conflicts can be
resolved only in this way."
</P>
<P>
"The details of the monitoring mechanism for Kosovo will be
discussed soon by the OSCE (Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe) permanent council after the U.N. Security
Council approves an appropriate resolution and suggests that the
OSCE carry out the mission," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia would be "most active at all stages, from the
beginning until the mission -- as we hope -- ends successfully and
the problem worrying the entire international community is
removed.
</P>
<P>
"The Balkans are doomed to live together and the problems
existing there should not be fanned," Ivanov said.

<HEADLINE> Net Overseas Earnings for UK Soars To Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The financial services industry
earned a record 25.2 billion pounds (40.3 billion U.S. dollars)
from overseas work, loans and investment in 1997, according to new
figures out Friday.
</P>
<P>
Helped by last year's booming financial markets, the City's
contribution to the British economy has doubled in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
About 14 billion pounds (22.4 billion dollars) of 1997's total
is made up of fee income for services, such as stockbroking or
banking, and the remainder is income, such as dividends, coming
from investments made abroad.
</P>
<P>
The earnings figures were compiled by British Invisibles (BI),
the private organization that promotes the UK financial services
industry internationally.
</P>
<P>
BI said the net overseas earnings of banks located in the UK
were 7.75 billion pounds (12.4 billion dollars), with insurance
institutions pulling in 7.42 billion pounds (11.87 billion
dollars). Pension funds recorded foreign earnings of 2.13 billion
pounds (3.4 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figures underlines the City's position as the financial
capital of Europe and helps explain why London's economy is now
bigger than those of Denmark, Sweden and Austria.
</P>
<P>
The City, which is only one square mile, alone provides about
250,000 jobs. There are 550 foreign banks based in London, more
than any other city in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the average daily turnover of London's foreign
exchange market was 637 billion pounds (1,019.2 billion dollars),
more than New York and Tokyo combined.
</P>
<P>
Duncan Mackenzie, BI's director of economics, said, "The City's
depth of expertise has a vital role to play in a wide range of
challenges from handling transactions in the euro to meeting the
needs of clients in both emerging and advanced economies alike."

<HEADLINE> World Food Day Observed in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Agriculture said Friday that with the promulgation of the new
constitution in 1995, the country has unequivocally committed to
the equitable socio-economic development of women.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting observing this year's "World Food Day"
under the theme "women feed the world", Vice-Minister of
Agriculture Getachew Teklemedehen said the Ethiopian government
has established appropriate infrastructure and mainstreamed
gender in all development sectors.
</P>
<P>
Getachew noted that his ministry, in its effort to empower
female farmers, has taken initiatives to improve their
participation and benefit through policy support, training and
extension, agricultural research, advocacy and by undertaking
affirmative action to improve the number and positions of female
agricultural professionals at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Tadelech Michael, Minister in charge
of Women's affairs in Prime Minister's Office, said gender has
become a central issue for equality, development and peace since
the UN Declaration of the Decade for Women (1976-1985).
</P>
<P>
She said out of the total labor force devoted in the
agricultural sector more than 60 percent is female labor.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the people and government of Ethiopia, the
Director- General of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
Jacques Diouf said in many countries, particularly in the
developing countries and in agrarian societies, production of
staple food, cash crops and livestock relies heavily on women's
labor.
</P>
<P>
African Women dominate agricultural production in many
countries and account for 60-80 percent of the agricultural labor
force on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Day falls on October 16, 1998.

MOSCOW, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers from Russia
and Belarus vowed here Friday to join hands against the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and his Belarussian
counterpart, Alexander Chubakov, said after the admission of the
Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, "NATO borders come 750
kilometers closer to Russia and Belarus."
</P>
<P>
"The area of NATO-controlled interests has approached our

He disclosed that the two defense ministries had worked out
specific measures to resist the enlargement but refused to give

</P>
<P>
"The irreversible process of a peace settlement" has begun in
Yugoslavia, Sergeyev told reporters after a joint session of the

</P>
<P>
"We fully control the situation (in Kosovo), closely follow its
development, hope that it will be settled by peaceful means and
reason will prevail," Sergeyev said. "Russia has done quite a

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges More Efforts to Overcome Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) said Friday that poverty reduction
should be the focus of nations' whole development strategies.
</P>
<P>
In its report on Overcoming Human Poverty released Friday prior
to the International Day for the Poverty Eradication to be
observed on October 17, the UNDP said rich donor countries should
live up to their commitments to poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The report said around one third of people in developing
countries continue to live in "income poverty," earning less than
one U.S. dollar per day.
</P>
<P>
They also suffer "human poverty," lacking essential education,
health care and nutrition with about 30 percent of all children
under five malnourished and 38 percent of all adult women
illiterate.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 130 countries surveyed by the UNDP, only 38 have set
targets for the eradication of extreme poverty despite the fact
that 43 have national poverty plans in place and 35 more address
poverty explicitly within their national planning framework.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP called for the mobilization of additional resources to
support anti-poverty programs while pointing out that aid from
developed nations has shrunk to an all-time low of 0.22 percent of
their gross domestic product, from the U.N. target of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said poverty reduction should also become the focus of
gender policy, "especially since gender inequality is an important
contributing factor to impoverishment, and women are
over-represented among the poor and frequently suffer the most
severe forms of poverty."

<HEADLINE> Liberia Denies Deploying Troops at Border With S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian government has
denied an allegation by Sierra Leone that Liberia had deployed
5,000 armed men at its border to attack the country, the News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Thursday by the Liberian Foreign
Ministry, the government expressed disappointment over the
allegation, especially at the time when efforts are being made to
reawaken the spirit of cooperation under the Mano River Union, an
economic union between the two west African countries.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "the government of Liberia calls on
the U.N., ECOMOG (West African Peace-Keeping Force), the press
and other interested parties to send investigative teams to the
border to ascertain the truth of Khbbah's allegation."
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG said earlier on Thursday that fighters from Liberia
were helping rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone, adding that
"foreign fighters from Liberia" were assisting rebels of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The RUF, together with supporters of a junta which was
overthrown by ECOMOG from power in February, are blamed for a
terror campaign in southern part of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government has complained about the
presence of the Liberian troops both to the Economic Community of
the West African States and to the Organization of African Unity.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian financial
minister has said that his country suffered an unfavorable trade
with its neighbor Kenya in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
While Tanzania is currently selling goods worth between seven

<P>
For example, a minimum duty of 399 U.S. Dollars per ton has

industries, Yona said to a delegation of the Kenyan Association
of Manufacturers (KAM) in Dar es Salaam Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Warring Factions Call for Transitional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Three warring Burundi
factions Friday called for an immediate establishment of a
transitional government to end ethnic civil war in the
land-locked African country.
</P>
<P>
Presenting views at the on-going third round of Burundi peace
talks in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha, the warring parties
said that the establishment of transitional body would pave way
for free and fair general elections and restore peace in the
war-torn tiny central African republic, according to meeting
sources.
</P>
<P>
The talks are brokered by former Tanzanian President, Julius
Nyerere, who also chaired the previous two rounds in Arusha in
June and July respectively.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a transitional government to allow peace to
settle in Burundi," the meeting sources quoted former president
of Burundi, Jean Baptise Bagaza, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jean Minani, the president of pro-Hutu party Frodebu, also
supported the call at the talks for transitional organs alongside
with another rebel group, Palipehutu.
</P>
<P>
"We'll not overcome our problems if we don't have a government
which is reflective of different thoughts of people," Minani said
at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Council for Defense and Democracy (CNDD), the
largest rebel group in Burundi, suggested at the meeting that
about 10,000 Hutus imprisoned in the country should be set free
to allow the peace dialog to continue.
</P>
<P>
"The Hutus must be freed and given a fair treatment," said
Leon Ndarubagi, secretary of the rebel group fighting to topple
the government of President Pierre Buyoya who came to power in a
military coup in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The RPB party suggested for the establishment of a Burundi
tribunal which should try those who committed crimes of genocide,
similar to a court started by the United Nations for Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, a women group from Burundi, which has
asked to be included in the talks, made its presentation to end
the country's ethnic war which has since 1993 killed more than
150,000 people, mostly civilians, in a series of massacres and in
armed conflict between the Tutsi-dominated army and the Hutu
rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman for Nyerere, Brigadier-General
Hashim Mbita, the debate will continue on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Those who have so far spoken at the debate include Burundi's
National Assembly, Frolina, Inkinzo, PL, UPRONA, Palipehutu,
Frodebu, RPB, CNDD, Abassa and two former Burundi presidents --
Bagaza and Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Congratulates 1998 Nobel Peace Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund Executive Director Carol Bellamy Friday congratulated the
1998 Nobel Peace Prize winners, John Hume and David Trimble, for
their contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said in a statement, "Their perseverance diplomacy in
bringing two entrenched sides together after years of bitter
conflict is an example to all who presently seek solutions to
equally difficult conflicts throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
"It is important also to congratulate the Nobel Committee for
helping to focus world attention on the Colombia Children's
Movement for Peace, whose nomination was a recommendation of the
incredible potential of children as peace-makers in today's
world," the executive director said.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of the Children's Movement as a serious contender
among this year's Nobel nominees is a signal to all nations in
conflict," Bellamy said. "In many conflict situations where adults
have failed to make peace, it will take the growing involvement of
children and young people to turn the tide."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that Colombia's young peace-makers exemplify the
ideals of the Convention on the Rights of Child, the world's most
widely ratified human rights accord. "The convention stresses that
children should be brought up to affirm peace, dignity, tolerance,
freedom, equality and solidarity," Bellamy said. "The children of
Colombia, faced with intolerable violence, have done this in no
uncertain terms and achieved remarkable results."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Colombia has been closedly involved with the Colombia
Children's Movement since its inception. In October 1996, the
Children's Movement for Peace helped mobilize children living in
the most violent municipalities of Colombia to vote in a special
election -- known as the Children's Mandate for Peace and Rights.
</P>
<P>
The children were asked to choose which of their rights were
most important to themselves and to their communities.
</P>
<P>
At first, it was thought no more than 300,000 children would
vote, but the movement grew so quickly that more than 2.7 million
children aged 7 to 18 years old turned up at the polls, about a
third of the age-group population nationwide. The turn-out in many
of the most violent municipalities was higher than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The children voted overwhelmingly in favor of the right to
survive and the right to peace. "The result sent shock-waves
through the nation," the UNICEF statement said.
</P>
<P>
A year later, more than 10 million adult Colombians (compared
with just more than 4 million who had voted in the previous 1994
presidential elections) turned out at the polls to support a peace
referendum that included backing for the Children's Mandate,
condemned the atrocities of the war and pledged their personal
commitment to help make peace.
</P>
<P>
As a result, peace became the main issue on which the 1998
presidential elections were fought and became the priority of the
new administration of Andres Pastranan.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS virus can mutate
into different, drug-resistant strains in patient's semen and
blood, researchers from U.S. and Switzerland reported in the
latest issue of the AIDS journal.
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied 11 HIV-infected men in North Carolina
and Switzerland. Some of those who were treated prior to the study
had AIDS strains that had mutated and developed resistance to
antiviral drugs. Most of the volunteers with these resistant
viruses had different viral strains in their semen and blood.
</P>
<P>
They found that even the powerful AIDS drug protease inhibitors
did not penetrate the male genitals, or did so only with great
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
In one patient, they discovered, resistance to the drug AZT was
found in the sperm virus, and later in the blood virus.
</P>
<P>
Thus they concluded that the male genitals and the
bloodstream act as separate "compartments" that have to be dealt
with independently when giving AIDS drugs.

<HEADLINE> UN Urged to Strengthen Check on Private Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. investigator on
the use of mercenaries on Friday recommended that the General
Assembly of the United Nations call for strengthened supervision
and scrutiny of private companies that provide military advice and
assistance on the international market.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Human
Rights Commission Enrigue Bernales Ballesteros said this should
apply even when such services had been agreed with legitimate or
constitutional governments or for the purpose of reinstating them.
</P>
<P>
The Special Rapporteur said since these companies usually hired
mercenaries to provide the military component of their services,
attention must be paid to the need to regulate and restrict their
operations to prevent them from interfering in internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that the General Assembly authorize the conduct
of studies and the drafting of proposals for strengthening
international prevention, action and response mechanisms in all
cases where there was a serious threat to the enjoyment of human
rights, the exercise of the right to self-determination of
peoples, internal law and order, life and peace.
</P>
<P>
The Special Rapporteur said this applied particularly in
situations of internal armed conflict which could extend beyond
national boundaries or have regional repercussions.
</P>
<P>
"This would limit the activities of private security and
military assistance companies strictly to providing technical and
professional advisory services in accordance with the relevant
legal norms," he added.

Both Rugova and the separate Albanian guerrilla group KLA said
the agreement reached by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on Tuesday was not acceptable as the
ethnic Albanians' demand was full independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nato announced that it gives Yugoslavia an
additional 10 days to comply with United Nations demands for a
peaceful resolution to the crisis in Kosovo. However, the Western
military alliance was not satisfied with the pace of withdrawal of
Serbian troops from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are still far from seeing full compliance with what the
international community wants," Nato Secretary-General Javier

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Implement Common External Tariff By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) has reached an agreement to
implement a common external tariff by the year 2000, COMESA trade
advisor M.J. Musonda said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Musonda said COMESA is one of the most successful regional
economic cooperation and integration groups not only in Africa
but also the world over.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA trade advisor said that all COMESA countries are
committed to reducing tariffs at a symposium on "Ethiopia and
Enlarged COMESA Market by the Year 2000" held in the capital of
this east African country, Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said, seven countries including Comoros, Eritrea, Kenya,
Mauritius, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe have reached the 80 percent
reduction level as of September 1998 while four other countries
have reduced tariffs by 60 or 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that inter-COMESA trade grew from 834 million U.S.
Dollars in 1985 to 2.5 billion Dollars in 1996 as a result of
COMESA trade liberalization and facilitation programs, with
further potential growth of four billion Dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Achievements in elimination of non-tariff barriers include
liberalization of import licensing, removal of foreign exchange
restrictions and taxes on foreign exchange, removal of import and
export quotas, removal of road blocks, and easing of customs
formalities.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Economic Growth Slows Down: Document </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Angola
said in a document Friday that Angola's economic growth has
slowed down evidently, with a predicted growth rate of only 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the document summarizing the performance of the national
economy in 1998, Angola's central bank pointed out that the
government's revenue will decrease because the petroleum industry
of the southern African country has been affected by the
faltering peace process and the lowering crude oil prices in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
It said that the growth of the petroleum sector and mining
sector will both slow down to 2.5 percent. The two sectors
account for 45 percent of Angola's gross domestic products (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the monetary policy for 1998, the national bank
said that it will keep committing itself to curbing the
inflation.
</P>
<P>
On account of the dropping crude prices in the international
market, the Angolan central bank has revised upward its inflation
target from the previous less than 30 percent to the current 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the price for crude oil in the international market
remained around the level of 18.6 U.S. Dollars per barrel.
However, it has so far plunged to 12 Dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the bank said that it will further take direct and
indirect measures to control money supply. It will limit loans
directly by setting the maximum and minimum of interest rates,
while introducing the reserve system.
</P>
<P>
Angola's GDP grew by nearly six percent for 1997, with the
processing sector recording the fastest growth rate at 92
percent.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Considers Reducing Excise Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
considering reducing excise duty on soft drinks, cigarettes and
clear beer, Zambian Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry
David Mpamba said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba told an annual general meeting of the Lusaka Chamber of
Commerce and Industry Association that other issues to be
considered include duty on some imported materials and levy on
the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the Zambian government is
considering the reestablishment of the tariff advisory board.
</P>
<P>
The government is aware of the concerns of the business
community about the generally weak situation in the economy, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chairman for Lusaka Chamber, Gaudenzio Rossi, said on the same
occasion that the government should come up with economic
policies that will focus on Zambians to revitalize the economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Chairman for the Zambia Association of
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) George Chabwera called
on the government and business community to hold dialog in a bid
to enhance economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Cola-Cola company in Zambia recently urged the
government of the southern African country to honor its promise
made last May to reduce the excise duty to five percent from 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
Due to the Zambian government's inability to reduce the excise
duty, the Coca-Cola company, increased its price last month to
900 Kwacha (0.45 U.S. Dollar) from 500 Kwacha (0.25 Dollar) per
bottle.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the sharp price hike, the company's sale
dropped by 70 percent.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets End Week Sharply Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets posted
large gains at the end of the week, reinvigorated by an unexpected
rate cut of 0.25 percent by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
But early euphoria was later tempered by scepticism that the
European Central Bank and the Bundesbank would not follow suit.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 finished the week with a 6.4 percent rise
thanks to the rate-cut inspired rally on Wall Street for the
second day running and advances in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 closed up 77 at 5133 in healthy turnover of 1.05bn
shares. The FTSE 250 jumped 94 to 4564.
</P>
<P>
Interest rate cuts in Hong Kong and Canada added to the
feel-good factor and fuelled hopes of another rate cut in the U.K,
although an inter-meeting easing by the Bank of England has
largely been ruled out by analysts.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the electronic Xetra Dax closed up 79 points at
4469, down slightly from an early morning high of 4578.
</P>
<P>
"Pretty clearly the U.S. interest rate cut is the reason for
the market rise," said a trader at the Hamburg-based MM Warburg.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the leading Cac 40 index had a more disappointing
turnout, ending 3390 by the end of the session after an initial
rise of 89 points to 3451.76.
</P>
<P>
"We recovered from September and early October losses... and
investors are pausing, looking for new elements that would justify
pushing the index higher," said a trader at a Paris-based
brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks rallied as further reports in the French press
managed to ease investors' worries over banks' hidden exposure to
hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russia's stock market continued its gradual climb
from the deep freeze on Friday, bounding ahead almost 10 percent
in the first hour of trading in an abrupt about turn after months
of seemingly endless falls. But the rally faltered and the index
fell back by 3.6 percent when trading was halted at 12:30PM local
time.
</P>
<P>
But the RTS index was still up nearly 30 percent on the week as
investors were attracted by the bargain prices of Russia's blue
chip companies.
</P>
<P>
The leading RTS index which had lost 90 percent of its value
this year, was reached 64.57 at its high before ending the week at
56.62.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas companies proved particularly attractive, despite
the perils of investing in a country gripped by a devastating
economic crisis.

JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- This week's trade talks
between South Africa and the European Union (EU) failed to
resolve an impasse over EU's tariff reduction offer for farm
products, a senior South African trade official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the negotiations did not achieve sufficient progress
on the key issue of agriculture, even though positive proposals
were made in this regard," South African Press Association quoted
Chief Director of Foreign Trade Bahle Sibisi as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, parallel negotiations on a wine and spirit agreement
did yield some progress, said Sibisi.
</P>
<P>
"The parties will now report back to their principals on the
outcome of the meeting in order to prepare for the forthcoming
discussions between (EU) Commissioner Joao de Neus Pinheiro and
(South African) Trade Minister (Alec) Erwin," he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks, now in their 21st round, broke down last month when
the EU insisted that the names "port" and "sherry" no longer be
used by South African producers.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Exports Down: Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's copper exports in
August reduced by 13 percent against that in January, falling
from 22,969 tons to 19,933 tons, according to the statistics
released by the Zambian central bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a Statistics Fortnightly obtained Friday from
Bank of Zambia, the country's central bank, copper exports have
dropped largely due to the lower price in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
The copper price in the world market fell to 1,623 U.S.
Dollars per ton in August from 1,693 Dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, a copper-rich east African country, exported 172,740
tons of copper during the first eight months of this year while
it produced 188,454 tons of copper in the same period, said the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
The country's copper output in August rose to 27,867 tons from
20,642 tons in January, representing an increase of 35 percent,
it added.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's largest copper companies, the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) which is under privatization has
still held the lion's share of the country's copper production
and exports.
</P>
<P>
It produced 162,154 tons of copper in the first eight months
and sold 146,188 tons in the world market.

<HEADLINE> Starr's Contacts with Jones Lawyers again at Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenneth Starr's
conversations with Paula Jones' lawyers in 1994 are winding up on
a list of Democratic complaints against the prosecutor in the
impeachment inquiry of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The talks with Jones' lawyer Gilbert Davis show Starr "never
should have been appointed" to investigate the Monica Lewinsky
scandal, says Representative Barney Frank, a member of the House
of Representatives Judiciary Committee that is considering Starr's
assertions that Clinton committed impeachable offenses, the
Associated Press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Frank, a Democrat, said the Starr conversations were relevant
to the impeachment inquiry because they show "he's deeply
involved" in the Jones case long before he got permission from
Attorney General Janet Reno to expand his Whitewater investigation
to include the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
Davis said he called Starr, then a private lawyer, a half-dozen
times to seek his guidance on the constitutional question of
whether a sitting president was immune from lawsuits. Starr's view
was that the president was not.
</P>
<P>
Discussions between Starr and the Jones team first surfaced in
1994 and were brought up again by the news media in January.
National Public Radio focused new attention on the contacts
Wednesday, prompting Starr's office to issue a statement in
response.
</P>
<P>
"This office did not mislead the Department of Justice
regarding relevant facts relating to its jurisdiction, or any
expansion," Starr's office said.
</P>
<P>
Reno at her weekly news conference on Friday said, "We're
taking all the information and all the allegations and reviewing
to see if an investigation is appropriate."
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Starr should have reported his talks with
Davis to Reno in January, when the independent counsel got
permission to look into Lewinsky, who was under subpoena in Jones'
sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Frank said Starr "may have wrecked the institution of the
independent counsel beyond repair." White House spokesman Jim
Kennedy said the conversations raise "serious questions."
</P>
<P>
Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, urged the chairmen of the
Senate Governmental Affairs and Judiciary committees to summon
Starr before their panels.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor "failed to disclose to the attorney general his
relationship with Mr. Davis and the assistance he had given Mr.
Davis in the preparation of the Jones suit," Durbin wrote both
committees.
</P>
<P>
Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat said the impeachment
inquiry, the Justice Department review and congressional oversight
hearings all were proper avenues for delving into Starr's conduct.
</P>
<P>
"Starr deserves an investigation of his own, maybe in the
context of oversight hearings next year" in the reauthorization of
the independent counsel law, said Nadler.
</P>
<P>
Jones filed her now-dismissed lawsuit on May 6, 1994, alleging
Clinton sexually harassed her in a Little Rock, Arkansas, hotel
room three years earlier when he was governor and she was a state
employee. Clinton denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department is reviewing the Starr conversations and
contacts by Starr law partner Richard Porter with New York book
agent Lucianne Goldberg, a friend of Tripp's who helped pave the
way for Tripp's cooperation with Starr's probe.
</P>
<P>
Other matters being reviewed include the taping by Starr's
investigators of a January 13 conversation between Tripp and
Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Summit Continues in U.S. in Less Formalities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators on Friday continued tough talks in Wye Mills,
Maryland, aiming at breaking the 19-month deadlock in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
For the whole day, the delegations broke up into groups
specializing in security, economic issues, the Palestinian airport
in Gaza and setting up a safe passage for Palestinians between
Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators dropped formalities as Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat sat alone
outdoors with an interpreter under a sun umbrella for about an
hour while their negotiators tackled the disputes.
</P>
<P>
"People are dressed rather informally... It does appear that
there is a better and more constructive and more pragmatic
atmosphere to work on these problems than there had been in the
past," said State Department James Rubin at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright had lunch at Netanyahu's quarters -- a mansion
overlooking the river at Wye Plantation.
</P>
<P>
"The informality of it all has increased and it isn't as stiff
as it used to be," Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin declined to say if the negotiators were making progress
but said the attitudes were constructive.
</P>
<P>
"We do believe that the pace of the work, the seriousness of
the work, the pragmatism that this delegation is bringing to bear,
the constructive approach is there. And whether that will be
enough is still an open question," he added.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to close a deal on Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank, coupled with Palestinian security measures to protect
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The central issue is a U.S. proposal for Israel to pull back
troops from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
specific Palestinian assurances to crack down on militants and
give cast-iron security commitments.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had some tough words on Thursday about the need for
success, setting an ultimatum until Tuesday, according to
Palestinian sources.
</P>
<P>
If the talks collapsed, the United States would announce the
failure and would not take such an active mediating role in
future, on Palestinian official quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin, asked to comment, said this was news to him. "I
received pretty reasonable readouts of the various meetings... and
I never heard anyone suggesting such a thing," he added.
</P>
<P>
"What we have said is that our goal is to complete the work if
possible by Sunday. And we don't want to speculate what would
happen after Sunday," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli delegates declined to comment on this Palestinian
account, citing an agreement not to leak substance to the media.
</P>
<P>
Rubin noted that Arafat and Netanyahu have hardly met for
months and have never spent much time together.
</P>
<P>
"Now we have not only increased the frequency but turned it
into something that's more normal, something that one hopes will
make each leader understand the needs and constraints and concerns
of the other so that practical solutions can be found to very real
problems," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> White House Chief of Staff Reported Departing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The farewells continued on
Friday for White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, who is
reportedly returning to North Carolina to explore a run for
governor in 2000.
</P>
<P>
A Rose Garden celebration of the budget agreement doubled as a
sendoff for Bowles.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton called the budget deal with
Republican leaders in Congress "a great closing act," for the
chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
It was Bowles' second bow for leading Clinton's mostly
successful budget wrangling.
</P>
<P>
Bowles is expected to be succeeded by his deputy, John Podesta.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Al Gore said the budget negotiations would not
have succeeded without Bowles. "And we all wish you well in
whatever you do. If there's some state that needs an outstanding
chief executive, I recommend you very, very highly," Gore said.

<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chen Yunlin, director of the
State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, who spoke at a banquet in
Beijing's Great Hall of the People in honor of Koo Chen-fu and his
party here today, said that he expects the mainland's ARATS and
Taiwan's SEF to start talks on procedural matters of political
negotiation as soon as possible and to follow this with a
re-opening of talks on practical and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the mainland always supports continued contacts and
exchanges between ARATS and SEF for the benefit of peaceful
reunification and dialog on developing relations across the Taiwan
Straits and expects the two to achieve something by this.
</P>
<P>
The mainland and Taiwan have been separated for almost 50 years
and this is unfortunate for the Chinese nation, Chen noted. But he
added that there has been an increase in the economic and trade
relations across the straits, an interflow of personnel and other
exchanges thanks to the joint efforts of compatriots living on
both sides and the departments concerned in the past decade and
more.
</P>
<P>
At present, the cross-straits relations are now facing new
opportunities and challenges at the turn of the century, Chen
said.

<HEADLINE> Pak FM Calls for Just Settlement of Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Saturday called for just settlement of the Kashmir
issue, saying that there was no reason for this dispute to remain
unresolved when the world's intractable disputes had been settled.
</P>
<P>
"In a qualitatively new international environment where
seemingly intractable disputes in different parts of the world had
been resolved or were in the process of being resolved, there was
no reason why a just settlement of the Kashmir dispute should be
postponed," Aziz said in a meeting here with Indian Foreign
Secretary K. Ragunath.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister stressed the need for a sustained and
substantive dialogue between Pakistan and India to promote peace
and security in the region by resolving all outstanding issues, in
particular the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the two sides should work to identify
measures that could promote nuclear stabilization and restraint in
South Asia in order to avoid nuclear confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Foreign Secretary, however, said that India favored
normalization of relations with Pakistan without waiting for the
resolution of contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
The secretary, who is currently holding a three-day talks with
his Pakistani counterpart, said that the talks had been held in a
candid manner and that India desired continuation of this dialogue
process.

<P>
The eight-point proposal set forth by Jiang Zemin, general
secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
has chartered the direction of relations across the straits
and of China's peaceful reunification, Chen said, and the key in
building the stable, healthy and favorable relations across the
straits and the country's peaceful reunification hinges on
adherence to the one-China principle and holding of political
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that any issues can be negotiated under the one-China
principle," he said, adding that as the first step, talks can be
first of all held on ending the state of hostilities under the
one-China principle.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the state of hostilities across the
Taiwan Straits will be put to an end officially through
negotiations and knotty problems that affect adversely the growth
of cross-straits relations will be resolved step by step, and
truly satisfy Taiwan compatriots' desire for stability, peace and
development, so as to open up new prospects for the development of
the relations across the straits.
</P>
<P>
ARATS and SEF serve as an important channel for developing the
cross-straits ties and the mainland hopes that ARATS and SEF,
within their capacity, will provide legal assistance and
facilitate the study of cases that involve the rights and
interests of compatriots living across the straits, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Massive Turnout in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Saturday called on the people to turn out vehemently to
elect the powerful Experts Assembly on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khatami made the appeal in an interview with the state-run
television to be broadcast Saturday night, the official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The more "lively and enthusiastic the election is held, the
more it will serve the interest of the Islamic Republic and that
of the people," Khatami said, quoted by IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The call came after several candidates from the pro-Khatami
leftist and moderate factions withdrew from the campaign to
protest the disqualification of some prominent applicants by the
Guardians Council.
</P>
<P>
The conservative-dominated Guardians Council, empowered to
screen the qualification of applicants in any election by Iran's
elections law, was accused of taking side while carrying out its
mandate.
</P>
<P>
A total of 186 candidates, out of 396 applicants, were approved
by the council to run for the Experts Assembly, which serves in
each term of eight years to determine the country's supreme leader
or council of leadership.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's constitution, the Experts Assembly also
has the right to dismiss the leader or member of the council of
leadership the incumbent fails to perform his duties.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that people have the primary role in the election
of the Experts Assembly and those elected must be accountable,
because their legitimacy emanates from the people.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Experts Assembly is where the Islamic and
republican natures of the system meet, and experts who enjoy
special status should elect a leader with specific
qualifications," he noted.

<HEADLINE> More ARATS, SEF Exchanges Are Expected (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chen said that Koo's mainland trip is the outcome of
increased exchanges and cooperation between ARATS and SEF, so it
is important that ARATS-SEF dialogues be increased and relations
across the Taiwan Straits further improved.
</P>
<P>
ARATS President Wang Daohan met with Koo in Shanghai to discuss
issues of common and respective concern, Chen said, and that he
appreciates the consensus reached between ARATS and SEF on four
points, including common ground in conducting multi-field and
multi-form dialog in politics, economics and other spheres.
</P>
<P>
Koo said he was impressed by the fact that his visit is a rare
chance for the starting point of interaction between ARATS and SEF
that allows both to exchange views and fully communicate their
concepts and views concerning problems in developing cross-straits
relations. He expressed his belief that his visit will
lay the basis for mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the banquet, Chen presented Koo with an antithetical
couplet inferring renewal of brotherhood after ordeals and ensuing
sufferings written by Qi Gong, a well-known Chinese calligrapher.
</P>
<P>
In return, Koo sent a gift to Chen, and Koo's wife Yen Cho-yun
exchanged gifts with Chen's wife Lai Xiaohua.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the banquet were Tang Shubei, executive
vice-president of ARATS, and Wang Yonghai, deputy director of the
State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
The banquet is followed by a traditional Beijing Opera
performance hosted by ARATS in Koo's honor this evening at the
Chang'an Grand Theater in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Koo was in such high spirits that he ascended the stage and
sang an episode of a very popular traditional Peking drama, which
brought the evening performance to its climax.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shihai, a well-known Chinese Peking Opera master, praised
Koo's opera singing as superb and full of feelings.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunlin, Tang Shubei, Wang Yonghai and their wives were
among those present at the performance.

WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A high school football
player in Hamilton, Ohio of the United States, who was allowed to
keep playing for his school's team after pleading guilty of two
felony drug charges, is now off the team after a judge sentenced
him to one year in prison.
</P>
<P>
Wayne A. Brandon Jarrett, 18, was sentenced by Butler County
Common Pleas Judge Anthony Valen for trafficking in cocaine and
possession of cocaine. The offenses he pleaded guilty of last
month occurred when he was 17.
</P>
<P>
Jarrett had continued to start as defensive lineman for the
Princeton High School football team after his conviction. School
officials, who characterized Jarrett as a model student and
athlete, had said that neither the school district nor the Ohio
High School Athletic Association has a rule that would make
Jarrett ineligible to play because of his conviction.
</P>
<P>
Jarrett was taken to the Butler County Jail after sentencing
pending removal to the state's correctional reception center.

KATHMANDU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Nepalese climber Kaji Sherpa
on Saturday scaled Mount Qumulangma, the world's highest peak, in
20 hours and 24 minutes, breaking the old record of 22 hours and
29 minutes, local Radio Nepal said.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old man started at the base camp (5,300-meter) at
four o'clock on Friday afternoon and reached the summit at 12:24
on Saturday noon, the state-run radio said.
</P>
<P>
The old record was set by a Frenchman Marc Bartard in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Detailed information is not available now.
</P>
<P>
Kaji Sherpa had planned to set a record of 18 hours on October
1, but was stalled by the weather.
</P>
<P>
This is his second attempt to conquer the 8,848-meter peak in
record time. He abandoned his first bid in 1994 after reaching a
height of 8,400 meters due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
He had climbed this world's highest peak four times.

<HEADLINE> NBA Star Drexler Welcomed As Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Clyde Drexler has yet to
coach his first game at the University of Houston, but already 16
of the 28 shiny boxes are sold out for the next three years at
Hofheinz Pavilion, and most of the 8,600 season tickets available
also are gone.
</P>
<P>
"We've gone to the records, and looking back at the Phi Slamma
Jamma days, we are right there," AD Chet Gladchuk said. "We're
down to 500 tickets and we are sold out for the season."
</P>
<P>
Drexler ended his NBA Hall of Fame career with the Houston
Rockets last season and returned to the school where he was a
member of the Phi Slamma Jamma dunking crew that went to the NCAA
Final Four three straight years in the 1980s, two with Drexler on
the team.
</P>
<P>
Season ticket sales started a dramatic increase on March 18
when Drexler was named coach. After averaging 2,838 at 13 home
games last season, the Cougars will play before nearly sold-out
home crowds this season.
</P>
<P>
"We've been wanting that type of crowd and Clyde is bringing
in a lot of people," said Chad Hendrick, a sophomore who started
22 games last season. "We can't do anything but win games now. We
want to show Houston that we can win."

<HEADLINE> Absolute Poverty Declines Substantially in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Absolute poverty has declined
substantially since 1992 as a result of rapid economic
development, a Ugandan minister has said.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation published in Saturday's New
Vision daily, Ugandan Minister of State for Finance, Planning and
Economic Development, Sam Kutesa, said that much progress was
made in the 1992-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 46 percent of the population were not meeting their
basic requirements compared to 56 percent in 1992. This is a 10
percent decline in poverty over four years or 18 percent decline
relative to the poverty level of 1992, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Real private consumption per capita increased from 6,238
Shillings (five U.S. Dollars) to 7,320 Shillings (six Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite the strong improvements in living standards during
this period, the minister said, the poorest 20 percent became
poorer.
</P>
<P>
Although all regions had lower poverty in 1996, poverty was
more marked in the northern and eastern regions where 65.5
percent and 53.3 percent of the population respectively were
still unable to meet basic requirements.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the sharp poverty decline to economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Over this period, the gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at
a rate of 6 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program human development
index, too, indicates that Uganda continues to register a steady,
albeit slow, improvement since 1993.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP human development index (1997) ranked Uganda 159th
out of 175 countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Turkey Start Talks to Promote Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Turkey started
trade talks in Baghdad on Saturday to promote bilateral economic
and trade relations, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
INA said the Iraqi-Turkish Joint Committee for Economic
Cooperation started first round of talks, which were co-chaired
by Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rasheed and the visiting
Turkish State Minister Mehmet Batalli.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the talks, the Iraqi minister described the first
round as an important step for strengthening bilateral economic
and trade relations, saying he hoped the current visit of the
Turkish delegation would achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish trade delegation led by Batalli arrived here on
Friday evening to attend the meetings of the joint committee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the talks, The Turkish minister emphasized that
the visit of the Turkish delegation reflected Turkey's desire
for increasing the volume of trade and economic exchange with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Batalli said Turkey would take all arrangements and facilities
to further develop bilateral economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister also said it was necessary to lift the
over eight-year embargo imposed on Iraq, stressing that Turkey, a
close neighbor of Iraq, also had sustained grave material damage
because of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in
August 1990 following its invasion of Kuwait. The harsh sanctions
include a ban on air travel and limits on sales of oil, thus
Turkey closed the Turkish-Iraqi pipelines for exporting Iraq's
oil until December 1996 when the U.N. allowed Iraq to export
limited amount of oil to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in
this country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to INA on Friday upon arrival, Batalli said he
would discuss with Iraqi officials prospects of expanding joint
cooperation in economic and trade areas.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Iraqi Joint Committee of Economic cooperation held
its last meetings in December 1996 in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Batalli in the trade delegation are 21 members
from government ministries, chamber of commerce and big companies.

<HEADLINE> Organisms Millions of Years Old Possible in Antarctic Ice Lake (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from France, Russia,
and the United States have found an ice lake beneath 3,700 meters
of ice in the Antarctic where they think old organisms may exist.
</P>
<P>
The 200 km by 50 km lake is 600 meters deep at the deepest and
is the largest and oldest ice lake among those that have been
discovered in the Antarctic, according to one of the
glaciologists, J.R. Petit from France.
</P>
<P>
Petit told a recent international Antarctic glaciology
symposium in Lanzhou, capital of northwest China's Gansu Province
that they found the lake when they were drilling for ice cores at
Russia's Vostok Station early this year, and a Russian scientist
has discovered live microorganisms in a 5,000-year-old ice core
sample.
</P>
<P>
At first, the Russian found some dust in the ice core, and then
he discovered live microorganisms existing in five percent of the
dust.
</P>
<P>
"We think that there must be live beings aged from one million
to even 10 million years old in the deeper ice layer or in the
lake," Petit said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that no larger living beings exist in the
lake because they could not stand the pressure and the clean water
has no sugar or food to sustain life.
</P>
<P>
Petit said that it is difficult for the microorganisms to live
in the lake as well, but they struggle by on some special
materials put out by volcanos in the same historical era.

The government has taken immediate, short-term and long-term
programs for post-flood rehabilitation and reconstruction, she
told the nation.
</P>
<P>
Proper steps would be taken to manage the country's water
bodies to make the best utilization of surface water as well as to
protect ecological balance by planting more trees and protecting
forest resources, she stated.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the rivers would be properly managed through necessary
dredging which would help increase the water-containing capacity
as well as ensure safe and proper navigation, she added.
</P>

LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Retired Former Chilean leader
Augosto Pinochet was arrested in London early Saturday, according
to a BBC Television report.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the London Metropolitan Police said Pinochet
had been arrested on allegations of murdering Spanish citizens
when he was leader of Chile between 1973 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who entered Britain on a diplomatic passport, early
Friday underwent a surgery at the London Bridge hospital.
</P>

On Wednesday, two Spanish judges investigating abuses which
took place in Chile and Argentina in the 1970s asked British
police to prevent Pinochet from leaving the country until he could

<P>
The study on these possible living beings several million years
in the lake will provide valuable clues for research on the
origins of life and the possibility of life in outer space, Petit
said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the United States plan to put a sound device in
the lake to do research in the next four years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some minerals found at the end of the ice core indicate that
there are abundant rocks at the bottom of the lake, and Petit
regards this as his latest discovery. Another rare phenomenon is
that the 200-meter-thick ice layer over the lake surface is
directly formed by frozen lake water.
</P>
<P>
Most glaciers in the area are usually formed by a lot of
accumulating snow piles that becomes harder year after year, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
They started ice core drilling at Vostok 10 years ago
originally for research on climate and environmental changes in
the Antarctic during the past 400,000 years, he says. When they
got more than three kilometers deep, they inferred from the rising
temperature and radar data that there must be a lake under the ice
layer, the scientist recalls.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the lake from being polluted, they stopped drilling
at a depth of 3,623 meters, 127 meters from the lake surface,
Petit said, adding that the ice core is so far the deepest in the
Antarctic, and the earliest data they can come up with goes back
400,000 years.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Denies Foreign Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi has opposed the importation of wastes from
abroad, saying that his government does not authorize any firm to
import and handle foreign wastes in the country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks in Maputo Friday.
</P>
<P>
Previously, there were reports saying that the Mozambican
International Waste Group had been authorized to import and
dispose foreign waste in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Noticias quoted Mocumbi as saying that it is
necessary to check if the firm had had the authorization.
</P>
<P>
If the firm did win the authorization from the Mozambican
government, then the government had gone against its commitment
to the related international treaties, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe any firm would have been authorized to import
and dispose foreign waste in the territory of Mozambique," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the handling of wastes created in Mozambique,
Mocumbi stressed the necessity to take measures to ensure that
wastes created in Mozambique can be properly handled in line with
the international treaties and without any harm to the human
being and other living things.
</P>
<P>
But he said: "No import of any poisonous waste should be
allowed." "Anyone who wants to start a firm involving in foreign
waste disposal should give up the idea because no authorization
would be issued," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that either Mozambicans or foreigners are free to
raise their investment plans.
</P>
<P>
If they want to invest in the disposal of the local wastes,
they will surely be welcomed.
</P>
<P>
But, the prime minister stressed, if they want to deal with
imported wastes, their investment plans would certainly be denied.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that in a document of approval issued on
February 15, 1996, the Mozambican Ministry of Coordination for
Environmental Affairs had authorized the Mozambican International
Waste Group to exclusively deal with the import, export and
disposal of various wastes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Shut Out from World Cup Table Tennis Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Cao Jianjie
</P>
<P>
SHANTOU, China, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese table tennis
fans got used to winning and accepted nothing less. That was why
they booed and gibed at the players who failed to live up to
their expectation.
</P>
<P>
China's best trio -- Kong Linghui, world No. 2, Liu Guoliang,
No.4, and Ma Lin, No.11, all lost on the third day of the World
Cup table tennis tournament Saturday afternoon, seeing their
lower-ranked rivals sail into Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese players are weak in mentality, consistency and
adaptability at their opponents' styles," said Li Furong, vice
president of the Chinese Table Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
World No. 9 Kim Taek Soo, who struggled in his group matches
but upset Sweden's reigning world champion Jan-Ove Waldner in the
quarter-finals, combined his usual array of table tennis wares to
deadly effect, routing Liu 21-15, 21-14, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
Liu moved into the semifinals at the expense of Ma Lin.
</P>
<P>
World No. 14 Jorg Rosskopf, who suffered a whitewash by Liu in
a group match but nipped Kong in a fight for a semifinal berth,
blanked 1993 and 1997 World Cup winner Zoran Primorac of Croatia
21-12, 21-15, 21-18 to reach the final.
</P>
<P>
Kim stunned Chinese double Olympic gold medalist with vicious
loops, deft blocks and consistent rallies.
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable," said Liu after the match. "Kim played so
well and he gave me a lot of pressure throughout the match."
</P>
<P>
Kim, who had only won four out of his 13 encounters with Liu
before this match, said he was just one step away from the World
Cup title and he would never let the chance slip easily.
</P>
<P>
"I feel so good now and I promise, I will bring out the best
in the final," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primorac's jubilation over his win over Belarus' world No. 1
Vladimir Samsonov earlier this afternoon was cut short as he
failed to beat the jinx in the game against Rosskopf.
</P>
<P>
No one has ever won the World Cup for the second straight time.
</P>
<P>
The world fifth-ranked Croatian looked jaded against the
inspired Rosskopf, whose ferocious backhand is stronger than many
of his peer's forehand.
</P>
<P>
Neither Rosskopf nor Kim has won the World Cup. Their best
performance in the annual event was second.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf said he had fifty-fifty chance against Kim in the
final but would "fight to the last".
</P>
<P>
China has won the World Cup for 10 times in the previous 18
versions. Sweden has won three times with Croatia twice, France,
Poland and Hungary once.

<HEADLINE> Kirghizstan Holds Referendum on Private Land Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- People of Kirghizstan went to
the polling stations Saturday in a referendum on whether to
introduce private land ownership to the central Asian republic.
</P>
<P>
Turnout was high and 67.05 percent of the registered voters had
come to polling stations by noon Moscow time (08:00 GMT), the
Interfax news agency quoting Kirghiz Central Election Commission
as saying.
</P>
<P>
A referendum is valid in Kirghizstan if no less than 51 percent
of the registered 2.254 million voters turn up, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
Kirghiz President Askar Akayev said earlier Saturday that the
referendum, on amendments to the constitution, would determine the
future of the country and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not expect the voters to support his ideas
unanimously but "it would be excellent" if two thirds of the
voters backed the amendments.
</P>
<P>
If the amendments are approved, Kirghiz said, land plots should
also be given to doctors, school teachers and social workers in
the villages in order to avoid public discontent.
</P>
<P>
"We should do our best to form a middle class not only in the
cities but also in the villages," Interfax quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the amendments to the constitution would give an
impetus to democratic reforms in the country and prove a good
model for other members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States.

<P>
ROME, October 17 (Xinhua)-- Controversial soccer star Diego
Maradona could soon file a suit against the Italian Football
Federation following a revelation that his 15-month suspension in
1991 had resulted from a botched dope test.
</P>
<P>
Maradona was banned following a positive test for cocaine
after a league match for Napoli against Bari, which marked the
end of his sensational career.
</P>
<P>
But a report by ANSA news agency claims that blunders with the
equipment were made in March 1991 at the now discredited Acqua
Acetosa test laboratory, currently at the center of a drugs
scandal in Italian soccer.
</P>
<P>
Not only Maradona's sample, but also the supposedly 'clean'
control sample, which is only used for comparison purposes to
make sure the equipment is set-up correctly, also showed traces
of cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rules Out Idea of No-first Use of Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Saturday ruled
out the proposal of no-first use of nuclear weapons as "outdated."
</P>
<P>
"That is an outdated concept in any case - even in the cold
war context of between NATO and WARSAW Pact this concept was never
recognized as relevant - so there is no question of accepting this
irrelevant concept," Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad
said while replying to reporter's questions after the joint
briefing held at the end of Pak-Indian talks on Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
The talks on the contentious Jammu and Kashmir dispute between
Shamshad Ahmad and his Indian counterpart K Ragunath followed
Friday's talks on issues of peace and security.
</P>
<P>
When asked for an alternative Pakistani proposal, he said, "we
have to develop a nuclear doctrine on the basis of minimum nuclear
deterrence capability."
</P>
<P>
Shamshad said that Pakistan has given some "specific ideas" to
India on the need for having a "regime of mutual restraint and
stabilization."
</P>
<P>
Replying to another question on Islamabad's proposal on non-
aggression pact, he stated that "we have left this proposal at the
table - you can call it a non-aggression pact or non-use of force
or avoidance of conflict."
</P>
<P>
The purpose of such a pact, he said, is to avoid a "devastating
conflict" in the changed environment in the region.

SINGAPORE, October 17 (Xinhua)-- World number three Marcelo
Rios of Chile and Australian doubles specialist Mark Woodforde
both advanced into the final on Saturday at the 700,000 U.S.
dollars Singapore Open.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Rios always had the upper hand in a clash of
forehands, moving Jim Courier around the court before he hammered
the former number one American 6-2 6-1 to make the final.
</P>
<P>
While Woodforde, 33, had to rally back to hold off Dutchman
Sjeng Schalken, ranked 80th, 0-6,6-4,6-2 after a calamitous start.
</P>
<P>
The final between the two finalists on Sunday is expected to
be an intriguing clash. Woodforde, 10 years older than his
high-flying opponent, had beaten second seeded Croat Ivanisevic
and Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen in previous rounds although it is

<HEADLINE> Turkey Asks Syria to Drive out PKK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has asked Syria to drive Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) out of the country if it wants better
relations.
</P>
<P>
Local Milliyet newspaper Saturday quoted Demirel as saying late
Friday night that "the place to shelter terrorists and the leader
(of PKK) is Syria. What Syria will do is to drive them out of the
country."
</P>
<P>
"The situation which disturbs Turkey is the situation which
Syria supports terrorism," said Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry Friday issued a statement rejecting
an offer of Syria for wide-range talks with Turkey. It said what
concerns Ankara now is only the issue of Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment Turkey wants to see whether Syria has put an end
to her support to terrorism," added the statement.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Syria have always been
troublesome. Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring the PKK,
which has been fighting since 1984 for autonomy of the Kurdish
minority in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria, denying the charges, repeatedly voiced its concern and
fear over Turkey's close military alliance with Israel that
threats Arab security.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has stepped up a war of words against Syria recently and
Ankara's war-like rhetoric has aroused fears of a regional
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
and Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi have visited Turkey
and Syria to try to persuade the two neighbors to solve their
dispute through dialog.

<HEADLINE> 5 South, South-East Asian Countries Likely to Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Five South and Southeast Asian
countries may decide to connect their capitals through setting up
a "common airline" and physically inter-link their nations through
a trans-Asian highway.
</P>
<P>
Both the ideas are likely to receive a go-ahead at the
forthcoming ministerial BIMSTEC (the Bangladesh, Indian, Myanmar,
Sri Lanka, Thailand Economic Cooperation) meeting, The Daily Star
newspaper reported Saturday, quoting diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The BIMSTEC, a new regional grouping comprising five countries
bordering the Bay of Bengal and was launched in the Thai capital
of Bangkok on June 6 last year, is expected to hold its first
ministerial meeting in Dhaka in December.
</P>
<P>
Four littoral countries of the Bay of Bengal -- Bangladesh,
India, Sri Lanka and Thailand -- had initially started the
grouping called BISTEC. Later at a ministerial-level meeting held
on December 22 last year, the four founding members agreed to
admit Myanmar, and it is now called BIMSTEC.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming meeting is expected to identify the thrust
sectors of the grouping, and plans are on the anvil to find ways
and means to focus on increasing trade, investment, tourism and
exchange of scientific data including meteorological data, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be also expected to draw up a possible list of
tariff concessions with the aim of creating a free trade zone in
the BIMSTEC countries in future, they stated.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong port, the largest sea-port of Bangladesh, is
likely to receive special focus for being propped up as a gateway
for boosting cargo trade and providing more trans-shipment,
refueling and warehousing facilities to the countries, and it may
be developed as a regional trade hub and a major gateway to the
Bay of Bengal, said Bangladeshi State Minister for Foreign Affairs
Abul Hasan Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the BIMSTEC has authorized an organization to conduct
a study for construction of a trans-Asian highway linking all the
five countries, and stretches of the highway already exist and it
is a matter of linking up and providing facilitation services, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 businessmen from the five countries at their March 6-7
meeting this year in Bangkok formed an expert group with former
president of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries as first
chairman of the BIMSTEC economic forum.
</P>
<P>
The original idea of the grouping was mooted by Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka, India and Thailand and was initially referred to as the
"Bay of Bengal Economic Cooperation Organization." And the
regional alliance was initiated considering the great potential of
increasing trade within these countries by taking advantage of the
geographical proximity of the countries of the Bay of Bengal
region and the eastern coast of the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The BIMSTEC is also being seen as a bridge between three SAARC
(South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries --
Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka -- and two ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) countries -- Thailand and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
"The BIMSTEC is in fact the first and only institutional link
between SAARC and the ASEAN," Hasan Chowdhury observed.

<HEADLINE> Shamshad: Quick Solution to Kashmir Dispute Unrealistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad said here Saturday that it would be unrealistic to
expect any quick solution to the contentious Kashmir dispute
between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad was talking to reporters at a briefing here Saturday
afternoon at the conclusion of the second session of talks with
Indian Foreign Secretary K. Ragunath.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides agreed to continue their
discussions on the Kashmir issue in the next round of talks whose
timing would be announced Sunday in the final statement.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been unrealistic on any body's part to expect
that we will come out from this short session with any concrete
progress on the one of the most complex issues which the world is
facing today and the issue which is the cause of serious peace and
security problems in this part of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistani and Indian delegations have held "useful
exchange of views in the very frank and candid manner" on the
50-year-old dispute during Saturday's talks.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides "did exchange some ideas on how to approach to
the final settlement of Jammu and Kashmir issue and of course this
requires further detailed discussion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the issue will take considerable time and attention
from both sides and that is why we have decided that we will
resume discussions on this subject in the next round of talks."
</P>
<P>
Indian foreign secretary Ragunath said at the briefing that "we
have begun the discussions and will continue exchange of
conceptions."
</P>
<P>
"Yet it is not occasion to spell out these conceptions we have
discussed. The basic positions (of the two sides) are known," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Shamshad and Ragunath pondered over the issues of
the regional peace and security and exchanged "substantive
proposals" on the confidence building measures between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two senior diplomats are to wrap up their current round of
talks and issue a final statement on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> No deadlock in Pak-India Talks on Kashmir: Ragunath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Indian Foreign Secretary K.
Ragunath said here Saturday that there was no deadlock in the
talks between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the question of total deadlock, we are going to
continue our discussions," he said at a joint press briefing after
having about three-hour exclusive talks on the thorny Kashmir
issue with his Pakistani counterpart Shamshad Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The Indian foreign secretary declined to give direct answer to
a question that whether there was any deadline set by India to
resolve this long-standing issue.
</P>
<P>
"There are many possibilities for improving the relations for
which you have to look at the relations in their totality and in
all aspects," Ragunath said, adding, "of course addressing of the
outstanding issues is one of the aspects."
</P>
<P>
When asked to spell out India's position on the Kashmir issue,
Ragunath said, "our position on these issues have been amply made
clear."

Responding to a question about thinning out of the Indian
troops in India-held Kashmir, he said, "we have heard these kinds

SHANTOU, China, October 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Kim Taek
Soo and German Jorg Rosskopf beat their more fancied rivals on
Saturday to move into the World Cup table tennis final which has
a 38,000 U.S. dollars champion's purse at stake.
</P>
<P>
The world No. 9 Kim, who struggled in his group matches but
upset world champion Jan-Ove Waldner of Sweden in the
quarter-finals,routed the world No. 4 Chinese fast-attacker Liu
Guoliang, 21-15, 21-14, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf, who suffered a whitewash by Liu in a group match but
nipped world No. 2 Chinese Kong Linghui in a fight for a
semifinal berth, blanked 1993 and 1997 World Cup winner Zoran
Primorac of Croatia 21-12, 21-15, 21-18.
</P>
<P>
Kim stunned China's double Olympic gold medalist with vicious
loops, deft blocks and consistent rallies.
</P>
<P>
"It's unbelievable," said Liu after the match. "Kim played so
well and gave me a lot of pressure throughout the match."
</P>
<P>
Kim, who had only won four games in his 13 encounters with Liu
before this match, said he was just one step away from the World
Cup and he wouldn't let the chance slip easily.
</P>
<P>
"I feel so good now and I promise, I will bring out the best
in the final," he said.
</P>
<P>
Primorac, who outlasted world No. 1 Vladimir Samsonov of
Belarus 3-1 in the quarter-finals, looked jaded against the
inspired Rosskopf.
</P>
<P>
Rosskopf said he had fifty-fifty chance against Kim in the
final.

BEIRUT, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese companies will take
part in Baghdad Trade Fair for the first time since the end of the
1991 Gulf War, the Daily Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 businessmen from 63 industrial and agricultural
companies are expected to take part in the six-day trade fair
which opens on October 25.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese companies have booked 1,000 square meters of space
at the Baghdad International Exhibition Center, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that 15 trucks loaded with Lebanese goods have
already set off for Baghdad with 10 more to follow. The total
value of Lebanese products is estimated at more than 3 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, authorized by the United Nations to buy 3.5 billion
dollars worth of goods, medications and goods under the
oil-for-food deal, agreed to buy 50 million dollars worth of
agricultural products from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The products will be transported through Syria and Jordan.

Association, is due to travel to Baghdad to hold talks with
Iraqi business leaders during the fair in a bid to seek a

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese companies will take
part in Baghdad Trade Fair for the first time since the end of the
1991 Gulf War, the Daily Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 businessmen from 63 industrial and agricultural
companies are expected to take part in the six-day trade fair
which opens on October 25.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese companies have booked 1,000 square meters of space
at the Baghdad International Exhibition Center, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that 15 trucks loaded with Lebanese goods have
already set off for Baghdad with 10 more to follow. The total
value of Lebanese products is estimated at more than 3 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, authorized by the United Nations to buy 3.5 billion
dollars worth of goods, medications and goods under the
oil-for-food deal, agreed to buy 50 million dollars worth of
agricultural products from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The products will be transported through Syria and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Helps Uganda to Eradicate Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) has helped Uganda achieve much in
eradication of poverty and pledged to contribute more toward this
end.
</P>
<P>
IFAD President Fawzi H. Al-Sultan, who is on a five-day visit
to Uganda, made this promise in a press release issued Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1981 IFAD has been a partner in Uganda's development by
financing nine projects, bringing total investments in the
country to approximately 150 million U.S. Dollars," said the
press release.
</P>
<P>
At present, the IFAD has shifted from assisting basic rural
rehabilitation toward the re-emergence of the Ugandan small
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Rome-based agency has taken the initiative of
reducing Uganda's debt within the framework of its participation
in the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative.
</P>
<P>
On May 26, 1998, the IFAD and the Ugandan government signed an
agreement for 20 million U.S. Dollars to finance a vegetable oil
development project which aims at revitalizing and increasing
domestic vegetable oil production in the east African country,
thereby lessening its dependence on imports.
</P>
<P>
The IFAD president acknowledged that from the early years of
this decade, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has expressed his deep
concern on the priority of reducing poverty.
</P>
<P>
While special days such as the International Day for the
Eradication of Poverty come and go, the only way to eradicate
hunger and poverty is to persistently work at it each day, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the world's poorest and through the United
Nations, the IFAD regards the 17th of October as the day to
rededicate efforts for and with the rural poor, the press release
added.
</P>
<P>
The IFAD president is scheduled to attend celebrations in
southwestern Mubende District Saturday to mark the special day.
The celebrations in Uganda reflect a long and solid development
partnership between the IFAD and the Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, there are still 800 million
people around the world who are unable to meet their basic needs
on a sustainable basis and 70 percent of them are the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
The IFAD was created in 1978 by the United Nations as a
specialized agency to give exclusive attention to the eradication
of hunger and poverty.
</P>
<P>
The International Day for Eradication of Poverty, observed by
the U.N. on October 17 since 1993, provides an occasion for all
citizens of the world to join in solidarity with those most in
need.

<TEXT>
<P>

of China.
</P>
<P>
Liu made the remarks at the fair of foreign economic and
technological co-operation in the central and western regions,
which opened in Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan
Province, today.
</P>
<P>
Granting more foreign financial institutions access to Chinese
market should come in line with China's financial supervision
capacity, and further opening up the nation's financial industry
to the outside world means permission on the proper increase of
the number of foreign financial institutions launching business in
China, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that foreign financial institutions
had opened 178 operational establishments in China by June, and
the People's Bank of China has authorized Shanghai and Shenzhen to
experiment with business by foreign banks in renminbi (RMB),
China's currency.
</P>
<P>
"China will not depreciate RMB," Liu emphasized, adding that
China is able to adhere to the non-devaluation stance because of
the backing of its economic strength and managerial expertise.
</P>
<P>
China will encourage export and foreign investment to cope with
the fallout of the Southeast Asian economic crisis, he said, a
series of steps will be taken to improve the financial service
sector, strengthen cooperation between banks and trade sectors,
and provide more support for propping up the foreign trade
industry.

<HEADLINE> Bone Marrow Transplant Patient Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Guangfu, a sixth-grade
primary school pupil in Haikou, capital of the southern island
province of Hainan, recently died of rejection symptom following a
bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons who performed the complicated operation on September
16 attributed the boy's death to the acute rejection symptom
resulting from the bone marrow transplant and his extremely low
immunity level.
</P>
<P>
Zhu had been in a relatively stable condition before October
10, but after that he had been listed in critical condition with
high fever and chills.
</P>
<P>
Zhu had been suffering from leukemia for two years. As no
suitable marrow donor was found among his relatives, he awaited
surgery at Hainan People's Hospital until a teacher in Taiwan was
found with suitable marrow among the 300,000 volunteers at a
marrow-donation bank in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Zhu's case, there have been only four cases of
non-blood-relationship marrow transplants in the Chinese mainland
and two of them were successful.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmad said on Saturday that he and his Indian counterpart
K. Ragunath were endeavoring to bring about positive results from
the on-going talks.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters before entering into talks for the second
day, Shamshad said that substantive proposals pertaining to issues
of peace and security were exchanged in Friday's talks.
</P>
<P>
"But I cannot say at the moment if we can reach any agreement.
We are still in a process," he said. "We are endeavoring to bring
about a positive final statement on Sunday."
</P>
<P>
Shamshad and Ragunath Friday devoted their first day of talks
to the issues of peace and security which top the 8-point agenda
agreed by the two sides during their talks here last June.
</P>
<P>
The two senior diplomats would take up the contentious Kashmir
issue on Saturday for an exclusive discussion for the first time
in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally the two sides will reiterate each other's known
positions on the Kashmir dispute, however we are encouraged by the
vision of the two prime ministers," Shamshad said.
</P>
<P>
"For us, it is not only a vision but a mandate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee have recently agreed to revive the bilateral
high-level dialogue stalled last September as the leaders saw the
necessity for an environment for durable peace and peaceful
settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has rendered all the reconciliation efforts by
Islamabad and New Delhi fruitless because of the two sides'
seemingly uncompromising positions.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan insists that the core issue of Kashmir should be
resolved before any other agreements can be reached while India
favors first taking up commercial and trade issues, saying the
status of Kashmir is not negotiable.

<HEADLINE> Four-Step Outlines Half Done </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua)-- A decade ago a sports official
outlined the future of chess in China in a program which aim to
sweep all the four chess titles to its credit on a four-step
basis.
</P>
<P>
The idea was dismissed as a fat chance for Europe, the
traditional chess powerhouse, have kept an undisputedly firm grip
on chess titles for decades.
</P>
<P>
The potential challenge was ignored until the just-concluded
world chess Olympiade in Elista where four Chinese young women cri
 sply snapped the winning streak of the Europeans with their
first women's team title ever to their crown.
</P>
<P>
Led by Xie Jun, the double world champion, the team capped
their ten years' relentless efforts by cruising to the victory
through thirteen rounds of wit campaign with an unbeatable 29
total points advantage over the closest rivals.
</P>
<P>
Under the inspiration from the women's side, China's men team
also broke new grounds as they improved to their best fifth place
ever, a remarkable progress in the heavy competition in men's
field.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zude, who headed the delegation to the event, could not
calm himself when realising the outline he made has been half
finished.
</P>
<P>
"This ushered in a new beginning for chess, and it also marked
a significant milestone for the high-riding Chinese team who make
its debut in 1980."
</P>
<P>
Wang Jia, vice president of China's Chess Association, said
that the success lies chiefly with the unmatched high quality of
the chess players they fielded.
</P>
<P>
"First this is a well-disciplined and united squad, and they
all have higher education backgrounds. Thirdly they are also
well-balanced by their different styles and possessed tested
mental quality."
</P>
<P>
The outfit, aged 24 on average, displayed more cutting edge
than the chess power Georgia whose aged lineup was embarrassed
into the late stage of the thirteen round event when feeling hard
to concentrate on the game, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
"Young as they are, the Chinese team did not in the least fall
short of the expericence," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The lineup was all made up of grandmasters on international
level. Xie Jun was crowned with two-time world champion, Wang
Ping ever qualified for the world champion candidacy competition,
and the other two are also champions in world collegiate event or
junior champions.
</P>
<P>
Until now the first two steps of the outline -- the women's
individual title and the women's team title -- has come into
reality.
</P>
<P>
China chess reached its first milestone when Xie Jun claimed
the women's individual title in 1991 in the world women's chess
championshiop, becoming the first non-Europe champion in chess
history. The 28-year-old also retained her title in 1993.
</P>
<P>
What about the last two steps -- the men's team title and the
individual title?
</P>
<P>
Chen Zude, the straightspoken sport offical, appeared a little
cautious in shedding light on the future.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy for us Chinese, because chess has been part of
the western civilisation, the East has not failed to pose a
serious challenge to the dominance of the West."
</P>
<P>
But the 33rd Olympiade has unfolded a promising prospect for
the Chinese men, who proved their strength on a step-by-step
pursuit.
</P>
<P>
China went through to the fifth place in the men's field with
110 teams participating, although their world ranking points pla
ced only 35th.
</P>
<P>
They came away with a record of eight wins, three ties and two
losses in 13 matches, including the victory over the finally
fourth-placed Israel and two draws each with the runner-up United
States and third-placed Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Chen expressed his determination that men's team should do as
well as the women.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway men's chess is more significant,"said Chen. "We will
try although it is much harder."

250,000 signatures online among the Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Web site "moveon.org" was launched September 22 by a couple
in California, Joan Blades and Wes Boyd who are co-founders of the
software firm Berkeley Systems. It urges the U.S. Congress to
"immediately censure President Clinton and move on to pressing
issues facing the country."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the quarter million signatures in three weeks, the
site developers said that it is the largest "cyber-petition" in
history. "The polls are saying it, and so have a quarter million
of our signers -- it's time to move on," they said in the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
The site cost 89.50 U.S. dollars to start. Visitors to the site
were asked to give their names, e-mail address, Zip codes and, if
they wanted, a comment.
</P>
<P>
To advertise the site, the couple sent e-mail to about 80
friends and acquaintances, asking them to add their names and pass
on the information.
</P>
<P>
In the first 24 hours, the site had more than 500
responses. Two weeks later, more than 175,000 Americans signed.
</P>
<P>
The site developers hope to get one, two or three million
names. But observers say it is not clear that signatures gathered
over the Net are taken seriously in Washington.

<HEADLINE> NBA Owners, Players Make Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- NBA owners agreed Friday to
accept the union's concept of a luxury tax on some contracts to
see if such a system will slow salary growth.
</P>
<P>
This is a sign of progress in the lockout since July 1.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to try it the union's way, but they have to
agree that if it doesn't work, we then have to try it our way,
"deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
The league asked for a two-year trial, with higher tax rates
and a lower threshold than the union had proposed. A hard salary
cap would be taken in the 2000-21 season if the percentage of
league revenue devoted to salaries failed to drop from 57 percent
to 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It appears at a quick glance to be a step backward. More
onerous than the proposal we received from them on September 24,"
union director Billy Hunter said. "It may be disguised in terms
of a tax, but it is in fact a hard cap."
</P>
<P>
According to the league's projections, the tax would have no
impact on 85 percent of future player contracts.
</P>
<P>
The tax rate would be 50 percent of the amount over 2.6
million U.S. dollars for all contracts worth up to 10 million
dollars annually. For contracts worth between 10 million dollars
and 15 million dollars annually. For contracts worth between 10
million dollars and 15 million dollars, the tax would be 100
percent, between 15 million dollars and 20 million dollars, 150
percent, and for contracts worth more than 20 million dollars,
200 percent, Granik said.
</P>
<P>
There was no decision Friday from John Feerick on the issue of
whether players with guaranteed contracts must be paid during the
lockout.

<P>
SHANTOU, China, October 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Kim Taek
Soo humiliated reigning world champion Jan-Ove Waldner, joining
Zoran Primorac in the semi-finals of the World Cup table tennis
tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Kim, the ninth-ranked player whose dedication
and attitude is an example to all, rallied to beat the
33-year-old Swede, the only player who has won a "grand slam" of
the Olympic, World Championship and World Cup titles.
</P>
<P>
After losing the first bet 13-21, Kim, quick on his feet with
a powerful right-handed attacking game, came from 13-17 down to
snatch the second set 22-20.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean turned up the heat by taking the following
sets 21-19, 21-13.
</P>
<P>
"I changed service in the second set and it came troubles to
Waldner," Kim said after the match.
</P>
<P>
Defending World Cup champion Primorac of Croatia brought down
world No.1 ranked Samsonov of Belarus, making the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
It seemed Samsonov was not in form as Primorac blasted winner
after winner for a 9-21, 21-15, 21-15, 23-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
In the other quarter-final games, Chinese Liu Guoliang edged
out teammate Ma Lin 22-20, 21-16, 17-21, 14-21, 21-17, and
Germany's Jorg Rosskopf downed World No.2 Kong Linghui 21-12,

<HEADLINE> Stone Altar Found in Mysterious Underground Chamber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The door of a newly-discovered
underground chamber under an ancient Chinese tower was opened by
archeologists at noon today, revealing a small sariras-enshrining
chamber.
</P>
<P>
After the 1 meter-wide, 0.8 meter-high chamber door was opened,
a stone sariras-worshipping altar, a censer, and a stone tablet
came to light.
</P>
<P>
"We have never seen such a big sariras-worshiping alter," Han
Wei, a researcher with local cultural relic research institute
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The censer was put on top of the about 1 meter-long, 1.5
meter-wide sariras-worshiping alter. After reading characters on
the stone tablet, Han told reporters a sariras--a combination of
bone ashes of eminent Buddhist monks dating back about 1,400
years--may be worshiped inside the alter.
</P>
<P>
The chamber was discovered beneath the 1,400-year-old Fawang
Tower in the southern part of Zhouzhi County in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, a place 80 kilometers away from the provincial
capital of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
The 30-meter-high Fawang Tower was built in 601 by Yang Jian,
an emperor of the Sui Dynasty (581-618). He built 31 towers to
bury 31 sariras in 601. These sariras were called as "Renshou
sariras".
</P>
<P>
"This tower was the only one still preserved till today, and the
sariras inside the tower was one of the 'Renshou sariras'" said
Han.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists will open the stone box to let the sariras
presumed to be preserved inside the alter come to light. But
before that, a series of precaution steps must be taken to protect
the precious sariras from damages to be brought by exposures.
</P>
<P>
The local government decided to move the tower to make way for
the construction of a reservoir which is to bring relief to water
shortages in the provincial capital city. With the approval of the
State Council, the task began in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
Today's excavation was broadcast live by the China Central
Television (CCTV), the first time the CCTV live broadcasts
excavation process of an archeological finding.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Start Post-Flood Farming in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi farmers have started
farming in full swing after the recent severe flood under a
massive program taken up by the Department of Agricultural
Extension (DAE) to cultivate different kinds of winter crops and
vegetables on six million hectares of land in the country.
</P>
<P>
The irrigated rice cultivation target has been fixed at 3.05
million hectares, wheat cultivation program has been set at 0.85
hectares, while maize, potato, sweet potato and other crops will
be cultivated on the 1.8 million hectares, The New Nation
newspaper Saturday quoted an DAE source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a program has also been taken by the DAE to cultivate
winter vegetables on 0.3 million hectares of land with production
target of 4.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Necessary measures have been taken to give loans, supply high
yielding varieties of seeds, fertilizer, insecticides and other
necessary inputs to the farmers of the flood-affected districts
for the successful implementation of the scheme, he stated.
</P>
<P>
It needs 666 tons of seeds to implement the program, and the
Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation will supply
high-yielding-variety seeds to the growers while the Bangladesh
Krishi (agricultural) Bank would arrange cash loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sowing of seeks will commence from November and continue till
the end of December.
</P>
<P>
The recent ten-week-long devastating floods had destroyed crops
on 0.85 million hectares of land in the country's 52
severely-affected districts, causing a loss of about 40 billion
taka (about 851.1 million U.S. dollars), while farmers lost over
3.5 million tons of crops including 2 million tons of rice,
according the latest figures issued by the DAE.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Calls for Eradication of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) Saturday called on the international community to
take the eradication of poverty as a priority and adopt effective
measures to quicken the process.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP made the appearl on the International Day for the
Eradication of Poverty, which fell on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the UNDP said the combat against poverty
is an imperative issue that all countries and societies around the
world must face up to.
</P>
<P>
As the annual gross product of the whole world has reached up
to 25 trillion U.S. dollars, the spending of merely 1 percent of
it will be quite enough to eradicate poverty on a gradual basis,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the world today, there are still 2 billion
people who do not have aduquate food supplies, lack basis sanitary
facilities and live under poor conditions. Each year, about 12
million children died of curable diseases or from starvation.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that since the 1995 World Summit on
Social Development, little progress has been made in eradicating
poverty in developing countries while the gap between the rich and
poor has continued to widen.
</P>
<P>
In some regions such as those south of the Sahara desert in
Africa and the Caribbean region in Latin America, poverty-stricken
people, who make up one fifth of the total population, have seen
their income decline year by year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said economic growths in many poor developing
countries have slowed down over recent years as a result that they
have been plagued by the heavy burden of debts, that there has
been little direct foreign investment in them and that
insufficient development aid has been supplied to them.

<HEADLINE> Overweight Boy Receives Acupuncture Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- An 11 year-old boy who likes to
play football and marbles and is fond of swimming like any other
children had to drop out of the school earlier this year even
though his grades usually put him among the top three students.
</P>
<P>
The problem for young Deng Xuejian was that he is
overweight. Although he comes from a poor family, he weighs 174.25
kilograms, is 1.58 meters tall, and has a 1.54 meter waist.
</P>
<P>
Deng is now receiving acupuncture treatment at a local
fat-reduction center in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"The boy was too fat to open his eyes, or for others to see his
neck," says Shi Lidong, a doctor at the center, "and he could
hardly walk or breathe."
</P>
<P>
Since Deng entered the center for treatment, his weight has
dropped by 15 kilograms, but doctors still don't know the reason
for the boy's weight because everything else about him is normal.
</P>
<P>
Deng says he is not afraid of the acupuncture treatment and
says that he now feels much better, and wants to go back to school
after the treatment.
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture, the traditional Chinese therapy using needles to
stimulate certain points on the body that has been used since
ancient times, is being used to curb Deng's appetite.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, acupuncture has been widely accepted by people
in many other countries.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Urges Peace Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, reacting to
Friday's award of the Nobel Peace Prize, said the biggest prize
was the peace process itself.
</P>
<P>
"The big prize is the peace settlement, and that's the prize
for all of us to keep our eyes on," said Adams at a news
conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
"I am not disappointed, I'm pleased for John Hume, and I hope
David Trimble will accept the responsibilities which go along with
these recognitions," Adams, who is on a week-long tour of the
northeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Hume, 61, head of the main
Roman Catholic nationalist party in Northern Ireland, and Trimble,
54, leader of the biggest Protestant party that wants the province
to remain under British rule.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he hoped the recognition would serve as "a spur and
an incentive to those who may be reluctant or those who may be
hanging back and those who may be delaying and those who may be
undecided about the future."
</P>
<P>
He added that the "only question" about the peace process and
its timetable was coming from Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
"So it's entirely within Mr. Trimble's gift as a leader of his
party and as a signatory to the agreement to ensure that indeed
this is not premature but is simply the precursor to his joining
with the rest of us... and moving forward with all speed," Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Sinn Fein had made as large a contribution to the
peace agreement as had other parties in the process.
</P>
<P>
"I think I have worked as hard," Adams said, "We have all
worked hard. The recognition that Sinn Fein has worked as hard
comes from our having increased our vote in the last election."

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Swift OSCE Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy's acting foreign minister
Lamberto Dini Friday urged the swiftest possible deployment of
international observers in Kosovo to verify Yugoslavia's
compliance with agreed terms on ending the crisis there.
</P>
<P>
Reporting to the cabinet on Kosovo developments and Thursday's
meeting of the Contact Group, Dini highlighted the importance of
the mission from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), whose formal mandate was signed in Belgrade Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-strong OSCE team of observers is charged with
monitoring the withdrawal of Serb special forces and the return of
aid workers to the area, where thousands of displaced Kosovo
residents are facing a humanitarian disaster as a Balkan winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
Dini noted that the Italian government's development aid
department has already sent a mission to Belgrade and to the
Kosovo capital Pristina to see how to set up reception centers for
the refugees as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Dini also reiterated the need to continue pressing Yugoslav and
Kosovo leaders to start "serious and constructive" negotiations on
the future status of autonomy that will enable Kosovo residents to
govern themselves.
</P>
<P>
This status should be modeled on the proposal made by U.S.
Ambassador to Macedonia Christopher Hill, with the support of the
Contact Group, Dini said.
</P>
<P>
That proposal envisages a Kosovo parliament and government but
falls short of independence which Kosovo is still demanding.
</P>
<P>
Italy and others have been pressing for a compromise in which

<HEADLINE> D'Alema Asked to Lead Italy's New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro Friday asked Massimo D'Alema, the leader of the Left
Democrats, to try to form a new governing majority.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema, who leads the largest party in the center-left Olive
Tree alliance, accepted the mandate Friday evening after a
30-minute meeting with Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
If D'Alema succeeds, he will become the first former Communist
to head a government in Italy.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema told reporters after the meeting that he would proceed
with "great caution" in his attempt to form a "strong and stable"
government.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was "necessary to listen with great care" to
political forces in order to ascertain "the effective existence of
the majority required for a stable government."
</P>
<P>
During Scalfaro's round of political consultations on Thursday
and Friday, party leaders had shown a certain receptiveness to the
idea of his mandate, said D'Alema.
</P>
<P>
And the reactions of moderate Marxists and the centrist
Democratic Union for the Republic (UDR) had so far given him hope
of being able to draw together a majority, he added.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema vowed to resume the cause of constitutional reform,
especially electoral reform, which is vital for creating a more
stable system of government.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema, 49, also expressed his gratitude to Romano Prodi,
whose attempt to revive his government failed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's government fell after it lost the support of the
hard-line Communist Refoundation party over the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema also appealed to Communist Refoundation leader Fausto
Bertinotti to relent over the budget, saying the budget was a
"good one."

<HEADLINE> Mysterious Underground Chamber to Come to Light </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists are to open the
door of a newly-discovered underground chamber under an ancient
Chinese tower at 12:00 today,
</P>
<P>
The chamber was discovered beneath the 1,400-year-old Fawang
Tower in the southern part of Zhouzhi County in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, a place 70-80 kilometers away from the
provincial capital of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
After locating the door of the chamber on October 7,
archeologists and technicians worked hard, removing a huge heap of
rubble blocking it.
</P>
<P>
The 30-meter-high Fawang Tower was built in 601 by Yang Jian,
an emperor of the Sui Dynasty (581-618). It is believed to be the
oldest tower ever preserved in China, and the only tower left
built in the Sui Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
In order to make way for a local water project, the local
government decided to move the tower and the Xianyou Temple where
the tower is located. With the approval of the State Council, the
task began in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
An 11.9 cm-long, 7.6 cm-wide, 10.5 cm-high bronze coffin,
containing two bean-sized sariras -- a combination of bone ashes
of eminent Buddhist monks -- had already been found while working
on the second floor of the tower.
</P>
<P>
Today's excavation will be broadcast live by the China Central
Television (CCTV), the first time the CCTV live broadcasts
excavation process of an archeological finding.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Emphasizes Rural Legal Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Justice
yesterday called on its subordinate organs to provide high-quality
services for farmers, the "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry circular said local law firms, public notary
offices and other legal service organizations should pay attention
to the needs of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The circular was issued shortly after the Third Plenary Session
of the 15th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) early this week. The session highlighted the importance of
agriculture and rural work in China.
</P>
<P>
The circular said legal service organs should actively
participate in economic development in rural areas by helping with
extensions of terms for contracted land, by protecting the lawful
rights of township enterprises and by guiding farmers in
establishing various shareholding firms as well as assisting the
work of collective entities.
</P>
<P>
Local legal service providers are required to reduce the
burdens of farmers in keeping with related laws and protect
farmers from fake and poor-quality grain seed, fertilizers and
farm chemicals.
</P>
<P>
They should also play an important role in the establishment of
an open, uniform, competitive and orderly agricultural
market. These organs must take the initiative to aid local
organizations in the popularization of agricultural techniques by
drafting related popularization contracts and by strengthening the
protection of intellectual property rights covering such
techniques.
</P>
<P>
The circular emphasized that legal education in the
countryside, especially about the laws that have a direct impact
on rural life, such as the Law of Agriculture, the Anti-flood Law
and the Land Administration Law should be provided.
</P>
<P>
Among China's more than 1.2 billion people, some 900 million
are farmers.

<HEADLINE> Rural Mothers Get Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 39,000 mostly rural
women and their loved ones have new lives and new hope thanks to
the Program of Happiness in China.
</P>
<P>
The three-year-old anti-poverty program provides loans and
assistance to impoverished women and mothers in remote and
economically backward areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The program, co-founded in February 1995 by the China
Population Welfare Foundation, the China Family Planning
Association and the China Population News, has produced startling
results.
</P>
<P>
One of the examples is that Zhou Youcui, from southwest China's
Sichuan Province, got a 2,000 yuan (241 US dollars) low-interest
loan from the program, which enabled her to improve her life by
raising pigs and milk cows.
</P>
<P>
Formerly-indebted Zhou only had an annual income of less than
1,000 yuan (120 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zhou has finally shrugged off poverty thanks to the program.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that women account for 58 percent
of China's current impoverished population, which stands at 50
million-plus. They shoulder a heavy burden of production,
household chores and reproduction.
</P>
<P>
"These women's appalling living conditions, poor health and
limited educations have had a direct impact on their families and
the up-bringing of their children," said Wu Jiangchun, deputy
director o the program's organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, in addition to the women aided, 180,000 others
have benefited from the program's 60 million yuan (7.2 million US
dollars) investment in 24 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
The staff of the program is now working hard to achieve a goal,
by the end of this century, of helping 80,000 impoverished mothers
with the aid of more than 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars)
in funds.
</P>
<P>
The program has set up schools to educate poor mothers and to
offer them free medical treatment and regular health care
services.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday the program received 1.65 million yuan (198,700 US
dollars) in donations from home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Industrial Sector Cuts 47,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan industrial
sector cut 47,000 jobs from January to September of this year, as
a result of the economic recession the country is undergoing.
</P>
<P>
About 19,000 persons lost their jobs between July and
September, a 5.8 percent increase in unemployment, said a poll of
the industrial sector by the "Datanalisis" Firm.
</P>
<P>
Luis Henrique Ball, Venezuelan Industrialists Confederation
president, said the industrial sector was hit by a rise in the
interest rates and budget cuts, which although positive, have
produced a recessive effect.
</P>
<P>
The economic depression was also attributed to production
cutbacks. In that sense, 60 percent of the 380 firms polled said
their production volume declined in comparison with the same
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The drop in domestic demands, inflation, political uncertainty,
unfair competition and the rise in raw material costs are among
the factors that hit the sector during this quarter, said the
poll.

BUDAPEST, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Central and East European
football associations here on Friday voiced their strong protests
against the proposed breakaway superleague for the continent.
</P>
<P>
At a summit here attended by a number of senior UEFA officials
as well as soccer leaders from the region, the regional soccer
chiefs also expressed "total support for the position of UEFA".
</P>
<P>
Attila Kovacs, president of the Hungarian Football Federation
who are hosting the conference, spoke on behalf of his counterpa
rts that the superleague would see the rich get richer and the
poor get poorer while in the Champions' League everyone has a
chance to be involved.
</P>
<P>
UEFA president Lennart Johansson said the meeting of 23
football associations from the region had unanimously backed
UEFA's opposition to the superleague and supported UEFA's
expanded Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
Only two clubs from the region -- Yugoslavia's Crvena Zvezda
and Russia's Spartak Moscow -- are known to have been involved in
talks with Milan-based superleague backers Media Partners.
</P>
<P>
They have been warned by their national football associations
to expect no support if they joined the superleague.

<HEADLINE> Some 1,500 Bulgarians Commit Suicide Annually: Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Around 1,500 Bulgarians commit
suicide each year, Professor Kiril Milenkov said Friday while
presenting a national program for suicide prevention.
</P>
<P>
Suicide is most often motivated by unrequited love, but
recently suicides by bankrupt businessmen have been on the rise,
Milenkov said.
</P>
<P>
As a rule, the problems leading to suicide include unemployment,
harsh living conditions, personal and family problems, and
pressure from employers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that women are most prone to suicide in their
teens and over 60 while men are most at risk between 40 and 60 in
connection with their professional careers.
</P>
<P>
The national program is carried out as a pilot project in
Sofia, Plovdiv, Bourgas, Dobrich and Elin Pelin.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,537 suicide attempts recorded last year in the five
areas, 365 resulted in death, according to the project director,
Lilyana Tsoneva.
</P>
<P>
The program aims at reducing the number of suicide attempts and
building an information system to record all suicide cases.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province will make a
greater effort to reach this year's growth targets for foreign
trade and overseas investment, according to Vice-Governor Cai
Limin.
</P>
<P>
Hebei had 2.73 billion U.S. dollars worth of exports and
imports in the first nine months, up 3.2 percent from the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Actual overseas investment in Hebei edged down 1.2 percent on a
yearly basis to 1.02 billion U.S. dollars in the first nine
months. The negative growth rate is in sharp contrast to the
planned official annual increase of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although exports has maintained growth this year, the rate has
slowed down, Cai says, and import growth has been low.
</P>
<P>
To meet this year's targets, Hebei will increase its effort to
encourage the overseas-funded enterprises to export their products
and improve the overall investment environment, Cai says, and make
an effort to improve product quality to increase competitiveness
and to enter new markets in South America, Eastern Europe, Africa,
and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Hebei will also accelerate reforms at state-owned foreign trade
enterprises to improve their efficiency, he says.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Automobile sales in Panama
jumped 43 percent in the past 10 months this year over the same
period last year to reach 33,713 vehicles, a motor company
president said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The automobile industry had not been affected by the Asian
economic crisis, and on the contrary, there was a favorable
climate for the supply and the demand, which facilitated the
entrance of new trademarks and models into the world market,
Jorge de La Guardia said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase to a number of financing policies
used by the national distributors, which allowed consumers to buy
cars at the best prices and the lowest interests.
</P>
<P>
De La Guardia explained that the top sellers in the country
were Toyota, with 8,900 autos, Mitsubishi with 6,370, followed by
Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
He said that the International Auto Fair inaugurated Friday,
which draws the participation of 83 firms from 14 countries in the
world, and the exhibition of more than 50 trademarks and 150
models of motor vehicles, would promote the sale of units in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Float Multi-Billion-Dollar New Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Brazil is planning to float
bonds worth of five billion U.S. dollars to beef up the central
bank's reserves, the National Development Bank of Brazil announced
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bonds would be backed by the money produced by income from
privatization or state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, budget cuts could facilitate a financial rescue
package put together by the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
which the Brazilian financial circles expected to amount to some
30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this package is to help Brazil to defend its
currency against devaluation. The cruzeiro real is already
subjected to big speculative pressures in the market.
</P>
<P>
Under Brazilian law, the U.S. dollars obtained from the sale of
bonds must be deposited in the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian international reserves had dropped from 67 billion
U.S. dollars to only 45 billion in recent two months.

<HEADLINE> Mosquito Vector of Dengue Discovered in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A mosquito species, much
stronger than the species known today, has been identified by the
Costa Rican health authorities as one transmitting the endemic
diseases of dengue fever and malaria in the region.
</P>
<P>
Health authorities found larvae of "Aedes albopictus" in three
homes in the region of La Virgen de Sarapiqui in the Atlantic zone
of the country, Health Minister Rogelio Pardo told the local media
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The combat against this species, said Pardo, is more difficult,
because it not only lives in houses, but also survives easily in
forests. It adapts to almost any environment and it is therefore
more difficult to combat.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry has launched an intense campaign against
the mosquito species, instructing local residents to eliminate
water deposits in houses, yards and streets where the mosquito
lays eggs and where its larvae develops.
</P>
<P>
Dengue is a disease transmitted by the mosquito, that causes
high fever, headaches and body aches, and can be fetal if there is
a relapse.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Crvena Zvezda Belgrade will
compromised to UEFA's order to play their European tie in Romania
next week because of political tension over Kosovo, a club source
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zvezda said UEFA, European soccer's governing body, had
confirmed international matches scheduled for Yugoslavia must be
played on neutral territory in the present situation.
</P>
<P>
The club, formly known as Red Stars, would accept it and most
probably make no further appeals to UEFA as scheduled, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, UEFA ordered Zvezda to play next Tuesday's UEFA
Cup second-round first-leg tie against Olympique Lyon of France
in Bucharest because of the tensions over Yugoslavia's volatile
province of Kosovo.

LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Newcastle striker Stephane
Guivarc'h said on Friday he has been humiliated by new boss Ruud
Gullit and wants to leave St James' Park as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old, who has played just twice for Newcastle since
his 3.5 million pounds move from Auxerre in the summer, accused
the Dutchman of a lack of respect while his agent said Gullit had
"put a curse" on the World Cup-winning striker.
</P>
<P>
Guivarc'h said that he had been astonished when Gullit, who
replaced Kenny Dalglish as manager, had ordered him to train with
the reserves. "If he told me to do it again I would refuse. To
get me to train with the second team is not very classy behaviour
on his part," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The 0.25 percent reduction in
the interest rates announced Thursday by the U.S. Federal Reserve
is positive, Chilean Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a step in the right direction in relation to the
normalization of the international financial system," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that as has been pointed out by several economists,
"the world lives now in a scenario very different to the one of
1989 and 1997, and is approaching a scenario of very low
inflation, almost recessive, which must be avoided."
</P>
<P>
It is logical, he said, that in this scenario the interest
rates drop, as it occurred Thursday with the U.S. decision.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Chief: "Take it or leave it" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- European soccer governing body
UEFA president Lennart Johansson said in Budapest on Friday his
European soccer governing body was committed to its new-look
Champions' League and the continent's major clubs could "take it
or leave it".
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Friday, Johansson said UEFA was
willing to involve the elite clubs in talks but decisions
remained with the national football associations.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a statement on Wednesday by 12 of Europe's top
clubs seeking a greater role in the organisation and financial
affairs of the Champions' League, Johansson said: "all of a
sudden every club must have a say about everything. Sometimes it
is 16 clubs, then 12 clubs and then three clubs."
</P>
<P>
"They would like to be involved. I think they should be
involved and we will talk to them and we will explain what we can
do. But we have our concept and they have to take it or leave
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believed that UEFA's reformed European competition
structure would satisfy the financial demands of clubs
threatening to form a breakaway superleague, Johansson said that
decision would be taken by each member country not the elite
clubs.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied (with the reforms) and the majority of
countries in Europe are satisfied. They will take a decision on
November 24. They will confirm to us that this is the way to go.
We cannot be guided by 10 or 12 or 16 clubs, there are 26 million
football players in Europe and there are 51 countries."
</P>
<P>
But Johansson, in Budapest for a meeting with leaders of 22
central and east European football associations, said UEFA would
be willing to involve the big clubs more closely in decision
making.
</P>
<P>
"Being the ones who contribute so much financially, helping us
to show solidarity to all of Europe, if they want to be involved
and work together why not? This is the democratic way of working
which I fully accept."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, 12 of Europe's top clubs met in Milan to discuss
the latest developments in the superleague saga and issued a
joint statement through AC Milan.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed a UEFA announcement last week of reforms
to the European Champions' League, expanding the competition from
24 to 32 clubs next season when the UEFA and Cup Winners' Cups
will be merged.
</P>
<P>
The changes came in response to attempts by Milan-based Media
Partners to set up a 1.2 billion U.S. dollars superleague.

MADRID, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A proposal to reduce the number

country's soccer chiefs here on Friday.

<P>
A meeting of the Footballers' Association (AFA) and the

Spanish football chiefs agreed at a meeting last year to allow
six non-EU players in each premier league squad.

The AFA and the RFEF had wanted that figure reduced to four

OTTAWA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Friday that it
will extend 1.8 million Canadian dollars (1.17 million U.S.
dollars) in humanitarian aid to Russia and Ukraine this winter.
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of the rouble has driven up the prices for food,
beating fuel, clothing and transportation, bringing hardship to
hundreds of thousands of people in Russia and Ukraine," said
International Cooperation Minister Diane Marleau in a release.
</P>
<P>
"The financial crisis coupled with recent crop failures means
people will face severe food shortages this winter. Canada's
support will help respond to some of their basic needs," added the
Canadian Minister.
</P>
<P>
The aid, to be extended through the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA), will be managed by the International
Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies over the
next six months. The aid will be distributed in cooperation with
the Red Cross societies in Russia and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> "Indonesia Spectacular" Program Launched to Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- An ambitious program dubbed as
the "Indonesia Spectacular" was launched by President B.J. Habibie
in a ceremony at the State Palace here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The five-month long program aims to restore the image of
Indonesia as a tourist destination, as well as to attract more
foreign tourists to come to the country.
</P>
<P>
Habibie stressed in his speech that violent mass riots and
lootings were things of the past.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is extensive. Not all regions in the country are
hit by riots and disturbances and such information should be
disseminated abroad," the president was quoted by national
newspapers Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Habibie welcomed the presence of foreign tour operators and
travel writers.
</P>
<P>
"Their presence here will enable them to witness the
development of the country. They can converse with the people and
go to tourist destinations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current economic difficulties faced by
businessmen, the president called on them to turn their attention
to the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
The program was initiated by the Association of Indonesian
Travel Agencies (ASITA) in close cooperation with the national
flag carrier Garuda and 30 foreign airlines. It will also involve
400 tour operators and travel writers from across the globe.
</P>
<P>
ASITA's action plan includes an invitation to tour operators
and travel writers from around the world to travel to all corners
of the archipelago free of air charge to see, by themselves, the
beauty and safety of the country, ASITA Chairman Muljono
Herlambang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Marzuki
Usman, the program was part of the "Let's Go Indonesia" campaign
launched sometime ago.
</P>
<P>
Tourism was Indonesia's third largest foreign exchange earner
last year after the oil and gas as well as textile and garments
sectors, bringing in 6.6 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier projected overseas tourist arrivals this
year to total between 5.6 million and 6.5 million, but the
country's calamities have forced the target to be revised to 4.6
million, or a 10 percent decline from 5.1 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government had expressed hopes tourism could become the
country's largest foreign exchange earner in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Hearts Lose Second Appeal to UEFA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Scotland club Hearts lost their
second appeal against the non-regulation dimensions of the Real
Mallorca goalposts when UEFA dismissed their case in Geneva on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tynecastle chief executive Chris Robinson was joined by legal
representatives in front of the European soccer governing body as
he offered new evidence on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA again rejected Hearts' pleas to be reinstated into
the Cup Winners' Cup because of the club's failure to submit
their protest in writing ahead of kick-off.
</P>
<P>
The dispute about the dimensions of the goalposts provided a
controversial background to the game.
</P>
<P>
On the night, club chairman Leslie Deans lodged a protest
after it was discovered that there was a 10cm difference in
height between the posts because of problems with the playing
surface at the Luis Sitjar Stadium.
</P>
<P>
But UEFA observer at the Cup Winners' Cup first round tie gave
the go-ahead for the match to start following consultations with
referee Hermann Albrecht and officials from both clubs.
</P>
<P>
Jim Hamilton scored a second half goal to salvage a draw on
the night but it was little consolation to the Scottish Cup
holders and Hearts went out 2-1 on aggregate.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India will take
up the contentious Kashmir issue on Saturday for an exclusive
discussion for the first time in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad and his Indian
counterpart K. Ragunath will devote the second day of their
on-going talks to the Kashmir dispute which has been a flash-point
between the two countries since their independence.
</P>
<P>
Sovereignty over the Kashmir, about twice the size of Virginia,
was left unresolved when the Indian Subcontinent was divided into
India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The two South Asian neighbors have already fought three wars,
two of which were over Kashmir, in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
And the territorial dispute over the Himalayan state has
rendered all the reconciliation efforts by Islamabad and New Delhi
fruitless because of the two sides' seemingly uncompromising
positions.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan insists that the core issue of Kashmir should be
resolved before any other agreements can be reached while India
favors first taking up commercial and trade issues, saying the
status of Kashmir is not negotiable.

<HEADLINE> Germany's SPD, Greens Agree on Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens party
have apparently cleared a major hurdle in forming a center-left
coalition government in Bonn after agreeing on a common foreign
policy program on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a new round of coalition talks with the Greens on
Friday, Guenter Verheugen, a SPD expert of foreign affairs, said
that the SPD-Greens program would guarantee continuity and
reliability of German foreign and security policy.
</P>
<P>
As a major policy shift, Greens officials indicated on Friday
that the future German government would not make it a priority to
press for a permanent seat for Germany in the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Instead Bonn would try first to seek "a European solution",
said Ludger Volmer, the Greens expert on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Eager to enter government for the first time since its founding
in 1979, the Greens has apparently refrained from asserting its
radical foreign policy demands like a call for an unilateral
German withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO).
</P>
<P>
Negotiators of the two parties said that a SPD-Greens
government would not rule out Germany's participation in
international peacekeeping missions in the future provided that
such moves are approved by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The pacifist Greens has so far categorically rejected any
deployment of German troops abroad.
</P>
<P>
The SPD and Greens on Friday also agreed to seek a strengthened
role for the United Nations and the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in preventing and solving regional
conflicts like the recent one in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
They also pledged that Germany would spend more on development
aid for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The SPD-Greens foreign policy program still views the NATO as
indispensable for peace in Europe. It also says that the United
States will remain the most important partner for Germany outside
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The SPD and Greens are planning to wind up their coalition
talks by Monday. If a comprehensive deal could be reached, the new
government is expected to be sworn in by the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Woods Survives in Sudden Death Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Tiger Woods had lady luck on
his side as he scraped past Welshman Ian Woosnam to reach the
semi-finals of the Cisco World Match Play at Wentworth, England
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Woosnam - a late stand-in for Bernhard Langer, who was himself
a replacement for Stewart Cink - was two up with three to play in
their 36-hole battle but putting frailties cost him a famous
victory.
</P>
<P>
He three-putted the 16th and then squandered a match-winning
chance from four feet on the final green.
</P>
<P>
The pair went back to the 1st as the match went into sudden
death and Woosnam pulled his drive into the left-hand rough. He
could not reach the green in two and after conceding a par-four
to Woods, he missed from eight feet and the match was over.
</P>
<P>
Woosnam had led by three after only eight holes of the morning
session, but Woods won the 10th and 12th to be only one behind at
lunch.
</P>
<P>
The match was all square when Woosnam ran up a double bogey
six at the 21st and Woods went in front for the first time when
he chipped in for an eagle at the next.
</P>

But it looked like his debut in the event would be short-lived
when Woosnam won three out of four holes from the 27th but he
could not close out the match.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Build New Generation of Military Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of
Defense on Friday announced that it will build the nation's next
generation of military rockets that will also help put satellites
in space at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force on Friday awarded contracts worth 3.03
billion U.S. dollars to Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp. to
carry out the program, the Pentagon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Boeing, which assembles launchers in
Huntington Beach, Calif., will conduct 19 launches and Lockheed
Martin, whose main rocket plant is in Denver, will have nine, the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The program is dubbed the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle,
and it will replace the nation's current fleet of medium- and
heavy-lift military launch systems, the Delta, Atlas and Titan,
with two modular families of launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The modular systems will be used in different combinations to
carry satellites into orbit at less cost than current launchers.
They will also be used in missions for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration and commercial users, as well as the
military, the Associated Press said, citing military officials.
</P>
<P>
The program was also designed to maintain competition in the
space launch arena, reduce risk and provide assured access to
space for government and commercial payloads, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The new systems would save five billion dollars to 10 billion
dollars over the life of the program.
</P>
<P>
The government payloads -- about a half-dozen of them
classified and presumably spy satellites -- will be put in space
between fiscal 2002 and 2006. The other launches involved global
positioning and communication satellites among others, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
During 1999 to 2002, the two companies will complete the
development of their launch vehicles, and construct and activate
the launch sites at Cape Canaveral Air Station, Florida, and
Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuses Republicans of Partisanship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Friday accused Republicans of "pure old-fashioned partisanship"
in killing everything from anti-smoking legislation to health-care
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also expressed concern about a low voter turnout in
mid-term elections. The election will be decided not only by which
side has the better argument but also "who shows up," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
A day after reaching a budget deal with Republicans, the
president staged a White House rally with three dozen members of
Congress and then flew to Chicago to campaign for Carol
Moseley-Braun, the first black woman elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Mosely-Braun made a passing reference to the impeachment threat
hanging over Clinton when she said Republicans "should leave this
man alone and let him do his job." The audience applauded loudly,
the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, both at the White House and in Chicago, said Congress,
in its rush to leave town, had accomplished major achievements
with legislation to hire 100,000 new teachers, help farmers,
protect the environment and reserve budget surpluses for Social
Security remedies rather than election-year tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that in "eight months of partisanship, too
many dreams of too many families were deferred." He said that
"partisanship killed" the patients' bill of rights for Health
Maintenance Organization (HMO) reforms and legislation to build or
modernize schools, to increase the minimum wage and to overhaul
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
And he said that "partisanship killed the comprehensive
anti-tobacco legislation which would have saved millions of young
Americans from painful and premature death.... This was about
whether we were going to take appropriate action to save our
children, and pure, old-fashioned partisanship killed it."
</P>
<P>
Republicans responded to Clinton's criticism. House Ways and
Means Committee chairman Bill Archer said, "President Clinton
should stop pretending he saved the surplus for Social Security.
The president compounds his credibility problem with this Congress
and the American people when he says he hasn't spent the surplus."

<HEADLINE> Millennium Bug Summit Calls for Global Dialogue, Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The world's leading
international organizations and trade associations Friday
concluded a two-day Global Year 2000 Summit by calling for more
dialogue and action on the Millennium Bug on a global basis.
</P>
<P>
Despite the growing international awareness of the Year 2000
challenge, the problem continues to be underestimated and the
threat to world economies is very serious, said a statement issued
by the conference.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the interdependencies inherent in a global economy,
the statement stressed that "national preparedness is not enough",
and said a more sustained international dialogue and cooperation
on the issue is needed.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the statement called for focusing on
international contingency planning, encouraging global leadership,
raising global public awareness and promoting a cross-sectoral
dialogue. Continued assistance for developing countries was also
urged by the conference.
</P>
<P>
"While a few developing countries have aggressively addressed
Year 2000, most are just now waking up to the problem." the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Global Year 2000 Summit was the first time major
multilateral governmental and business organizations met together
to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
Participants included the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), World Bank, International Chamber of
Commerce and International Telecommunications Users Group.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 problem, or so-called Millennium Bug, stems from
early programmer's need to save computer memory when writing
software. Without conversion, many existing systems will not
recognize 00 as 2000 but as 1990 or invalid date.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report from the OECD, Year 2000 problem
may arise not only in computer systems, but also in communication
networks and in chips intergrated into industrial control systems,
consumer electronic devices and safety systems worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the overall global costs of repairing systems and
devices in anticipation of the Millennium Bug run into hundreds of
billions of U.S. dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But experts warned at the Summit that current world financial
turmoil and the introduction of Euro, the European single
currency, may reinforce the importance of the Year 2000 challenge.
</P>
<P>
The current uncertain economic situations "create a difficult
backdrop for keeping the appropriate level of focus on long-term
challenges, such as the Year 2000 problem," said Roger Ferguson,
chairman of the Joint Year 2000 Council, established by the Bank
for International Settlements (BIS).
</P>
<P>
The introduction of Euro will also raise challenges for Year
2000 preparations, he told the conference.

<HEADLINE> Judiciary Committee Aides, White House Lawyers to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- White House lawyers and
House of Representatives Judiciary Committee aides conducting an
impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Bill Clinton are
scheduled to meet for the first time on Wednesday, a committee
spokeswoman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Participants are expected to focus on logistics such as
Clinton's rights and guidelines established the House earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
Republican committee spokesman Paul McNulty has said Republican
investigators will invite the White House to offer up any material
that could help Clinton's case. But a White House official said
there were no plans so far to discuss the substance of the charges
against the president.
</P>
<P>
White House Counsel Charles Ruff, legal adviser Gregory Craig
and Clinton's private attorney David Kendall, are expected to
attend on the president's behalf, The Associated Press quoted an
anonymous White House official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chief Republican investigator David Schippers and Thomas
Mooney, the committee's chief of staff and general counsel, will
represent the panel's Republicans, said spokeswoman Michelle
Morgan. Attending for the Democrats will be chief investigator
Abbe Lowell and general counsel Julian Epstein.
</P>
<P>
No committee members would attend, Morgan said.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Milosevic Not Complies Fully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Friday that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has not yet
fully complied with the U.N. demands and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) should remain ready to act.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin made the remarks at a
regular briefing in response to questions on NATO's decision to
postpone its activation order, which expires on Saturday, for
another ten days.
</P>
<P>
"Our view of the decision they should make is that there has
not yet been full compliance by Milosevic with the requirements of
the international community, and therefore, we believe NATO's gun
should remain cocked," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
"The exact nature of that extension I think will be up to NATO
authorities to describe, but generically speaking, what we're
talking about is continuing to provide General (Willy) Clark the
authority to use force by a later date now, to extend the time
frame, if there is not compliance by President Milosevic," he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin said that reports have indicated that Milosevic
is complying with NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
"There are reports, reliable reports from our monitors, that a
significant number of internally displaced persons, the people up
in the hills, are returning to their homes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Rubin also admitted that Yugoslav military forces
and police units are "no longer in the field."
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslav military forces and police units -- our assessment is
that about half of those that were in Kosovo are no longer in the
field, which means either they're in barracks or they're out of
Kosovo," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"There are significant signs of police units having moved, and
clearly, as I indicated, the police presence is diminished," he added.
</P>
<P>
Monitors have reported that a Yugoslav military armored brigade
departed from its location where it was deployed just a month ago,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a military police has also departed its recent
location.
