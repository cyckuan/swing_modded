<HEADLINE> Agrotechnique Helps Feed 64 Million Poor Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 64.6 million people in
China's poor rural areas are no longer threatened by hunger,
thanks to a state-sponsored agricultural technique promotion
project that has been in use for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The technique, which boosts maize yield by using hybrid seeds
and plastic sheets, was used on 3.626 million hectares of farmland
in poor regions in 16 provinces including Sichuan, Hubei, Yunnan,
Gansu, Guizhou and Shaanxi -- 54 percent more than the planned
figure.
</P>
<P>
Each hectare of farmland that uses the seed/plastic method can
harvest 2,505 kg more maize, enough to feed an additional 15
people.
</P>
<P>
Working jointly to promote the technique are the State Planning
Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance,
China Agricultural Technology Promotion Center, and the Leading
Group for Economic Development of impoverished Areas under the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
China has 65 million people who still live below the poverty
level. They mainly inhabit the mountain or plateau areas in the
west and central regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the China Agricultural Technology Promotion
Center said that popularizing this technique is one important way
for these people to overcome poverty during the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000).

<HEADLINE> Greece Tries Hard to Bid for 2004 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Losing out to Atlanta in the bid to
host this year's centenary Olympic Games has not dampened Athens'
conviction that it is worthy of staging a modern Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
The Athens Organising Committee for the Bid said today that
Athens is making every effort to bid for the 2004 Olympics but
with a approach markedly unlike that which has characterised
Athens' efforts in the past.
</P>
<P>
This bid, according to organising committee president Yianna
Angelopoulou-Daskalaki, is totally different.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we are basing our efforts on our infrastructure projects,
which are among the best in the world, and on the fact that Athens
is being transformed, slowly, into a modern city.
</P>
<P>
"Work on the Athens metro has already begun, as has work on the
new international airport at Spata, two very important projects
which will be ready in 2004 and are necessary for a city that
aspires to host the greatest athletics event in the world."
</P>
<P>
Athens is competing for the first Olympic Games of the new
millennium whith Rome, Stockholm, Seville, Istanbul, the French
city of Lille and St.Petersbur. The candidacies of Cape Town and
Rio de Janeiro are considered to lead the field as neither Africa
nor Latin America have ever hosted an Olympics before.
</P>
<P>
The final touches are being put to the Athens bid now before it
is submitted to the IOC in August. an OOC delegation will visit
the city in October before the IOC decides on a shortlist of
candidates in February next year. The final decision is expected
in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government fully supports in every way Athens'
attempt to host the 2004 Olympics. This is a national effort which
requires the mobilization of all of us, " said sports
undersecretary Andreas Fouras.
</P>
<P>
Angelopoulou-Daskalaki said she was "cautiously optimistic"
about the result.
</P>
<P>
"The philosophy behind the bid this time is different and on
the facilities side we are ready, " she said. "Athens has
abandoned the prevailing Greek position that our contry was the
one that gave birth to the Olympics and therefore has a given
right to host a modern Olympiad. We have to be reliable and to
show that we are professionals," the president added.

<P>
HANGZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Three days of torrential rain has
caused severe flooding in east China's Zhejiang Province,
destroying more than 50,000 houses and inundating 130,000 hectares
of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The heavy rains started early on June 30 and continued until
the evening of July 3, pouring down 300 millimeters of rain on
5,000 square kilometers of land in northern Zhejiang, official
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The rains have boosted the local rivers and reservoirs to
record-high levels, and caused floods that have victimized 1.2
million people.

People's Liberation Army soldiers and armed policemen have been
sent to the flood-stricken areas to aid in rescues, and to bring
fresh water, food and medicine to the flood victims.

<HEADLINE> 617 Die of Traffic Accidents in May in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents killed 617 people
in France in May this year, 45 fewer than those in the same month
last year, said Highway Security in a communique today.
</P>
<P>
For 10 months running, the number of casualties in traffic
accidents has been declining in France after the government
announced the lowering of the level of tolerance of alcohol in
blood to 0.5 grams per liter.
</P>
<P>
The Highway Security said that the number of people killed in
traffic accidents from June 1995 to May 1996 in France stood at
8,135, the lowest since 1956.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the number of people who died in traffic accidents in
France totaled 8,412.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the number of traffic accidents stood at
9,637, which was 1,903 fewer than that in May 1995. Altogether
13,165 people were injured in traffic accidents in May.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Orders Release of Jailed Islamic Activists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today ordered the release of
hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad activists jailed in the
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the release of the activists was conducted
"on condition that Palestinian security is not harmed."
</P>
<P>
Over 700 Islamic militant activists have been jailed by the
PNA security forces in a widespread crackdown launched after a
spate of terrorist suicide bombings killed 58 people inside
Israel from late February to early March.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two leading Islamic militant
groups that oppose the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, claimed
responsibility for the suicide attacks.
</P>
<P>
Under Israel's pressure, Arafat ordered Palestinian security
forces to crack down the Islamic militant suspects by raiding
mosques, homes and Islamic institutions.
</P>
<P>
Hamas and Islamic Jihad strongly denounced the PNA's
crackdown, justifying their militant activities in Israel as a
form of resistance against Israeli occupation of Palestinian
lands.
</P>
<P>
Israel has imposed a crippling closure on the Palestinian
self-rule areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip since the start of
the suicide attacks, inflicting severe hardship on the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Pressure on Arafat to release the jailed Islamic activists by
the Palestinian public has increased because of the continued
closure and the election victory by Israeli hardline Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who promised to deliver secure peace to Israeli
people, has conditioned the progress of Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks on what he called PNA's fulfilment of its commitments to
fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Arafat today approved the family of
Yahya Ayyash, Hamas' chief bomb-maker killed by Israeli agents in
January, to rebuild its West Bank home which was destroyed by
Israeli security forces after the February terrorist attacks.

<HEADLINE> Urban Construction Should be Scientific, Li Ruihuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Senior Chinese official Li Ruihuan
today urged city planners to attach great importance to urban
development to ensure it stands the test of time.
</P>
<P>
Visiting an exhibition of the progress achieved in urban
construction, Li, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Committee, said that economic growth in the past
decade and more has changed the appearance of many Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
China's cities currently are investing heavily in urban
construction, which eventually will turn architectural blueprints
into reality.
</P>
<P>
"Yet urban development also faces challenges: if it is not
properly handled, the outlook of the city will be affected, thus
causing great losses," said Li, also a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that city officials should not change the city's plans
on a whim, because these guidelines are created by experts and
approved by the local people's congresses and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
If plans need to be changed, proper procedures should be
followed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of cities should learn from the other countries their
useful experiences in urban construction, and not merely repeat
what the other countries have done," Li said.

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet hosted by Kazak President Nursultan
Nazarbayev tonight, Jiang said China will work together with
Kazakhstan to develop equal, mutually-beneficial and friendly
relations on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence
and to seek common prosperity.

He said that over the past four years, the friendly,
good-neighborly, mutually-beneficial and cooperative relationship
between China and Kazakhstan has enjoyed healthy development, and
bilateral exchanges and cooperation in all fields produced positive
results.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people admire kazakhstan's progress in stabilizing
political situation, reviving economy, improving national unity and
advacing social development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The central Asian republic actively participated in international
affairs and played a positive role in promoting regional peace,
stability and cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said Jiang's first state visit is full of sincerity and
trust, which will help enhance the friendship and cooperation between
the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we can regard China as a reliable and strong neighbor with
which we can open dialogue on equal footing, develop long-term
partnership and solve all problems with ease," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We not only have common borders, but also are focusing efforts
on the common objectives of prosperity and progress," he said,
adding that Kazakhstan is attentive to China reform and would
study the experiences in economic restructuring while maintaining
domestic political stability.
</P>
<P>
"We can work together to solve a lot of problems, including
reviving and developing the 'Silk Road,' which connects not only our
two economies, but also the hearts of our peoples who love and trust
each other, Nazarbayev said.

During the visit, Jiang is expected to have an in-depth exchange of

LUANDA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- US Ambassador to Angola Donald
Steinberg said here today that the ties between the two
countries are now at "the best stage" since they established
diplomatic relations in l993.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that the establishment of
diplomatic relations between the two countries has opened doors
for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the instability in the southern African
country has hindered the development of the friendly relations
between the United States and Angola in recent years.
</P>
<P>
There was a turn for the better last December when Angolan
President Eduardo dos Santos paid a visit to the United States
and held talks with US President Bill Clinton, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade relations are good, he said, adding that
Angola is now the third largest trade partner and the second
largest investment country of the United States in the sub-Sahara
region. enditem

<HEADLINE> Sihanouk Thanks Prime Ministers for Pardoning Editor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk
today thanked the country's Co-Prime Ministers for agreeing to a
royal pardon for an opposition newspaper editor jailed last week
for defaming them.
</P>
<P>
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen Tuesday accepted the king's proposal to release
Chan Ratana, editor of the Khmer-language Voice of Khmer Youth
newspaper who was jailed on Friday for one year and fined five
million riels (2,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chan was sued by the two prime ministers in February last year
after his paper, which supports the opposition Khmer Nation Party,
ran a cartoon and story entitled "Ranariddh is more stupid than
Hun Sen three times a day."
</P>
<P>
He was jailed on Friday after the Supreme Court rejected his
appeal last October against the municipal court ruling in February
1995 which sentenced him to a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, the king is entitled to grant anyone an
amnesty, but he put forward his proposal in a letter to the prime
ministers, saying he wanted their support before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
He said that while there was no doubt Chan Rattana had
committed a "clear and serious" offence, he should be pardoned.
</P>
<P>
Both co-prime ministers agreed and the king expressed his
thanks in a letter released by the palace, but dated from Beijing,
where he is undergoing medical treatment.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Issues "Order" for Okinawa on U.S. Base Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today ordered Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota to renew a
lease on land in a U.S. military base, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The order is the latest stage in a running confrontation
between the governor and the central government over his refusal
to force Okinawan landowners to renew leases with the state for
property used by U.S. military facilities.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto mailed a document "ordering" Ota to comply with the
government's request, after the governor refused his original
request and ensuing "recommendation," Kyodo quoted government
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ota, explaining his reasons for refusing, has previously said
that the return of the Futemma air base agreed by both the
U.S. and Japanese governments and its transfer to other locations
within Okinawa are "far from the satisfaction of the Okinawa
people."
</P>
<P>
If Ota refuses Tokyo's "order", as is likely, Hashimoto will
have to file a lawsuit forcing Ota to comply with the request.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo is asking Okinawa to publicize a government paper
pertaining to a plot of land inside the U.S. Navy's Sobe
communications facility in the village of Yomitan.
</P>
<P>
The forced lease for the land expired at the end of March, and
the central government wants to renew the contract to keep the
land for use by the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The time consuming procedures the central government is taking
against the governor are based on the nation's Local Autonomy Law.
</P>
<P>
Posting of the official "order" paper is necessary before Tokyo
can obtain approval from a local land expropriation committee to
renew the lease.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, an island in southern Japan, has a heavy concentration
of U.S. military bases. Relations between the prefecture and the
U.S. have been strained since the rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl
by three U.S. servicemen last year.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked angry protest against the U.S. military
presence on the island and Ota has spearheaded a drive to cut down
on the American presence.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Arrives in Kyrgyzstan on State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived here today on a two-day state visit to Kyrgyzstan, the
first visit to the central Asian republic by a Chinese head of
state.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement distributed at the airport, Jiang said
the main purpose of his visit to the "friendly neighbor" is to
explore ways to further develop friendly and good-neighborly
relations on a strategic basis into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China and Kyrgyzstan are linked by common mountains and rivers,
and their friendly, good-neighborly, mutually-beneficial and
cooperative relationship has enjoyed sound and steady development
since 1992, when the two countries established diplomatic ties,
said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is expected to exchange views with Kyrgyz President Askar
Akayevich Akayev and other leaders of Kyrgyzstan on bilateral
relations and international issues of common concern as well as
signing a number of documents.
</P>
<P>
"It is my belief that this visit will help to deepen our mutual
understanding, trust and friendship, and bring friendly relations
and cooperation between China and Kyrgyzstan to a new level,"
Jiang stated.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president flew to Bishkek, the fifth leg of his
six-nation tour of Europe and central Asia, after successfully
winding up his state visit to Uzbekistan, which was preceded by
visits to Spain, Norway and Romania.

<HEADLINE> S. African Minister Calls on Businessmen to Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade and Industry Minister
Alec Erwin today called on South African businessmen to stop
complaining and concentrate instead on the country's economic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Addressing clothing and textile sector representatives at a
conference in Durban, Erwin said international traders remained
optimistic about South Africa's prospects, though this sentiment
was not always shared by their South African counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Erwin, who recently met European business leaders, said it was
time for South Africans to rise to the country's economic
challenges.
</P>
<P>
''In South Africa we have a tendency to whinge and talk some
blatant nonsense. To whinge earns you a disrespect,'' said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that foreign investors knew South Africa had
problems, but their view of the country's potential for success
was ''sometimes far better''.
</P>
<P>
Fundamental changes in international trade would necessitate a
more flexible and dynamic approach among South African business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
To this regard, Erwin said other countries' ability to rapidly
translate new technology into advanced production was possibly
the greatest challenge to ''protectionist'' attitudes in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
He further highlighted the need to play a constructive role in
developing the southern African region or risk ''harsh
consequences''.
</P>
<P>
''If South Africa plays a constructive role, we will get a
staggering good will and support from whithin the region, if not,
we will be treated very harshly,'' he added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Okinawa to Hold Referendum on U.S. Bases in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan's southernmost island
prefecture Okinawa will hold a referendum on September 8 to ask
local residents whether they support a reduction in U.S. bases on
the island, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa governor Masahide Ota, who revealed the referendum date
during a prefectural assembly session, said it would be an
opportunity for every Okinawa resident to be informed of the
situation in the prefecture and to think about its future.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa is eager to hold the referendum before regular defense
talks between Japan and the United States in late September, which
will take up the base issue.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of all land used by the U.S. military in Japan
is located in Okinawa, although the island prefecture makes up
only 0.6 percent of Japan's land area.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached in April between Tokyo and
Washington, the U.S. military will vacate some 20 percent of the
land it now occupies in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. bases became the most heated topic in Okinawa after three
U.S. soldiers raped a school girl on the island in early September
last year, arousing great public anger. Local residents are
demanding that U.S. troops leave the island.

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan to Hold Talks on Semi-Conductors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Europe and Japan are to hold a
further round of talks in Tokyo on a global deal on computer chips
after "encouraging" progress at last week's G-7 summit in France.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the talks will be to narrow and, if possible,
eliminate any remaining divergences in the European and Japanese
approaches to future international cooperation on market access in
the semi-conductor industry," an EC spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Japan will hold separate negotiations with the United States
the following day on the future of its bilateral semi-conductor
agreement which expires at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. wants to renew the agreement it signed with Japan in
1991 which guaranteed U.S. chip manufacturers at least 20 percent
of the Japanese market. The U.S. claims it needs some kind of
framework to ensure foreign growth in the Japanese semiconductor
market.
</P>
<P>
But Japan says the market is now open to foreign players and
opposes a bilateral accord with the U.S., preferring to go for a
global computer chip deal.
</P>
<P>
It has been backed by the European Union which supports a
trilateral or multilateral arrangement for the industry.
</P>
<P>
The EC has also said it is also consulting with the U.S. on a
trilateral arrangement.

<HEADLINE> Buthelezi Denies IFP Withdrawal From Govt This </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP)
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today dismissed speculation that his
party would withdraw from the African National Congress-led
government of national unity at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Johannesburg, Buthelezi said the IFP
meeting scheduled for this weekend in Ulundi of Kwazulu/Natal was
a continuation of the one on June 15, where members had been
unable to get through a long agenda.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said: ''I stated that it is possible that the issue
may arise if someone raises it, but that the only decision-making
body which can decide the issue of when we leave the GNU was the
annual general conference.''
</P>
<P>
''This remains the position,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
The IFP's annual general conference is scheduled to take place
at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
IFP General Secretary Ziba Jiyane said on Wednesday that there
was a ''fifty-fifty'' chance that the party would withdraw from
the government.
</P>
<P>
Jiyane said the IFP would look at ''what is going right and
what is going wrong'' before taking a decision.
</P>
<P>
The IFP is now the only participant of the government after
the withdrawal of the Nnational Party on June 30. enditem

ATLANTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne
on Wednesday had a talk through the telephone link-up with
American and Russian astronauts 15,000 miles away, with their
topics centering on the upcoming Games and the Olympic torch relay.
</P>
<P>
These astronauts are the seven crew members of the U.S. space
shuttle Columbia and the three crew members of the Russian space
station Mir, including American astronaut Shannon Lucid, who has
been in space for 103 days by Wednesday.
</P>

Sunday, the same day the Columbia is scheduled to land at the Cape.
</P>
<P>
"Events such as the Games and joint space missions foster the
international spirit of peace and cooperation," Payne said through
the link-up, hailed as part of the high-tech demonstration in the

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Russia Agreed on Black Sea Naval Base Lease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Russia have finally agreed
on the expiry date of Russian Black Sea Fleet's lease of the
Sevastopol naval base, a senior Ukrainian official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Gorbulin, secretary of Ukraine's National Security
Council, told the media that both he and Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's aide, Dmitry Ryurikov, have agreed that the Russian navy
could build its own base in the Black Sea under the lease whose
duration is 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement is good for Ukraine because it takes into
account Ukrainian interests.
</P>
<P>
After the approval of Ukraine's new constitution June 28,
Yeltsin sent Ryurikov to Kiev to discuss with Ukrainian officials
rules governing foreign troop presence in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Gorbulin remarked though that the new constitution does not
rule out the possibility that the Russian navy may use the
Sevastopol base on a 20-year lease.
</P>
<P>
The Black Sea Fleet issue is believed to be a headache for both
Russia and Ukraine after the latter's independence from Russia.
The setting of an expiry date of the lease will help them finally
resolve the issue.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Launch More Than 10 Hughes Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the Hughes Electronics
Corp. Group have agreed to launch more than 10 satellites next
century for the latter by using a remodeled version of Japan's
H-II rocket, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A contract will be signed next month between Rocket Systems
Corp., a Japanese rocket consortium, and Hughes Space and
Communications International, a newspaper quoted Japanese space
industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The contract, the first for using a Japanese rocket to launch
foreign satellites, will also be the first foreign commercial
launching contract for the H-II rocket since it made its first
successful flight in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
The latest deal will signal Japan's entry into the fiercely
competitive business of commercial satellite launching, a market
where the U.S., European, Russian and Chinese companies vie with
each other for about 30 launches a year, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Rocket Systems will use a remodeled version of
the H-II, called the H-IIA, to launch more than 10 satellites
scheduled to be made by Hughes between 2000 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese rocket consortium is involved with 73 local
aerospace firms, nonlife insurance companies and banks. The H-II
rocket is the first major launching platform developed entirely in
Japan and the only rocket in the country capable for launching a
2-ton satellite into stationary orbit. So far, three H-II rockets
have been successfully launched.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has allocated 25 million
U.S. dollars for refugees residing in Iran, according to a U.N.
official here today.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR representative Peter Bertrand said 50 percent of the
money would be spent on repatriating Afghan refugees in Iran.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated Iranian contribution to building 50 schools and
refugee camps to provide accommodation and education for Afghan
and Iraqi refugees living in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has extended valuable health service and family
planning service to 5,000 women refugees living in refugee
townships.

<P>
Bertrand arrived at the Caspian town of Ramsar to attend a
seminar on studying the health and medical requirements of the
foreigners taking refuge in Iran.

According to a report, an Iranian official from the Interior

The official said there were 2.5 million refugees in Iran, each
costing Iran two dollars per day.
</P>
<P>
He called on international organizations to increase their aid

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Britain's Opposition Unveils Blueprint To </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Opposition leader Tony
Blair today formally launched his bid for power at the next
election, saying he would create a "genuinely one-nation society"
with "new vision and new direction."
</P>
<P>
Unveiling his long-awaited "Road to the Manifesto" document --
Labor's election blueprint -- Blair told voters that they were
offered a choice between "hope and fear" at the next election.
</P>
<P>
The Labor government would give ordinary British people "a
square, fair deal" if they elected him prime minister, Blair said.
People would feel how everyday lives would be changed by Labor
without bringing higher tax bills, he added.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto's main pledges are:
</P>
<P>
-- Cutting National Health Service (NHS) waiting lists by
100,000 by releasing cash from the NHS red tape,
</P>
<P>
-- Slashing primary school classes to below 30 pupils,
</P>
<P>
-- A job creation scheme for the young unemployed funded by a
windfall tax,
</P>
<P>
-- Fast track punishment for persistent young offenders, and
</P>
<P>
-- Ensuring sound finances by holding down public spending.
</P>
<P>
The document also makes emphasis on defense and foreign
affairs, pledging to have strong defense and leadership for
Britain and retain the European Union (EU) veto on key issues, EU
reform and a more effective UN.
</P>
<P>
On Northern Ireland affairs, the manifesto said, Labor will
stick to the commitment to reconciliation between conflicted
communities and unity of Irish people.
</P>
<P>
It is believed today's 36-page guide document is the most
detailed program ever put out by an opposition party so far ahead
of an election.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Conservative Party attacked Labor's "Road to the
Manifesto" as "the road to ruin."
</P>
<P>
Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said voters should
not believe Labor's economic pledges designed to remove its old
image as a high-tax, high-spending party.
</P>
<P>
"The unmistakable fact is that to deliver on any of these
promises, Labor would have to raise taxes, put up borrowing, or
do both," the finance minister said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Labor's manifesto, the Independent newspaper
wrote in its editorial entitled "Steady, Tony, it could still fall
apart:" "The Labor leader bears his policy document like an
anxious curator with a priceless vase. But on slippery ground, he
is right to be cautious."

NICOSIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The people of Cyprus place their
hope in the United States for realizing the principles of freedom
and justice for their divided island, Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory message to President Bill Clinton on the
occasion of the anniversary of the U.S. Independence Day,
President Clerides noted that "the declaration of independence of
the U.S. marked a new beginning in world history signaling the
birth of freedom, justice and human rights throughout the
world."
</P>
<P>
He said that "two hundred and twenty years later all humanity
in its search for world peace is still guided by the spirit of
these principles."
</P>
<P>
"The people of Cyprus, who for 22 years are striving to
reunite their country, today place their hopes in the U.S.A. and
especially to your personal involvement for the realization of
the same principles which will culminate in a just settlement of
the Cyprus question based on the United Nations resolutions and
the principles of international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president reiterated his government's readiness for
the further enhancement of the relations of friendship and
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides paid an official visit to the United states
last month and held talks with Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized the northern third of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Zairean Deputy Prime Minister
Kititua Ntuoiansi today appealed for a speedy repatriation of
over one million Rwandan refugees in his country, calling the
refugee situation "explosive".
</P>
<P>
"It is simply beyond our capacity to manage them any more. We
are calling for their speedy repatriation," said Ntuoiansi in an
interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier who doubles as Foreign Minister, is in the
Cameroonian capital of Yaounde to attend the ongoing Council of
Ministers meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"They (meaning refugees) destroyed schools, villages and
towns, and caused lots of border trouble for our country. With
their presence, we even cannot hold smooth general elections," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"We earnestly appeal for the OAU, United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the international community to
take effective steps to relieve Zaire's refugees burden," said
Ntuoiansi.
</P>
<P>
Zaire, with its largest share of refugees burden in Africa,
now hosts 1.6 million African refugees in its territory,
including over one million Rwandans, mostly the majority Hutus
who fled for fear of revenge after the 1994 killings of up to a
million Tutsis and moderate Hutus at home.

ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Massoud Barzani, leader of the
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), has sent letters to the heads
of state of Turkey, the United States, France, Germany and
Britain, asking them to restrict Turkish military operations in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency today quoted a KDP radio
report as saying that Barzani demanded that the military
operations be used in a limited framework.
</P>
<P>
Safin Dizayee, KDP Representative in Ankara, said that they
had given this message to the Turkish Foreign Ministry and they
might be presenting the letter to President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The KDP Ankara office said in a written statement that since
early April there have been aerial operations and military
incursions into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It said: "These operations are done under the pretext of the
pursuit of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) and targeting
suspected camps."
</P>
<P>
"Sadly in many such operations civilian settlements have fallen
victim to these unnecessary raids," it added. "If such
indiscriminate attacks continue, it will further encourage people
to abandon their homes and create a real vacuum which can only be
an advantage for the PKK."
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year guerrilla war for
self-rule in southeastern Turkey and the PKK rebels have been
penetrating from their camps in northern Iraq for attacking
civilian and military targets in Turkey.

NICOSIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
succeeded in withdrawing a stolen ancient relic from an auction in
London.
</P>
<P>
According to a police announcement here today, a delegation
from Cyprus Criminal Investigation Department (CID) went to London
following a report that an ancient item stolen from Cyprus
will be auctioned in London.
</P>
<P>
Together with the metropolitan police, the CID officials
managed to avert the sale of the east Greek Geometric Skyphos
of the late 8th century B.C., believed to have been stolen
from a private collection in the Turkish-occupied area of
Famagusta, in the eastern part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The auctioneers, who told Cyprus last week they were ready to
off help if there was proof concerning the stolen item, decided
to withdraw the stolen antiquity from today's sale.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, investigations are continuing to
locate the seller of the Skyphos.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a number of antiquities, including
Byzantine icons, were located at auctions or private collections
throughout the world, following the Turkish invasion in 1974,
which led to the division of the island.
</P>
<P>
The government and the church of Cyprus have managed to
secure the return of a number of items belonging to the
island's 9,000-year-old cultural heritage.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 358 Mln Dlr EFF Credit for Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved a three-year credit for Peru in an amount of
about 358 million U.S. dollars equivalent under the extended Fund
faciltiy (EFF).
</P>
<P>
The credit is provided to support the Peruvian government's
1996-98 medium-term economic and reform program. About 215 million
dollars equivalent will be available for disbursement during the
first year of the credit.
</P>
<P>
Peru's medium-term strategy aims at consolidating the gains
achieved during 1993-95 by lowering inflation to industrial nation
level by the end of the program period; by creating conditions for
sustained real output growth, which will rise to at least 6
percent by 1998 from 3 to 4.5 percent in 1996; and by
consolidating progress toward external viability by reducing the
external current account deficit to below 5 percent of GDP in 1998
from 7.2 percent of GDP in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The program for 1996 is targeted at containing inflation at 9.5
to 11.5 percent and at narrowing the external current account
deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP. Real GDP growth is expected to be 3
to 4.5 percent this year and the overall deficit of the combined
public sector will be halved to 1.3 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Peru joined the IMF in December 1945. Its quota is about 672
million dollars equivalent and its outstanding use of IMF credit
currently totals about 926 million dollars.

<P>
NICOSIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today welcomed the
forthcoming visit by U.S. presidential Emissary for Cyprus Richard
Beattie and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright,
viewing it as an indication of increased American interest in the
Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said that the visit will give the chance
to Albright "to be informed about the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Cyprus government expects to be briefed
on the U.S. Undersecretary of State Peter Tarnoff's recent
contacts in Athens with the Greek government.
</P>
<P>
However, Cassoulides noted that Cyprus does not consider
visits to this region by high ranking American officials as an
indication that the U.S. sees the Cyprus question as part of the
Greek-Turkish disputes.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides made the statement ahead of the scheduled visit to
Cyprus by Beattie and Albright in mid July.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the proximity talks between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriot sides to prepare the ground for direct
negotiations "should be confidential if they are to succeed."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the Turkish side would agree to
confidentiality but acknowledged that the matter has not been
discussed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community's peace efforts over the
past 22 years have not succeeded in bringing the two sides on the
island closer to an agreement to settle the protracted Cyprus
problem.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Advised to Develop Human </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- African states have been advised
to make concerted efforts in promoting human capital particularly
among women, in order to realize better productivity and
sustainable rural development.
</P>
<P>
This was said by resident representative of the U. N.
Development Program (UNDP) in Uganda Babatunde Thomas yesterday
when opening the 4-week post graduates course on human rights of
women in Mukono, about 30 km east of Kampala, reported Radio
Uganda today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Thomas said gender disparities cut across
employment and income level of Africa where women represent only
14 percent of employees in administrative and management
positions while only 10 percent are members of parliament and
only 6 percent in cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
The course is in response to the increasing need for an
academic forum to address issues of inequality and violence and
provide information to women leaders on their rights under the
existing international standards according to the U.N. legal
instrument.
</P>
<P>
The course is aimed at increasing awareness of women's legal
literacy in respect of policy in order to eliminate gender bias.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian PM on Foreign Exchange Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
said today the Ethiopian Government Bank, the National Bank and
private banks will gradually be authorized to buy and sell
foreign currencies in free market.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the House of People's Representatives, Meles said
the procedure that obliges traders engaged in export trade to
transfer wholly the foreign exchange they obtain to the National
Bank has had a negative impact on the export trade.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian premier was quoted by the Ethiopian News Agency
as saying that the procedure will gradually be lifted in three
years' time beginning next September.
</P>
<P>
A new procedure will be adopted after two months to allow the
traders to retain ten percent of the foreign exchange they earn
for themselves and sell the remaining for any bank they choose in
three weeks time, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meles said the foreign exchange auction held fortnightly by
the National Bank will be conducted every week, adding the
auction will gradually stop with the consolidation of the foreign
exchange transaction of both government and private banks.
</P>
<P>
He further said the foreign exchange rate is expected to
stabilize when citizens are allowed to buy from banks any amount
of foreign currency they need for education, health and
miscellaneous expenses in their stay abroad.
</P>
<P>
He added that since a 7.7 percent economic growth rate has
been registered this Ethiopian year (ending on July 7, 1996) and
the inflation rate is lower, the prices of fuel, medicines and
fertilizers will be determined by the world and local markets in
the coming three years.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A French international
airliner, CORSAIR, today inaugurated its direct flight services
from Paris, France to the Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA)
in northern Tanzanian.
</P>
<P>
The French airliner, which operates to 54 destinations around
the world, made the maiden flight with its jumbo jet 300-747
Boeing, which landed at KIA at 7:50 a.m. this morning.
</P>
<P>
The flight with 591 passengers, out of which 100 were French
tourists, was accorded the warm welcome by hundreds of workers of
the KIA plus Tanganyika Wildlife Safari tour officials.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here from Arusha, CORSAIR
General Manager Bernard Asacher told reporters at the airport
immediately after arrival that his airliner replaced Air France,
which stopped its services to KIA last April due to economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Asacher said for a start CORSAIR would have one flight every
Thursday and plans are underway to increase its flight services
to the country by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The CORSAIR chief said the flights would facilitate exports of
flowers to Europe and boost tourism in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister for Natural Resources and Tourism Juma
Ngasongwa appealed to other international air lines to emulate
CORSAIR by establishing direct flights from Europe to KIA as
their gate way to tourist destination in Tanzania and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> 6,500 Burundi Refugees Fled to Zaire, Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 6,500 refugees have fled to
Zaire and Rwanda since last weekend due to ethnic clashes in the
Cibitoke region in northwest Burundi, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said today.
</P>
<P>
The clashes have also left many houses burnt down and about
22,000 people homeless. Water supplies have been destroyed
and the lack of water has led to outbreaks of disease.
</P>
<P>
Food, medicine, blankets and water are urgently needed, UNHCR
spokesperson Ron Redmond quoted officials of the Burundian
Ministry of Defense as saying.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said that the Burundian government has asked his agency
to help the people in Cibitoke, and UNHCR is considering
sending a fact-finding mission to the area in the next few days
when security conditions allow.
</P>
<P>
There has been no international presence in the Cibitoke region
since three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross
were killed in an ambush on June 4.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said about 500 Burundian refugees from a total of 2,500
in Bujarama, southwest Rwanda, had returned to Cibitoke in the
last two days. UNHCR is continuing talks with Rwandan
authorities to move the rest of the Burundi refugees to safer
places away from the border.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,500 refugees from Burundi have arrived In Uvira,
eastern Zaire, since last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Redmond said there were unconfirmed reports of massacres.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Says Fredericks is No Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- American sprinter Michael Johnson,
who is attempting to become the first man to win the 200 and 400
meters at one Olympic Games, said his Namibian rival Frank
Fredericks could hardly challenge him or American runners in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks, 200 meters runner-up in the Barcelona Games four
years ago, will square off with Johnson in an international meet
in Oslo on Friday, and fans are considering it an Olympic preview.
</P>
<P>
Johnson begged to disagree.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not (considering so)," said Johnson. "A lot can happen
between now and the Olympic 200 meters final on August 1. For me,
this is just another race before the Games. I am using it to work
on some things, to stay sharp and to keep focused."
</P>
<P>
"I understand the interest," he said. "I am coming off a world
record in the 200 (19.66 seconds) at the U.S. trials. Frankie has
run the two fastest 100 times of the year, 9:86 and 9:87, just off
the world record of 9:85.
</P>
<P>
"Frankie has not run many 200s this year. He's run 19:95, but
three others -- myself, also Ato Boldon and Mike Marsh -- have
gone under 19.9. Impressive 100 times don't always transfer to the
200.
</P>
<P>
"If I have to, I'm ready to run 19.6 or 19.7. I don't think
Frankie is ready to run those times."
</P>
<P>
Fredericks said earlier that he was not sure what he was going
to run in Atlanta, either the 100/200 double or just the 200.
</P>
<P>
Johnson thought Federicks would do double.
</P>
<P>
"Frankie will run both the 100 and 200," Johnson said. "He'd be
fool not to. He's got to run the 100; he's almost broken the world
record twice. Then he has three days of rest before starting the 200.
So he's got to run the 200."
</P>
<P>
Johnson added that he still wanted to win although the outcome
of Friday's 200 would not determine the Olympic 200 champion.

BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Scientific research on China's
military must be strengthened, and the work should focus on
improving quality of the armed forces, Vice-Chairman of the
Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing said today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Such research should only be strengthened, not be weakened,"
Liu stressed at the fourth national meeting on military research.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, research into the military should
focus on major practical issues concerning the army's organization
and combat capability, such as the establishment of army units,
military strategies and the management of troops.
</P>
<P>
"Research should produce high-quality results that can serve as
reference for the military decision-making bodies, as theory for
guiding our army in field work, and as textbooks for military
institutions," said Liu, who is also a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the advances in military scientific
research affect the quality of China's army, especially in light
of the present international situation and achievements in modern

<HEADLINE> ICRC Appeals for 9 Mln Swiss Francs for Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) launched today an appeal for more than 9 million
Swiss francs (about 7.5 million U.S. dollars) to cover the growing
needs of the victims of the conflict in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said this sum reflects the magnitude of the tragedy
affecting tens of thousands of people caught up in the hostilities
between government troops and opposition forces, which resumed
with growing intensity in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC, opposition forces in Tajikistan have now
succeeded in extending their control over the area which separates
the semi-autonomous province of Gorno-Badakhshan from the rest of
the country, thereby cutting off many villages from the outside.
</P>
<P>
As a result, close to 15,000 destitute people seeking food and
safety have fled this region, which covers Tavildara, the Mionadu
valley and part of the Garm valley, since the beginning of the
year. Some 5,000 additional people have left the Mionadu valley
across the mountains in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Some displaced people told ICRC local delegates that the
situation in the Mionadu valley, which used to have a population
of 25,000, is rapidly deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, the ICRC intends to bring in relief supplies
for about 40,000 people. This will enable it to provide assistance
to newly displaced people and to help as soon as possible those
who are trapped in areas to which ICRC delegates have not yet had
access.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of any worsening of the situation, emergency
rations to feed 50,000 people for two months will be stocked in
the capital city of Dushanbe. Additional surgical supplies and
medicines will also be distributed to meet the growing health
needs brought on by a collapsing economy and four years of
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Deepened Reform of State Enterprises Called For </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo has
called for the speedier reform of the state-owned enterprises in
order to improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection of north China's Henan Province from June
28 to July 5, Wu, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, visited factories,
mines and other industrial enterprises, a hi-tech zone, and
scientific research institutes, and listened to a report from the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the growing number of enterprises that have
suspended production are causing significant financial losses, and
therefore represent a major problem for the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
The businesses shut down because of inflexible business
practices, an unbalanced product mix and deep-rooted management
problems, which deserve the attention of authorities at all
levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu called on local officials to be aware of the factors that
will be beneficial to state enterprise reform. State-owned
enterprises are at the heart of the national economy, and they
have been invigorated after more than a decade of reform, he added.
</P>
<P>
The State Council formulated measures this year to promote
state enterprise reform, which has spread from the original 18
pilot cities to 50, he said. Also, he added, banks are helping
enterprises merge or declare bankruptcy, and a system for loss
reduction and profit increase is in place.
</P>
<P>
The success of the reform depends mainly on the progress of
supporting reforms, such as the separation of the government
functions from those of enterprises, acceleration of the
establishment of social security system, and the solution to the
overburdens of enterprises, Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Urges Russia to Resume Bilateral Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine today urged Russia to resume
bilateral negotiations on a series of controversial issues, talks
which had been put on hold by the Russian presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said on Wednesday
that he was satisfied with the result of the second round of the
election and Ukraine's policy of backing incumbent president Boris
Yeltsin had proved correct.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin won the election with 54 percent of the vote, beating
his political rival Gennady Zyuganov by 13 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said it's the time for the two countries to take
active measures to settle the controversial issues between them,
notably the Black Sea Fleet issue.
</P>
<P>
A solution acceptable to both sides should be found through
joint efforts, Udovenko stressed.
</P>
<P>
Most of the differences between Ukraine and Russia over the
division of the fleet, a legacy left over from the former Soviet
Union, have been settled.
</P>
<P>
But there is still the unresolved question of whether the
Russian navy will be allowed to use the military port of
Sevastopol, inside Ukrainian territory.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Ukraine said it may lease the port to the
Russian navy, but the two sides have never reached agreement on
the time limit and rent of the lease.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to sign an agreement of friendship,
cooperation and partnership, expected three years ago, due to the
above disputes.

ATLANTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The American men's Olympic
basketball squad, the Dream Team III, will take its Olympic show
on the road this weekend with two exhibition matches.
</P>
<P>
"Things have gone just about like we expected," said coach
Lenny Wilkens in Chicago. "The guys are ready to start playing
games."
</P>
<P>
The Dream Team will take on the American under-22 All-Stars
team Saturday at the Palace of Auburn Hill, Michigan, and then
meet the Brazilian Olympic team in Cleveland's Gund Areana.
</P>
<P>
Wilkens hasn't decided on a starting lineup but did say
Detroit's Grant Hill would start Saturday since the game is on the
Pistons' home court.
</P>
<P>
"With a team like we have, the starting lineup is meaningless,"
Wilkens said. "People are just preoccupied with it. These guys are
all competitive and will perform in any role we use them."

new Afghan cabinet, which had been scheduled for Thursday evening,
was put off for an indefinite period, said a report reaching here

<HEADLINE> Ninety Percent of Chinese Workers Sign Labor Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Nearly nine out of ten Chinese
workers have signed labor contracts with their employers, China's
Labor Minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of a national conference on
implementing the Labor Law, Li Boyong said some 95.66 million
people were employed by enterprises that has implemented the labor
contract system by the end of last May, which accounted for 88.7
percent of enterprises employees nationwide.
</P>
<P>
It marks the beginning that permanent employment is no longer
secured and distribution is based on contribution, said the
minister. "And the establishment and adjustment of labor relations
have been channeled onto legal tracks."
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1994, China set the goal of establishing
preliminarily a labor contract system nationwide by the end of
1996. Li expected the goal to be accomplished with view to the
progress that has been made in this field.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that state-owned enterprises have made
remarkable progress in implementing the labor contract system,
which is stipulated by the Labor Law, while it is quite difficult
to implement the system in rural enterprises and private
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Labor departments will focus on supervising and speeding up the
establishment of the labor contract system in rural enterprises
and private businesses in the latter half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Li Boyong noted that increased management of labor contracts is
the first step in implementation of the labor contract system, so
as to urge employers and employees to defend their own legal
rights and interests by using labor contracts and to maintain a
harmonious labor relations between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
China conducted a nationwide check-up on the employment system
of the overseas-funded and private businesses from April to June,
and will examine public-owned enterprises, rural enterprises and
small private businesses in urban areas, in an effort to ensure
the establishment and effective implementation of the labor
contract system.

<HEADLINE> Measures Urged To Control Prices of Chemical Fertilizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Immediate measures should be taken
to eliminate the chaos in the country's production and supply of
chemical fertilizer, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Problems surrounding the country's fertilizer supply have
resulted in high prices that are causing farmers to complain, said
State Councilor Chen Junsheng during a tele-conference on the
country's major farm-use materials held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China had an adequate chemical fertilizer supply for this
year's spring planting, but Chinese farmers cannot afford the high
price of fertilizer, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The adequate and cost-efficient supply of chemical fertilizer
is linked to the development of China's agriculture and the
stability of rural areas, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He called on fertilizer producers and government administrators
to take firm measures that will guarantee the sufficient supply
and reasonable price of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a chemical fertilizer reserve system be
established to control prices of chemical fertilizer, and that
tougher measures be taken to protect the interests of Chinese
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Plastics Industry to Grow by 8.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's plastics industry
is expected to grow by 8.3 percent in 1996, Minister of
International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a speech by the minister, the country's plastics
industry had recorded double-digit growth rates from 1991 to 1995,
averaging at 13.4 percent per annum.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah's speech was read by the ministry's parliament
secretary Hishamuddin Tun Hussein at the Malaysian Plastic
Manufacturers' Association tonight.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the plastics industry recorded an estimated turnover
of about five billion Malaysian ringgit (about two billion US
dollars), an increase of 19 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This increase has been mainly attributed to the increased
demand by domestic companies," the speech read.
</P>
<P>
The country's exports of plastic products also went up by 23
percent in 1995, reaching 1.35 billion ringgit (about 540 million
dollars) against 1.1 billion ringgit (about 440 million dollars)
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafidah urged plastic manufacturers to make efforts to
widen their markets. She said Malaysian companies should not look
only at the domestic market, noting that the Malaysian plastics
industry has gained only a very small portion of the market of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Malaysia's intra-ASEAN trade in 1995
amounted to 84 billion ringgit (about 33.6 billion US dollars),
constituting about 25 percent of the intra-ASEAN trade.

diplomatic ties in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of diplomatic relations ushered in a new
historical era in the traditional friendship between our two
peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Kazakh leaders all attach great importance to
enhancing the traditional friendship between the two countries,
Jiang said, citing several meetings between him and Kazakh
President Nursultan Nazarbayev in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have reached broad agreement on bilateral
relations and a wide-range of major international issues, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
Such agreement has been written into their common political
documents and thus laid a firm political and legal basis for a
stable and growing bilateral relationship, he added.
</P>
<P>
With concerted efforts, Jiang said, the Sino-Kazakh friendly
cooperation in the politics, economy, science, technology and
culture has proceeded smoothly and yielded satisfactory results.
</P>
<P>
On the Sino-Kazakh border, Jiang said China and Kazakhstan have
signed and ratified their border agreement and are about to
conduct a boundary survey and put up boundary markers.
</P>
<P>
He praised the five-nation border agreement signed in the
Chinese port city of Shanghai in April 1996 by China on the one
hand, and Russia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and Tajikistan on the
other.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the accord and positive progress in their
border disarmament talks, Jiang said, "we have turned our boundary
into one of peace, tranquillity, friendship and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic accomplishment that we have made together
and one that will have a far-reaching impact throughout the Asian
continent," he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges Moscow to be Flexible Over Territorial Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of Russia's presidential
election, Japan today urged Moscow to be more flexible on a
long-standing territorial dispute over four islands and said it
would activate bilateral talks on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda told a press conference that
Tokyo wants to start bilateral talks on the four Russian-held
islands off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
The islands -- Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai
group of islets -- were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
Japan has since demanded the return of the islands as a
prerequisite to the conclusion of a bilateral peace treaty.
Moscow has so far flatly rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda also said Japan hopes political and economic reforms
will continue with President Boris Yeltsin's re-election.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's emphatic victory in Wednesday's run-off election over
his political rival Gennady Zyuganov shows that Russian people
support Yeltsin's reform-oriented policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin won 54 percent of the votes, beating Zyuganov by 13
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto to Have Routine Medical Check-up in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto is
scheduled to leave here for Europe Sunday for a routine medical
check-up, Minster/State Secretary Moerdiono announced today,
following mounting speculations about the president's health.
</P>
<P>
The 75-year-old head of state "will go abroad with the main aim
of undergoing a medical check-up," Moerdiono told journalists
here, but he declined to specify which country it would be.
</P>
<P>
He said the president was advised to go abroad by his doctors
after a regular check-up on June 26.
</P>
<P>
The doctors advised further check-ups using "more sophisticated
equipment than those available in the country."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, sources close to ministers said that the president
would go for treatment in Germany, possibly in the city of
Frankfurt, for his health problems.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said check-ups in foreign countries were "something
normal" as many officials do so.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was hospitalized briefly in August 1994 when he was
found to have a stone in the left urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
His urinary problems dated back to 1982 when he underwent an
operation at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah dropped against the US dollar
in trading in Singapore today as Jakarta confirmed that the
president was traveling to Europe for a medical check-up.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was changing hands at 2,344-2,346 rupiah this
afternoon from an opening quote of 2,335 in Singapore, Asia's
leading trading center for regional currencies, dealers said.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature to Inspect How Labor Law Enforced Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The country's top legislative body
will conduct a large-scale campaign to inspect the enforcement of
the Labor Law, a senior Chinese legislator said today -- the
second anniversary of the enactment of the law.
</P>
<P>
Inspection tours to be held through the end of this year will
cover about half of the provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities in the country, said Ni Zhifu, vice-chairman of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Ni, who will personally conduct the tours, was speaking today
at a national conference on the implementation of the Labor Law in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The inspection is expected to correct the problems of neglect
of the law, lax law enforcement and insufficient punishment for
illegal activities," Ni said. "It also should educate the public,
as well officials and judicial officers, about the law, and
enhance their awareness of the necessity to abide by the law and
protect their interests by it."
</P>
<P>
Other officials at this conference said that the Labor Law has
been applauded by both employers and employees since it was
initiated on July 5, 1994, and went into effect in early
1995. Their approval of the legislation has helped to protect the
rights and interests of workers and promote the reform of
state-owned enterprises, which creates and maintains harmonious
labor relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the daily lives of some employees are affected by the
difficulties of the state-owned enterprises they work for, as some
managers regard the protection of their employees' rights and
interests as an obstacle to financial profit.
</P>
<P>
Some enterprises, especially those that are foreign-funded and
private, are experiencing more labor disputes with their
employees, whose legitimate rights and interests are occasionally
threatened, according to officials.
</P>
<P>
To tackle those problems, the Labor Ministry, the State
Commission of Economy and Trade, and the All-China Federation of
Trade Unions demanded that localities take effective measures to
implement the Labor Law in an all-round and correct way.

<HEADLINE> Firearms Control Law Adopted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's first Firearms Control Law
was approved at the 20th meeting of the 8th National People's
Congress Standing Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
The law takes effect October 1 to strengthen overall firearm
controls, "and to provide an important legal weapon for the
national police force," said a senior official with the Ministry
of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
The official said that cases involving firearms have risen
rapidly in recent years, and illicit dealing in firearms is also
rampant in certain parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ministry statistics show that police have confiscated a total
of 560,000 guns, 1,200 of them military weapons, since the
nationwide anti-crime campaign started on April 28.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Regulations of the People's Republic
of China on Firearms Control, approved in 1981, have helped a lot
over the past several years, but cannot adapt readily to the
increasing number of firearms-related crimes in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Firearms Control Law, stipulates clearly, for the first
time, that the Ministry of Public Security is to be in charge of
firearms control, with the exception of firearms for the military,
armed police, and the militia.
</P>
<P>
The new law reduces the number of personnel allowed to have
firearms, increases controls on the manufacturing, marketing, and
purchase of firearms to prevent the flow of firearms to society
illegally.
</P>
<P>
The official says that the national police are to continue to
confiscate illicit firearms, register firearms owned by
individuals, and control factories which produce and sell
firearms.

<HEADLINE> China to Work for Early Conclusion of Nuclear Treaty: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to join other
countries in working for the conclusion within this year a "fair,
reasonable and verifiable" nuclear test ban treaty "with universal
adherence and unlimited duration," Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Kazakh parliament, Jiang, who arrived here
Thursday afternoon for a three-day visit to the Central Asian
country, said "China always stands for complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons and endorses a
comprehensive nuclear test ban in the process towards this
objective."
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that China's declaration in June of a moratorium
on peaceful nuclear explosions from the coming September "is not
only a response to the legitimate demand of the vast number of
non-nuclear-weapon states, but also a move to quicken the
conclusion of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)."
</P>
<P>
He added that China has been actively participating in the CTBT
talks, the latest round of which just ended in Geneva in late
June. The new rounds are to resume on July 28.
</P>
<P>
Jiang affirmed that the Chinese government and the Chinese
people will exert their utmost efforts to work for a nuclear-free
world and for maintaining lasting peace and universal security in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that China had been compelled to
conduct "extremely limited but necessary nuclear tests" in order
to safeguard the paramount interest of the country and the people.
</P>
<P>
Although the international situation is on the whole moving
toward greater relaxation, Jiang explained, the world is not yet
tranquil as hegemonism and power politics linger on and the dark
shadow of huge nuclear arsenals and nuclear threats remain.
</P>
<P>
China's reform, opening process and modernization drive require
a peaceful international environment of prolonged stability, Jiang
went on to say, adding that China had been subject to threat of
nuclear attacks in the past.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the small number of nuclear weapons
China possesses are entirely for the purpose of self-defense, and
that "they constitute no threat to any country, but are conducive
to breaking the nuclear monopoly by major nuclear powers and
preventing nuclear threats and nuclear wars."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that from the very first day of possessing nuclear
weapons, China has, in a highly responsible manner for regional
security and global peace, made a unilateral solemn pledge that at
no time and under no circumstances will it be the first to use
nuclear weapons, and has undertaken the obligation not to use or
threaten to use nuclear weapons against any non-nuclear-weapon
state or nuclear-free zone.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 China and Russia issued a statement on mutual
non-first-use of nuclear weapons, in which the two sides vowed to
take measures not to target their strategic nuclear weapons
against each other.
</P>
<P>
China has also issued government statements pledging security
guarantee for Ukraine and Kazakhstan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has strongly appealed to other nuclear powers
to respond positively to China's initiative on the immediate start
of negotiations aimed at concluding a treaty on mutual
non-first-use of nuclear weapons and an agreement on unconditional
non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states and
nuclear-free zones.

<HEADLINE> China's First International Conference on Joyce's "Ulysses" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Scholars and other people
interested in James Joyce gathered in Beijing today to discuss the
Irish writer's life and works.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Hayes, Irland's ambassador to China, said at the opening
of the first International Academic Conference on James Joyce in
China that people attending the meeting could "share a common love
of the values and spirit of great literature."
</P>
<P>
Although the author's "Ulysses" was known to many Chinese in
the 1930s, publication of a Chinese version of the entire work did
not come until the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one hundred scholars and publishers attending the
conference reached consensus that the meeting was a superb
opportunity for Chinese literature to meld with world literature.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory letter to the translator of the Chinese
version of "Ulysses", Irland's President Mary Robinson expressed
her thanks to Jin Di for his "16-year labor of love in bringing to
the billion users of Chinese a work of art which is generally
regarded as the greatest English language literary achievement of
the 20th century."
</P>
<P>
She also wished the conference success.
</P>
<P>
Joyce wrote "Ulysses" in 1922, an example of the
stream-of-consciousness genre and a pioneer of modernist
novels. The work was controversial worldwide after its publication
and was banned by many countries.
</P>
<P>
Before the reforms and opening-up, China also banned modernist
novels, including "Ulysses", and those who even read Western
literature secretely were accused of being dangerous elements
until 1978, when the country began to re-evaluate and re-introduce
the genre.
</P>
<P>
Now, people are able to buy and openly discuss novels and poems
by Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Thomas Stearns Eliot.
</P>
<P>
In 1981 Jin Di, a professor at the Tianjin Foreign Studies
University, translated a few chapters of "Ulysses" and got them
published, then in 1993, he published the first volume of the work
itself.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese version of the book was done by Xiao Qian and
his wife, Wen Ruojie, both experienced translators.
</P>
<P>
The two versions of the work are said to have been printed
millions of times in the Chinese mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong,
but many scholars and ordinary people are interested in comparing
their translation skills by examining the truthfulness,
expressiveness, and graceful qualities.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yuanmai, director of the Foreign Literature Institute of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, says that, in spite of the
disputes, publication of the Chinese version of "Ulysses" itself
was a great event in China's cultural life.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wei, another researcher, says that publication would have
been impossible "if there had been no great change in Chinese
society and the economy."
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, history has proven that excellent works can
break down barriers of time and space. Readers from various eras
should be allowed to share different ideas about literary works
based on their needs and aesthetic judgments, and many scholars
believe that "Ulysses" is a gift for Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Kejia, a well-known translator, has this to say, "The
exchange between and supplement to both (Chinese and Western)
sides will make world literature all the more rich and
splendid. This is where the significance of this conference lies."
</P>
<P>
He also notes, however, that owing to the great differences
that exist between Western and Oriental cultures, it is certainly
no easy job for China to profit from Modernism.
</P>
<P>
"A patient process of explication, discrimination and digestion
is evidently in need," he points out.
</P>
<P>
People attending today's meeting included representatives from
the International James Joyce Foundation, researchers from Europe
and America, as well as experts from Taiwan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Professor Jin Di delivered a report at the meeting, but the
other translator, Xiao Qian, was unable to attend because of
illness.
</P>
<P>
The conference was jointly held by the Tianjin Foreign Studies
University, the Foreign Literature Institute of CASS, the Embassy
of Ireland, and other relevant institutes.

<HEADLINE> Accelerated Payment of Tax Rebates in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Rebates of taxes for exporters rose
nearly 175 percent to more than 13 billion yuan (more than one and
a half billion US dollars) in May, reversing a downward trend in
the first four months of the year, a senior official of the State
Administration of Taxation said here today.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Faguang, deputy director-general of SAT quoted the latest
statistics showing that China's tax rebates for exports reached
34.4 billion yuan by June 20, up 7.1 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Cheng estimated China's tax rebates to exporters by the end of
June at some 40 billion yuan. This year's budgeted figure is 65
billion yuan and to date 63.6 billion yuan has been allocated.
</P>
<P>
During the January-April period, China's tax system paid
exporters a total of 15.63 billion yuan in rebates, down 42
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
To stop the slide, SAT issued two notices in May and June,
urging tax departments nationwide to speed up payment of rebates
to exporters, and lifted the annual tax rebate quota by 7.5
billion yuan, setting aside another 1.5 billion yuan especially
for exporters of textile and silk products.
</P>
<P>
Cheng explained that "accelerated payment of tax rebates since
May will greatly boost China's exports and help ease the pressure
of a capital shortage confronted by exporting enterprises."

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Dropping Trade Protectionism Against South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today called on the developed countries to scrap trade
protectionism targeted against the developing countries and
discriminatory trade policies.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark in a speech at the Kazakh Parliament,
saying that continued economic growth in the world and in the
developed countries can not be based on the prolonged backwardness
of a large number of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
If the developing countries become stronger and more
prosperous, said Jiang, they will provide the rest of the world,
developed countries included, with "enormous trade and investment
opportunities, and instill inexhaustible vitality to the global
economy."
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is here for a three-day visit to Kazakhstan, warned
in his speech that the economic gap between the North and the
South keeps on widening although the global economy has maintained
its growth momentum. The current unjust and inequitable
international economic order should be changed more urgently, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the developed countries have the duty to help
the developing countries to shake off poverty and backwardness
through effective moves and thus narrow the gap between them and
the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
"We stand for a more effective North-South dialogue and a
better North-South relationship," said Jiang, "the developed
countries should pay greater attention to the development of the
developing countries and the problem in their face."
</P>
<P>
On the South-South cooperation, Jiang said that it should take
multiple forms and be conducted in various fields and at various
levels, and that it should feature not only economic cooperation
but also political, cultural and social cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that with vast land, large population and a
high degree of economic complementarity, these countries offer a
great deal of real or potential opportunities for South-South
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The differences in their level of development underscore the
very necessity and possibility of the cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president regarded "similar historical experiences and
common task for development" as bonds of solidarity and
cooperation among the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"A stronger position and enhanced role of developing countries
in world economic affairs will greatly facilitate the improvement
and development of North-South relations," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that development of the developing countries, and peace
and stability in the world all call for a more effective
North-South dialogue and closer South-South cooperation, which is
regarded by China as the two key issues facing world development
and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On China's opening-up, Jiang called it "all-directional,"
saying that his country is open to both the developed and
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to step up our coordination and cooperation with
the other developing countries, including those in Central Asia,"
said the visiting president, "so as to promote the common
development and common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan is the last leg of Jiang's six-nation tour which has
taken him to Spain, Norway, Romania, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan.

<HEADLINE> Reform, Development, Stability Crucial to Economy: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today stressed that the proper handling of the relationship among
reform, development and stability is crucial to China's economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark in a speech delivered at the Kazakh
parliament in which he briefed Kazakh legislators on the current
situation in China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that as a developing country with a population of
1.2 billion, China owes its sustained economic growth to the
proper handling of the relationship among reform, development and
stability.
</P>
<P>
Development is the goal, reform the driving force and stability
the prerequisite of both, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that without a stable social and political
environment, reform can hardly move forward smoothly, neither can
economy grow rapidly. Therefore, the Chinese government sets great
store by maintaining an overall economic, political and social
stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
While sustaining a high growth, Jiang said, the government also
takes care to ensure a steady, coordinated and continuous
development so as to avoid violent ups and downs in the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jiang stated, consistently proceeding from China's
realities, the Chinese government has actively promoted reform in
the country's economic and political structures, consolidated
socialist democracy and legal system in an all-round manner and
stepped up development of socialist culture and ethics.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we have tried to adopt a gradualist approach
and ensure stability and all-round progress in society by avoiding
and minimizing contentious social issues that may accompany the
reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also noted that China upholds the principle of ethnic
equality and attaches importance to economic and social
development in minority-inhabited areas.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government safeguards the religious freedom of its
citizens while guiding them to live harmoniously under socialism,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China's reform and economic development have been
given a reliable guarantee, thanks to the overall stability it has
maintained. "And progress in reform and economic development has,
in return, contributed significantly to stability in all areas."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, are marching
with full confidence on the road of socialist modernization," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also told the Kazakh legislators that the policy of reform
and opening up, which Chinese people have pursued for 18 years,
has produced tremendous success.
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and 1995, China's Gross National Product (GNP) has
increased at an average rate of 9.9 percent. People's livelihood
has improved remarkably.
</P>
<P>
Income of urban and rural residents has grown at an average
annual rate of 6.3 percent. In 1995, China's two-way trade reached
280 billion U.S. dollars and the foreign exchange reserve now
stands at 85 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Thursday for a three-day state visit to
Kazakhstan, the last leg of his six-nation tour.

<HEADLINE> Economic Improvement in Henan's Poverty-stricken Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has made some success in beginning to stimulate economic
development in poverty-stricken areas in various ways, one of
which is by taking advantage of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Shangcai County of the province has improved its economy with
an input of 60 million yuan, and three of its four Sino-foreign
joint ventures have begun operation.
</P>
<P>
Xinyang Prefecture, in another move, has given priority to
developing the breeding sector, turning it into one of the area's
economic pillars. Its products have found markets in a dozen
countries, including Germany, France, Japan, and the Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some areas are generating construction funds by
supplying labor services abroad. Zhumadian and Xinyang have sent a
total of 1.7 million laborers abroad, bringing in over two billion
yuan in incomes.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Chengyu, deputy governor of the province, there
are still 6.7 million poor people in the province, but the areas
where they live are mostly rich in natural resources and have good
prospects for cooperation with advanced countries and regions.

Alexander Downer today welcomed Indonesia's ratification of a
bilateral security treaty negotiated under the former Labor
government last December.
</P>
<P>
"With the agreement entering into force, another milestone in
relations with Indonesia has been achieved," said Downer, who is

<HEADLINE> Iran Attacks USA for Freezing Iranian Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today attacked the United States for freezing Iranian
assets in 1980 and termed it as a "historical criminal act."
</P>
<P>
"We will certainly bring the United States to justice at
international tribunals one day to be condemned (for its act),"
said the 61-year-old president at a large Friday prayer gathering
in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration seized about 12 billion U.S.dollars
worth of Iranian assets -- some were military purchases -- in the
 United States in 1980 following the take-over of the American
embassy in Tehran by a group of extremist Moslem students.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can justify such breach of trust and injustice done
by the U.S. against the Iranian people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said: "we are now witnessing the disgraceful defeat of
Washington's unilateral sanction and bullying policies against
Iran because even America's closest allies could not tolerate
such intimidations."
</P>
<P>
In the recently concluded G-7 meeting in Lyon, France,
President Bill Clinton failed to convince other member states to
join the unilateral U.S.embargo against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that if the Americans come to realize the
depth of Iranian people's satisfaction with their officials, they
will never think about confronting Iran.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK to Be Brighter for ROK Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Businessmen from the Republic of
Korea (ROK) hold that Hong Kong's investment and market
environment will be brighter in the coming years, said Paek
Chong-Hyon, chairman of the Korean Chamber of Commerce in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Paek said South Korean
businessmen's confidence in Hong Kong can be testified by the
increasing number of enterprises run by Koreans in Hong Kong in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to the chamber, in 1985, there were only 16 South
Korean investment enterprises in Hong Kong, and now the number
exceeds 250.
</P>
<P>
Paek said the total number of South Korean companies in Hong
Kong has reached more than 400 with 76 large enterprises setting
regional headquarters in the territory.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong has become South Korea's eighth largest
overseas investment destination and that by the end of last year,
his country's investment in Hong Kong amounted to 324 million US
dollars. The amount will be rising in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Paek said trade between South Korea and Hong Kong has grown
rapidly in recent years, and it rose by 32.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is South Korea's third largest destination for its
exports and as an international trade center, Hong Kong will in
future be more important for South Korea's exports which will be
delivered to China's mainland and Southeast Asian countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Paek said Hong Kong also serves as a major source of investment
for South Korea, adding that about 35 percent of the country's
funds were collected from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With many South Korean companies in Hong Kong turning to open
up market in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong is becoming more
important for them to collect funds to promote their business in
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Now about 100 Hong Kong-based ROK (Republic of Korea)
enterprises are engaged in electronic, textile and chemical
industries in Chinese mainland and they have made progress in
business," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with Hong Kong's return to China and the
implementation of the principle of "one country, two systems",
Hong Kong's economy will become more vigorous.
</P>
<P>
He said his chamber and South Korean companies will enhance
their cooperation with their Hong Kong counterparts and will also
increase their investment in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
He said that in future, South Korea's strategy for trade
development is to open emerging markets in Asia with a focus on
the market in China.

<HEADLINE> No Food Deficits in Coming Year, Says Tanzanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 7.393 million
tonnes of food crop harvests is expected for the financial year
1995/96 against an originally stipulated target of 7.084 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Agriculture and Co-operatives Paul Kimiti said on
Thursday that available statistics show there is likely to be no
food deficits in the coming year except for wheat. The minister
made the statement when he presented the 1996/97 budget to the
National Assembly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that yields of some 4.476 million tonnes of
grain and 2.608 million tonnes of other food crops were expected
to be harvested in this financial year, owing to excellent
weather and other conditions in the past year.
</P>
<P>
A surplus of 310,000 tonnes of non-grain food crops can be
sold abroad without disrupting supply to suffice the national
food demand before the next harvesting season, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti predicted that in the 1996/97 fiscal year, cotton
yields will increase by 102 per ceent, coffee by 27 percent,
cashewnuts by 22 percent and sugar by 8.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister told that in the last fiscal year sisal
production decreased slightly, while tea production decreased by
nine percent and pyrethrum yields descended to 18 percent of the
previous year's crop.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Condemns US Arms Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- South African Minister of
Defence Joe Modise has described the United States' continued
arms embargo against South Afria as becoming "irritating".
</P>
<P>
He slammed the US policy while speaking at the release of
ARMSCOR's annual report yesterday in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The ARMSCOR company is the country's biggest weapon producer
and exporter.
</P>
<P>
Modise said the arms embargo is affecting the friendship
between the two countries and should not be allowed to continue
since it emanated from the apartheid days.
</P>
<P>
ARMSCOR has once offered to pay a 14.5 million U.S. Dollars in
fine in exchange for the lifting of the embargo, only to be
rejected by the US Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
ARMSCOR handles the acquisition of all equipment including
spare parts for aircraft for the South African defence force.
</P>
<P>
However, the US embargo is making it impossible for the
company to obtain spares. "This meant that other agencies had to
use dubious methods to obtain them," said Modise.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is continuing talks with the United States about
the embargo, but those talks drag "on and on, making it an
irritation".

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Launches National Policy Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has launched
a national policy against drugs with special emphasis on the
protection of young people against the menace.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the national anti-drug policy at a special
launching ceremony Thursday night in Nicosia, President Glafcos
Clerides said a coordinating body has been set up to study the
problem and seek ways of solution.
</P>
<P>
This coordinating body, which involves the President himself,
the Council of Ministers, ministries, youth and anti-narcotic
organizations, will also be responsible for the supervision of
programs aimed at the prevention of drugs abuses, the President
added.
</P>
<P>
He promised that programs for treating addicts will be
upgraded and that efforts to rehabilitate them into society
intensified.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides congratulated the Cyprus police and
especially the anti-drug squad for their success in stamping out
drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Minister for Justice and Public
Order Alecos Evangelou said though the drug related problems in
Cyprus were not so serious so far, but there was always the danger
of exacerbation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to legal measures against drugs, Evangelou said the
Justice Ministry is in a process of legislation in line with
international conventions.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has recently stepped up its anti-drug
campaign as the drug cases have been on the increase in the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics issued by the police, in 1995 the
authorities investigated 156 drug cases involving 221 people, with
100 being Cypriots. However, in 1990 there were just 50 cases
involving 79 people.

far, involving five billion dollars in overseas investment. Nearly

<HEADLINE> Uganda Starts Operation To Put Down Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 5 (Xinhua)-- Uganda has started an offensive to
wipe out rebels of the Lard's Resistance Army in the north,
reported local daily "The New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Salim Saleh, a presidential advisor on
political and military affairs as saying that the operation will
last six months.
</P>
<P>
"We are occupying all the rebel bases, their resting bases and
transit routes. This will keep the rebels constantly on the
move," Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The occupied rebel areas cover key bases, caves, hills and
forest areas around Kilak Hills and Kilak game reserves.
</P>
<P>
Also occupied are Ayugi forest reserves, Akara Hills in Achwa
County and Mogali Ridges bordering Sudan, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 401 brigade headquarters of the Uganda army has since June
19 moved to Kilak Hills to carry out the crack down, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kilak Hills are the scene of a protracted gurrilla warfair in
which the Acholi Tribe fought against the British colonialists,
known as the Lamogi Rebellion.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said that there are other areas to be occupied soon. The
next stage will start to use more "harder ways", including
confiscating properties of suspected rebel agents and their
collaborators, to end the insurgency there, he added.
</P>
<P>
All means are devised to stop the rebels from bringing in more
arms and supplies from Sudan, Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in his April campaign for
presidency pledged to voters in the north that he will stage an
offensive to wipe out rebels in the north in June.

<P>
TEHRAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Bahrain have agreed to
stop propaganda campaign against each other following Syria's
mediation between Tehran and Manama, an official report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati was quoted by the
official news agency IRNA as saying "We are for good neighborly
relations with all of our neighbors including Bahrain."
</P>
<P>
By taking the first step towards removing misunderstandings
between Iran and Bahrain, Syria intends to proceed with its
mediation efforts until other steps are taken in this regard, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister explained that following the end
of the Arab summit which was held in Cairo on June 22-23, Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Shara arrived in Tehran with a message
for President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani from his Syrian counterpart
Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
While in Tehran, Shara briefed Iranian officials on the
outcome of the Cairo summit and announced Syria's willingness to
mediate between Iran and Bahrain in order to remove
misunderstandings between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Velayati said, Farouq al-Shara visited both
Tehran and Manama twice. He said both Iran and Bahrain welcomed
the mediation efforts by a prestigious Arab state.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Iran downgraded their diplomatic ties from ambassadorial
level to the level of charge d'affaires shortly after Manama
accused Tehran of involvement in a plot to topple the Bahrain
government last month.

<HEADLINE> County Officials in Shanxi Responsible for Eradicating Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Officials of 46 mountainous
counties in north China's Shanxi Province have signed contracts of
responsibility with provincial officials to help local residents
escape their impoverished conditions.
</P>
<P>
The contracts are expected to help the entire population of the
province escape poverty by the year 2000 and provide a good
foundation for future well-being, provincial officials say.
</P>
<P>
The populous inland province has had some progress in
alleviating poverty in the past decade, but because of natural and
historical reasons, 3.81 million people in 46 mountainous counties
were still considered to be living in poverty, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The harsh life of the mountainous areas caused some local
officials to want to get out and some would move to other places
after a short period of service.
</P>
<P>
The contract system sets goals, dates, and specific jobs for
county magistrates and secretaries of county Communist Party
committees to get their particular counties out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
County officials who fail to fulfill their task will not be
allowed to move on to other better posts or will not be promoted,
while those who meet their goal and do the job well will be open
for promotions and awards.

two peoples and of serving the interests of the region and the
world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the common desire of the peoples of the two
countries and the solemn responsibility of their leaders to
carefully cultivate bilateral friendly relations and ensure their
long-term and stable development.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev fully agreed with Jiang's remarks. "Our bilateral
relations are on the basis of lasting trust and the two sides have
no problems either in bilateral ties or on international issues,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Kazakhstan agrees with the Chinese view that the world is
heading toward multi-polarization, and supports China's advocacy
of building a new just and rational international political and
economic order," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that relations among countries should be developed on
the basis of equality, mutual benefit and non-interference in
internal affairs, and that Kazakhstan opposes the monopoly of
world affairs by big powers.
</P>
<P>
Both Kazakhstan and China are facing the task of economic
development and need a peaceful and stable world, Nazarbayev said,
adding his country is against separatism and supports China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang's visit to Kazakhstan is the first ever made by a
Chinese head of state, which coincides with the fifth anniversary
of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is a historic event in bilateral relations and will surely
give strong impetus to their further development," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral relations in recent year have made remarkable
headway, with the signing of 15 inter-governmental agreements.
</P>
<P>
"The five-partite accord on building military trust in border
areas signed in April in Shanghai, and the five cooperation
agreements to be signed here today all indicate the political
desire of the leaders of the two sides for actively enhancing
bilateral ties," he added
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China holds that the two sides should respect each
other's social systems, roads and models for development, refrain
from interfering in each other's internal affairs and settle
disputes through consultations on the basis of equality.
</P>
<P>
"China will as always support Kazakhstan's independence and
sovereignty, respect its domestic and foreign policies; China is
willing to be a long lasting good friend, good neighbor and good
partner," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said bilateral trade has changed from barter at early
times to the present mode of cooperation, but there still remains
great potential. He called on the two sides to develop trade and
economic cooperation in line with internationally-recognized trade
practices.
</P>
<P>
There remains much to be done to improve the environment for
cooperation and investment and provide better economic and legal
protection, Jiang said, adding the two sides should encourage to
build direct links among trust-worthy and powerful companies of
large and medium size of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should expand the capacity of railway and highway
transportation by bringing the Euro-Asian Continental Bridge into
full play, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said Kazakhstan welcomes direct investment from
Chinese companies and their efforts to open new cooperation fields.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Thursday on a three-day state visit to
Kazakhstan, the last leg of his six-nation tour.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President had visited Spain, Norway, Romania,
Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan on his ongoing Euro-Asia trip.

<HEADLINE> Swazi Actling Prime Minister Warns Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Acting Prime Minister of
Swaziland, Sishayi Nxumalo, has warned the Swazi People against
the growing trend of using wildcat industrial action as a weapon
to force government to meet unbudgeted salary increase demands,
South African daily ''The Citizen'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi prime miniser was referring to the demand by the
country's teachers and civil servants currently on strike for
salary hike.
</P>
<P>
Swazi teachers and civil servants staged a wildcat strike last
month, demanding a 18 percent salary increase. But the government
was offering them a 9.9 percent plus a four percent increase in
allowances.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in the capital Mbabene on
Thursday, Nxumalo said if the strikers' demand are granted, the
money will have to come from funds earmarked for development
projects to improve the quality of life of people in the rural
areas where the majority of the population are unemployed and
with no salary at all.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is deeply concerned about the widening
gap between the vast majority of the Swazi people who are without
jobs and the fortunate minority with jobs, salaries and
allowances and still demanding more.
</P>
<P>
To this regard, the Acting prime minster noted, these
midguided demands by labour organisations especially in these
times of national economic difficulties undermined the
government's efforts to speed up development in the rural areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
Region has developed an ambitious plan to protect the environment
while boosting economic development.
</P>
<P>
The government will have an "environmental target
responsibility system" for the next five years to define
environment protection work at each level of government, according
to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's "Southwest Economic
Herald".
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection and agriculture departments will have
ecological agriculture trials, and the region will plant 20,000 ha
of grass and improve 660,000 ha of grass land by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Cultivated land with more than 15 degrees' slope will be
returned to forest and grass, and those with less than 15 degrees
will be changed to terraced fields.
</P>
<P>
Technology transfers will be used in enterprises with severe
pollution problems to ensure that they reach state standards by a
certain deadline. In new projects, environmental protection will
be given priority in the design.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, 90 percent of the industrial waste
gas will be treated and 45 percent of solid wastes will be
recycled.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Cabinet Advocates Higher Retirement Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese cabinet has endorsed
lifting the retirement age from 60 to 65 as part of a new 10-year
outline to cope with the rapid graying of the Japanese society,
Kyodo News Service quoted government officials as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
The outline, a follow-up to last year's law on measures to cope
with the graying of the society, is setting comprehensive
guidelines for policy-making in this area over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The basic idea is to create an environment that enables elderly
citizens to live independently and to participate actively in
society.
</P>
<P>
By encouraging private initiative and making existing
facilities more efficient, the outline aims to "control the
increase of taxpayers' burden in the future as much as possible."
</P>
<P>
A major means for easing the fiscal burden resulting from the
rise in the number of pensioners would be to secure employment
opportunities of various kinds beyond the current retirement age
of 60, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The outline also calls for the introduction of a public nursing
care insurance for the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Govt Urged To Speed Refugee Repatriation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
( by Guo Ming)
</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Organisation of African Unity
(OAU) today urged the Tutsi-led Rwandan government to adopt a
policy of national reconciliation to ensure early repatriation of
its 1.7 million Hutu refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts should be stepped up by the Rwandan government to
build a condusive atmosphere for early repatriation of refugees
in order to ensure peace, stability and security in the country
and in the sub-region," said a resolution passed by the ongoing
64th council of ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, with its refugee population totaling 1.7 million, is
on top of the list of the 1996 refugee report recently released
by the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
The death of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyramana and his
Burundi counterpart President Cyprian Ntaryamira following the
downing of their aircrft, started a massive ethnic massacre of
the minority Tutsis by then Hutu government, resulting in huge
exdos of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Between 500,000 and a million minority Tutsis and moderate
Hutus were butchered between April and July in 1994, until the
Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front defeated the old
Hutu government and took power.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi government insistence that properties be returned to
their original owners has often been ignored by local authorities
who favor newcomers over returnees tainted by the genocide.
</P>
<P>
"The massacres have gone so deep, it is difficult to find
forgiveness." said the United Nations special representative
Shaharyar Khan.
</P>
<P>
The OAU also called on asylum countries, including Zaire,
Burundi and Tanzania, to make further sacrefices for the welfare
and needs of the Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
Few of the 1.7 million Rwandan Hutu refugees who fled to
Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi have come back home.
</P>
<P>
These victims of intimidation by the former Hutu
administration behind the genocide fear revenge attacks by the
ruling Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) of the minority Tutsis on
their return.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan refugees have caused many political, economic and
social problems for the host countries, which have been urging
for their early repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, the Zairean government threatened the use
of force against the one million Rwandan refugees in its
territory and made an urgent call on the OAU for their prompt
repatriation, saying Zaire's national security is severely
threatened by the armed Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that the Hutu refugees might develop into a
military force on Rwanda's borders, just as earlier generations
of Tutsi refugees, fleeing after the overthrow of the Tutsi
monarchy in 1959, later formed the Rwanda Patriotic Army which
invaded from Uganda in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The refugee camps just over Rwanda's borders are a potent
source of instability for the former rebels who now make up the
Tutsi-dominated government in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Zaire had previously threatened to close the camps on its
territory by force, seeing the refugees as causing
destabilisation along its ethnically mixed eastern border.
</P>
<P>
The OAU resolution also urged the international aid
organisations to continue to provide financial assistence to the
governments of Rwanda and the asylum countries to facilitate the
voluntary repatriation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Aid has poured in from more than 100 agencies, but there has
been little direct help to the new government from foreign donors
suspicious of the administration in the capital Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
(ICTA ) which has been in existence for quite some time now
formally charged the first suspects in late May this year. Lack
of funding for the tribunal is one of the factors accounting for
the slow pace of its operations.
</P>
<P>
The current Tutsi-dominated Rwandan government is holding some
67,000 prisoners on charges related to the 1994 massacres for
trial in Rwanda's own court system, which is barely functioning.
Over 2,000 have already died in overcrowded jails.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. wants to maintain a small political presence in
Rwanda to assist in promoting national reconciliation,
strengthening the judicial system, facilitating return of
refugees and rehabilitating infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> US Promises No Cut in Aid to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has been given a promise of no
cut in American financial assistance to the largest Middle East
country despite a persistent effort by the U.S.congress to reduce
Washington's foreign aid level.
</P>
<P>
A visiting U.S. official announced here Thursday that the
U.S. financial aid to Egypt would remain at its usual level of 815
million U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sally Shelton, Deputy Director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, told a press conference that the
U.S. congress was to conclude debates over aid to Egypt and no
reduction had been requested in this case.
</P>
<P>
The congress has stopped foreign aid to some countries because
of budget deficit, said the official who is here to attend a
session of the Education and Human Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee is an offshoot of the Egyptian-U.S. partnership
agreement known as the Mubarak-Gore Agreement.
</P>
<P>
She called Egypt one of the most important friends to the U.S.,
noting Cairo plays a central role in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the largest U.S aid recipient country second only to
Israel in the Middle East region. It receives 2.3 billion dollars
in terms of economic and military aid annually, about 0.9 billion
dollars less than that by Israel.
</P>
<P>
U.S. plans for assistance to Egypt would center on four main
fields: economic development, infrastructure, population and
health and the promotion of the judicial system and the faculties
of law, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, she added:"Egypt will not need aid for life."

<HEADLINE> Pudong Opens Office to Facilitate Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen overseas-funded
enterprises were among the first beneficiaries of an office opened
in the Pudong New Industrial Area to facilitate investment.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises were delighted to find that they were granted
project approval letters and business licenses just ten days after
submitting their applications, as against 60 days previously
needed.
</P>
<P>
The new office is designed to provide a "one-door service" to
speed up domestic and overseas investment in Pudong, Hu Wei,
vice-director of Pudong's Management Committee, said recently.
</P>
<P>
It means investors can get procedures done in the office, which
previously had to go through 15 government departments including
trade, agricultural, planning, taxation, labor, public security,
customs, commodity inspection, quarantine and supply of water,
power and electricity, telecommunications and even cultural
affairs, Hu explained.
</P>
<P>
The office is required to complete examination and approval
within 10 working days of projects involving less than 30 million
US dollars, provided that the projects are under the category of
not being subject to policy restrictions.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, Pudong had attracted 3,501 projects involving a
combined 9.1 billion US dollars of direct investment from 56
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
This year's goal is to draw 800 projects worth three billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in Yangtze Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The delta area of China's longest
river, which includes Shanghai and parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang
provinces, has over 55,000 overseas-funded enterprises, including
about half of the world's 100 biggest multinationals.
</P>
<P>
"To invest in the delta area is very profitable," Jean-Pierre
Vassaux, general manager of Shanghai Associated Finance, Ltd, has
commented.
</P>
<P>
That financial venture involving the Shanghai Branch of the
Construction Bank of China and Societe Generale of France made a
profit of 30,000 US dollars in the first year of operation in
1994, and 500,000 US dollars the following year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai AT&AMP;T, a Sino-US venture, recouped its total investment
of 18 million US dollars within three years of opening in 1991.
</P>
<P>
It was China's first joint venture producing optical fibre
digital transmission equipment and now has 30 percent of the
Chinese market and is involved in building the country's 22
long-distance trunk lines.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-German Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive Company is
another success story. Started in 1985 with registered capital of
350 million yuan (42 million US dollars), it by now has increased
that to 2.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The company has sold over 500,000 Santana cars, worth over 60
billion yuan in China, and has been cited as one of China's best
overseas-invested enterprises for three consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou Matsushita Electric Works Ltd., a Sino-Japanese venture,
invested 46 million US dollars in March, 1995, to produce
copper-clad laminates and printed boards as parts for Matsushita's
color television and micro-wave oven plants in the delta. The
venture expects to recoup its investment in five years.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Iveco Fiat has decided to invest 400 million US
dollars along with the Jiangsu Yuejin Motor Vehicle Group to
form Naveco Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"We like to see more Iveco cars running in the streets of
China," said Camillo Donati, chief representative of Iveco's China
Office.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with the constant improving of China's market
economic structure, investors will be more successful in the delta
area," Associated Finance's Vassaux concludes.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Reduce Rice-Growing Land to Save Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government plans
gradually to reduce rice-cultivating land from present 672,000
million hectares to 294,000 hectares by the year 2000 in a bid to
save water.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources, in
coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture, issued a decree on
May 1, prohibiting many areas in Egypt from cultivating rice, the
latest local English newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The ban, which will be in effect in June next year, is due to
water shortages, the paper quoted government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Those who violate the ban will face a fine of 952 Egyptian
pounds (about 281 U.S. dollars) per hectare of illegal rice crop
and 10 pastres (about 0.029 dollars) for each cubic meters of
water used to irrigate the rice, according to the decree.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Hadi Radi, Minister of Public Works and Water resources,
told the paper that Egypt's quota of the Nile River's water is 5.5
billion cubic meters a year.
</P>
<P>
This amount should be sufficient for Egypt's agricultural,
commercial, industrial and household needs, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the government cannot afford to use 21,429 cubic
meters of water to irrigate one hectare of rice field, Radi said.
</P>
<P>
"If we are not cautious with water, Egypt will be suffering
from a severe water shortage by the year 2025," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Egypt's rice harvest was estimated at 4.8 million
tons, compared with 4.5 million tons in 1994, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian wholesalers and farmers expect rice production to
decrease drastically after the ban comes into effect.
</P>
<P>
However, Saad Nassar, Head of the Agricultural Research Center,
which is affiliated to the Ministry of Agriculture, said the
ministry will increase the productivity rate to 819 tons per
hectare from the present 571 tons by using new kinds
of fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian farmers were unhappy with the ban and wanting the new
decree to be revoked on the ground that the high price of rice help
them to pay debt which they own to banks, the paper said.

fiscal 1996 ending March 31, 1997, Kyodo News Service quoted a a

<TEXT>
<P>
As a duty-free zone, the street is known as a "shopper's
paradise" across the country. In addition to daily necessities,
gold jewelry is a hot item for bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
A young lady choosing gold necklaces in a jewelry store said,
"Hong Kong has the lowest gold price in the world. Buying gold
jewelry on the Sino-British Street is exactly the same as buying
such jewelry in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
According to the boss of the Boji Store, commodities available
on the street are mostly ordered directly from wholesalers or
manufacturers in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Because of intense competition, prices of many commodities on
the street are even lower than those in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
For historical reasons inland residents on one side of the
street have relatives living on the opposite side, in what is Hong
Kong's new territories. It means that residents on both sides of
the street can visit each other frequently.
</P>
<P>
With more and more people coming to the street on shopping
expeditions, more business people from Shatoujiao and Hong Kong
have flocked to the street, where both Chinese currency Renminbi
yuan and Hong Kong dollar are accepted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years the Shatoujiao Town government, the
Shenzhen City government and the Guangdong provincial government
have financed the construction of a number of large stores on the
street, as well as apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Quanfang, secretary of the Shatoujiao Town Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, described the street as a "special
zone within a special economic zone."
</P>
<P>
He promised the the Shatoujiao town government will do its
utmost to turn the street into an even better "paradise" for
shopping, sightseeing, tourism, recreation and services.

TOKYO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Japan's NEC Corp. will start
manufacturing flash memory chips by the end of 1996 to meet the
growing demand for portable products, Kyodo News Service quoted a

</P>
<P>
The company will initially mass produce 4-megabit and 8-megabit

</P>
<P>
NEC will produce flash memories at its production subsidiaries
in Yamaguchi, Hiroshima and Kumamoto prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The production lines for the chips will be shared with those
for 16-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM), the production
of which is currently being adjusted, he said.
</P>

GUANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua Correspondent Che Xiaohui) -- It's
eight o'clock in the morning Beijing time, and the Chung Ying
Street in Shatoujiao Town, Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province,
begins to bustle.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of visitors speaking in different accents,
dialects and languages flock to the street from the nearby
Shatoujiao customs office.
</P>
<P>
The street, known as "one street with two social systems,"
quickly becomes noisy, with peddlers hawking their goods, and
would-be buyers haggling with sellers.
</P>
<P>
The street -- 250 meters long and three to four meters wide --
is divided by eight boundary tablets at its center. Crossing the
tablets means crossing borders. The middle line of the street
forms the dividing line between China's inland area and Hong
Kong's New Territories.
</P>
<P>
Here visitors shop freely in any store on either side of the
street.
</P>
<P>
A special environment has turned the street into a commercial
and tourism center, with nearly 200 stores and shops.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 people from all over the country converge on the
street for shopping and sightseeing every day, according to the
local customs office.
</P>
<P>
The Boji Grocery is considered the busiest store on the
street. Its floor space of just 20 square meters is packed with
foodstuffs, detergents, cosmetics and kitchen utensils. There is
always a queue at the cashier's check-out.
</P>
<P>
A man carrying a basket of goods was in the line. He said with
a strong northeast China accent: "I think Chung Ying Street is a
place that all people coming to Shenzhen must visit. Besides, it
is less expensive to do your shopping on the street, where prices
of goods are usually 33 percent lower than elsewhere."

<HEADLINE> Liberalisation Policy Makes Tanzania's Cash Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Liberalisation of cash crops
marketing, a policy which was introduced two years ago, has
increased the cotton and coffee production.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Tanzanian Minister for Agriculture
and Co-operatives Paul Kimiti at a National Assembly meeting on
Thursday. He said that liberalised cash crops marketing had
pushed up producers' prices in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti said that cotton production increased from 148,953 tonnes in
1994/95 to 251,200 tonnes in 1995/96, while the output at
ginning factories and coffee curing plants also went up during the period.
</P>
<P>
He said plans are underway to liberalise marketing of tea,
pyrethrum and sisal and a law to that effect will be moved in
the National Assembly later in the 1996/97 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the move was designed to increase
competition among buyers, a factor that was anticipated to push
up producers' prices, much in the interest of farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said among the strategies is to encourage that crops
should be bought at designaed points to facilitate transparency
in the setting up of prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kimiti said the Zimbabwean government will continue
supporting the co-operative movement because of its potential in
improving living conditions of millions of people in rural areas.

HANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Forest parks in east China's
Zhejiang Province were visited by a total of 6.5 million overseas
and domestic tourists in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The boom is attributed to the efforts of nearly 10,000 people
who work in the tourism sector of the province, and to the growing
number of special tourist programs and tourist spots.
</P>
<P>
The province now has more than 40 forest parks covering nearly
200,000 hectares. Zhejiang's forest coverage rate ranks first in
China.
</P>
<P>
Its forest parks played host to 8.8 million overseas and
domestic visitors last year. There are more than 60 forest scenic

<HEADLINE> Large Investment in China's Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China plans to invest 189 billion
yuan in 1,591 environmental projects over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest sum ever allocated for environmental
protection in the country's history, according to a report
in the weekly magazine "Outlook" to be published next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The funds are 30 billion yuan more than the investment in the
three gorges water control project, the largest of its kind in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection is of paramount importance and the
only choice for China's economic and social development, the
report quoted Zou Ping, an associate research fellow at the
research office of the State Council, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A report from the State Environmental Protection Bureau says
that the particulate matter in northern Chinese cities averaged
0.392 mg per cubic meter and that of south China, 0.242 mg per
cubic meter, in 1995, far exceeding World Health Organization
limits. Beijing, Shenyang, Xi'an, Shanghai, and Guangzhou were
rated as the most seriously polluted cities in China.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investment, 32.4 billion yuan, or 4 billion US
dollars, will be raised abroad, and China welcomes other
countries' participation in dealing with pollution and foreign
cooperation, technical help, and economic aid, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment now only makes up 10 percent of China's
total investment in environmental protection. There is a great
potential in attracting foreign funds in this regard, Zou noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's President Jiang Zemin today
signed a stringent gun law which strengthens the country's control
on weapons.
</P>
<P>
The President also signed new laws controlling auctions and
archives. They were passed today by China's top legislature, with
decrees signed by Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The new laws were approved on the closing-day of the 20th
meeting of the National People's Congress Standing Committee,
which was presided by Qiao Shi, chairman of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Consisting of 69 articles in six chapters and integrating
international conventions with practices in China, the Auction Law
regulates the auctioning of goods, auctioneers, auction processes
and legal responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Agencies engaged in auctions in China will be obliged to abide
by the law from January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
The Amendments to Archives Law, going into effect today, has
listed criminal responsibilities for people destroying, losing,
illegally providing, faking and reselling archives.
</P>
<P>
The Law on Firearms Control, with 50 articles in eight
chapters, makes regulations on the acquiring of legal firearms by
individuals and organizations, as well as the making, selling,
daily management, transport, and the exit and entry into the
country of guns.
</P>
<P>
The law is aimed at strengthening controls over guns, and
safeguarding public security. Individuals and organizations that
are found to illegally hold, buy or sell, transport, lease and
lend guns will meet severe punishment, according to the general
principles of the law.
</P>
<P>
The law will be put into effect on October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Another law on energy saving, which is expected to be passed at
the 20th meeting, was put back on the shelf for further
deliberation, due to the many revisions submitted by members of
the Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The legislature today also approved the final budget of central
finance in 1995 put forward by the State Council, and a report on
the final budget delivered by Minister of Finance Liu

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Investment in Guangzhou Economic Development Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in the
Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone in the first
five months of this year, according to recent statistics, reached
1.059 billion U.S. dollars, 47.9 percent over that of the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administrative committee of the zone says
that it has attracted more overseas funds by improving its
investment environment and many multinationals have been putting
funds there.
</P>
<P>
Of the new overseas-funded projects in the first three months
this year, 17 of them had 10 million dollars each in investment.
</P>
<P>
Average foreign investment for each of the zone's projects is
about 7.9 million dollars, three times higher than that of China's
other economic development zones.
</P>
<P>
The official attributes the increase mainly to an efficient
administration and more regulations protecting the rights and
interests of overseas investors. Over the past few years, 85
regulations for governing the zone have been adopted.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to other development zones, it usually take an
overseas businessman a mere three to five days here to obtain
approval for a project, and only about 15 minutes to fill out
application forms.

<HEADLINE> Maradona could be Barred from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Argentine football superstar Diego
Maradona could be denied entry into Japan to play in the Japanese
football league because of his drug history, a justice ministry
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult. Generally speaking, if the conditions of his
entry are the same as before, the result would be the same as
well," said the official of the ministry known for its tough
stance against drug offenders, AFP reported.
</P>
<P>
In May 1994, the World Cup ace was barred from entering Japan
to play friendly matches as Japan's immigration law bans the
entry of those who have been convicted of narcotics charges.
</P>
<P>
Maradona was arrested in Buenos Aires in April 1991 for cocaine
 possession, and five months later was given a 14-month suspended
sentence by an Italian court for the same offence.
</P>
<P>
He was also suspended from international competition for 15
months in 1991 and 1992 after testing positive for cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
Maradona made his comeback in October last year from another
15-month international ban for drug-use, following the 1994 US
World Cup, where he later tested positive for epehedrine.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Maradona said he is ready to leave Argentine first
division club Boca Juniors and play for an unnamed Japanese
team. He has been negotiating a deal that would take him to Japan
until December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The contract could be worth some 20 million dollars, Japanese
media reported.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Fuika, an agent for Japanese interests, and Maradona's
agent Guillermo Coppola both confirmed Thursday that an agreement
had been reached in principle between the Argentine star and
Japanese clubs.

and tourism center, with nearly 200 stores and shops.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 people from all over the country converge on the
street for shopping and sightseeing every day, according to the
local customs office.
</P>
<P>
The Boji Grocery is considered the busiest store on the
street. Its floor space of just 20 square meters is packed with
foodstuffs, detergents, cosmetics and kitchen utensils. There is
always a queue at the cashier's check-out.
</P>
<P>
A man carrying a basket of goods was in the line. He said with
a strong northeast China accent: "I think Sino-British Street is a
place that all people coming to Shenzhen must visit. Besides, it
is less expensive to do your shopping on the street, where prices
of goods are usually 33 percent lower than elsewhere."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Well-Thought Tactics Keep Yeltsin in Kremlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- It's only a matter of time before it
can be pronounced that Boris Yeltsin will preside over the Kremlin
and Russia for another four years.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent president now has two moves to thank for as he
managed to fend off a strong challenge from Gennady Zyuganov,
chief of the Russian Communist Party and archrival in the
10-candidate presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Feeding the people in the country and stopping the war in
Chechnya enabled Yeltsin to more than survive the first-round
polling last month. Appointing a retired general as his henchman
uplifted him out of Wednesday's runoff as a clear winner.
</P>
<P>
The central electoral commission announced today that after 97
percent of the votes had been tallied, Yeltsin led Zyuganov with
53.7 percent or 38.94 million of the ballots. Zyuganov got 29.3
million votes or 40.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
Now Yeltsin and Zyuganov were separated by an insurmountable
differential of 9.6 million votes though the distance between the
duo was a lot closer and the other way around six months ago.
</P>
<P>
When the presidential campaign began in February this year,
Gyuganov took the advantage of most of the triumph of the
Communist Party in the parliamentary elections last December.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll, conducted by the Russian Center for Public
Opinion Research in late February, showed that Zyuganov commanded
the support of 24 percent of the respondents whereas Yeltsin
obtained only 11 percent in favor.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin launched his come-from-behind campaign by promising and
offering social welfare in kind.
</P>
<P>
He saw to it that wages in arrears were paid; pensions were
raised; the military was restructured and the price of vodka was
held down.
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old man braved fatigue and his sometimes mysterious
health problem to travel far and wide. He even went down coal
mines and up to the Chechen battle fronts to make his platform
heard and appreciated.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's campaign trek led him from his home town of
Yekaterinovka to the Urals while the air waves of radio and
television debates carried his message further beyond.
</P>
<P>
His footing in the presidential wrestle became firmer as he
firmed his stance on issues of Chechnya and the NATO eastward
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The president's toil and moil paid off on June 16 when the
first-round poll was held.
</P>
<P>
Despite a low turnout, Yeltsin got 35.28 percent of the votes
as against Zyuganov's 32.04 percent, which set the stage for
Wednesday's showdown.
</P>
<P>
Russian election laws stipulate that if no candidates get 50
percent or more of the votes, a one-on-one runoff has to be held
for the top two leaders within 15 days after the first round ends.
</P>
<P>
A kingmaker was now needed and retired general Alexander Lebed,
third in the first-round elections, stood out the one.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin demonstrated his political insight and dexterity by
naming Lebed chief of the national security council and his
personal security aide only one day after the elections.
</P>
<P>
The switch of Lebed's supporters, or 11 million voters, played
the decisive role. So did the 5.55 million followers of liberal
economist Grigory Yavlinsky who, though a stern critic of Yeltsin,
declined to vote for Zyuganov.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Under Fire over Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Pressure is mounting on the
Indian government to review the price hike in petroleum products
as Janata Dal President Laloo Prasad Yadav and other chief
ministers belonging to the ruling United Front joined the brigade
of critics, the Indian Express said today.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government led by Prime Minister H. D. Deve
Gowda announced on Tuesday a massive price hike in petroleum
products, which became effective on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Many state chief ministers, who began to hold a conference here
Thursday, decided to raise the issue with the prime minister when
they meet him on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The hike seems unreasonable. It should have been done in
phases. I am going to convey the resentment of the people to the
prime minister tomorrow," Laloo Prasad Yadav said at the
conference on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu, another influential man
of the United Front, said the hike was unjustified. It should
have been effected in installments, he said.
</P>
<P>
While conceding that some amount of price hike may have been
justified, Maharashtra Chief Minister Manohar Joshi believed that
what has been done would cause unbearable burden on the common
man.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) launched a
new round of attacks on the price hike while the Congress Party,
which supports the United Front government from outside, planned
to move a privilege motion against the government in the coming
session of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Facing such mounting pressure, Gowda, who had earlier ruled out
any review, is likely to be forced to eat his own words, analysts
said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment For Yangtze Delta Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (xinhua) -- With China's foreign investment
policy favoring agriculture more and more, foreign investors are
eyeing the agriculture sector in the Yangtze River Delta, a major
grain producer in China.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing-based newspaper reports that companies from some 20
countries and regions have invested in agriculture in the delta,
which covers parts of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, and the
Shanghai Municipality.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, agricultural output of the area, which has good
natural conditions for agricultural development, such as fertile
soil and abundant water resources, was more than 160 billion yuan,
according to "China Import News".
</P>
<P>
Hangjia Lake Plain to the south of the delta, has approved more
than 40 foreign-funded companies in the farming sector, with a
total investment of nearly 100 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have expressed an interest in foreign
investment, saying that the delta, with its large population and
higher living standard, has a large potential market.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the country has
worked out a series of preferential policies for taxation and use
of land and labor to woo more foreign investment to the sector.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Children in suffering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will mark the Day of the
African Child on july 30 amid reports of rising poverty and a
host of other problems facing Zimbabwe's children, the Zimbabwe
National News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Minister of National Affairs, Cooperatives
and Employment Creation Thenjiwe Lesabe as saying that today's
children have to contend to with ever-increasing problems the
nation is facing, primary among which, are economic hardships,
resurgence of diseases and disintegration of family structures.
</P>
<P>
''The purpose of observing this day is to advocate for greater
attention, political conviction and resources to africa's
children,'' Lesabe said.
</P>
<P>
Like other countries in Africa, Zimbabwe is faced with a
rapidly increasing population, not matched by infrastructural
development. As a result, the country has a housing crisis dand
sometimes sanitation is compromised as mostly urban authorities
battle to maintain congested sewer system, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Government's welfare arm, the Department of Social Welfare
is recording a steady increase in the number of children needing
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Because of the adverse economic climate, rural children living
around commercial farming areas are forced onto farms to help
sustain households, Lesabe said.
</P>
<P>
The number of children orphaned by the AIDS is estimated to
reach 60,000 by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
One in every 10 people is said to be infected with the
aids-causing hiv virus in Zimbabwe and 300 deaths related to HIV
infection are reported every week.
</P>
<P>
Of all the deaths of children under the age of five, at least
half are caused by HIV/AIDS, according to Health and Child
Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps.
</P>
<P>
''Looking after our children must be the first priority,
because without them to take over tomorrow our economic and
social development programmes would to nil,'' Stamps stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The State Statistics Bureau has
predicted that China's market price index will continuously go up,
but with slower speed this year.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index in the first six months of this year
was up 9.3 percent, and 11.8 percentage points less than the same
period of last year, and the retail price index rose by 7.3
percent during this period, a drop of 11.1 percentage points, the
Shanghai-based "Business News" reported recently.
</P>
<P>
Ren Caifang, head of the Urban Social and Economic Survey Team
under the bureau, said the market price situation in the first
half of this year is better than expected.
</P>
<P>
"This is because of the government's money-tightening policy,
abundant market supply, and the state's regulation of prices for
some goods," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Ren was optimistic about the state control of inflation within
ten percent this year on condition that there is no severe natural
disaster this year.

<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Scientists at Zhejiang Medical
University have discovered two genes that they say may provide a
clue to the cause of cancer in the large intestine.
</P>
<P>
The genes, referred to as HSU17714 and HSU20428, were located
from among 46 related genes found in cancer cells in the large
intestine, and were subsequently cloned by the research group,

<HEADLINE> China Doping Control Center Passes IOC Annual Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China Doping Control Center (CDCC)
has passed the annual accreditation test conducted by the
International Olympic Committee recently, the head of CDCC told
Xinhua here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tianle, a member of the IOC Medical Commission and
Director of CDCC, said he received a congratulatory letter
from Prince Alexandre de Merode, President of the IOC Medical
Commission, on June 21.
</P>
<P>
"In the letter, the President said that CDCC has smoothly
passed the annual accreditation test offered by IOC this year, and
expressed his appreciation of CDCC's timely, reliable and accurate
analyses, " Yang said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, it is the seventh straight time for China to
pass the IOC annual check.
</P>
<P>
Yang said the IOC's demand this year was very tough, requiring
CDCC to clarify eight drugs from six urien samples and completing
the test and research within 72 hours. On May 24, the CDCC sent an
accurate report of 100 pages to IOC.
</P>
<P>
CDCC, an A Class laboratory accredited by the IOC in 1994, owns
26 scientific and technical personnel. Each year about 200 samples
are tested in the laboratory. The samples mainly collected at the
national and international competitions in China as well as those
sent here by other countries.
</P>
<P>
Yang also told Xinhua that China's Olympic Committee has
increased the numbers of flying test from last year. He said Wang
Junxia, world record holder for the women's 10,000 meters, has
received 12 doping checks in the past 12 months. Le Jingyi, world
record holder for the women's 50-meter freestyle swimming, also
received six flying tests and two normal checks conducted by CDCC
last year.

<HEADLINE> Mergers Change Harbin's Economic Landscape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- In an effort to revitalize
enterprises in Harbin, an old industrial city of machinery,
textile, medicine, food, automotive, and petrochemical industries
and capital of Heilongjiang Province, 231 money-losing companies
have been merged with 188 productive ones.
</P>
<P>
The Xingguang Machinery Plant, a large state-owned firm in the
northeastern Chinese city had losses of 160 million yuan before it
was merged in 1993 with the First Automotive Works, China's
largest automotive production base, to produce a well managed
plant with better output value and sales.
</P>
<P>
The old planned economy left all state-owned enterprises rigid
in their management, short of capital investment, and out-moded in
technology and equipment, and many were even forced to suspend or
cut production.
</P>
<P>
To reverse this trend, the Chinese government decided, in 1994,
to encourage the city to merge companies for reorganization,
better use of assets, and improved performance. In this way, 300
million yuan worth of assets and 680,000 sq.m. of workspace in the
city were improved and 30,000 employees were given proper jobs.
</P>
<P>
The city's merger system is supposed to be conducted on the
basis of mutual benefits and agreement of both parties and is not
restricted to the city or to the same industry.

<HEADLINE> China to Produce 10 Million Motorcycles This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to produce 10
million motorcycles this year, as against a market demand of 8.5
million units, "China Automotive News" has reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that market competition has remained fierce
since the national output of motorcycles topped 7.83 million units
last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past six months domestic motorcycle manufacturers have
been active in increasing production and cutting prices to gain a
larger market share. It has led to large stockpiles, deteriorating
performance and excessive supply.
</P>
<P>
In addition, manufacturers of other products have made a shift
to begin building motorcycles, making market competition even more
intense, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
These new-comers have taken little trouble to push their
products onto the market, since they have enough funds, backing
from governments, flexible marketing strategies and lower
production costs.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the 2010
blueprint for the national economy, the motorcycle industry must
make efforts to expand circulation channels, and optimize the
motorcycle market while increasing production scales and standards.
</P>
<P>
China has many large motorcycle and parts trading markets, some
of which are in Guangzhou, Zhuzhou, Jiangmen and Changzhou cities.

<HEADLINE> Township Electronics Industry Spark With Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (xinhua) -- China's township electronics
industry has become a thriving force in the country's electronics
sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Beijing-based "China Township Enterprises
Daily" show that in 1995, the output of township electronics
industry was 70.5 billion yuan, 241 times that of in 1980.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 township companies now send their electronic
products to international markets.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper about 60 percent of the companies
are producing spare parts and components for large-scale machinery
and electronic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation helped township companies promote their
development, it said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper admitted that there are still some problems
existing in the current township electronics industry, underlining
poor quality in some of the companies.
</P>
<P>
It suggests township enterprises spare no effort in improving
quality of their products, and to raise their competitive ability
on international markets.

<HEADLINE> Zimnbabwean Government Functions Decentralised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Some of the central government
functions to provide housing, health services and education will
be transferred to rural district councils as the Zimbabwean
government implements its decentralisation policy.
</P>
<P>
Announcing on Thursday the progress made in decentralisation,
Local Government, Rural and Urban Development Minister
John Nkomo said the government had put in place clear procedures
and linkages for the implementation of the decentralisation
policy.
</P>
<P>
A 10-member ministerial committee has been set up to oversee
the transfer of duties which goes hand in hand with a five-year
billion dollar capacity building program to adequately equip
rural district councils for the take-over.
</P>
<P>
The levy of taxes will also be transferred to rural councils.
</P>
<P>
John Nkomo said, ''This should not be taken as a strategy of
dumping problems of sector ministries to rural district councils
but an undertaking to promote and strengthen democracy and civic
responsibility as citizens participate in their governance and
development."
</P>
<P>
''That decentralisation should be defined and understood as
the legislated transfer of functions and authority from central
government to local authorities such as rural district councils
on a permanent basis,'' the minsiter stressed. Eenditem

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticized for Imposing Secret Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Relief Association
(IRA) criticized Turkey for obstructing humanitarian aid reaching
northern Iraq and urged for a policy review under the new government
led by Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News today quoted the relief agencies as saying
that over one million U.S. dollars worth of humanitarian aid in
the form of medicine, provided as part of a campaign organized by
the IRA, faces the prospect of being wasted due to a "secret
embargo" put in place by the Turkish government against northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which is dedicated to alleviating the pain and
suffering of the poor and the needy people around the world, has
brought the six loads of supplies to Turkey, the first arriving
six months ago, for transshipment to northern Iraq, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the first load of supplies is being held at the
Turkish-Iraqi border crossing at Habur. The other five are at the
port of Istanbul with an additional 17 boxes being impounded at
the Istanbul airport since May 9, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
IRA Chairman Khalil Jassemm said:" We tried everything
possible to get the shipments across the border, but we could not
succeed."
</P>
<P>
Negotiations have begun between the IRA and the Turkish Red
Crescent over sending the medicine and medical equipment to
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
IRA officials are trying to do everything to distribute these
supplies before they become spoiled.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the Turkish Foreign Ministry worries that
relief and volunteer organizations working in northern Iraq are
possibly supporting illegal groups or parties in their struggle
against Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Sino-German Venture Paints Aircraft for International Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German joint aircraft
maintenance venture has painted a A300-600R aircraft for a Chinese
airline company.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft of China Northern Airlines has already been leased
to Korean Airlines.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time Beijing Aircraft Maintenance and
Engineering Corporation (AMECO), which is China's largest in the
field, has been indirectly involved in aircraft painting for
Korean Airlines. The first one, a Boeing-747, was done four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
"AMECO's painting, which took only nine days to complete, is up
to international standards in terms of work time and quality",
pointed out an aircraft maintenance expert.
</P>
<P>
Sources at Korean Airlines believe that AMECO can win more
projects from international markets with their first-class
service, competitive price and fine maintenance facilities. The
airline itself is considering sending more planes for painting by
AMECO, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
AMECO, jointly funded by Air China and Lufthansa in 1989, has
already undertaken heavy maintenance for three Boeing-747s,
reflecting its high maintenance level.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Students in Beijing Normal
Institute of Physical Culture can now watch TV in their
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 student dormitories in the institute have
installed 14-inch TV sets. All the TV sets are domestically-made
"Peony" color TVs.
</P>
<P>
In the past there were few TV sets in students' dormitories in
colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
Early this year the local municipal Party committee and
municipal government decided to install closed-circuit TVs in
college students' dormitories, in a bid to enrich cultural
activities in college campuses, and promote ideological and
cultural progress in colleges.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Normal Institute of Physical Culture is the first to
install TV sets in all students' dormitories.
</P>
<P>
Today's "Beijing Daily" quoted a college student as saying that
"This is a good thing for us."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that eight other colleges and universities under
the administration of Beijing are also making preparations to
install TV sets in students' dormitories.
</P>
<P>
Students in most of locally-administered schools of higher
learning are expected to watch TV in dormitories by October.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Grow More Grain, Less Cotton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers have grown more
grain and tobacco, but less cotton this year, a survey by the
State Statistics Bureau has found.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted at the end of May, found that China's
rice growing area has ballooned by almost one percent over last
year, to 8.274 million ha this year, while the country's wheat
growing area is 3.9 million hectares, up 4.5 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, China's cotton growing area has shrunk by
420,000 ha in the past year to 4.2 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the increase of grain growing area has much to
do with the government's decision to raise the grain purchase
price this autumn, while farmers opted to grow less cotton
foreseeing the difficulty of selling cotton.
</P>
<P>
The bearish international cotton market resulted in huge
stockpiles in the Chinese market, dampening textile companies'
enthusiasm in buying cotton from farmers.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that China has grown tobacco over an area of
1.507 ha this year, 17.9 percent more than last year, reflecting a
desire to earn quick money.
</P>
<P>
China produced 465 million tons of grain and 4.5 million tons
of cotton last year, up 4.5 percent and 3.7 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> China's Two New Nature Reserves Added to International Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Two state nature reserves in China,
the Maolan and Tianmushan, have been accepted as members of
UNESCO's international network of biosphere protection zones.
</P>
<P>
It brings the number of China's nature reserves in the network
to 12.
</P>
<P>
The Maolan nature reserve, located in Libou county in southwest
China's Guizhou Province, is the only surviving karst forest
ecological system protection zone in China, or even in the world's
subtropical areas.
</P>
<P>
It has become a rich "gene bank" of biological resources, and
it also has scenic karst forest tourist resources, providing a
natural laboratory for scientific research and monitoring, and a
scenic spot for ecological tourism.
</P>
<P>
Located in Linan county in east China's Zhejiang Province, the
Tianmushan nature reserve is famous for its unique geographic and
landscapes. It consists of distinctive natural environment,
bountiful biological resources, well-preserved forest ecological
system, and places of historic interest.
</P>
<P>
It boasts a large variety of rare animals and plant species,
including the oldest wild ginkgo trees and cryptomeria groups.
</P>
<P>
Biosphere protection zones attach importance to coordination
between human beings and the natural environment in a global
perspective.
</P>
<P>
The zones lay stress on the combination of their functions,
usually including protection, research, monitoring, education,
training, information communication, and demonstration.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Clinton to Discuss Withdrawal from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will discuss a U.S.-brokered "Lebanon-first" deal
involving Syria and Israel with President Bill Clinton next week,
a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to visit Washington on July 9 for his
first meeting with Clinton since taking office in June.
</P>
<P>
An official in the Prime Minister's Office was quoted by The
Jerusalem Post as saying that the deal would involve Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon after strict security arrangements
are made.
</P>
<P>
Advisers to President Clinton have discussed this option
recently, but no policy decision has been taken about it, a
senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk refused to confirm but
said U.S. would consider the idea until "we have a chance to talk
to the prime minister and see how he wishes to proceed in the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has called for such
an initiative on south Lebanon this week, terming it a
"land-for-security" arrangement.
</P>
<P>
This echoed a similar plan favored by slain former Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who envisioned the Lebanese Army's
redeployment southward and disarming the Hezbollah. He proposed
that, if this arrangement holds for six to nine months, Israel
would pull out of the security zone.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Netanyahu would support the
same terms to settle the Lebanon question to ensure Israel's
security.
</P>
<P>
However, the major premises of the governments of Rabin and
Shimon Peres were that south Lebanon would be part of a peace
package, whose centerpiece would be an Israeli-Syrian peace treaty
based on Israel's return of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
As Netanyahu's government has ruled out such a deal with Syria
rejecting any compromise on the Golan Heights, so the central
question remains what incentive would Syria have to agree to the
"Lebanon-first" arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that Syria apparently wants Israel to stay in
south Lebanon, as this leaves Israel vulnerable to pressure
during the Golan talks. But this approach has failed to cause
Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Another official in the Prime Minister's office said the
incentive for Syria should be that if it does not agree to such a
deal, the international community would impose a form of trade
sanctions upon Damascus, due to its support of Hezbollah and
hardline Palestinian and Kurdish groups.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, this official opposed the idea that, in return for
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, Syria's control over the
northern half of Lebanon would be formalized.
</P>
<P>
Some sources suggested Israel publicly challenge Syria to make
a deal in south Lebanon or be held responsible for Israel's
indefinite stay on Arab soil, the Post report said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Opportunities, Challenges Coexist in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- African countries have also
made progress in regional cooperation which is now on the upswing
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
So far, the east African Inter-Governmental Authority of
Development (IGAD), the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) and the Economic Community of the West African States
(ECOWAS) have worked out projects of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, disequilibrium remains in both Africa's political and
economic areas, and behind the rosy picture still tower many
problems facing the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Although the OAU and the international community have been
making arduous efforts in mediating the internal conflicts in
some African countries, the crises of Burundi, Somalia and
Liberia are far from being resolved.
</P>
<P>
The issues of Somalia, Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Sierra Leone
and Angola will still be on the agenda of the forthcoming OAU
summit, waiting for African leaders to find solutions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in spite of the economic recovery for three years
running, Africa's economy is still very backward compared with
other continents in the world.
</P>
<P>
Africa is burdened with lack of food and huge debts. By the
end of 1995, debts of African countries reached 322 billion US
Dollars, a four percent increase over that of the previous year.
And the 1995 economic growth rates of 26 African countries were
still below their population increase.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the summit of African leaders will focus on their
economic development and integration for a better Africa. Some
social problems such as refugees which have topped 7 million and
the spreading epidemic AIDS will also be on the agenda for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
All in all, if African states are determined and united to
promote peace and economic development, a better Africa can be
seen not very far away, just as OAU Secretary General Salim A.
Salim put it at the very beginning of this year, "the dream of
the development of Africa is not unreal. Africa can and will
develop."

<HEADLINE> Europe Congratulates Yeltsin, Expects Further Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- European leaders today
congratulated Russian President Boris Yeltsin for his victory in
the presidential runoff and hoped that Russia will continue
reforms and cooperate with other European nations.
</P>
<P>
European Union Commission President Jacques Santer and Eastern
European Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek said the outcome
of the elections "bodes well for the development of relations
between the European Union and Russia."
</P>
<P>
Javier Solana, secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), said the alliance is looking forward to
cooperating with the new administration in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that NATO expects to establish a firm, stable and
lasting "partnership for peace" with Russia, Solana said both NATO
and Russia bear the commitment to safeguard the security and
stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl told reporters that he
had telephoned Yeltsin to congratulate him personally.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kohl sent a letter to Yeltsin, in which he expressed
confidence that the re-elected president would "proceed undeterred
with the adopted path of comprehensive reforms in Russia and good
cooperation with the international community."
</P>
<P>
From Elysee Palace, France's presidential residence, President
Jacques Chirac said in a message to Yeltsin that he was "very
happy" to work with the latter on developing French-Russian
relationship of "partnership and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's re-election should serve as a "guarantee of peace and
security in Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Austria and Italy leaders joined other European
countries to hail Yeltsin's victory.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil on Thursday sent a message of
congratulations to Yeltsin, and Austrian Prime Minister Franz
Vranitzky said the results of Wednesday's elections meant Russia
could continue to conduct stable international dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said that Yeltsin's victory
"inspires growing confidence" in Russia, and Italy's Foreign
Ministry said in a statement that the election result is an
"extremely positive factor" for the stability and security of the
European continent.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is poised to be the next Russian president after
winning Wednesday's second round of presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
With nearly 54 percent of the vote, he led his Communist rival
Gennady Zyuganov by about 13 percentage points with almost all the
votes counted.
</P>
<P>
The two men entered the run-off after beating eight other
candidates but failing to win more than 50 percent of the votes in
the first round held on June 16.

ADDIS ABABA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The 32nd summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) opens in Yaounde, Cameroon
on Monday to discuss its blueprint of peace and development in the
world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
The grand gathering of African leaders comes when Africa is
faced with both opportunities and challenges in its political,
economic and social areas.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is not the picture of conflict and disaster that is
portrayed daily by the media," said a joint statement issued by
the chief executives of the OAU, the U.N. Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA) and the African Development Bank recently.
</P>
<P>
Since the 31st OAU summit, political stability in most African
countries has been improved while in some African countries,
internal conflicts and social unrest have been or are being
resolved with the region's "hot spots" being cooled down
gradually in general.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution, which was set up three years ago, is playing a
greater role in maintaining peace and mediating and resolving
internal conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the body's efforts to mediate internal
conflicts in Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone,
Angola, Sudan and the Comoros have contributed a lot to peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the year 1995 saw the fastest economic growth in
Africa since the 1990s. It was also the first time that the
economic growth of 27 African states have surpassed their
population increase, according to the ECA.
</P>
<P>
The ECA predicted that the gross domestic product of African
states will rise by 2.9 percent this year, as against last year's
2.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Fijitsu Develops Software to Let Kids Use Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- World electronics giant Fujitsu
Laboratories Ltd. has developed a software designed to enable
children to enjoy communication through the Internet global
personal computer (PC) network.
</P>
<P>
The software shows on a PC screen a dog, bird, balloon for
other image carrying a message when the computer receives a
message from another PC and then stores the image in an "album",
according to a Kyodo News report.
</P>
<P>
To send a message, an operator opens a scanner by pressing a
"camera shutter" on the screen, picks an image as a messenger and
lets it carry the message.
</P>
<P>
Among other functions, the software enables children, as young
as 6 years old, to process sounds as if to operate a tape
recorder, Fujitsu was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In order to test the program, PCs will be installed in three
elementary schools in a western prefecture starting Saturday and
connected to computers in Fujitsu Laboratories and prefectural
education centers.

</P>
<P>
According to the lastest figures released by the bureau, the
country's economy has been growing at an average rate of 9.3
percent.

PHNOM PENH, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia will order its citizens
to re-register their weapons in an effort to stem rising crimes in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Co-Minister of Interior Sar Kheng has signed a directive that
will require all weapons to be re-registered. The measure will go
into effect after the approval of the Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Existing legislation calls for weapons to be licensed with the
Ministry of Interior, but Interior officials acknowledge that many
weapons are never registered.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 illegal weapons were seized in five months this
year.
</P>
<P>
In April and May, foreign embassies reported more than 60
robberies, prompting the Ministry of Interior to form a task force
to help protect the foreign community in the capital.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Tighten Overseas Investment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
considering measures to tighten the screw on approval of overseas
investment by Indian corporates, the Times of India said today.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the Finance Ministry said the approval
given by a special committee of overseas investments of above 4
million US dollars is proposed to be staggered in view of the
emerging balance of payments position as well as the internal
annual ceiling on the total amount of such investments.
</P>
<P>
The special committee comprising officials of the Finance and
Commerce ministries as well as the Reserve Bank of India will also
be required to make an "independent" assessment of the performance
prospects of the overseas investment proposal.
</P>
<P>
This will be a departure from the present practice of the
committee accepting the projections made by applicants on their
face value.
</P>
<P>
The "independent" assessment will, in particular, cover the
likely benefits of an overseas investment proposal in terms of
foreign exchange earning and additional export growth.
</P>
<P>
The new requirements for the approval of overseas investment
are believed to be a reversal of the policy of facilitating
overseas investment by Indian corporates with a view to building
up India's own multinationals.
</P>
<P>
The proposed policy change followed a recent Finance Ministry
review of the working of the present policy which has suggested
that the performance of Indian ventures abroad has often been
unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
A large number of ventures have failed to achieve the projected
levels of net foreign exchange earnings or additional exports for
the country.

according to the Beijing Municipal Customs Office.
</P>
<P>
An official at the office said that exports from Beijing to
Japan, and imports from Japan into Beijing, amounted to 433

<P>
The official said that exports shot up by 16.3 percent to 135
million dollars, and imports by 12.5 percent to 298 million

</P>
<P>
Beijing's trade with Japan during the January-May period was
marked primarily by a substantial increase in the import of
equipment and materials by foreign-funded companies as investment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the import of such equipment and materials
surged 76 percent to 58.21 million dollars.

percent to 97.84 million dollars, and imports into such companies

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Leader Moves to Oust Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian National Congress
President P.V. Narasimha Rao has decided to crack the whip against
partymen indulging in indiscipline, The Times of India reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The first victim is expected to be one of his main detractors,
former industry minister K. Karunakaran, who is likely to lose the
membership of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) (supreme
decision-making body of the Congress party).
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Rao asked office-bearers of the All India Congress
Committee (AICC) to examine if Karunakaran was a member of the
AICC.
</P>
<P>
Karunakaran has repeatedly criticized Rao and even demanded his
resignation for the unprecedented debacle of the Congress party in
the recent general elections. The senior Congress party leader has
recently speeded up his efforts to solicit support to force the
resignation of Rao as party president.
</P>
<P>
Unlike many other partymen who became members of the AICC after
winning party elections, Karunakaran had become a member by virtue
of being the Congress party's parliamentary leader in the Kerala
state assembly.
</P>
<P>
Now that he is no longer the leader of the Congress legislative
party in Kerala, he has ceased to be an AICC member and also a CWC
member.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Opportunities, Challenges Coexist in Africa (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The 32nd summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) opens in Yaounde, Cameroon
on Monday to discuss its blueprint of peace and development in the
world's poorest continent.
</P>
<P>
The grand gathering of African leaders comes when Africa is
faced with both opportunities and challenges in its political,
economic and social areas.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is not the picture of conflict and disaster that is
portrayed daily by the media," said a joint statement issued by
the chief executives of the OAU, the U.N. Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA) and the African Development Bank recently.
</P>
<P>
Since the 31st OAU summit, political stability in most African
countries has been improved while in some African countries,
internal conflicts and social unrest have been or are being
resolved with the region's "hot spots" being cooled down
gradually in general.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution, which was set up three years ago, is playing a
greater role in maintaining peace and mediating and resolving
internal conflicts in the region.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, the body's efforts to mediate internal
conflicts in Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia, Sierra Leone,
Angola, Sudan and the Comoros have contributed a lot to peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the year 1995 saw the fastest economic growth in
Africa since the 1990s. It was also the first time that the
economic growth of 27 African states have surpassed their
population increase, according to the ECA.
</P>
<P>
The ECA predicted that the gross domestic product of African
states will rise by 2.9 percent this year, as against last year's
2.3 percent.

DHAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese language center has been
set up in Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The center was organized by some non-governmental groups, which
mainly comprise returned Bangladeshi students who had studied in
China. The center will recruit students and teach Chinese language
in order to promote friendly relations between the two countries
and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the center here Thursday, Bangladeshi Foreign
Minister Abdus Samad Azad appreciated the establishment of the
center, saying that it would help foster relations between the two
countries as language was the best medium of communication and the
Chinese language was widely spoken in the world.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visits to China on several occasions in the past,
the foreign minister pledged that the government would continue to
promote trade and economic relations between Bangladesh and China
to the mutual benefit of the two peoples.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government Justifies Policy on Telecom Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
justified its policy to allow private companies into the country's
telecommunication sector, saying that the policy would not harm
the state-run Nepal Telecom Corporation (NTC).
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications said Thursday in a press release
that the government was determined to ensure the participation of
the private sector in new telecommunication services like radio
paging and cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
The policy was adopted with a view to making the
telecommunication sector well-organized and spreading the
facilities throughout the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
The NTC would gear ahead competitively if the private sector
was brought into competition while efforts were underway to
provide more autonomy to the corporation, according to the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's decision to invite private companies
into the telecom sector has met the opposition from telecom trade
unions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The NTC Workers' Union Thursday undertook a strike for three
hours in a protest against the government's policy of privatizing
the telecommunication services.
</P>
<P>
The strike would continue today across the country, union
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the protest program would be launched next
Monday jointly by the NTC Workers' Union and National Telecom
Employees' Association, they said.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that the government's decision would have an
negative impact on telecommunication customers in remote and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
Private companies had the only objective of making profit and
would confine their services to urban areas, they said, adding
that competition would lead the state-owned NTC also to withdraw
its services from rural areas.
</P>
<P>
But the government has made clear that it would ask new
telecommunication operators to provide services in remote and
rural areas through necessary regulations and rules.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the government had granted permissions to
nine private companies to operate services like paging and
cellular phone in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Vice President to Resign as Ambassador to Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Vice President
Humberto de La Calle announced today that he will resign the post
of ambassador to Spain and will return to his country to help
solve the political crisis in his country.
</P>
<P>
Last night, De La Calle met President Ernesto Samper discussing
the situation in Colombia and said that he has different opinions
with Samper on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Colombia has been in crisis since the president was charged
with cover-up, illegal enrichment and electoral fraud. He has been
accused of receiving an estimated 6 million U.S. dollars from the
Cali cocaine cartel in his 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Some congressmen back Samper and voted to clear the president
of the charges in early June, but some want him to resign.
</P>
<P>
The economy in Colombia has been deteriorating and there is
also a confrontation between the United States and Colombia
because of the dispute over Colombia's anti-drug policy, said the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
"I see a very complicated and anguishing picture in the
country," said de La Calle, while Samper said that the substantial
elements of the crisis had been overcome.

KATHMANDU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-five teachers were arrested
Thursday when they clashed with police during a demonstration here
demanding the reinstatement of sacked teachers, police said.
</P>
<P>
The arrested teachers were released shortly afterwards, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
About 500 teachers from The Nepal National Teachers'
Organization (NNTO) were staging a march on the prime minister's
office demanding a meeting with Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba
when police stopped them with tear gas, according to organization
sources.
</P>

<P>
The NNTO launched a protest program eight months ago urging the
government to satisfy its demands including the reinstatement of
teachers sacked by the present government for political reasons.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Not to Sell Rice to Iraq on Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has refused to
sell rice to Iraq on credit as the Export-Import Bank of Thailand
will not provide a financial guarantee for the sale.
</P>
<P>
Under a memorandum signed with Iraq in April, the Thai
government was to sell 100,000 tons of 15 percent white rice worth
50 million US dollars to Baghdad on one year's credit, with Iraq
agreeing to buy more rice from Thai private traders.
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank argued that since the United Nations had
allowed Iraq to receive money under the "oil for food" program, it
was inappropriate for Thailand to sell rice to Iraq on credit,
according to Pracha Charutrakulchai, director-general of the
Foreign Trade Department.
</P>
<P>
Pracha said he believed that private traders could replace the
government in supplying the rice.
</P>
<P>
If either side fails to reconfirm the sale, the memorandum will
expire automatically.
</P>
<P>
There are also problems with rice sales to Pyongyang, according
to Commerce Minister Chucheep Harnsawat.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea wants to buy
200,000-300,000 tons of 25 percent white rice from Thailand, but
the buyer still owes Thailand money for previous purchases.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Thailand exported 2.85 million
tons of rice worth 24.5 billion baht (980 million US dollars).
Exports for the whole year were targeted at 5 million tons worth
45 billion baht (1.8 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Develop 54 Industrial Estates by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand plans to develop 54
industrial estates nationwide by the year 2000, according to
Industry Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Chaiwat Sinasuwong has already ordered the
Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) to speed up
implementation of its industrial estate development plan, as it
has so far developed only 23.
</P>
<P>
Development of industrial estates has been slow because
villagers encroaching on the land to be transferred to IEAT refuse
to leave.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Ministry has asked IEAT to stop concentrating only
on developing state-owned land and begin negotiating with private
land owners who are interested in co-venture.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises in industrial estates enjoy many privileges,
including tax and tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
Development of industrial estates is also aimed at contributing
to rural development and stemming the flow of labor migration to
big cities.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Unveils Deregulation in Fishery Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government Thursday
unveiled a deregulation package on the fishery industry, which
promises less bureaucracy, improved port management and the right
to purchase foreign ships.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution Hartarto,
who announced the reform measures, said "this deregulation is
aimed at improving Indonesia's capability to utilize fishing
potential in a sustainable way which ultimately increases
Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports."
</P>
<P>
The measures would allow selected local companies to buy used
foreign ships and operate them in the 200-nautical-mile exclusive
economic zone (EEZ).
</P>
<P>
Under the reform measures, the minister said, chartered foreign
vessels would not be allowed to operate in Indonesia after the
year 2000. Instead, the Indonesian firms which chartered the ships
would be allowed to buy them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Sjarifudin Baharsjah said
Indonesian fishery companies could buy foreign new or used vessels
only when there were no local products and the permit will be
given to the companies with good performance only.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, to achieve a five percent increase
in fishing production or an increase of 160,000 tons of fish per
year, the country needs at least 250 fishing vessels.
</P>
<P>
The government also simplifies the licensing procedures for
operating fishing vessels with both national and foreign flags.
</P>
<P>
Before the deregulation, vessels with national flags have to
obtain 15 documents -- 13 from the Directorate General of Sea and
Transportation, and two from the Directorate General for Fishery.
Under the new deregulation package, the fishery firms only need to
have eight documents to obtain their licenses.
</P>
<P>
Foreign vessels operated by Indonesian fishery firms (vessels
with foreign flags) are now required to have five documents as
compared with six documents before.
</P>
<P>
In order to support the fishery industry, the government also
plans to improve the management of fishery ports.

<HEADLINE> Dalian officials Urged to Learn Foreign Languages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Every official and civil servant
under the age of 50 in Dalian City in Northeast China's Liaoning
Province have been told to learn a foreign language.
</P>
<P>
They have to study English or Japanese languages training in
their spare time.
</P>
<P>
According to an order issued by Dalian municipal party
committee and government, the people have to take examinations
after the language training mainly through special television and
radio programs.
</P>
<P>
The order stipulates that the city's appointment of new
officials will take into consideration the foreign language level
of job candidates.
</P>
<P>
In a recent public invitation for the recruitment of 15
officials at bureau level in Dalian City, foreign language was an
exam item.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, employees in commercial, tourism and
communications departments are also required to receive foreign
language training.
</P>
<P>
The city also decided to take three to five years to popularize
foreign language study among all its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Dalian is one of China's first group of coastal cities that
implemented an opening to the outside world policy. It takes the
lead in introducing foreign investment in Northeast China's three
provinces.
</P>
<P>
However, the lack of personnel who have mastered foreign
languages has hindered the city's development. City authorities
called on officials and citizens to learn foreign languages in an
effort to make the city open more widely to the outside world, and
to help build Dalian into an international city.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Workers Face the Sack In Japan War Software Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tianjin, July 5 (Xinhua) Four Chinese workers at a
Japanese-funded firm in north China port city Tianjin face being
fired after refusing to develop computer game software featuring
war battles between Japan and allied troops during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The four young Chinese men claim the software, "Final Decision
of the Governor", would hurt the feelings of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The software, a product of Japanese Tianjin Koei Company,
features a battle between the troops of Japanese, Chinese and the
United States during the Second World War in the Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Guo Haijing, one of the four workers, in an interview with
Xinhua, said they knew they could lose their jobs for their
refusal.
</P>
<P>
"We would not give in since national dignity is more
important," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable for us to make with our own hands the
images of the former Japanese troops", he added.
</P>
<P>
The four people were hired by the Japanese firm last year to
develop computer graphs after their graduation from a local arts
institute. They were asked on May 13 to develop cartoon pictures
for the software using material provided by the Japanese company.
</P>
<P>
Liang Guangming, a 24 year-old employee, said the material
contained Japanese warplanes and warships used during the war, and
images of Japanese officers, including the name of chief war
criminal Hideki Tojo.
</P>
<P>
Hideki was sentenced to death by the Far East military tribunal
soon after the war, as one of chief culprits of the Japanese War
of Aggression against China (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
About 35 million Chinese people were killed or wounded during
the war, and the economic losses for China reached 560 billion US
dollars, according to an official document compiled in China in
the late 1940s.
</P>
<P>
"The war criminals, who were responsible for the death of many
Chinese people, were generals in the software program, which is
unacceptable to us," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
"What embarrassed us most was the scene of hailing Japanese
troops after they won a battle," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liang and his three colleagues were threatened by the Japanese
manager of the company with dismissal immediately after they
refused to develop the software.
</P>
<P>
The company also set up a branch in Beijing, which takes
advantage of China's rich resources of software developers to
produce graphs of basic images, and Chinese versions of software.
</P>
<P>
Their products are exported to Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The games software "Final Decision of the Governor", is said to
have offended some people in Shanghai when it entered the city
last year.
</P>
<P>
Three college students demanded an investigation into the
import of the software in a letter to local government.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by local experts say the software is
misleading, and advocates militarism. They have demanded the
recall of the 'offending' software.

<HEADLINE> New Government Formed in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel today
reappointed Vaclav Klaus as prime minister of a new three-party
coalition government, one month after Klaus lost his parliamentary
majority in the legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
This is also the first government of the independent Czech
Republic, which divided from the former Czech and Slovak
Federation in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member cabinet, formed after two weeks' long and
difficult negotiations, includes seven members from Klaus' Civic
Democratic Party (CDP), and four each from his two small partners
in the center-right coalition, the Christian Democratic
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party and the the Civic Democratic
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The CDP occupied most of the key posts including those of
foreign minister, interior minister and finance minister.
</P>
<P>
In last month's parliamentary elections, the ruling coalition
won 99 seats in the 200-member parliament, narrowly losing its
majority.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that facing the challenges from both the
majority opposition and the coalition itself, Klaus' government
will have a tough time during its coming four-year term.

ROME, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Another prominent Italian magistrate
was arrested today along with three lawyers and an accountant, as
a result of a widening graft probe into Rome's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Local news reports said magistrate Antonio Pelaggi was accused
of being paid 400 million lire (about 265,000 U.S. dollars) by a
construction businessman in exchange of acquitting him from a tax
fraud case.

<P>
The event took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The
businessman involved, Renato Armellini, died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the arrests were ordered on the basis of the
information from Armellini's son-in-law, who told prosecutors the
builder had taken a bag filled with money with him to meet judge
Pelaggi.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Offers A Broader Stage for Investors From Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 5 (Xinhua) -- In China's biggest special economic
zone of Hainan, an increasing number of business people from
Taiwan are shifting their eyes to promising agriculture, industry
and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Just a couple of years ago their sights were fixed firmly on
such sectors as real estate, entertainment and catering.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-funded enterprises mushroomed after Hainan was approved
as a SEZ in 1988. However, a considerable number of them were
small enterprises falling only into a limited number of sectors,
said Li Yongchun, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994 Hainan has significantly adjusted its industrial
structure, and as a result the common prosperity of agriculture,
industry and tourism begin to take the place of booming real
estate sectors, which had dominated the industry of the island,
especially during the 1991-1993 period.
</P>
<P>
After the adjustment, competition became fiercer on the island.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, streams of small investors moved to other parts
of the country where competition was less fierce.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Haikou, capital city of the province,
registered 581 Taiwan-funded enterprises in the 1988-1995 period,
however, only 173 of them have remained to date.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the enterprises that left during the period did not
have big investments, therefore, their departure does not really
hurt economic co-operation between Hainan and Taiwan." said Li.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, the enterprises which stayed are ones that are
capable and have ambitions to expand their businesses," noted Li.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 400 Taiwan-funded enterprises which are currently doing
business on the island are mostly engaged in various sectors,
ensuring they reap comparatively steady profits.
</P>
<P>
Another trend is that more Taiwan-funded enterprises are
transforming themselves from labor-intensive to
technology-intensive, and as a result, attention has focused on
the bringing in of state-of-the-art technology and new talents.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the provincial government,
the island province has formally vowed to turn Hainan into a new
industrial province, a tourist resort, as well as a tropical
agricultural base.
</P>
<P>
Among the 20 Taiwan-funded enterprises registered during the
first quarter of the year, the bulk fell into the categories of
industry, agriculture and high-tech enterprises, an indication
that investment from Taiwan is on a healthier road.

XINING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has
spent 3.8 billion yuan on its economic construction over the past
few years. Over 2,000 key issues have been tackled with the
injection of the money plus the efforts of scientists, say
officials.
</P>
<P>
A program to develop water saving technology in rice growth led
to an extra 627 million kilograms of rice being produced in two
years, and the saving of 2.5 billion cubic meters of water as an
added bonus.
</P>
<P>
A program on the development of high-yield and high-efficiency
farming technology brought about an extra 93 million kg of grain
during a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have also arranged 100 technological programs
which are expected to help with economic development in poverty
stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The province attached great importance to the renovation of
state-owned enterprises with updated technology.
</P>
<P>
In recent years more than 10,000 technology renovation projects
have been carried out in enterprises throughout the region,
yielding 30 billion yuan's worth of added industrial value.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the region has accelerated the construction of the
hi-tech industrial development areas in Guilin, Nanning and
Liuzhou.
</P>
<P>
So far, 457 technology-intensive enterprises have been set up
in the three areas, including 159 hi-tech companies. By the end of
1995, the hi-tech industrial sector accounted for 5.48 percent of
the regional industrial output value.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains in the last five
days have caused serious losses to rice and coffee crops in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Rice Producers Association reported today that the rains have
beat rice plants down to the ground, making the crop grow
immaturely.
</P>
<P>
The situation is similar for coffee crop. Heavy rains caused
the beans to drop and rot, which could reduce the output by 5
percent.

Peasants from Chiriqui Province, the main rice growing region
in Panama, said that rice and coffee yields will be 30 percent and
5 percent lower because of the rains.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tian Ezhou Nature Preservation
Region in central China's Hubei province recently had 32 newborn
baby David's deers.
</P>
<P>
The number of the David's deers has reached 111 in the nature
reserve, which has successfully raised the rare animals in a
complete natural environment.
</P>
<P>
The David's deers, known as "Milu" or "Sibuxiang" in China,
were raised in the imperial hunting gardens in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The rare animal died out in the wild in China, its native home,
around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
However, some had been taken to European in the latter of the
19th century by a Catholic priest and naturalist Pere David. Hence
the name David's deer.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, some 30 of the rare species returned home to China as
gifts by Britain, which now are raised in the 1,500-hectare Tian
Ezhou preserve, a "happy paradize" rich in woods, grassland, red
marshes and lakes.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that about 2,000 head of the deer are now in
the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Lush scenery and local culture have
attracted a growing number of tourists to the Xishuangbanna Dai
Autonomous Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
According to local statistics, 1.54 million tourists visited
the prefecture in 1995, at the Sino-Myanmar borders in southwest
China's Yunnan Province. Of those visitors, 23,600 were from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the number of domestic and overseas
visitors has grown yearly at an average rate of 27.7 percent and
20 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the local tourism industry brought in
7.3 million US dollars in foreign exchange, with an annual average
growth of 116.9 percent, and contributed 950 million yuan to local
revenues.
</P>
<P>
Located on the chief water and land traffic passage connecting
southeast Asia and southwest China, Xishuangbanna is an ideal
tourist destination with its beautiful tropical scenery and unique
folk customs, said a tourism official with the prefecture
government.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the government has invested heavily in
infrastructure in the past five years, which has promoted the
local tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, the prefecture renovated the Jinghong
Airport and the Daluo highway, and installed 25,600 program
controlled telephones and 480 lines for paging and mobile phone
services.
</P>
<P>
Several hotels, entertainment businesses, and parks featuring

Experts estimate that 80,000 overseas travelers and three
million domestic sightseers will visit Xishuangbanna by the year

<HEADLINE> Defending Champion Sampras Crashes out of Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Pete
Sampras of the United States and fourth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of
Croatia have both been knocked out by unseeded players in the
quarter-finals clashes at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the frustrating match, suspended frequently by rain,
world number one Sampras, who has won three consecutive Wimbledon
titles over the past three years, seemed unable to cope with his
bigger Dutch opponent Richard Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
The tall and strong Dutch player, who just forced 1991
Wimbledon men's single champion Michael Stich out of the
tournament, was in superb attacking form and gave Sampras simply
no chance to launch effective counterattacks.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek, who hit about 30 aces in the match, snatched the
victory over the title holder in straight sets, 7-5, 7-6, 6-4 and
sailed into the men's semi-finals. The Dutch player is very much
likel to the hottest candidate to win the Wimbledon men's singles
trophy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the match, Krajick said he would not be able to
toast his two-day win over top seed Sampras, "the tournament is
not finished yet and there's no time to celeberate because I've
not even got a day off since Friday."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sampras said: "Richard goav me my toughest test ever
out here and I was'nt good enough. He returned and passed me
better than I thought he could and he thoroughly deserved to win."
</P>
<P>
The American tennis ace noted that he had to focus his
attention on the U.S. Open after this crucial defeat, "I'll have
to put this result into perspective and bounce back with good
display there," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic, bidding to reach his fifth Wimbledon semi-final,
lost a long and difficult battle against unseeded Austrilian Jason
Stoltenberg 3-6, 6-7, 7-6, 6-7. The latter obtained a berth in
the semi-finals, in which he is due to clash with Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
In another two men's singles quarter-final clashes, two
American players the 13th-seeded Todd Martin and unseeded MaliVai
Washingtonof defeated British player Tim Henman and Alex Radusecu
of Germany and joined hands into the semi-finals, but
unfortunately the two Amercians would have an in-fighting in the
semi-finals in a bid to reach the men's singles final.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles semi-final matches, the fourth-seeded
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain thrashed his American opponent
Meredith McGrath in straight sets 6-2, 6-1 in only one hour and
gained a place in the women's singles final for the second year
running.
</P>
<P>
But in the other semi-final match between defending champion
Stetti Graf of Germany and Japanese player Kimiko Date, the world
number one Graf snatched the first set 6-2 quite easily.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, the 12th-seed Date, who is always a
slow-starter, launched really powerful attacks upon the defending
champion and took the set by the same 6-2.
</P>
<P>
When Date seemed very much likely to create the biggest upset
by ousting Graf, the match, which started very late due to the
frequent rain interruptions of previous matches, was suspended and
would be re-started tomorrow morning.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves 3 Credits for African Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has okayed three
credits totaling 135 million U.S. dollars for development projects
in Mali, Cote D'Ivoire and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank's recent announcement, a credit of
about 60 million dollars equivalent is provided for a Mali
economic management project. The project will support the
government's efforts to deepen fiscal adjustment and provide a
stable macroeconomic environment that is conducive to sustained
private sector-led economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Another credit of about 40 million dollars equivalent is
approved for Cote D'Ivoire's integrated health services
development project. The project is designed to expand access to
health services and improve their utilization, make services
available on a sustainable basis, and improve the ability of the
Ministry of Public Health to analyze health problems.
</P>
<P>
The third credit of some 35 million dollars will be provided to
another Western African country, Sierra Leone. The funding for its
transport sector project will help the implementation of a new
sector policy and strategy. It will finance capacity building to
expand institutional reform and strengthening, and increase the
use of labor-intensive methods in road works and road maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The credits will be channeled through the International
Development Association, the concessionary lending wing of the
World Bank for developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Manchester to Get 21m Pounds to Rebuild Its City Centre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
redistributing regional aid funds to give Manchester an extra 21
million pounds (33 million US dollars) to help rebuild its city
centre following last month's IRA bombing, the Financial Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 20 million pounds (31 million US dollars) will come from
reallocating some of the two billion pounds (3.1 billion US
dollars) in European Union (EU) regional aid for 1997-99, using
money originally designated for other parts of the UK.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Trade and Industry denied that redistributing
the two billion pounds regional aid fund in Manchester's favour
would have much effect on other parts of the UK. "It's 0.5 percent
of the budget. It's not a big deal," said an official.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide a further one million pounds (1.55
million US dollars) to pay for a master plan to redevelop the
damaged city centre, and another 150,000 pounds (232,500 US
dollars) to support an international urban design competition that
will provide the blueprint for the work.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the package, Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime
Minister, said the goal should be to "redesign the city centre for
the 21st century", and he hoped that the world's best architects
and urban planners would take part.

According to the agreements, France will help Haiti revive its
education by providing textbooks and helping organize public
schools, and help it run its financial administration, establish a
public health network and develop pig-breeding trade.
</P>

France will soon send 5,000 tons of maize and some other food
products worth one million francs to the poverty-striken country.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic Says to Have Taken Over Full Power from Karadzic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July (Xinhua) -- Acting President of Bosnian Serb
state Biljana Plavsic said here today that she has taken over all
presidential powers in the Serb entity Republika Srpska since June
30.
</P>
<P>
Prior to that, there was a brief vacuum, Plavsic told reporters
after meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic transferred power to
his deputy Plavsic on Sunday under intensive international
pressure. International community has threatened to reimpose
sanctions against Bosnian Serbs unless Karadzic, who was indicted
as war criminal by the international war crimes tribunal, stepped
down. Karadzic also said Wednesday he would not run for the
upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Plavisc, also a hardliner, said intensive efforts were under
way for the implementation of the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
"We are now trying to include all institutions and all
Republika Srpska departments so as to make up for the lost time
and to have the Dayton accords implemented in the envisaged
order," Plavsic said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting with Milosevic, Plavsic offered strong
assurances that the Serb entity would continue successfully to
implement the Dayton peace accords, according to Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic stressed the significance of all-round cooperation of
the Republika Srpska leadership with the international community
which is engaged in the successful implementation of the peace
plan, especially in preparations for the September 14 elections.
</P>
<P>
It was in the greatest interest of Bosnian Serb citizens to
have democratically and legally elected institutions, which would
no doubt help reaffirm the Bosnian serb entity, the Serbian
president said.

<HEADLINE> Cost of Living in Britain the Lowest in EU: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The cost of living in Britain is the
lowest in the 15-nation European Union (EU), according to a survey
published today.
</P>
<P>
Britain is put by ECA International, a global network of nearly
800 multinational member companies which track the cost of more
than 200 goods and services, at the bottom of its Cost of Living
League of EU countries.
</P>
<P>
Within the EU, Denmark keeps its place as the most expensive
country, with goods and services 71 percent more costly than
Britain.
</P>
<P>
Among 28 European countries surveyed, Britain this year comes
24th, beaten for cheapness only by Hungary, Poland, Turkey and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland emerges as the most expensive country in Europe and
is number three out of 108 countries surveyed across the world. It
is 87 percent more costly than Britain, which is placed 61st in
the world, two places lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the most expensive country in the world, as it has
been for more than five years. It is now reckoned to be 134
percent more expensive than Britain.
</P>
<P>
Barry Rodin, a senior ECA consultant, said: "The cost of living
in Britain has been cheaper than other countries in the EU since
Britain left the exchange-rate mechanism in 1992."
</P>
<P>
"It would be expected that European unity would have led to a
convergence in the cost of living but these figures show this
hasn't happened. There is still a significant gulf between
countries like Denmark and Germany at the top and Portugal and the
UK at the bottom," he added.

<HEADLINE> Former Elf President Accused of Abusing Social Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Loik Le Floch Prigent, president of
the National Railway Company of France (SNCF) and former president
of the Elf-Aquitaine oil group, today was accused of abusing
social funds by a local court here.
</P>
<P>
Judge Eva Joly told the 52-year-old SNCF president that she is
also considering to have him put in jailed.
</P>
<P>
Prigent, who was president of Elf-Aquitaine oil company from
May 1989 to August 1993, was also accused of "hiding the action
of abusing social funds, abusing of trust, hiding the action of
abusing trust, spreading false information and presenting false
documents."
</P>
<P>
Elf-Aquitaine gulped down 800 million francs (153 million U.S.
dollars) in the process of saving the textile group Bidermann in
early 1990's, and this raised doubt over possible financial abuse
by the leaders of the group.
</P>
<P>
Two French watch-dog institutions, the Commission of Stock
Exchange Operations and the Court of Accounts, submitted two
reports expressing doubt over the case, and the Paris Attorney
General, or le Paquet de Paris, launched an inquiry into the
affair in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry led to the detention of the head of the Bildermann
group, Maurice Bidermann on May 24, and the judicial investigation
of six other persons, including the ex-wife of Prigent, Fatima
Belaid, who was suspected of having benefited from the
"generosity of Maurice Bidermann". She was accused of "covering
the action of abusing social properties".
</P>
<P>
Prigent has claimed his innocence in the case.

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Zaire has threatened the use of
force against the 1.5 million Rwandan refugees on its territory
and made an urgent call to the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) on their prompt repatriation.
</P>
<P>
"It is not that we are driving them out. We are obliged to do
that unless there is a prompt repatriation, because our national
security is severely threatened by them," declared Zairian Deputy
Premier Kititua Ntuoiansi at the end of the OAU Council of
Ministers meeting tonight.
</P>
<P>
"Our police are paralyzed before the Rwandan refugees who are
often armed. That's why we have to use the military," said
Ntuoiansi who is in charge of Zaire's foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the Rwandan delegation has made an "urgent call" to
the council of ministers meeting which began this morning.
</P>
<P>
Senior Zairian officials said here today that the Council of
Ministers meeting is set to pass a resolution on the Rwandan
refugees which the Zairian government hopes will include stepping
up the repatriation process.
</P>
<P>
Zaire, with its largest share of refugee burden in Africa, now
hosts 1.6 million African refugees on its territory, including
over one million Rwandans, mostly the majority Hutus who fled for
fear of revenge for the 1994 ethnic killings at home.
</P>
<P>
Reports say the Rwandan refugees are now forming an army with
trafficked arms, causing instability to both Zaire and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"It is simply beyond our capacity to manage them any more,"
said Ntuoiansi in an interview with Xinhua earlier today.
