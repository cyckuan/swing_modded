L.A. SWEEPS DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Seemingly finished by the heat, by the strength-sapping
humidity, by two goals it never should have surrendered, the Galaxy
_ and the plan to sweep the Dallas Burn in the first round of Major
League Soccer's playoffs _ looked as good as dead Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Then arrived the most remarkable occurrence in a season packed
full of them: Three goals in the final 10{ minutes, the finale on
an unimpeded Clint Mathis run, and L.A. _ somehow, some way _
pulled out a dramatic 3-2 triumph before 8,130 at the Cotton Bowl
to earn a place in the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Galaxy's depth that made the difference and left
Octavio Zambrano looking like a genius, his three second-half
substitutions changing the tenor of a match that, at least for the
first 75 minutes or so, L.A. had no business winning.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching the Burn make the most of nearly every
opportunity that fell its way, the Galaxy found its stride in the
final minutes, using strikes by Ezra Hendrickson and Paul Caligiuri
and Mathis' stirring run from midfield to claim the best-of-three
series two games to none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you,'' said Zambrano, ``it's the crunch when you can
see the real character of some players, and Clint and Ezra both
came through in the crunch. You need that element if you aspire to
go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been the Galaxy's aspiration since the exhibition season,
and two more victories _ over either Chicago or Colorado starting
Saturday at the Rose Bowl _ will it them back to the MLS Cup on its
home turf, where in 1996 it saw a 2-0 lead disappear in the final
minutes of a loss to D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it took advantage of a weary Dallas squad that didn't
have enough juice, or a deep enough bench, to hold onto what looked
like an insurmountable lead.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that way because L.A., too, was exhausted, wilted by
86-degree heat and 70 percent humidity. But three changes _ Mathis
for midfielder Martin Machon and Hendrickson for left back Joe
Franchino in the 57th minute, and Wellington Sanchez for midfielder
Danny Pena in the 63rd _ provided everything it needed to turn
things around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our three guys gave us the shot of adrenaline we needed in a
crucial moment,'' said Zambrano. ``We were tired, no doubt about
it. One time I looked out there and Cobi (Jones), Welton, Mauricio
(Cienfuegos) and Carlos (Hermosillo) were just standing. They were
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was up to those three guys to make it happen and they made
it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So did some tactical adjustments. With the Burn sitting back
trying to protect a 2-0 lead _ forged with goals by Brian Haynes in
the 44th minute and Jason Kreis in the 48th _ Zambrano sent
everyone forward except central defenders Robin Fraser and Steve
Jolley. Sanchez, making his second appearance since mid-July,
encountered little opposition in midfield and was able to direct an
attack that spent most of the final 15 minutes camped around the
Dallas box.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrickson halved the deficit in the 80th minute, getting into
the goalmouth to volley home a sharp Cienfuegos cross from left of
the net, and Caligiuri evened things in the 85th, soaring above
Jorge Rodriguez to head in a Cienfuegos free kick earned by Sanchez
on a run from midfield.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to freeze Burn defenders, who turned into spectators
for Mathis' run in the 88th minute. It started on the right wing,
with Mathis playing two passes with Jolley to open space, the
taking off unchallenged toward Dallas' box.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody stepped up to confront him on the 30-yard run; Jones,
from the left wing, ran through the Burn box, taking defender
Richard Farrer with him, and Rodriguez stepped over to cut off a
passing lane, leaving an open path to the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just opened up in the middle,'' Mathis said. ``I took a big
touch and was about to take a shot, and then (Jones) led Farrer out
of the play and left me some space. So I decided to take another
touch, looked up and saw an opening in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   He got within 14 yards of the goal and curled the ball with his
right foot past goalkeeper Mark Dodd and just inside the far post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like we self-destructed,'' Dodd said afterward. ``We
played our hearts out, left everything on the field and attacked
with purpose. For whatever reason, we didn't have the discipline,
the organization _ I don't know what. We just didn't have what it
takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, finding ample space behind L.A.'s defense, could have
sent the series back to L.A. for a decisive third game with better
finishing. Chad Deering, moved to the wing in one of coach Dave
Dir's adjustments after Thursday's 6-1 loss, beat Galaxy goalkeeper
Kevin Hartman at the left post in the fifth minute but fired into
the side netting of an open goal; and Kreis beat an offsides trap
to go one-on-one with Hartman in the 26th but did little with the
opportunity, his 13-yarder swept aside by the Galaxy goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes broke the deadlock just before halftime, slipping between
Caligiuri and Pena, streaking into the box and past Hartman, then
firing into an open net.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2-0 three minutes into the second half thanks to a Fraser
miscue to the left of the Galaxy goal. He tried a back pass to
Hartman but hit it poorly, and Mickey Trotman ran onto it as it
reached the 6-yard box. Hartman went out to confront the Dallas
striker, who dropped the ball back for Kreis, who eluded Jolley and
fired into an open net.
</P>
<P>
   That should have been enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those matches,'' Zambrano said. ``One thing
about this team I have to say: It never gives up. There's always an
option, always an opportunity, to still come back and win.''

A GREAT ESCAPE BY PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The NFL Films cameras had to work overtime to
capture every moment of Sunday's game between the Patriots and New
Orleans Saints. Artistically, this was far short of ``Gone With the
Wind,'' but for pure entertainment, it was ``Blazing Saddles'' and
better.
</P>
<P>
   It had turnovers, questionable officials' calls, and plays that
perhaps you've never seen before. In the midst of all the chaos, a
27-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri with three seconds remaining
gave the Patriots an all-too-close-for-comfort 30-27 win.
</P>
<P>
   The win improved the Patriots' rec-ord to 3-1 and dropped the
Saints to 3-1. The Jets' win over the Dolphins left New England in
a tie for first place in the AFC East with Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to execute better,'' said linebacker Ted Johnson,
whose efforts helped stop the Saints' running game dead in its
tracks (39 yards). Once again the Patriots had trouble stopping
their opponents when it really mattered, though, as the Saints
converted 9 of 18 third-down plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game shouldn't be that close,'' Johnson said. ``We hurt
ourselves. There are going to be games when we're not going to win,
but we've got to win the games we're supposed to win and we did. It
wasn't pretty, but given the way the game ended, we'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe (21 of 35 for 317 yards and one touchdown) survived
three interceptions and a fumble that was recovered by New
Orleans's Keith Mitchell and returned 63 yards for a second-quarter
touchdown. Bledsoe led the winning drive, completing four straight
passes for 62 yards to set up Vinatieri after the Saints tied it
with 1:32 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great confidence in my two-minute offense and under two
minutes I expect to be able to score,'' Bledsoe said. ``Vincent
Brisby is a good example. He comes in with two minutes to play and
he makes the key catch of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After New Orleans tied it, 27-27, Chris Canty couldn't take the
ensuing kickoff past the 20. Bledsoe, in the shotgun, hit Troy
Brown for 9 and 16 yards, Ben Coates for 10, and Brisby for 27 to
the Saints 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints, who had been blitzing Bledsoe most of the afternoon,
were selective on the final drive. They blitzed on the second play
to Brown, then on a running play by Robert Edwards that lost 2
yards. A too-many-men-on-the-field penalty put the ball at the 15.
After Edwards, who gained a career-high 97 yards on 22 carries, ran
6 yards to the 9, the Patriots were ready for Vinatieri, whose
winning field goal was his third of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only a few seconds left on the clock and it's the
final play, so sure it's a little nerve-wracking,'' said Vinatieri.
``But the offense did a great job getting the ball downfield and
putting me in a nice spot to kick it.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinatieri's heroics were necessary because of one of the more
bizarre plays you'll see. With New England ahead, 27-24, just
before the two-minute warning, Tom Tupa punted from the Saints 45.
Cover man Tebucky Jones caught up to the ball just shy of the end
zone and batted it back toward teammate Larry Whigham, who batted
it to the turf. The ball hit off a Saints player and bounced toward
the Saints' Earl Little, who picked it up. But Andre Hastings, who
had a huge day picking on Chris Canty for six receptions, ripped
the ball out of Little's hands and ran.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots thought the ball was downed. No whistle had blown,
but 99 times out of 100, the ball would have been ruled down.
Whigham claimed he put his hands on Little's shoulders, but the
referee didn't see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to sit it down at the 1-yard line because I thought my
momentum was going to carry me into the end zone,'' said Whigham.
``One of their guys drop-kicked the ball into the end zone and the
other one downed it. I put both of my hands around his shoulders,
because if I hit him, you get a flag.''
</P>
<P>
   But special teams coach Dante Scarnecchia, while acknowledging
that the play is ruled down at the discretion of the official, said
his team needed to finish off the play regardless. ``That's what
I'm (upset) about,'' said Scarnecchia. ``We need to finish plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hastings nearly finished the Patriots, running 76 yards
down the right sideline before Tupa shoved him out of bounds at the
Patriots 25. But the Saints had to settle for a 37-yard field goal
by Doug Brien, tying the game at 27 with 1:29 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots led, 17-14, at the half after New Orleans put
together an 80-yard drive in the final 2:41, scoring on a sharp
1-yard Danny Wuerffel pass to Cam Cleeland with time running out.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Thomas made a huge defensive play on the first
possession of the second half, picking off Wuerffel on a screen
pass to Lamar Smith. Thomas put a nice spin move on Wuerffel and
ran 24 yards to make it 24-14, Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged field goals to make it 27-17 with 4:44
remaining in the third quarter. Then things started to get a bit
squirmy.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Brown, who had a huge day returning punts (5 for 104
yards), ran one back 38 yards to the Saints 22 after Whigham
pressured Royals and rolled into his left leg, injuring the punter.
There was no penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe followed with his third interception, which went
right through Coates's hands to Tyrone Drakeford at the Saints 25.
</P>
<P>
   Wuerffel (25 of 47 for 278 yards) directed a well-run drive as
he picked on Canty most of the time, including a 22-yard pass to
Hastings to the Patriots 20. He capped it with a 7-yard toss to
Smith, making it 27-24 with 7:44 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   That made all the miscues of the first half, when New England
outgained the Saints, 274 to 122, but only held a 3-point lead,
seem huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have scored some early points and I let us down,''
Bledsoe said. ``When you have a chance to make up for those
mistakes, you have to do it. That's what we live for.''

POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION AT GRADE SCHOOL HAS PARENTS CONFUSED, ANGRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT AND JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Nearly two weeks after a legislative hearing
raised concerns of possible elevated toxic contamination at
Jefferson New Middle School in South Central Los Angeles, the
school district is running a battery of new tests to determine
whether the school should be closed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, it has left notification of parents up to a
state agency.
</P>
<P>
   The suddenness of the new round of testing _ after parents
previously were assured by the district the site is safe, and that
an on-site filtration system was working properly _ has confused
parents and enraged community activists and some area politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure who to believe,'' said Pedro Perez, whose son
attends the school, about a quarter-mile away from their home.
</P>
<P>
   They and other parents said that in the absence of complete test
results and Los Angeles Unified School District assurances, they
wonder whether toxics from the school are to blame whenever their
children come home with rashes or other minor afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair. They're risking the health of my children,''
said Maria Elena Aguinaga, 35, who lives just 100 feet from the
school.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD officials acknowledge there have been problems with the
cleanup of toxic solvents at the site, resulting this week in a
couple dozen citations and a clean-up and abatement order from two
oversight agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But they said there is no indication those problems have
resulted in contamination levels high enough to pose a health risk
to children and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked each of the agencies, is there anything that you
believe suggests we should close the school, and the answer was no,
that they knew of no risk justifying busing 2,000 kids two hours
each day to another school,'' said Barry Groveman, the district's
outside counsel from the Los Angeles firm Proskauer Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-acre site, located across the street from a contaminated
Superfund site, once housed a World War II defense plant, furniture
manufacturers, metal plating operations and a gas station,
according to a report by the state's Joint Legislative Audit
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including state Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale,
said the district should shut the school down until it can
guarantee it is safe for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't taken an aggressive enough approach,'' Wildman
said. ``I'm extremely concerned about the safety of the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD Superintendent Ruben Zacarias said he has a contingency
plan ready if test results expected by midweek show dangerously
elevated toxic levels or if state agencies order it closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew that any state agency said that place is not fit for
kids, I would close it immediately,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 assessment by the district, with state oversight,
concluded that there is no health threat to students.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the concern is the on-site filtering system, or
soil vapor extraction system, which has been shut down periodically
this year. Those shutdowns ``may pose a risk of indoor air
contamination within school buildings,'' the state Department of
Toxic Substances Control said in a letter sent to parents in the
past week.
</P>
<P>
   One of the toxics of concern is methylene chloride, a
carcinogen. It is one of the solvents the vapor extraction system
was supposed to keep from getting into the school's air, according
to regulatory officials.
</P>
<P>
   There is no direct evidence methylene chloride, or any other
contaminant, has migrated from the soil into classrooms during
stoppages of the filtration system, because direct air sampling has
not been required under the system's operating permit, said Barry
Wallerstein, South Coast Air Quality Management District acting
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The air sampling the district has agreed to do this weekend as
part of a plan approved by Department of Toxic Substances Control
and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board is designed
to answer that question, said Angelo Bellomo, vice president of
Environmental Strategies Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the permit likely will be changed to require such
direct air sampling in the future, Wallerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the vapor extraction system were detected when
levels of both methylene chloride and total volatile organic
compounds in excess of the permit level were found at a test point
within the VES itself, Wallerstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Those violations are ``technical'' in that they do not suggest
an actual health risk, but nonetheless will be referred to AQMD's
in-house prosecutor for action, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The levels, while violating the permit, were still so low that
had they gone directly into the air they would have been within
safe limits, Wallerstein added.
</P>
<P>
   Groveman said the district has not sent out its own update on
the situation absent a complete review. Further, he said it was
only toward the end of the week that the district's plan to test
the site was approved by regulatory agencies, who themselves had
scrambled throughout the week to deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be notifying parents as soon as we get the facts,''
Groveman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo said in addition to air samples, the soil at the site
also will be retested for contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   Toxic Substances Control officials have told parents that soil
used to backfill the site may have come from Caltrans, which could
indicate a higher lead content. The soil was tested previously, but
not with as strict a protocol as Caltrans-procured dirt would have
required.
</P>
<P>
   The Regional Water Quality Control Board is also requiring a
plan to test for hexavalent chromium, another carcinogen, that has
been found in groundwater at the northwestern corner of the school.
No water sampling tests have been scheduled for this weekend, but
they are planned in the longer term.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he wants to believe the school, which opened last
summer, is safe. But, he said if district officials can't establish
that soon with certainty, ``I'm not going to let my son attend that
school.''

PATRIOTS FOUND A WAY TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ It was not the kind of game you copy onto
videotape cassettes and send home for your friends and relatives to
watch and appreciate. It was not pretty, at least it wasn't pretty
very often.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the way it was supposed to be nor the way it should
have been, but Sunday was the kind of victory that forces teams to
come to your house on some frozen Sunday in January when everything
is on the line and home field counts for something. By then you've
forgotten all about an October afternoon in New Orleans when you
escaped your own errors and won despite yourself.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened Sunday to the New England Patriots. They
won when they could have lost, which says something about them.
They won when not so long ago they would have lost, which says more
about them. They won despite their best efforts to stop themselves
from winning, which says everything about them. What it says is,
barring injuries and acts of God, they're going to win a lot of
games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rookie year, my second year, my third year, we probably
would have lost this game,'' admitted Patriots wide receiver Troy
Brown, who is now in his sixth year and glad of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had 10 chances to lose Sunday to a Saints team that
shouldn't have beaten them once if they played 100 times. They
turned the ball over four times. They allowed rag-armed quarterback
Danny Wuerffel to throw for nearly 300 yards. They gave up pass
plays of 32, 23, and 21 yards, and got smoked on seam routes more
often then logic would argue is possible. Worst of all, they gave
up a 76-yard punt return because nobody thought to touch a guy down
on one knee with the ball in his hands in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they played like some of the Patriot teams New
England would like to forget. The difference is they won anyway and
in the National Football League those are often the wins that
separate Super Bowl teams from teams that have to go to Pittsburgh
on a frozen Sunday in January and don't quite survive the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's as difficult as it can get to overcome four
turnovers against an undefeated team,'' Patriots coach Pete Carroll
said after his team had stuffed a 30-27 victory in the satchel by
virtue of a 27-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal with three seconds to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have made it more difficult. But we showed the
will to fight back and overcome adversity we created. We had the
opportunity to seize the game and we didn't. It could have been an
easier day but I'm proud of the way we held on and won.''
</P>
<P>
   They held on by answering whenever the scrappy but undermanned
Saints thought they'd broken through. The first time came after
linebacker Keith Mitchell picked up a Drew Bledsoe fumble and ran
it back for a 63-yard touchdown in the second quarter to give New
Orleans a 7-3 lead. The Saints came right back and intercepted a
Bledsoe pass at their 46. Another score and the Superdome would
have been as loud as a Def Leppard concert.
</P>
<P>
   Instead silence reigned when Ty Law intercepted a Wuerffel pass
three plays later and Bledsoe threw a screen to Derrick Cullors for
43 yards. Next thing you knew it was 10-7 New England because
Vincent Brisby was standing in the end zone with a 6-yard touchdown
catch.
</P>
<P>
   It went that way all day. The inferior but unflappable Saints
scoring points at key moments and the superior but fallible
Patriots responding time and again until they finally checkmated
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the end of the half, for example, New England's
defense made the classic mistake of allowing a team to drive 80
yards for a score as time ran out right after they had pushed their
lead to 17-7. The suddenly re-energized Saints came out to start
the second half trailing by only 3 and believing in themselves.
This could have been a turning point, but the Patriots stymied it
by forcing Wuerffel into an unwise pass under pressure that lineman
Henry Thomas intercepted and returned 24 yards for a touchdown,
putting on a Barry Sanders-like pirouette to elude a tackler along
the way. New England was back in charge.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? The Saints came right back to score but only
got a field goal after having four shots from inside the New
England 6. And the Patriots answered immediately with three of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of game that frays the nerves of fans and
coaches because those four turnovers and defensive lapses seemed to
have negated a seven-sack day and Bledsoe's 317 yards passing and
Robert Edwards's nearly 100 yards (97 to be exact) rushing and
Terry Glenn's 105 yards receiving when the Saints tied it with 92
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints did that the way they did it the whole day, by making
a play when none seemed possible. One second a New England punt
seemed to have been downed on the Saints 1. Next moment, Andre
Hastings had stolen the ball from teammate Earl Little and made a
run-for-your-life, 76-yard return to New England's 25.
</P>
<P>
   On many afternoons in many other years, this final folly would
have finished the Patriots. Their defense would have cracked but
this one refused to buckle, allowing a tying field goal but no
more.
</P>
<P>
   On many afternoons in many other years this final frustration
would have led to the offense overreaching and killing itself. But
no more.
</P>
<P>
   Instead an offense that had produced four turnovers refused to
make a fifth. It marched 70 yards in 86 seconds with Bledsoe
dissecting a defense now fearful of rushing him with the wild
abandon it had earlier in the game. So, in the end, it was the
Saints back on their heels, not the Patriots, because New Orleans's
coaches understood who had made New England's life difficult all
day and it really was not them.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a defense in retreat, Bledsoe completed four straight
throws for just enough yardage to set up the winning field goal and
everyone left for the airport happy. In a long season, any team
will have days like this. Even the best of teams will, as the 49ers
showed in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   It is the teams that survive such days who don't have to pack
their galoshes in January and head off to play in stadiums they'd
rather avoid. If that is the way things end up for the Patriots, it
will be because of days like this one when they won simply because
they refused to accept a defeat of their own making.

SAINTS LIVED BY BLITZ, THEN LOST WITHOUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ If he had it to do all over again, he would have
done it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back,'' said Saints defensive coordinator Zavan
Yaralian, ``I would keep blitzing him again. As the game went
along, I became less enchanted with our blitzes, because they made
most of their big plays when we were blitzing. But, all of the good
things we did today, and we did a lot of good things, came when we
were blitzing.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Mike Ditka was right on the money when he said after
the game, ``New England beat us in every phase of the game.
Offense, defense, special teams. The amazing thing was, we still
had a chance to win it at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this game, the Patriots were the only team in the
league with no turnovers. They went through three games without a
fumble or interception. But Sunday Drew Blesdoe was responsible for
four turnovers _ three interceptions and a fumble that was returned
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into the game hoping for turnovers,'' said Yaralian.
``We knew our defense did not match up well against their offense.
There were too many places where they had the edge on us. Our hope
was to get turnovers and make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strip for a touchdown to give us the lead,'' 7-3 early in
the second quarter, ``was the kind of thing I hoped for. Before the
game, I thought we might battle them into the fourth quarter and
pull out a win. We did. But in the end, we made some fundamental
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where Yaralian could second-guess himself. After the
Saints tied it, 27-27, the Patriots started from their own 20 with
1:21 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Yaralian decided to play it safe. ``In the second half, their
big plays came when we blitzed. We had a couple of guys they were
working on, and we couldn't cover it up. They wanted to go after
them. We wanted to protect them. We couldn't cover the crossing
pattern. Terry Glenn had our guys backing off and when they did, he
cut across the middle. We weren't jumping on him the way we should
have when we're blitzing. Our guys backed up, and he took off
across the middle and made big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn had four catches for 105 yards, a 26-yard average. So
Yaralian decided to drop into zones. Bledsoe adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that kind of game,'' said Yaralian. ``We did something
on defense. They would adjust. Then we would do something else,
they would adjust. I bet we blitzed them 30 times in the game. When
we got to him, we made the big play. When we didn't, they made the
big play.''
</P>
<P>
   On the last drive, Bledsoe took control. He looked away from
Glenn, who was double-covered. In just 38 seconds, he completed
four passes, two to Troy Brown for 9 and 16, then to Ben Coates for
10, then Vincent Brisby for 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coates can kill you,'' said Walt Corey, the former Bills
defensive coordinator, now with the Saints. ``He's so big, and you
know Bledsoe is looking for him, and we still couldn't stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   The catch was Coates's seventh of the day. During the week,
after looking at film of the Patriots' games, the Saints protested
that the officials were letting Coates get away with murder,
pushing off the defenders before making his break to the ball.
Nothing happened to change it. Coates still pushed off and made the
big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Coates catch left New England at the New Orleans 45,
not yet in range for kicker Adam Vinatieri. Yaralian pondered
blitzing, but decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went with a cover-two zone,'' Yaralian said. ``Our guys
just played it wrong.'' He said Bledsoe's completion to Brisby to
the Saints' 18 never should have happened. ``We had two guys there,
and neither one of them played it right. But those things happen.
We made some good plays, we just didn't make enough of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you blitz the way we do,'' said Saints general manager
Bill Kuharich, ``you are living and dying by the sword.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints do not have the players to match the Patriots
straight up. They had to try to win with gimmicks and hustle. They
came close.
</P>
<P>
   New England won this game on defense. Henry Thomas ran back an
interception for a touchdown. The Patriots sacked Danny Wuerffel
seven times, and knocked him down at least 20 times. They held the
Saints to 39 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   However, they should not be happy about the way the pass defense
played. Andre Hastings chewed up Chris Canty. No one could cover
Saints rookie tight end Cam Cleeland, who had eight catches for 64
yards. It was clear that when he needed a play, Wuerffel was going
to look for Cleeland, much like Bledsoe looks for Coates.
</P>
<P>
   At least, the Saints had some excuse for getting beat up a
little on defense. Tom Tupa's punting and the Patriots return game
kept New Orleans on its heels.
</P>
<P>
   But Wuerffel led scoring drives of 80 and 75 yards, almost all
through the air, and the Patriots had better be concerned about the
future because they are going to face a lot better passers than
Danny Wuerffel. But perhaps none more courageous.

HASTINGS NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ He had a sensational day. Six catches for 73 yards
and a punt return for another 76 yards that almost went down as one
of the greatest plays in National Football League history.
</P>
<P>
   But when Sunday's game against the Patriots was over, the
Saints' Andre Hastings apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let my teammates down,'' said Hastings, ``I should have gone
all the way on that play. If I did, we would have won the game.
Look at it in here (the Saints' locker room). It's so quiet because
we lost. If I did better, we would have won. This would have been
different.''
</P>
<P>
   With just over two minutes to play in the game, the Patriots
were clinging to a 27-24 lead when punter Tom Tupa lofted a beauty
that bounced high at the goal line. First Tebucky Jones batted it,
then Larry Whigham, who had a great day on special teams for New
England, leaped high, gliding a foot above the goal line, and
flipped the ball back over his shoulder, trying to stop it on the
1.
</P>
<P>
   The ball landed, bounced off a Saints player, and rolled into
the end zone. No whistle. The Saints' Earl Little picked up the
ball, dropped to one knee, and cltuched the ball to his stomach. No
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a thing called the `first touch' rule that Bobby
April taught us when I was in Pittsburgh,'' Hastings said. April
was the special teams coach of the Steelers when Hastings was in
Pittsburgh. They're both with the Saints now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first touch rule is that if a player on the punting team
touches the punt first, then a player on the receiving team can do
anything he wants, and not have to worry, as long as the whistle
has not blown. They (the Patriots) touched it first. The whistle
did not blow. I said to Earl, `Give me the ball, give me the ball.'
I got it from him and started back.''
</P>
<P>
   While Patriot players were jumping around congratulating each
other, thinking they had pinned the Saints on their own 1-yard
line, Hastings knew better.
</P>
<P>
   He started racing along the Saints sideline, picking up blockers
along the way. A touchdown would have put the Saints ahead and on
the verge of an astonishing upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it ,'' said Hastings, ``I had just one man
left to beat (punter Tom Tupa). I had the choice _ to go inside and
cut back to the middle, or stay outside. I thought I had him beat
to the outside, but he pushed me and I couldn't stay inbounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints had to settle for a field goal, tying it at 27, and
the Patriots came back with a field goal with three seconds left to
win, 30-27.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastings had no reason to feel bad, other than his team's
loss. He was terrific.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at Mike Ditka's postgame press conference, the coach's
first positive comment came without a question asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre Hastings made some plays out there today that I hadn't
seen before,'' Ditka said. ``He made some catches that defied
logic.''
</P>
<P>
   The punt return is one of the most unusual in the books. But in
this town of voodoo and black magic, crazy things can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a game here when I was with the Saints,'' said Patriots
receivers coach Steve Walters, ``where a guy from the Rams did
something similar and it went for a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Robert Bailey, taking it 103 yards for a score.
Fortunately for the Patriots, they avoided a repeat. Hastings, with
a choice to make, left or right, went right, which proved to be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tupa had a fantastic game for them,'' said April. ``His punts
were great, and then at the end, he made that play that saved the
touchdown.''

JETS GO WITH PAT HAND TO DOWN DOLPHINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Bill Parcells seemed almost happy late
Sunday afternoon. Not overjoyed, definitely not satisfied. But
happy, or at least not too angry.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells's New York Jets had taken a 20-9 victory over Miami,
thanks to former Patriots Keith Byars and Curtis Martin, and
rejuvenated quarterback Vinny Testaverde. The win gave the Jets a
2-2 record and dropped Miami to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are kind of starting over,'' Parcells said. ``The defense
made a couple of plays that helped and the offense was good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we do some awful dumb things. Some of these players that
continue to do them, they're going to have to change their ways or
I am not going to be playing them anymore, because it's about to
cost us. We got away with a few things, exercising poor judgments,
mistakes. Veteran players are making them. Not a lot. But four or
five things that, had they not done them, could have made it a lot
easier for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells will not likely follow through on those threats. But he
will use one of Martin's few mistakes for motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many carries he had, I don't know anything,''
Parcells said. ``But he ran out of bounds to stop the clock on his
30th carry, and that wasn't too smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that carry was a 13-yard pass reception on the first
play of the Jets' final possession. Testaverde's right arm was
about to be yanked out of its socket, so he flipped a lefthanded
shovel pass to Martin. Testaverde then tossed a 17-yard completion
to Byars, who set a league record for career receptions by a
running back, as the Jets maintained possession.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's poise and resourcefulness were welcomed by
Parcells, but he was not so content by the controversy that is
brewing about his starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did enough to win the game,'' Parcells said. ``It wasn't
real pretty. We were going to try not to turn it into a passing
game, if we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Testaverde would start next week at St. Louis, Parcells
said, ``I didn't say that. The only persons asking those questions
are you people and my answer is the same. I'm not going to answer
'em anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Testaverde, ``I just want to keep playing well and,
whatever his decision, I'm confident in my abilities. I'll go with
whatever he decides, so it's a win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, it has been a lose-win situation. Glenn Foley
started the opening games, but was injured and replaced by
Testaverde for the 44-6 win over Indianapolis two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not to be a game to showcase quarterbacks. Dan
Marino was held to 121 yards passing, and Testaverde had a slow
start, especially before Miami defensive end Jason Taylor injured
his left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were unthreatening offensively as they fell behind to
an Olindo Mare field goal in the final seconds of the first
quarter. But on Mare's kickoff, they capitalized on a
blocking-below-the-waist penalty on Bernie Parmalee to take
possession on the Miami 45.
</P>
<P>
   Ten plays later, Testaverde threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to
Keyshawn Johnson, and the Jets gained momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, their offense continued to struggle, but their defense
turned into a steamroller: Miami's offense produced minus-7 yards
on its last two possessions of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Jets' last two possessions of the half produced
six plays that gained yardage, and Testaverde surrendered a fumble
to Shane Burton. But the Jets gained 22 yards on a face mask
penalty and 28 on a pass interference call, setting up a 47-yard
field goal by John Hall for a 10-3 halftime edge.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's next three possessions produced another minus-10 yards
on nine plays. And Testaverde threw a 16-yard completion to Byars
on fourth and 1 to the Miami 7, setting up a 6-yard scoring run by
Martin for a 17-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Byars had six catches for 71 yards and moved past Marcus Allen
on the career list for running backs with 593 receptions.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jets' slipups, Parcells noted that some players had
donned inappropriate footwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not responsible for dressing them,'' Parcells said. ``We
are not talented enough to just show up and play, and if we don't
understand that we'll lose, and I don't know how it's going to go.
We're 2-2. A lot of teams are 2-2.''

PADRES PUT ON BRAVE FACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Streams of unconsciousness while wondering if Kevin Brown can
pitch on no days rest versus the Braves:
</P>
<P>
   It may take that kind of Herculean effort for the Padres to beat
the Braves in the National League Championship Series. The Braves
are the most methodical team in baseball since the old
DiMaggio-to-Mantle era Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the Braves' only concern is having too many
starters. In beating the Cubs in three straight, the firm of
Smoltz, Glavine and Maddox allowed all of 15 hits. Bobby Cox never
had to ponder whether he should start a Kevin Millwood or Denny
Neagle in Game 4 of the Cubs series.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy got two great efforts from Brown, one shaky start
from Andy Ashby, and an unexpected dominating performance by
Sterling Hitchcock on Sunday evening. I'm guessing the Astros won't
rush to see the remake of Alfred Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' this week.
</P>
<P>
   It may be difficult for Bochy to finesse his pitching staff
around the Braves. But before lurching towards Atlanta, Bochy
deserves to be acknowledged for taking a daring risk in moving
Brown's start up.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it looked like a bad decision. Tied 1-1, most
managers would have been confident they could at least split two
games at home, and then play a deciding fifth game with their best
pitcher on the mound. If the Padres had lost Game 3 Saturday, Bochy
would have been torched.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they won, and Houston came out in Game 4 feeling the
pressure of the situation. Randy Johnson did what was expected, but
the nerves of his teammates showed, in the field and at the plate.
Bochy probably clinched the manager of the year award this weekend,
assuming all of the ballots haven't been mailed. ...
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bochy should pray for precipitation. A couple of
well-timed rainouts could allow him to use a three-man rotation and
spot the gritty, nasty Brown for as many as three starts.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1962 World Series, rainouts allowed the Yankees to start
Whitey Ford and Ralph Terry three times each in a seven-game series
with the Giants. And the Yankees won the series in seven. ...
</P>
<P>
   The American League series could be intriguing, or it could be
boring. The Indians have proved feisty since their return to
prominence, and there's enough bad blood between the Indians and
Yankees to bring out the best in both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Yankees could sweep the Indians in four if their
pitching is as dominant on the field as it is on paper. The Yankees
will use a four-man rotation of David Wells, David Cone, Andy
Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez, have a fifth starter in Hideki
Irabu if one is needed, can rely on a deep set-up cast, and boast
of Mariano Rivera as their closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' starters -- Jaret Wright, Dwight Gooden, Charles
Nagy and Batolo Colon -- do not match up, and neither does the
Indian bullpen. Lefties Wells and Pettitte should nullify the bat
of Jim Thome, the most dangerous stick in the Indians lineup. ...
</P>
<P>
   It would have been nice to see the Cubs and Red Sox go a round
further than they did, but their exits do not diminish their
seasons. It was nice for a few days to even dream about such a
World Series matchup. ...
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Angels should be glad they didn't catch Texas in the
A.L. West, considering how easily the Yankees dispatched the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   One has to wonder if Disney Sports wouldn't agree. The bottom
line-oriented company can look back at the 2.5 million attendance
in 1998 with some satisfaction, and will be counting their revenue
from the pricey new concessions into Christmas. From their
perspective, 1998 was a fine success.
</P>
<P>
   A division title would only have delivered one or two more
playoff games and would have heightened fan expectations to do it
again. Disney always seems more content polishing the bottom line
than winning. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now might be a good time to remind people that the Angels, who
used a platoon of Phil Nevin and Matt Walbeck behind the plate this
season, traded for an injured catcher in Charlie O'Brien, and
started Chad Kreuter in key September games, couldn't find a place
on their team for Padres' series star Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, who was traded for Ken Hill in late '97, has been with
five teams in the last three years. It's only fair to also note
that he was never more than a platoon player during his Yankee
years, and that the Yankees didn't keep him even after he had a big
home run enroute to their 1996 World Series title. ...
</P>
<P>
   The offseason should be as interesting for the Dodgers as the
last regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger General Manager Kevin Malone wants to have a manager in
hand by the end of this week. The guy he wants is Montreal's Felipe
Alou. The fact Malone knows his work from their days together in
Montreal is a key factor. If for some reason Alou does not come
west, Malone should seriously consider Davey Lopes, and not just
because he's a former Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes has interned as a coach now for a decade and is widely
respected by players wherever he has worked. He speaks his mind and
demands a lot. Steve Garvey may have been the star of the Dodgers'
infield for those nine years between 1973 and 1981, but Lopes was
the soul of the quartet. ...
</P>
<P>
   Once a manager is in hand, Malone will seek to resolve the Jeff
Shaw situation and launch a search for a No. 1 starter. Those two
items could be linked. If Shaw is determined to get out of L.A.,
Malone would likely seek a starting pitcher in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Malone will undoubtedly take a swing at the top two free agent
pitchers, Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown, but both are likely to
sign with their current teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins reportedly have inquired about reobtaining Charles
Johnson, who is arbitration eligible. The Dodgers might consider a
deal, but only if they believe there is a chance of re-entering the
Mike Piazza sweepstakes. And while the Marlins sucked this season,
their minor league pool of talent is considered the best around.
</P>
<P>
   Malone also needs to find a center fielder, because Raul Mondesi
wants to return to right field, which would then move Gary
Sheffield to left. Two potential local angles would be obtaining
ex-Fullerton star Mark Kotsay from the Marlins or the Angels' Jim
Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers may lack a No. 1 pitcher, but they're confident Chan
Ho Park, Darren Driefort, and Carlos Perez are an acceptable 2-3-4.
The Angels need a starting pitcher, and the Dodgers potentially
could offer Ismail Valdes, who is not considered untouchable, Dave
Mlicki or Brian Bohanon. ...
</P>
<P>
   Braves in seven, Yankees in six. ...

HEALTH OFFICIALS CONSIDER LOWER GRADE FOR THE TRULY AWFUL EATERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MELISSA SCHMITT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- John and Julie Burns love to dine out, and they
try to stay away from restaurants that receive a health inspection
grade of less than a B.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as they prepared to enter a sushi bar recently, the Burnses
were confused because the San Fernando Valley restaurant displayed
a card with a number: 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does a 58 mean?'' asked Julie Burns, 25.
</P>
<P>
   It meant that the restaurant had no paper towels or hand soap in
the employees' bathroom, filthy cutting boards, live and dead
cockroaches in the kitchen area, and pots and pans that were not
sanitized, to name a few problems.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant that like 265 other restaurants across the city,
it didn't score high enough to get the lowest letter grade: a C.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal by Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D.
Antonovich, those restaurants would be tagged with D's _ for dirty
_ and closed. The board is expected to consider the measure Oct.
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer is looking for the letter grade,'' Antonovich
said in announcing his proposal. ``Any restaurant receiving less
than 70 percent has had an easy out under the current ordinance.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Burnses, the measure seems common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't have a grade high enough for a letter, shouldn't
they be shut down?'' Julie Burns asked.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Antonovich's proposal, let alone the entire
letter-inspection program, is necessary remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The number of food-related illnesses reported in the county does
not appear to be on the decline since the program began, said Mike
Spear, director of Environmental Services for the county. ``We
haven't seen anything to reflect that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, restaurants are performing much better on inspection
reports than they did in the beginning. Of the 6,975 facilities
inspected to date, 4,252 received A's, 1,907 received B's and 545
received a grade of C.
</P>
<P>
   County officials said they did not know how much the inspection
program cost, but they say it has been widely popular.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Matthew Kreis, 24, Travis Howard, 26, and Austin Hanks,
28. If the restaurant doesn't make the grade, they said, then it's
not making their dinner either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the food here so much, I don't even think about that A
in the window,'' said Howard while dining at Angel Lena's Soul Food
Kitchen in Sherman Oaks. But Howard said his loyalty, despite the
rice and beans, and those smothered pork chops, is only A _ maybe B
_ deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were a C in the window, it would make a difference,''
Howard said, and Angel Lena's wouldn't be selling him any sweet
potato pie until they made the grade again.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, said Kreis, ``I'd eat in a restaurant that was a C place
if it was the only place around, and I was starving to death.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Valley sushi bar, the problems were so severe
that a C was too good.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means there were many violations,'' said health inspector
Mark Como, who is not one of the inspectors who visited the sushi
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors closed the restaurant for 48 hours for the presence
of cockroaches. The owners attended a hearing, submitted to a
reinspection and were allowed to reopen.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants are only allowed to be re-examined once each year,
at a cost of $161 for a second inspection. That inspection would be
done within 10 days. If the restaurant then passed, a third
surprise inspection would be performed within three months.
</P>
<P>
   All restaurants start with a grade of 100, with points
subtracted for each infraction. There are 44 categories, with items
weighted by importance, Como said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, serving spoiled food would cost 3 points.
Employees not washing their hands before serving would cost 4
points. Reserving food to a customer that was previously served to
another, or using it in food preparation, like salsa for instance,
costs 5 points.
</P>
<P>
   There is no set numerical grade at which a restaurant shuts
down, Como said, adding that any one of five items will close a
restaurant on the spot. They include the presence of rats,
cockroaches or sewage or a lack of hot water.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants are supposed to keep their inspection reports on
hand, readily available for customers to view.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, they can make the judgment for themselves whether
it's safe to eat in a C or lesser place,'' Spear said. ``Customers
can look at the nature of what was marked off. But if it wasn't
safe, it would more than likely have been closed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Valley sushi bar, the bottom line is that
standard rules of cleanliness were not being observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not cleaning. Food is being kept at the wrong
temperature. There are problems with the equipment,'' Spear said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember that all inspections are a
snapshot,'' Spear said. ``Things can change on the day we're not
there. Even for the A place.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Shabbouei, owner of California Pita and Grill in Woodland
Hills, is a supporter of the program and believes Antonovich's
proposal will only improve restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Shabbouei displays an A in his window and recently got licensed
as a certified food handler through the health department.
</P>
<P>
   His restaurant never has had a problem with cockroaches, but
Shabbouei said he can understand how it could happen. And the rules
are too strict, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All it takes is for one box of produce to come into the
restaurant with a roach. ``That's it. You're shut down. And that
would kill my business. It really would. It would kill me,''
Shabbouei said.

PLUMMER TIED A BOW ON `GIFT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The clock read :01.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it,'' Marc Trestman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Cardinals coaches said they did, too. They were on the
field pleading their case, index fingers pointed to the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Metcalf, ball in hand, had just stepped out of bounds at
the Oakland 36-yard line. The Cardinals thought one second
remained. Enough time to try to tie the score with a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It was over.
</P>
<P>
   To their disbelief, time had expired. Coach Vince Tobin's
calculated and questionable gamble had failed.
</P>
<P>
   As surprise gave way to rising anger _ ``The guy must have been
wearing silver and black,'' Jake Plummer said of the Sun Devil
Stadium timekeeper who didn't stop the clock _ the quarterback
turned from the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders were celebrating on his field.
</P>
<P>
   Jake closed his eyes and bit down hard on his mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the field (one official was hit by a water bottle
thrown by an angry fan), No. 16 suddenly broke into a sprint,
running as if trying to distance himself as quickly as possible
from his most frustrating, and perhaps disappointing, day as a
Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   The ``clock guy'' didn't cost Jake's team this game.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the decision not to let Joe Nedney try a 55-yard
field goal with five seconds left, although the play Jake ran
instead surprised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of drew it up,'' Plummer said of the simple 2-yard
sideline pass to Metcalf. You mean, it wasn't in the game plan? You
hadn't run it earlier? ``We've never run it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake knew who was mostly responsible for the Cardinals' 23-20
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He was.
</P>
<P>
   He called his performance ``terrible'' _ two thumbs down. While
he accepted gentle words of support and encouragement from his
teammates, he characterized the back pats as ``b.s.'' Bogus
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   His toughest critic, Plummer said, ``I didn't give us a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals could have won _ perhaps should have won _ but
three interceptions sealed their fate.
</P>
<P>
   The home team led, 14-9, in the second quarter when Plummer
floated a pass in the flat to Adrian Murrell. Plummer never saw
cornerback Charles Woodson hiding in the weeds. Woodson picked off
Plummer's pass and ran 46 yards. There was nothing between him and
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Raiders corner Marquis Walker stole another
Plummer pass and ran to the Cardinals' 4, where the Raiders scored
again. Oakland, 23-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders tried to let the home team come back in the third
quarter, fumbling on their own 16. But Plummer immediately
delivered another pass he wished he could have retrieved the second
the ball left his hand. Larry Centers was open, but the pass was
underthrown. Eric Allen intercepted in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer described his mistakes as if he had carefully placed
each in a box, with tissue paper, and tied the package with a
colorful bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gift-wrapped them,'' he said of his interceptions, ``and
handed them out.'' He called the last one a ``nice, shiny, silver
gift.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone deserved a gift, it was the Cardinals defense. Led by
Simeon Rice, the defense played its best game of the season and put
the home team in position to win its third game in a row. Can
anyone remember the last time the Cardinals were 3-2?
</P>
<P>
   The table was set. A big crowd. A beatable opponent whose
starting quarterback left the game because of an injury. If the
Cardinals had won, it would have been a rebirth of sorts, a turning
point in the season even more exciting than the hatching of a giant
egg at halftime. Out popped the team's new mascot, a person wearing
a red bird suit.
</P>
<P>
   Like the quarterback, the mascot is a work in progress. He
doesn't even have a name.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals start winning games they should, especially at
home, I'm for calling the bird Jake.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if this team can't find a running game and the
quarterback keeps throwing touchdowns to the wrong team, my vote in
the name-the-mascot contest is Shredded Tweet. &QL;

CARDS CAN'T KICK  
 TIME RUNS OUT (MAYBE) ON TYING FIELD GOAL TRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Was there one second left, or wasn't there?
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if the Cardinals had played a magnificent, flawless
game, only to be robbed by a slow-fingered timekeeper on the
closing play of a 23-20 loss to the Oakland Raiders at Sun Devil
Stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But it put a groan-inducing question mark on a performance that
proved that despite the giddiness of two straight wins, the young
Cardinals (2-3) have not yet arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin tried to give kicker Joe Nedney an opportunity
to send the game into overtime, but in the process, he took the
chance away altogether. With the ball at the Raiders 37-yard line
and 5 seconds remaining, Tobin first sent the field-goal team onto
the field. It would have been a 55-yarder, well beyond Nedney's
career best of 47.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the Raiders (3-2) burned their final timeout, Tobin
sent the offense back out in the hope of completing a quick out and
knocking three or four yards off a field-goal try. There was little
time for error, and the coach might have miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be capable of completing a quick out in less than
five seconds,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer, who rallied after putting his team in a big hole
early, completed the pass to Eric Metcalf, who stepped out of
bounds at the Raiders 35, a gain of 2.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bang-bang play. The field-goal try would be 53 yards.
Or so the Cardinals thought.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard clock, however, was full of zeroes, and the
officiating crew didn't dispute it. Thus ended the Cardinals brief
tenure as co-leaders of the NFC East. They fell a game behind the
Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked to me like there was one second left on the clock,''
Tobin said. ``But we didn't get the chance to kick the field goal,
and that is a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Referee Johnny Grier said he asked line judge Gary Arthur, who
is responsible for the time, if the game clock was correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there was no time left, and I went with that,'' Grier
said.
</P>
<P>
   There would have been a slight breeze facing Nedney, just enough
to riffle the streamers atop the uprights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd made it, it would have been an unbelievable play,''
Nedney said.
</P>
<P>
   But the game boiled down to those controversial closing seconds
only because the Cardinals' offense and special teams had made the
kind of plays that players don't live for. Four critical plays _
three of them interceptions by Plummer _ accounted for a 24-point
swing for Oakland after the Cardinals held a 14-6 lead in the the
second quarter:
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf fumbled away a punt, setting up a field goal by former
Cardinals kicker Greg Davis, who was thanked for the memories with
loud boos as he connected from 34 yards (after also converting from
51 and 40) to pull the Raiders within 14-9.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer didn't see Raiders rookie corner Charles Woodson as he
tried to hit Adrian Murrell in the right flat. Woodson picked it
off and took it back 46 yards for a touchdown. Suddenly, the
Cardinals were down, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   On the very next series, Plummer was about to be swept under
another wave of blitzing Raiders. Hit as he threw, the pass was
intercepted by Marquis Walker and returned to the Cardinals 4-yard
line. That set up a touchdown scramble by Donald Hollas, a backup
quarterback who was forced to play after Jeff George was knocked
out early by a groin strain. Just like that, the Cards were down
23-14.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the third quarter, the Cardinals defense gave Plummer
another chance. Linebacker Jamir Miller forced Hollas to fumble and
linebacker Ron McKinnon recovered at the Oakland 16. On the first
snap, Larry Centers was open in the end zone, but Plummer
underthrew him. The ball was intercepted by cornerback Eric Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gift-wrapping them and handing them out today,'' Plummer
said. ``They really didn't beat us, we beat ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   When Plummer's rough day was combined with a Cardinals' ground
game that covered only 49 yards, it nullified a defensive effort
that limited Oakland to 222 total yards and forced three turnovers
and proved that the Cardinals still have plenty of room for growth
before they're playoff contenders. &QL;

MORE LEGAL FINAGLING FOR TYSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The &UR; Mike Tyson psychodrama might be headed for a
Nevada courtroom as early as today in a legal attempt to block
public disclosure of a psychiatric evaluation he underwent in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to the Nevada Athletic Commission, Tyson's
latest psychiatrist,  &UR; Dr. Ronald  &UR; Schouten, that a public reading
was ``unnecessary'' and ``contrary to his best clinical
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: There's a lot of embarrassing stuff in the lengthy
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, doesn't rank as a shock. The worst is always
expected of Tyson. He even expects it of himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe anything in the psychological report could
be more negative on Tyson than his own words are in a current
``Playboy'' interview.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's battalion of lawyers should have tried to ban the
magazine before it went to work on the psychological evaluation. By
now, what can the shrinks tell us that we don't know already?
</P>
<P>
   Another licensing hearing has been scheduled in Las Vegas for
Oct. 19. But all the legal briefs and bluffs make that date look
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in Nevada, the best guess is Tyson will fight
someone, somewhere, somehow before the end of the year. For one
thing, he has to pay all those lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Before he even gets around to his Clinton-sized legal bill,
however, Tyson has a more pressing matter with the Internal Revenue
Service. His reported tax debt is $13 million. Further reports
indicate the IRS will seize his multimillion-dollar homes in Las
Vegas and Connecticut if he doesn't pay up by Dec. 31. &QL; 
Briefly . . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it sounds as if ringside commentators have been taking
all the punches. &UR; Evander Holyfield has been written off as a shot
fighter by many after his sluggish victory over  &UR; Vaughn Bean. How
soon they forget. The same thing was said of Holyfield after a poor
performance in a victory over  &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Czyz. Holyfield went on to upset Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix junior-welterweight  &UR; Ahmed Santos of  &UR; Michael
 &UR; Carbajal's Ninth Street Gym is scheduled for an ESPN2 date against
Las Vegas'
 &UR; James Crayton on Oct. 16 at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   There's still no word on Carbajal's opponent for a projected
comeback later this month at Biloxi, Miss. Promoter &UR; Russell Peltz
wanted Carbajal, once the world's best at 108 pounds, to challenge
for the North American Boxing Federation's 112-pound title in his
first bout in more than a year. But first, trainer and manager
 &UR; Danny Carbajal wants to see how his brother looks in a tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State Boxing Commission was uncomfortable with last
Wednesday's cage fight card at Club Rio. But the show went on
anyway because fighters were classified as amateurs by promoter
 &UR; Scott Maling, a longtime matchmaker for Commission-regulated pro
cards. A similar show at Celebrity Theatre was canceled in January
after pre-fight publicity attracted the attention of Sen.  &UR; John
McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's next commission-regulated, uncaged card is
scheduled for Oct. 13 at Midnight Rodeo, a nightspot at 33rd Avenue
and Indian School Road. Six bouts are scheduled by &UR; Willy Borchert,
a longtime Phoenix trainer who entered the promotional wars in
large part because he wanted to give local kids a chance to fight
in front of a hometown crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Pay-per-view television operators report that &UR; Oscar De La
 &UR; Hoya's victory last month over &UR; Julio Cesar  &UR; Chavez generated
between 650,000 and 700,000 customers. Meanwhile, De La Hoya,
already back at work for a Nov. 21 bout with Ghana's  &UR; Ike  &UR; Quartey,
continues to criticize Chavez for not going beyond the sensational
eighth round. ``I would never, ever do that,'' De La Hoya said.
``Even with a broken nose, with both eyes completely shut, I'd
never quit.'' &QL;

KINGS ROOKIES ON THE BUBBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Kings completed the
exhibition schedule Sunday night and the 24-man regular-season
roster appears close to completion as well.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a last-minute trade, the loss of a player or two in
today's NHL waiver draft or the signing this week of free-agent
defenseman Aki Berg, the Kings look to be set in goal and on
defense, with only a couple of question marks at the forward
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question appears to be whether either of rookies
Josh Green and Olli Jokinen _ or both _ will make the roster that
will travel to Edmonton to start the season Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Following a 4-3 win over the Vancouver Canucks before a crowd of
6,660 at Centennial Garden arena, coach Larry Robinson said much
will hinge on the waiver draft. He also said he wants to be
cautious with his team's top prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the season progresses, kids have ups and downs,'' Robinson
said. ``If you can be patient, it makes sense to keep them around.
It doesn't make sense if they're going to play a couple of games,
then sit a couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Green scored the game-winner Sunday, completing a strong
exhibition season. Jokinen, originally not scheduled to play, had
one of his stronger performances, as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Berg, who is playing in his native Finland, the Kings
must sign him by Friday or lose his services for the season.
General manager Dave Taylor said he isn't optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   In the game, the Kings (6-2-1 in exhibitions) got goals from
Philippe Boucher, Jozef Stumpel, Luc Robitaille and Green to beat
the Canucks (4-3-1).
</P>
<P>
   __ Feeling a draft: Seven Kings, including minor-league goalies
Manny Legace of the Long Beach Ice Dogs and Frederic Chabot, will
be exposed in today's NHL waiver draft. Also exposed are center Ray
Ferraro, forwards Nathan LaFayette and Dan Bylsma, and defensemen
Jaroslav Modry and Mark Visheau.
</P>
<P>
   Visheau, who injured his left thumb in a fight with Stu Grimson
of the Mighty Ducks one week ago, is scheduled to undergo surgery
Tuesday and is expected to miss 7-10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With Visheau out and Rob Blake sidelined by a hip-flexor strain
that the Kings say is mild, the team recalled defenseman Jan
Nemecek from the Ice Dogs. Nemecek, who had two assists, was
expected to be returned to the Ice Dogs after Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bure watch: Canucks general manager Brian Burke on holdout
forward Pavel Bure, who wants out of Vancouver: ``I told the media
the first day of training camp that the next time I talk about
Pavel Bure is to tell you where he's going. I didn't want it to be
a distraction to the team and it hasn't been. If I don't get the
right deal, I've said publicly that he's going to sit the whole
year.''

WANTED: HELP FOR DEFENSE  
 OFFENSE ACCEPTING BLAME FOR THE LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD   
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Outside linebacker Jamir Miller, always honest
and candid, wasn't angry, just frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't blaming the Cardinals' offense for the 23-20 loss to
the Oakland Raiders Sunday, but he also thinks it has to give the
defense more assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take that many snaps every game,'' Miller said of the
Cardinals' defense, which was on the field for 69 plays, second
most this season. ``It's ridiculous. We need help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders scored 17 of their points following three Cardinals'
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' defense, meanwhile, gave up only one touchdown,
and that was on a drive that started on their 4-yard line after an
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't give the game away,'' said Miller, who had 12 tackles
and a sack. ``We can't play like that. Our defense is good enough.
Once we get a lead, we can dominate. But when you give up a lead,
it's hard to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals led, 14-6, before committing four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   How good was the Cardinals' defense?
</P>
<P>
   They held running back Napoleon Kaufman, the AFC's third-leading
rusher, to 58 yards, 32 below his average.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Tim Brown made only two catches for 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks Jeff George, who was knocked out of the game late
in the first quarter because of a groin injury, and his
replacement, Donald Hollas, combined to throw for only 120 yards,
115 below the team average. They were sacked three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense played awesome today,'' said Cardinals quarterback
Jake Plummer, who was intercepted three times, two leading to
Oakland scores and the other in the Raiders' end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamir Miller _ it looked like he was in on every tackle,''
Plummer said. ``The defensive backs played great. We (the offense)
just have to pick up our end of the bargain. We have to go out
there and put points on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals nickel back Kwamie Lassiter intercepted George on
Oakland's opening drive, helping Arizona to a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also recovered two Oakland fumbles, including one
with 1:52 left that gave the offense one last chance.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defensive end Andre Wadsworth sacked Hollas at the
Cardinals 30 and forced the fumble. Cornerback J.B. Brown, starting
for injured Tommy Knight, recovered at the 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came off the back side wide open,'' said Wadsworth, who has
four sacks in the past two games to tie Green Bay's Vonnie Holliday
for the most by an NFL rookie.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals couldn't move the ball closer than the Raiders
38 as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave our offense the ball back and in a position for them
to get where they needed to get, but they couldn't get there,''
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense had allowed the Raiders to run off more than six
minutes before forcing the turnover. Twice the Raiders converted
third downs, including a third-and-13 from the Oakland 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to find a way to get the ball back for our offense a
lot sooner,'' cornerback Aeneas Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Center Aaron Graham exonerated the defense from any blame for
allowing the Raiders to control the clock for much of the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``All day, the defense stepped up and made plays,'' Graham said.
``They gave us great field position. We were just not able to
capitalize. If you get that kind of field position, you have to get
six points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take away the interceptions, we win by 14 points. This was
just a lost opportunity.''

NO EXCUSE FOR TOBIN'S LACK OF FAITH

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - If your kicker has the leg, the decision is
simple.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nedney has the leg.
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't have is the confidence of his head coach, whose
tactical blunders may have cost the Cardinals a victory on a
pivotal Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   You can blame the timekeeper. You can blame the referees. Or you
can blame the man hugging the clipboard.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as Vince Tobin tried to stand by his sideline logic
in the waning moments of a sickening loss to the Raiders, it is
simply indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the pregame,'' Nedney said, ``we were swinging from 58
yards and getting it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why you kick the football. You don't risk some yahoo
failing to turn off the clock in time. You don't risk the
officiating crew having to sort through the chaos and order time
back on the clock while one team is running off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Not with five seconds left. Not in a game that could've served
as a trampoline for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What my reasoning was, it was a 56-, 57-yard field goal
against the wind,'' Tobin said. ``I felt we could get another
three, four yards on a quick out and get out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, the kick was 55 yards. The wind was really a breeze, the
kind that wouldn't ruffle a bad toupee. And if Nedney hits the ball
square, another three, four yards isn't going to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, he's a guy who hits for distance, even if his radar
gets a little quirky.
</P>
<P>
   So Nedney is 0 for 5 beyond 50 yards in his career. He didn't
miss on Sunday. And in that scenario, you have to give him his
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I was in the middle of the field, getting
focused for the kick, then I had to run right off,'' Nedney said.
``People will tell you it's a long shot, a low-percentage kick. But
those are the ones that separate you from other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would've had to hit it perfect. But I would've given it a
ride. I'd have given it the best shot I could. That's what I live
for.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Davis, the opposing kicker, was asked what the odds where
of Nedney nailing the kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   And good enough for Tobin, until the Raiders called a timeout.
Which gave the coach too much time to ponder how little he trusts
his kicker.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of faith was evident in the second quarter. The
Cardinals reached the Oakland 35 with the ``wind'' at their back.
On fourth down, Tobin sent his punter onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ahead at that time, and they weren't doing anything on
offense against us,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, precisely the reason to kick. A chance to extend the lead
to 17-9. A chance to see how locked in Nedney really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little disappointed,'' Nedney said. ``That would've
been a good shot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this wasn't all about coaching. Simeon Rice jumped
offsides on a third-down stop by the Cardinals, eventually leading
to the Raiders' first field goal. Leading 14-6 with a chance to put
the game away, Eric Metcalf fumbled a punt return. And Jake Plummer
threw three of the most costly interceptions you'll ever see.
</P>
<P>
   All told, they were the kind of plays you expect from a team
still learning how to win. A team not that far from a legacy of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   But the sideline decisions were not the kind you expect from a
seasoned head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the final gripe: Who is Donald Hollas and why
didn't the Cardinals try to knock him into the next millennium from
the moment he entered the game? Why didn't they blitz everyone but
the new mascot in attempt to shake, rattle and roll a second-string
quarterback? Why did they allow him time to get comfortable, time
to work his way into the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that was a factor in the ballgame,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it was. And like it or not, so was Tobin. For the wrong
reasons. &QL;

INCUMBENT PRESIDENT TAKES COMFORTABLE LEAD IN BRAZIL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Brazilian voters gave President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso a comfortable lead in the first round of
balloting on Sunday, apparently maintaining the leadership of a
country struggling against economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With 27 percent of the vote counted, Cardoso appeared to have
won 51.3 percent of the vote, compared with 33.9 percent for his
main rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the three-time presidential
candidate of the leftist Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   If he still has a majority when returns are complete, Cardoso
will be declared re-elected without facing a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet members gathering at the presidential palace in Brasilia
on Sunday night called the vote a mandate for the economic measures
that the president is under national and international pressure to
carry out.
</P>
<P>
   With $30 billion having drained from federal reserves since
Russia's economic collapse in late August, and with the stock
market down more than 40 percent this year, the government has been
close to paralyzed by the approach of the election.
</P>
<P>
   It has been negotiating a bailout with the International
Monetary Fund but has been unable to show progress on structural
changes that would cut government expenses over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting is probably not over yet. Though a first round
victory may strengthen Cardoso's hand for the politically sensitive
social security, civil service and tax overhauls ahead, da Silva
appeared to win substantially more votes than the 24 percent
predicted, signaling considerable opposition ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's congressional and senatorial races did not appear to
substantially alter the overall power balance between the
president's governing coalition and the opposition. But with
run-offs slated for Oct. 25 for several unresolved governorships,
legislators will probably be too busy campaigning for their
parties' candidates to support painful economic measures in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with policy makers at meetings of the Group of
Seven industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund in
Washington seeking permanent solutions to ward off the kind of
volatility that is threatening Brazil, after devastating Asia and
Russia, Cardoso is under considerable pressure to put Brazil's
accounts in order. Each day, $300 million to $500 million in dollar
reserves is leaving Brazil for safer countries.
</P>
<P>
   But Gregg Smith, the chief investment strategist at Prudential
Securities in New York, said the international financial markets
were not necessarily expecting big changes from Brazil in the next
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing everybody's going to be watching is whether
there is an IMF and World Bank package to support Brazil, and
whether the Brazilians are starting to take actions to work on the
budget deficit,'' he said. ``If those two things look like they're
moving in the right direction, it will begin to calm financial
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Carlos Alkimin, a political science professor at
Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro and chief of population
studies at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics,
said he did not expect that Cardoso could make progress on
restructuring the government before Oct. 25, because such measures
would require legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he can do is take measures on the administrative level to
cut costs or to play with controls on currency,'' Alkimin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's balloting was somewhat confused, with about half of the
country voting on small shoebox-sized computers that elderly voters
had trouble mastering. Though electioneering was required to end
before polls opened on Sunday, most candidates appeared to ignore
the prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   At Rocinha, in Rio de Janeiro, believed to be the largest slum
in South America with about 300,000 residents, palm-size photos of
candidates fluttered like autumn leaves through the air and
carpeted the streets. People waited more than an hour to vote, with
many supporting Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   Luiz Claudio Silveira, 34, a horse trainer who voted in Rocinha,
said he planned to vote for Cardoso, largely because the president
had ended inflation. ``If you go to the supermarket, you can buy
whatever you need now,'' Silveira said. ``Four years is not enough
to change a country as big as ours. I really believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Rute Vicente Oliveira, 48, a manicurist, also planned to vote
for Cardoso. For most of her life, she said, her family lived in a
lean-to, too poor to build a proper home. Her father dreamed of
giving his family solid, sturdy shelter, Ms. Oliveira said, but he
died before concrete blocks replaced the family's plywood slats.
``Now the house is almost done,'' she said. ``It's almost
completely in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Many voters appeared to be unaware of the fiscal adjustments
ahead, though the president announced less than two weeks before
the election that government belt-tightening measures would be
inevitable. Of the 106 million Brazilians eligible to vote on
Sunday, nearly 70 percent have less than an elementary school
education, and 35 percent are barely literate.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto Manuel da Silva, 40, who owns an ice cream parlor, said
that he expected the economic adjustments to hurt him personally
but that he was prepared to sacrifice to stabilize Brazil's
economy. The president said he would cut government costs, crack
down on tax evaders and, if necessary, raise taxes to increase
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking more about the situation of the country than of
myself,'' da Silva said. ``With a stable money, our situation will
get better.''

COWBOYS DOMINATE REDSKINS AFTER SHAKY START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Before team owner Jerry Jones yakked it up with
Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia and NBA star Grant Hill in the
winning locker room, and before Jason Garrett, Emmitt Smith and
Leon Lett toyed with the winless Washington Redskins in a 31-10
rout, there were some tense moments for the Cowboys on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The elements were right for a Redskins ambush, Cowboys safety
Darren Woodson thought after a Garrett fumble led to a quick 7-0
lead for the home team. Adding to the surreal scene was the dark,
damp, gray day at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium with several frenzied
fans waving signs that read: ``We Hate Dallas! We Hate Dallas!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me thought here we go again, that same old RFK stuff
going on. My mind flashed back to the times they've beaten us when
we came here, and when the stands would shake,'' said Woodson,
whose last victory at Washington came in 1994, when the approval
ratings of the president and the home team football coach were
considerably better than they are now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our offense,'' Woodson said, ``came right back to score.
And then we rallied in the huddle and said we were not going to let
the Redskins win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson's early apprehension turned quickly into Cowboys
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett completed an almost perfect 14 of 17 passes _ including
his first seven _ for one touchdown and no interceptions. Smith
rushed for 120 of the club's 224 yards on the ground. Lett (six
solo tackles) led a defensive charge that sacked quarterback Trent
Green four times and intercepted one of his passes, sending
beleaguered coach Norv Turner's Redskins to an 0-5 start, their
worst in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gives the Cowboys (3-2) a 3-0 record in the
division. They have outscored Washington, New York, and Arizona,
100-27. With Troy Aikman possibly returning next week, Sunday's
game leaves Garrett with a 2-1 record as the starter. After losses
by the New York Giants and Arizona Cardinals Sunday, the Cowboys
are in sole possession of first place in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   But forget about division championships for now, Gailey said.
Sunday, he said, was about a team showing character and playing
with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to have to overcome a lot to win this
football game,'' Gailey said. ``It looked tough, but we gained
something as a football team by overcoming the adversity. That's
not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Adversity hit on the Cowboys' ninth offensive play, when Garrett
mishandled a wet ball on a snap from center Clay Shiver. Four plays
later, Washington led 7-0 when Leslie Shepherd ran past cornerback
Kevin Smith's zone coverage and beat safety Omar Stoutmire to
Green's pass for a 40-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a hostile environment, but no one had their heads
down, no one panicked,'' linebacker Fred Strickland said. ``We knew
we'd make our share of plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys made plenty the rest of the way, outscoring the
Redskins 31-3. Wide receiver Ernie Mills twice beat struggling
Redskins cornerback Cris Dishman on crucial plays. First, for a
29-yard pass that set up a field goal, and second, for a 43-yard
touchdown pass that gave the Cowboys a 17-7 lead. Cornerback Deion
Sanders set up Smith's three-yard touchdown run with an
interception of a Green pass in Redskins territory.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the Cowboys' defense and running game, not the
hot-handed Garrett, which put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins running back Terry Allen (19 carries, 82 yards) was not
much of a factor. And neither was Green (13 of 29 for 193 yards),
whose favorite target, Michael Westbrook, the NFL's receptions
leader, was shadowed and shut down for much of the day by Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett attempted only four second-half passes as the Cowboys
shut the door on the Redskins with a running game that produced two
100-yard rushers for the first time in 20 years. Despite playing
much of the first half without right guard Everett McIver, who will
miss the next three to five weeks with a sprained ligament in his
right knee, the Cowboys ran up the middle of the defensive line,
where the Redskins play two $57 million defensive tackles _ Dana
Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson. In the second half, Smith had 63 of
120 yards, and Chris Warren had 102 of his 104.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward in the Cowboys locker room, Jones shook hands with
Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador in Washington, and with Hill,
the star of the Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Cowboys owner flashed a billion-dollar smile and summed
up the day: ``Psychologically, mentally, this gives us a good
feeling as a football team.''

STARS PIN HOPES TO IMPROVED DEFENSEMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took Darryl Sydor five years of NHL play to finally figure
something out: The game isn't that complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but the more simple I make the game, the easier
it's become for me, and that's mostly happened since I've been with
the Stars,'' Sydor said. ``We have a real strong philosophy here
that you don't try to do more than you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   That creed has helped mold the Stars' defense into what is
arguably the finest in the NHL. The core group of six defensemen
mixes size, skill and experience, and the organization's depth
gives the Stars a group that will not be significantly hurt by one
or two injuries. But what holds them together is their belief in
one another and their belief that the simple play will usually be
the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, that's something that I've been able to learn
through experience by having some great teachers here,''
25-year-old Richard Matvichuk said. ``I think calming down comes
with maturity and experience, but what we do here is we play a game
that's very disciplined, a game where you have to be positionally
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   And that goes for everyone. While the Stars love the offensive
creativity that Sergei Zubov brings to the ice, they also expect
Zubov to be defensively responsible. While the organization almost
demands that Matvichuk and captain Derian Hatcher dish out big
hits, it also requires that they don't create an opening by
venturing too far to deliver a check.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that each player can improve in every area,'' said
assistant coach Rick Wilson, the man responsible for assembling the
defense and for making defensive matchups during the game. ``We
demand a lot from the players, but we also know that they have a
lot to give.''
</P>
<P>
   And they might be able to give even more this season. With
Matvichuk (25), Hatcher (26), Sydor (26) and Zubov (28) all in the
prime of their careers, each is expected to be better this season
than he was last.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an honest expectation; we should be better,'' Hatcher
said. ``With our age and the fact we have all played together for
two or three years, there's no excuse not to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a scary thought. Hatcher is ranked eighth among NHL
defensemen by ``The Hockey News''. Zubov is ranked 11th and
finished second in the defensemen scoring race last season with 57
points (10 goals, 47 assists). Sydor was an All-Star Game selection
last season and ranks second in plus-minus among defensemen over
the previous two seasons (plus 54). Matvichuk is coming off his
best NHL year in which he led the NHL in blocked shots (142) and
was fourth in the NHL in hits (222).
</P>
<P>
   The two elder statesmen _ Craig Ludwig (37) and Shawn Chambers
(31) _ each boast a Stanley Cup championship in their past and are
the perfect complements to the top four. Ludwig is tough enough to
take the minutes of Hatcher or Matvichuk if need be, while Chambers
is skilled enough to take the place of Zubov or Sydor in the event
of injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt they're the best in the league; it's
obvious,'' Stars goalie Ed Belfour said of the group that helped
him forge a league-best 1.88 goals-against average. ``From top to
bottom, no other group can match them.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for that is the chemistry that coaches try so
hard to create, but often times has to create itself. Sydor is able
to play a simple game and stay away from the mistakes that haunted
him when he was a member of the Los Angeles Kings because he is
paired with Zubov.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do what comes natural to me and let Zubie do the
rest,'' Sydor said. ``It just seems to work out well when we're out
there together.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk, meanwhile, is able to be one of the top hitters in
the league because he knows Hatcher is behind him backing him up.
While Hatcher's numbers aren't as impressive, his work helps make
Matvichuk a better defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   The third pair of Chambers and Ludwig is similar. Chambers can
use his offensive skills because he knows Ludwig always is there to
back him up. All in all, it's a package that is set up to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go down the line and we should be better as a group,''
Chambers said. ``We know each other pretty well now, the young guys
just keep getting better, we know Eddie better. You don't want to
get too far ahead of yourself, but the bottom line is there's a lot
of talent here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that simple. FIVE BOUND FOR KALAMAZOO
</P>
<P>
   The Stars on Sunday sent five players to their minor-league
affiliate in Kalamazoo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Sent down were defensemen Petr Buzek, Richard Jackman and Brad
Lukowich, center Greg Leeb and winger Mel Angelstad. The moves
trimmed the Stars' roster to 28, including injured Joe Nieuwendyk
and Aaron Gavey. The Stars' must have their healthy roster at 24
before the season opener Saturday.

NASCAR DEALS WITH SECOND SEEPAGE PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _For the second time this season, water seeping
onto a racetrack owned by Speedway Motorsports Inc. has played
havoc with a NASCAR Winston Cup event.
</P>
<P>
   A faulty sewage pump located off of track property sent water
streaming across the backstretch of Charlotte Motor Speedway on
Sunday, prompting NASCAR officials to throw a red flag and stop the
UAW-GM Quality 500 for 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Track officials reported that a sewage pump located on U.S. 29,
just north of CMS, shut down early in the afternoon. The
malfunction caused an overflow from a manhole located in the East
Grandstand on the backstretch of the 1.5-mile trioval. Water
spilled over the outside retaining wall above the ``Charlotte''
sign and ran across the racing surface, which is banked at 5
degrees in that area.
</P>
<P>
   Championship contenders Mark Martin and Jeff Gordon were racing
at the head of the field when the water became noticeable down the
1,360-foot backstretch. After several drivers reported that the
water had nearly caused them to aqua-plane out of control, NASCAR
threw a caution followed by a red-flag on lap 94 of the scheduled
334.
</P>
<P>
   Early morning rains had threatened to delay the start of the
race, but it started only a few minutes after the originally
scheduled time of 12:05 p.m., CDT. But this water problem proved
not to be rain-related.
</P>
<P>
   During the delay, Geoff Bodine jokingly suggested that a broken
sewer was the source.
</P>
<P>
   ``I smelled a little odor when I went by,'' Bodine said.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance crews shut the system down and stopped the leak, and
also replaced the defective pump.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Winston Cup qualifying for the Texas 500 at Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth was halted when water began seeping
out of Turn 1, causing several cars to spin and crash. The session
was postponed until the next morning. SMI chairman Bruton Smith
subsequently spent approximately $3 million to install a new
drainage system and reconfigure the 1.5-mile trioval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think you've seen everything until you see something like
that,'' Kenny Wallace said of the latest incident. ``Thank God that
water wasn't in the corner.'' BOBBY LABONTE TAKES BLAME
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the red flag, the race produced 11 pace-slowing
cautions, one under the event record set in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Native Texan Bobby Labonte triggered a grinding, 10-car crash
when he lost control and spun entering Turn 2 on lap 202. Labonte
slid backwards into the outside wall, and the resulting scramble
collected the cars of brother Terry Labonte, Ricky Rudd, teammates
Jeremy Mayfield and Rusty Wallace, Kyle Petty, teammates Dale
Earnhardt and Mike Skinner, Sterling Marlin and Kenny Irwin Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who qualified third, was running second to Martin when
he hit the spin cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get under Mark in Turn 1,'' said Labonte,
driver of the No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac Grand Prix. ``It
really pushed bad (front end would not turn) when I got underneath
him. And then when I got free of him and turned left underneath him
a little bit, it took all the air off my nose and just spun out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't their fault. It was mine.''
</P>
<P>
   But Labonte, Rudd and race-winner Mark Martin were among those
who said there was oil dumped in Turn 1, apparently from a blown
motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was oil everywhere,'' said Rudd, winner of last week's
event at Martinsville (Va.) Speedway in the No. 10 Tide Ford
Taurus. ``No one had any control. Everyone sailed off in there and
you really didn't know where you were gonna land after you got into
the corner.'' GORDON STREAK INTACT
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup points leader Jeff Gordon was running as ``low'' as
eighth before a late-race charge moved him around Kevin Lepage for
a fifth-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   The pass on lap 331 of the 334 allowed Gordon to record his 15
consecutive top-five finish. Gordon made his charge despite a
damaged left rear quarter-panel that affect the downforce on the
No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Crew chief) Ray Evernham kept telling me I could get the 16
car (Lepage) for fifth place, and I was about ready to spin out as
it was,'' Gordon said. ``I think my car kept getting a little
better and his was going away pretty fast, so I was lucky to get by
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has posted an average finish of 2.06 over the last 15
races, and averaged 175.7 points during the period. NUTS AND BOLTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeff Burton's third-place finish in the No. 99 Exide Batteries
Ford was his seventh top-10 in the last eight races. He climbed
from seventh to fifth in the Cup standings, matching his best
position of the season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bobby Hamilton's fourth-place result in the No. 4 Kodak Chevy
was his third top-10 in the last four races, and allowed him to
move from 13th to 11th in Cup points.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rookie Kevin Lepage's sixth-place finish in the No. 16
Primestar Ford was his Winston Cup career-best, and second career
top-10.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman might not
return next week after all.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who has missed the past three games with a fractured
collarbone, said two weeks ago that he had set Sunday's game
against the Carolina Panthers as his target for returning to the
lineup. However, after the Cowboys' 31-10 victory against the
Washington Redskins Sunday, he wasn't so certain.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is scheduled to have X-rays taken on his shoulder Monday.
And while acknowledging the bone won't be healed for another two
weeks, he said it would be ``very optimistic'' for him to play
against the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who has been against Aikman's early
return all along, said Sunday's victory should influence the team
to rest him another week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this gives us an opportunity to not take a chance on
him,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could rest Aikman three more weeks, considering
after the Panthers (0-4), the Cowboys face the Chicago Bears (1-4)
and then have a bye before meeting the Philadelphia Eagles (0-5).
 &LR; name _ Clarence E. Hill Jr. EVERETT OUT, KIESELAK IN
</P>
<P>
   Right guard Everett McIver is expected to miss the next three to
five weeks with a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right
knee.
</P>
<P>
   McIver was injured with 5 minutes, 20 seconds remaining in the
first quarter. His replacement was Mike Kiselak, a former Canadian
League star, and it was not long before he was tested. On Kiselak's
first play, he blocked Redskins tackle Dan ``Big Daddy'' Wilkinson,
clearing room for a 6-yard Emmitt Smith run. Kiselak also had a bad
play, allowing Wilkinson to escape his clutches for a sack of Jason
Garrett in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   How did Kiselak even get in a Cowboys uniform? Some fan from
East Texas kept sending the Cowboys tapes of Kiselak in the CFL,
scouting director Larry Lacewell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept saying, `You gotta look at this guy,' '' Lacewell
said. ``I blew it off. Finally, I got the film and decided to take
a look and I thought, `Hey, this guy can play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The fan in East Texas thanks you, Larry. MILLS MAKES PLAYS
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Mills beat Redskins struggling cornerback Cris Dishman
twice for a game-high 72 yards Sunday. Mills' 29-yard reception set
up the Cowboys' field goal in the first quarter. And his 43-yard
reception in the second quarter gave the Cowboys a 17-7 lead. NEAR
TD FOR DEION
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders is making a strong case for
some kind of player of the year award _ defense, special teams. His
first-quarter interception set up Emmitt Smith's 3-yard touchdown
run in the second quarter. And he had a 71-yard punt return for a
touchdown called back because Charlie Williams was holding. RUNNING
MEN
</P>
<P>
   How will running back Smith react the first time Chris Warren
rushes for 100 yards?
</P>
<P>
   Smith got his answer Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, sporting a blue hat and matching blue sun glasses, talked
about how great a combination he and Warren made. And why not?
While Warren's 104 yards on 14 carries came with the game decided,
Smith rushed 28 times for 120 yards to help key the victory against
the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely showed what a 1-2 punch can do,'' Smith said.
``Chris is a great back.''
</P>
<P>
   The 104 yards marked the first time Warren had topped the
century mark in almost two years. The last was a 116-yard effort
against the Buffalo Bills, December 8, 1996. TIGHT ENDS RE-EMERGE
</P>
<P>
   Who said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey isn't part psychologist?
</P>
<P>
   Gailey did a good sucker job on the media and maybe the Redskins
last week when he talked about how the tight ends in the Cowboys
offense are often used as run blockers and didn't really fit into
his passing-game philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys tight end David Lafleur, who hadn't caught a pass since
the season opener, had a career-high four receptions for 29 yards.
And tight Eric Bjornson caught one for 4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to be involved,'' LaFleur said. ``We understand
the offense and were not going to put the numbers like Eric and Jay
Novacek used to. Our role is to do a lot of blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   But against the Redskins, it was to catch passes as well, as
Gailey, who noticed something in the Redskins linebacker coverage
on film, said he planned all along to included his tight ends in
the passing game.

GARRETT'S SOLID GAME GIVES AIKMAN TIME TO HEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ In truth, their run-happy, pass-orderly,
defense-miserly 31-10 victory here Sunday probably told us very
little about the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts, after all, were the winless, hapless _ and soon to be
Norv-less? _ Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   But this much we know:
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett, quarterback caretaker-in-residence, bought Troy
Aikman another week of bone-mending time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about it is that he threw the ball away when he
needed to throw it away,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said of
Garrett, who went 14-for-17 for 169 yards. ``He played a smart
football game. You've got to give the guy credit. I thought he
played a really smart football game.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Garrett played a smart football game.
</P>
<P>
   But all things are relative. This was Week 3 of watching Gailey
hand Garrett the keys to the Cowboys' offense, and the new coach
was sounding no differently than any other anxious
man-of-the-house.
</P>
<P>
   It had pleased him that Garrett had the family Studebaker home
by 10 p.m., with all grillwork intact, the radio turned low and no
unrepairable dents in any fenders.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey wasn't ready to issue a blanket blessing of Garrett's
three weeks of substituting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Gailey said, ``because we didn't win them all. I don't
care who's out. We need to win them all.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, dad. But at least the police didn't have to escort Jason
home.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett's best game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to evaluate games like that,'' Garrett answered.
``I'm really a play-by-play guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at plays, see where you made your mistakes, and then
you move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   A week after he helped squander a golden opportunity against the
Oakland Raiders, Garrett displayed veteran poise and preparation
against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garrett obviously played as well as anyone could play,'' said
besieged Redskins coach Norv Turner. ``They were able to move the
ball in the first half, and I thought he was the key to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, however, Washington offered only token resistance. The
Redskins are 0-5, but let me suggest they're not as good as their
record.
</P>
<P>
   The medical conclusion is Aikman, suffering from a broken
collarbone, needs to take another week off. Never mind what he said
last week about targeting Sunday's Carolina game for his triumphant
return.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett can handle it. Aikman needs to wait another week, or
two, or four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea about next week,'' Garrett said. ``If he's
healthy, he'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's old thinking. That's Switzer-era thinking. The
``asthma field'' was extinct. The inmates ruled the asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman wasn't a doctor, but he frequently played one on TV. When
Aikman said on the local sports shows he was ready to play, he
played. Same with Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   You would think, however, the new man in charge, Gailey, would
have something to say about that. It should all be required
homework in his Cowboys Assertiveness Training Course. The former
head coach never enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   And for Gailey's part, Garrett and the rest of the offense
bought him another week.
</P>
<P>
   With the offensive line plowing manly sized holes through the
Redskins' defense, the Cowboys' Smith and Chris Warren both ran for
more than 100 yards. The passing game did fine, thank you, on a
diet of Garrett taking short drops and throwing to Ernie Mills,
Billy Davis and David LaFleur.
</P>
<P>
   So, no need to rush things. When he sees the doctor Monday,
Aikman needs to take an X-ray. Take a Valium. Take another week _
or two _ off.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's game, Aikman said, ``I think it's pretty
optimistic to think that I would be able to play next week.''
</P>
<P>
   No big hurry, in other words. He was here. He saw the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but a trifling thing like a broken collarbone never made
Aikman cautious before. Was he suggesting prudence, someone asked,
because he saw the game that fill-in Garrett played?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason playing well certainly helps us,'' Aikman said, his head
again displaying its rock-hardness. ``But that has no bearing on
when I can play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the issue. The issue is whether the collarbone is
healed.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is also, let me suggest, that another of the NFC
feebles, Carolina, heads for Texas Stadium on Sunday, to be
followed by a Cowboys trip to Chicago, an open week and then a Nov.
2 game in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. The toughest part of that stretch is clearly the open week.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders were a different test last week, we can assume. They
were smart. They were patient. They were lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys might not see another foe like Oakland for two
months.
</P>
<P>
   They need Aikman. They just don't need him yet.
</P>
<P>
   As the head coach needs to inform him.

COWBOYS FIND LIFE'S ELIXIR IN NFC EAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Even this early in the season, it's obvious that
the Dallas Cowboys have located the NFL's version of the Mayo
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling sick after a lousy loss? Got just the cure. It's called
the NFC East, currently known as NFC Lite.
</P>
<P>
   In their most-impressive victory and 60-minute show of
domination since the 1997 opener in Pittsburgh, the Cowboys
transformed an expected tough game into a giggler here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter disappointment surrounding last week's home-field
loss to Oakland became a distant memory. It was a different
everything and everybody this time, including a composed and sharp
Jason Garrett. Winless and desperate, Washington, old NFC East
enemy, stayed winless and desperate, walloped by the Cowboys,
31-10.
</P>
<P>
   All three victories this season are against divisional brothers,
and by a combined score of 100-27. More vital is that after a
mind-twisting loss in Denver and an angry loss to the Raiders, the
Cowboys have been able to find immediate comfort against East
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   A once-proud division is suffering, but for what it's worth, the
Cowboys are now experiencing the same luxury the 49ers have enjoyed
for years _ loading up on a cupcake division. Except that on most
NFL menus, the Cowboys are also listed as pastry, and that's even
when Troy Aikman is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey, for now, doesn't seem to mind the perception of
either his team or the division. For the Cowboys to prove they can
still hang with the big boys, it will have to be in the playoffs,
and that comes beyond Christmas. If capable and worthy, there's
ample time and games to prepare for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our best game,'' Gailey said in a happy locker room,
``and I think it showed an improving team. Where we are at the
moment, however, I don't know yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still learning this team, but I'm also a believer that
adversity teaches you more about people than anything else. When
things are not going well, how do they respond? And I'm impressed
with our guys in that area. Really impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, gloom hung over the Cowboys after the Oakland
defeat. Plus, they were coming into Washington, where they hadn't
won since 1994. With an 0-4 record, the Redskins' whole season rode
on this one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we wanted to happen, happened early,'' safety
Darren Woodson said. ``\RThe Redskins\S got the quick touchdown on
us and were all pumped up.''
</P>
<P>
   But from that early seven-point hole, the Cowboys totally took
over the game. Emmitt Smith (120 yards on 28 carries) headed a
ruthless ground game. He combined with Chris Warren (104 yards on
14 carries) to turn the $57 million worth of defensive tackles _
Dan Wilkinson and Dana Stubblefield _ that Washington purchased in
the off-season into instant Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by an offensive line providing running room, Garrett
picked his spots through the air and picked apart the Redskins
secondary. Particularly impressive was how Garrett overcame an
early blunder when he lost a fumbled snap, setting up the
Washington touchdown. Combine that with Garrett's role in the
Oakland loss, and panic could have been an option. ``But Jason
never looked so cool back there,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins needed to establish the same running game the
Cowboys had, but it didn't happen. Nearly half of Terry Allen's 82
yards came on one carry in the second half with Washington down by
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in here at halftime, up by seven points (17-10), and the
coaches are going a mile-a-minute on all the adjustments,'' Gailey
said. ``Suddenly, I look up, and the entire team had stampeded
right out the door. Somebody had said it was two minutes to
kickoff, and I couldn't keep 'em in here. They kicked down the door
to get back out there. That kinda' shows how the players approached
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been, however, no pattern of consistency thus far.
Open the season with a nice win at home against Arizona; have the
defense get powdered in Denver; bounce back strongly in New York
with Deion and defense; give one away against Oakland at home; and
then do a road dance on the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what coach Gailey is going to be harping on all this
week: consistency,'' said defensive tackle Chad Hennings. ``There's
no reason this team shouldn't start showing it. The attitude is
there. We're together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that Sunday's opponent is Carolina at Texas Stadium, as
in winless Carolina (0-4), coming off a 51-23 shelling Sunday by
Atlanta. No, it's not another NFC East get-well card. But if
consistency does surface, Carolina is a victory waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, let the memory of the Oakland disaster serve as a
reminder that the Cowboys are still in an up-and-down mode, until
they prove otherwise.

RUNNING GAME FLASHES FORMER BRILLIANCE
</HEADLINE>
 SIDER-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Cowboys running backs coach Clarence Shelmon
sported a deft, I-told-you-so type of grin in the locker room after
Sunday's 31-10 victory against the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   And it would seem he has every right to smile, considering the
dominant performance of his primary charges. Starting tailback
Emmitt Smith totaled 120 yards and a touchdown on 28 carries and
backup Chris Warren tallied 104 yards and two touchdowns on 14
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Two backs rushing for more than 100 yards in the same game had
happened only twice previously in team history.
</P>
<P>
   But while he commended the performances of Smith and Warren,
saying ``this is exactly why we brought Chris here,'' Shelmon knows
the play of the Cowboys' maligned offensive line and the pregame
strategy of coach Chan Gailey played a large role in the running
game's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line did an outstanding job,'' Shelmon said.
``But we felt we could run the football all along. The game plan
was simple. We ran very few plays. But we used a lot of different
formations. The backs got a feel for the running lanes because they
were running the same play and the blockers were blocking the same
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Redskins had been allowing 160 yards a game on
the ground and ranked 29th in the league against the run, the
Cowboys should have figured they could run the ball. But they
thought they could run against the Oakland Raiders last week, too.
</P>
<P>
   And with a 2.7 yards-per-carry average the past two games,
nothing was guaranteed. Those numbers came against the New York
Giants and Raiders, who used eight- and nine-man fronts against the
Cowboys in an attempt to put more pressure on inexperienced
quarterback Jason Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Nate Newton, 37, much-maligned center Clay
Shiver and former CFL guard Mike Kiselak _ who replaced injured
Everett McIver early in the first quarter _ went to work on the
Redskins' $57 million defensive-tackle duo of Dana Stubblefield and
Dan Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, matched up against the 1997 defensive player of the year
Stubblefield for most of the day, looked like the ``Big Newt'' of
old, as the Cowboys ran over the left side for two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted he got help from Shiver, tackle Larry Allen and a
running back on Stubblefied and said the running game still needs
to be more consistent. But Newton warned that people shouldn't
think the Cowboys have gone soft in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an older team,'' Newton said. ``We still got talent in
the right spot. And as role players, we still got to do what we got
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who is fast becoming a premier strategist, is helping
them do it. Another significant part of the running-game strategy
against Redskins was to run outside early in the game. The idea was
to wear out Stubblefield and Wilkinson by getting them to run
laterally in an attempt to soften the inside for later in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The plan paid dividends in the second half when Garrett limited
his passes while the Cowboys leaned heavily on the running game. Of
the 224 total rushing yards, 165 came in the second half, capped by
the final 11-play, 96-yard touchdown drive at the end of the fourth
quarter that included no passes and took 6:02 off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   And Shelmon was smiling the entire time.

TEXAS' RICKY WILLIAMS ASKS TO HONOR DOAK WALKER
</HEADLINE>
 12 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas tailback Ricky Williams, winner of the 1997 Doak Walker
National Running Back Award, has made a special request to NCAA
officials to wear jersey No. 37 in Saturday's game against Oklahoma
as a tribute to the former SMU star who died Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a senior who became close to the Walker family after
winning the award, seeks a one-game exception to wear Walker's
number in his final appearance at the Cotton Bowl, the stadium
dubbed ``the house that Doak built'' because it was twice expanded
to meet growing ticket demands during Walker's career at SMU.
</P>
<P>
   John Bianco, Texas' associate director of media relations, said
Sunday that school officials had not received word from the NCAA on
Williams' request. Williams wore a helmet decal with No. 37 on it
to honor Walker while rushing for a career-high 350 yards and five
touchdowns during a 54-33 victory against Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   By doing so, Williams became the first back in NCAA history to
top the 300-yard mark in consecutive games. Williams rushed for 318
yards and six touchdowns in a 59-21 rout of Rice on Sept. 26. ABC
PICKS A&AMP;M GAME
</P>
<P>
   ABC has selected Nebraska-Texas A&AMP;M as Saturday's 2:30 p.m.
telecast (WFAA/Channel 8), network officials announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision finalized starting times for this week's Big 12
games, which will include two 6 p.m. telecasts on other networks:
Oklahoma State-Texas Tech (Fox Sports Southwest) and Kansas
State-Colorado (FX). The Texas-Oklahoma game will be shown at 11:30
a.m. on KXTX/Channel 39. TECH INJURIES MOUNT
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes said starting offensive linemen
Curtis Lowery (sprained knee) and Steve McFadden (sprained ankle)
are among six players expected to miss Saturday's home game against
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes said both linemen are out, along with reserve defensive
end Devin Lemons (sprained knee). Listed as doubtful are linebacker
Ty Ardoin (chest bruise), cornerback Antwan Alexander (chest
bruise) and receiver Tim Baker (knee).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our training room looks like a MASH unit,'' Dykes said. ``We
need Oral Roberts over here for a couple of days to lay on some
hands.'' Big 12 honors three
</P>
<P>
   Three players with Texas connections were selected as the Big 12
players of the week: Williams (offensive), Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat
Nguyen (defense) and Nebraska punt returner Joe Walker (special
teams).
</P>
<P>
   Williams rushed for 350 yards and five touchdowns against Iowa
State, Nguyen had eight tackles and two turnovers in a 24-21
victory against Kansas, and Walker, a Lamar High School graduate,
returned a punt 73 yards for the game-winning touchdown in a 24-17
victory against Oklahoma State.

A COUCH-POTATO HEAVEN AWAITS BIG 12 FANATICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Replace the batteries in the remote control, program the VCR and
break out the industrial-size bag of Doritos.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest football weekend of the Big 12 season is upon us,
and it figures to be a Saturday made in heaven for sofa spuds. The
list of compelling matchups runs deep enough that Texas-Oklahoma is
reduced to an 11:30 a.m. appetizer on a day when pivotal Big 12
games will be fed to viewers in nonstop fashion for approximately
10 hours on four channels.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the color of your class ring, a case could be made
for any of the three subsequent telecasts _ Nebraska-Texas A&AMP;M
(2:30 p.m.), Kansas State-Colorado (6 p.m.) or Oklahoma State-Texas
Tech (6 p.m.) _ as the main course in a tasty football smorgasbord.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, these four games should help answer lingering
questions about a league heading toward the midpoint of its season
with four unbeaten teams, a revitalized Heisman Trophy hopeful and
plenty of mystery surrounding its weekly outcomes because of
improved play by the bottom feeders.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pressing issues that should be answered this week:
</P>
<P>
   Is Texas Tech a threat to win the South Division, or merely a
5-0 mirage that will vanish now that quality teams begin dotting
the Red Raiders' schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Can Texas tailback Ricky Williams continue to compile enough
superhuman statistics to rebuild a once-shaky Heisman campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Does a change in quarterbacks give Texas A&AMP;M a better chance to
record its first victory against a top-10 opponent since 1989?
</P>
<P>
   How will No. 5 Kansas State respond to the novelty of a road
trip, much less one that mandates the Wildcats actually play an
opponent with a winning record?
</P>
<P>
   These are the questions that try Big 12 souls. Answers won't be
available until Saturday night. For some educated guesses, we turn
to the experts.
</P>
<P>
   Tech coach Spike Dykes, how 'bout those Red Raiders?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing some things better than I expected,'' said Dykes,
pointing to a rushing offense and rushing defense both ranked among
the top five in the nation. ``But we've still got some chinks in
our armor. We're not ready for the big boys yet. But we're close.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown, how do you rate your tailback's Heisman
hopes now that he's become the only rusher in NCAA history to
record consecutive 300-yard games?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's among the front-runners. I feel he has to be first or
second, for sure,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, is your Randy McCown-led offense ready to
rumble with second-ranked Nebraska?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not very smooth and that really concerns me,''
Slocum said. ``We can't play like we've been playing and stay on
the field with Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State coach Billy Snyder, what concerns you most about
playing in a hostile environment against those pass-happy Colorado
Buffaloes?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 38 penalties in our last three games. We've given up
over 200 yards in the passing game our last two games,'' Snyder
said. ``That tells me there's a lot of work to be done in those
areas.''
</P>

TOUGH STRETCH TESTS SEC'S CHARACTER

<P>
   A Southeastern Conference team has won (Florida 1996) or played
for (Florida '95; Tennessee '97) the national championship each of
the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   However, it appears the SEC could be its own worst enemy this
season. The winner of the league's Dec. 5 title game could be more
of a survivor than a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the start of two pivotal weeks in the SEC. Georgia
won at Louisiana State, 28-27, behind the play of freshman
quarterback Quincy Carter. After spending three seasons playing in
the Chicago Cubs' minor-league system, Carter has led the Bulldogs
to a 4-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an opportunity here to do something special, and
when you're a player that's all you want: an opportunity,'' Carter
said. ``This is why I gave up baseball and came back to football.
If you love college football, these are the kinds of things you
live for.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee struggled to win at Auburn, 17-9, Saturday. The
Volunteers won despite 218 yards of total offense and nine first
downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play in this league, you're fooling yourself if you
ever think it's going to be easy on the road,'' Tennessee coach
Phillip Fulmer said. ``A stretch like this is when you find out
about the character of your football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has four teams ranked in the top 11 _ No. 4 Tennessee,
No. 6 Florida, No. 7 Georgia and No. 11 LSU. Tennessee has beaten
Florida, and Georgia has beaten LSU; Florida plays host to LSU this
weekend, and Tennessee is at Georgia. Georgia and Florida play Oct.
31.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's games again caused some movement in the poll voting.
Ohio State's 28-9 victory at home against No. 7 Penn State boosted
the Buckeyes, while Nebraska's 24-17 nail-biting victory against
Oklahoma State cost the Cornhuskers the ground they gained the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Top-ranked Ohio State picked up six first-place votes in The
Associated Press (media) poll; second-ranked Nebraska lost five No.
1 votes. The previous week, the vote flowed the other direction,
with the idle Buckeyes losing six votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``ESPN/USA Today'' (coaches) poll, Ohio State picked up
the first-place votes of nine voters who switched from Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead ``Star-Telegram'' college football writer Wendell
Barnhouse takes a look at this week's top games:
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 UCLA at No. 10 Arizona: The Bruins enter a tough stretch.
Next week, high-scoring Oregon visits the Rose Bowl. The Wildcats
are gaining confidence each week.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Tennessee at No. 7 Georgia: Another Saturday, another SEC
showdown. The winner takes command of the East Division.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Nebraska at No. 18 Texas A&AMP;M: The Cornhuskers appeared to
be hitting their stride until tripping _ but winning _ against
Oklahoma State. The Aggies need to fix their offensive woes.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Louisiana State at No. 6 Florida: Last season, the
Gators' hopes of a national championship ended in Baton Rouge, La.
Florida didn't like watching the Tigers celebrate, and coach Steve
Spurrier has a good memory.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Kansas State at No. 14 Colorado: After an off week, the
Wildcats face a ranked team for the first time this season.
However, the Buffaloes have appeared exceedingly average while
going 5-0.

RAIN OF ERRORS AT ARROWHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ First, lightning struck. Then, Andre Rison
struck. In between, the Seahawks' offense was just stuck.
</P>
<P>
   In another bizarre game in a seemingly endless series of
grotesque games for the Seahawks at Arrowhead Stadium, the Kansas
City Chiefs slapped them with a 17-6 loss in Sunday night's
nationally televised game.
</P>
<P>
   A storm that dumped 3.6 inches of rain on downtown Kansas City
from 7:15 to 9 p.m. forced a 54-minute delay in the game when
lightning struck too close to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could delay the inevitable _ the Seahawks' eighth
straight loss at Arrowhead, and their 16th to the Chiefs in their
last 17 trips here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying we're not the same Hawks, but we played like
it today,'' defensive end Michael Sinclair said in a Seahawk locker
room filled with silence and overflowing with frustration. ``This
is tough. It's the same old feeling. We came here and acted like we
don't have a clue what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   This loss dropped the Seahawks to 3-2 and into a tie with the
Oakland Raiders for third place in the AFC West entering next
week's game against the unbeaten and division-leading Denver
Broncos at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have got to change. We've got a juggernaut coming in
Sunday,'' Sinclair said of the defending Super Bowl champion
Broncos. ``If we play like that, we're going to be the laughing
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' latest setback at Arrowhead was not without
injuries. Quarterback Warren Moon cracked a rib and wide receiver
Joey Galloway bruised his left knee. Neither finished the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, meanwhile, improved to 4-1 as Rich Gannon hooked up
with Rison on an 80-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter.
Gannon also scored on a 4-yard run in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we had some opportunities,'' Seahawks
coach Dennis Erickson said. ``We didn't make plays and they made
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case in last week's three-point loss at Pittsburgh,
the defense played well enough for the Seahawks to win and made
enough big plays that the Seahawks should have at least been in
this game.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl free safety Darryl Williams recovered a club-record
three fumbles and the Seahawks had five in the game. But all the
offense could muster from the field position supplied by the
defense were a pair of Todd Peterson field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team effort, and we didn't get it done,'' Williams
said. ``Some days it's like that. You've got to take advantage of
big plays. Today, we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Joseph gave the offense another chance in the fourth
quarter by returning a punt 66 yards to the Kansas City 17. Again,
the offense failed as Peterson slapped a 38-yard field-goal attempt
wide left.
</P>
<P>
   The game was suspended with 7:10 remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Moon was dropped for a 1-yard loss on a broken play,
referee Phil Luckett was called to the sideline and told to send
the players to the locker room by Art McNally, NFL assistant
supervisor of officials. Fans also were advised to move to the
lower concourse of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seen some lightning go across the sky and, in my
judgment, the last that we saw was severe enough and too close to
the stadium. I felt it was time to pull everybody out,'' said
McNally, who called Luckett from his seat in the press box. ``We
cannot take a chance with the safety of the players and the fans in
the stands. We decided we would suspend the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the lightning delay, the two teams slipped, slopped and
sloshed to a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon lost the ball on the third play of the game and Seahawks
defensive end Phillip Daniels recovered the fumble at the Kansas
City 17-yard line. Three runs by Ricky Watters moved the ball to
the 4, but Moon's third-down pass to Mike Pritchard in the end zone
was batted incomplete by Chiefs cornerback James Hasty.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson then kicked a 22-yard field goal with 12:05 left in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks almost got the ball back on the Chiefs' second
possession when it slipped from Gannon's hand again on first down.
Sinclair recovered inside the Kansas City 25, but it was ruled an
incomplete pass. Replays showed that Gannon lost the ball on a pump
fake, but the incompletion ruling stood.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City tied the score just before the end of the quarter by
driving to a 22-yard field goal by Pete Stoyanovich. With the
middle of the field looking more like a giant slip-and-slide, the
Chiefs pounded away at the middle of the Seahawks' defense on a
10-play, 45-yard trudge.
</P>
<P>
   Donnell Bennett carried five times for 35 yards before being
forced to the sideline with a bruised right hand.
</P>
<P>
   The rain continued to pelt the field in the second quarter. The
Seahawks' first possession ended with a fumble by Watters, but they
got the ball back three players later when Sinclair forced a
Bennett fumble that was recovered by Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It started pouring rain again when the Seahawks got the ball
with 8:50 left in the half. When several bolts of lightning
crackled too near the stadium, the decision was made to suspend the
game.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, John Friesz replaced Moon, who was hurt on
the run just before the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Before the night was over, the Seahawks had used each of their
quarterbacks. And as Chiefs linebacker Anthony Davis bellowed on
his way to the locker room, ``They used all three quarterbacks, and
none of them got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon was 0-for-2. Friesz was 8 of 19 for 52 yards. Jon Kitna was
3 of 12 for 42 yards. The Seahawks finished with only 167 yards and
other than Galloway's five catches, only one other wide receiver
caught a pass.
</P>
<P>
   On his first full series, Friesz threw a first-down pass to
Pritchard, who leaped for the ball but had it go off his hands.
Chiefs cornerback Dale Carter made a diving interception of the
carom and a 15-yard face mask penalty against Seahawks tight end
Deems May moved the ball to the Seattle 17. Six plays later, Gannon
scrambled into the end zone to give the Chiefs a 10-3 lead at the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Rison's TD, the Chiefs' longest pass play since 1990, came at
the end of the third quarter as he ran past Williams to take
Gannon's pass wide open. Rison then outran strong safety Jay
Bellamy to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran play action and we were up playing the run and he got
behind one of the safeties,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams admitted the blown coverage was his fault. Everyone
involved agreed the long pass was the difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it turned the momentum around,'' Gannon said.
``We actually had another play called when we were in the huddle.
That other play came in and it was a read route to Andre and he
made a great decision. ... He went right by them and I just tried
to put it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rison: ``We practiced that play, but it wasn't drawn up on
our script this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' offensive ineptness was exemplified by their first
possession of the fourth quarter. After Galloway picked up a first
down with a 9-yard completion, the Seahawks wound up with a
third-and-35 as tight end Carlester Crumpler false started, tackle
Howard Ballard was flagged for holding, Watters fumbled and then
was dropped for a 7-yard loss after taking a pass from Friesz.
Friesz's third-down pass was incomplete, but at least they didn't
lose yards on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna replaced Friesz late in the fourth quarter, but had a pass
picked off at the Chiefs' 1-yard line by Hasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the one thing we've always believed in. You
play one play at a time,'' Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer said.
``When it's over you put it aside and go to the next one. They
certainly embraced that philosophy today. It was a pretty strong
performance by our defensive football team.''
</P>
<P>
   And another bitter loss at Arrowhead for the Seahawks.

MARK MARTIN WINS, BUT GAINS LITTLE GROUND ON JEFF GORDON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURNBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _Mark Martin carved a 25-point chunk out of Jeff
Gordon's NASCAR Winston Cup points lead Sunday with a dominating
victory at Charlotte Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Martin knows even that will not cut it if he expects to overhaul
Gordon's still sizeable 174-point championship advantage with five
races remaining. But that does not mean Martin is growing
frustrated by his inability to reel Gordon into immediate striking
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I look frustrated?'' a grinning Martin said after his
victory in the UAW-GM Quality 500. ``This is the greatest year of
my life. I don't see how anybody could look at this year and think
that it was a failure. If I never even start the rest of the races
this year, it's gotta be a tremendous success.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's victory on the especially slick 1.5-mile CMS trioval
was his career-best seventh of the season, second only to Gordon's
10. Martin led a race-high 215 of the 334 laps, the eighth time he
has led the most laps this season and bagged the extra five points
that accompany it. Martin now has scored 145 lap-leader bonus
points in 1998, the most of any driver. And his 29th career victory
was his 18th top-10 finish in the last 19 races of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the same driver,'' said Martin, whose team was rebuilt and
relocated from Liberty, N.C., to nearby Mooresville by team owner
Jack Roush during the off-season. ``I'm not driving harder, smarter
or better than I ever have. I'm driving better cars and man, it's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin and the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus were good enough to
lead on six occasions, including all of crunch time. Martin led 133
of the final 134 laps, including the final 66 to beat Ward Burton
by 1.110-seconds. Jeff Burton, Ward's younger brother and Martin's
Roush Racing teammate, was third, followed by a resurgent Bobby
Hamilton and the ever-present Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon racked up his 15th consecutive top-five finish when he
drove around Kevin Lepage, another Roush driver, on lap 331. That
was worth an extra five points for Gordon, driver of the No. 24
DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Gordon needs to
finish fifth or better in the remaining five races to claim his
third Cup title and deny Martin his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating there a little bit,'' said Gordon,
referring to his chase of the Roush pack in front of him. ``They're
fast. Mark's got an awesome setup, obviously, and those guys can
really drive. They were really strong today.''
</P>
<P>
   But survival of the strongest also was a factor during a race
that produced 11 caution flags, one less than the event record set
in 1981. The race also was red-flagged to a stop for 42 minutes on
lap 94 when a sewer pump malfunctioned and allowed water to back up
and seep over a portion of the backstretch wall and across the
track.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Gordon were among the leaders who dodged a 10-car
wreck in Turn 2 triggered by native Texan Bobby Labonte on lap 202.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things that took out some good race cars,
and it should have taken us out,'' said Martin, who was leading
Labonte and the race at that point. ``When I entered the corner I
saw a shiny stripe (of oil) on the racetrack, just a vague shiny
stripe. I decided in a split-second to not turn left and let the
car go into the corner on the high side. My spotter called,
`Inside, whoa!' I knew I had made the right choice right then, and
then he started telling me to hurry up because Bobby was starting
on the inside of me. And if he would have spun in the oil, he could
have spun right into me and crashed me out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very close situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's winning average speed was 123.188 mph in a race that
took 4 hours, 4 minutes and 1 second to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton, meanwhile, led 33 laps and posted his best finish
since his victory at North Carolina Motor Speedway in Rockingham,
N.C., in October 1995. That was 88 races ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat everybody but one car \RMartin's\S and I wanted that
one car awful bad,'' said Burton, driver of the No. 22 MBNA Pontiac
Grand Prix. ``I know I had him beat on motor, there's no doubt
about that. We were just off on chassis a little bit. He just had a
little bit on me in (turns) 3 and 4.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was Ward Burton's first top-five since the
season-finale at Atlanta Motor Speedway in November 1995.

CHIEFS SINK SEAHAWKS ON LAKE ARROWHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Another 10 minutes of rain Sunday night, and
Kansas City could have opened its first fresh seafood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The hastily rearranged halftime show featured Gordon Lightfoot
singing ``The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the best part of the Seahawks-Chiefs water-balloon fight was
that it provided Seattle a climatological preview of the new
roofless football stadium scheduled to open in 2002, not to mention
a name: Waterworld.
</P>
<P>
   True, weather in Seattle doesn't usually happen like this _ 3.6
inches of rain in less than two hours, accompanied by gales and a
light show with percussion that surpassed the best of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part of the game for the Seahawks was that it was the
same Seattle story in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   For the 16th time in the last 17 games in this place, the
Seahawks went down in the standard ignominious fashion. But instead
of a thud, they went down with a splash.
</P>
<P>
   In a game played mostly at flood stage, the Seahawks managed to
set a low-water mark in a 17-6 defeat. In a season filled with
optimism after a 3-0 start, they have lost two straight road games
to good teams _ the kind of games that they vowed to win to fulfill
the expensively promoted promise of turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't beat us _ we beat us,'' defensive tackle Sam Adams
said. ``If they beat us, we'd be concerned. But we've made the same
kind of mistakes two weeks in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's got to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the defense was resolute, except for one hiccup that
allowed an 80-yard gamebreaker of a touchdown pass to Andre Rison.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the offense bordered on the inept.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the thunderstorm was abominable, the ball was slippery and
leaden, the field was sod cheesecake and the pratfalls were
hilarious. But unless they had mud caked over their ears and eyes,
the Seahawks will have a difficult time explaining the false
starts, misreads, blown plays and fundamental mistakes that had
little to do with abysmal conditions. The Chiefs were overboard in
the same brown ocean, and somehow learned to swim.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the environmental burlesque was the Seahawks' Voyage to
the Bottom of the Playbook _ again. Much as it happened last week
in Pittsburgh, the Seahawks were desperate for just one big play to
turn the game around.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the big play went to K.C. when quarterback Rich Gannon
connected with Rison at the end of the third quarter for the game's
second touchdown _ one that might as well have been worth 60 points
instead of six, given the Seahawk offensive breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the weather, but at the same time, the
offense hasn't played well, maybe even going back to preseason,''
said quarterback John Friesz, who played most of the second half in
relief of injured Warren Moon. ``We just haven't played at a real
high level.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of the first-half cyclone, the futility was
understandable _ no pass completions, just two first downs and 37
yards rushing by the six-minute halftime, a concession to the
54-minute delay in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last game (against San Diego on Sunday here), I said it was
the worst conditions I'd ever seen,'' Chiefs coach Marty
Schottenheimer said. ``How little I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the airborne water was so dense, the upper deck
stands across from the press box could not be seen. Stadium lights
created a sheen on the rain-soaked field that for a few moments
created a lake-like glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was praying every time I got under center than I didn't
fumble the snap,'' Moon said. ``The ball was sitting in a couple
inches of water.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final play before play was temporarily halted _
supervisor of officials Art McNally said play either must be
stopped or yardage converted to fathoms _ Moon was sacked on a
busted play, and the hit cracked a rib. He never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky guy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlucky Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half that was mostly free of wind, rain and
standing water, the Seahawks under Friesz squandered multiple
opportunities provided by five K.C. fumbles. The opening series of
the third quarter ended when Friesz missed a wide-open Joey
Galloway on a pass in the flat at midfield, throwing out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as close as I've come to throwing a pass backwards,''
Friesz said of his lost grip on the ball. ``Sometimes when you have
dry hands, it works against you. I think I'd rather have the ball
and my hands wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul-weather games are always field-position affairs that turn
on the running game and turnovers. They are manly sorts of jousts
that reveal who can turn calamity into opportunity. All you need to
know about the Seahawks on this black evening was that they had
more yards in penalties (88) than rushing (73). In this four-hour
trudge through sludge, the Seahawks were also revealed to be closer
to their past than their future.

RAIN OF ERRORS AT ARROWHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ First, lightning struck. Then, Andre Rison
struck. In between, the Seahawks' offense was just stuck.
</P>
<P>
   In another bizarre game in a seemingly endless series of
grotesque games for the Seahawks at Arrowhead Stadium, the Kansas
City Chiefs slapped them with a 17-6 loss in Sunday night's
nationally televised game.
</P>
<P>
   A storm that dumped 3.6 inches of rain on downtown Kansas City
from 7:15 to 9 p.m. forced a 54-minute delay in the game when
lightning struck too close to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could delay the inevitable _ the Seahawks' eighth
straight loss at Arrowhead, and their 16th to the Chiefs in their
last 17 trips here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying we're not the same Hawks, but we played like
it today,'' defensive end Michael Sinclair said in a Seahawk locker
room filled with silence and overflowing with frustration. ``This
is tough. It's the same old feeling. We came here and acted like we
don't have a clue what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   This loss dropped the Seahawks to 3-2 and into a tie with the
Oakland Raiders for third place in the AFC West entering next
week's game against the unbeaten and division-leading Denver
Broncos at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have got to change. We've got a juggernaut coming in
Sunday,'' Sinclair said of the defending Super Bowl champion
Broncos. ``If we play like that, we're going to be the laughing
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' latest setback at Arrowhead was not without
injuries. Quarterback Warren Moon cracked a rib and wide receiver
Joey Galloway bruised his left knee. Neither finished the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, meanwhile, improved to 4-1 as Rich Gannon hooked up
with Rison on an 80-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter.
Gannon also scored on a 4-yard run in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second half, we had some opportunities,'' Seahawks
coach Dennis Erickson said. ``We didn't make plays and they made
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the case in last week's three-point loss at Pittsburgh,
the defense played well enough for the Seahawks to win and made
enough big plays that the Seahawks should have at least been in
this game.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl free safety Darryl Williams recovered a club-record
three fumbles and the Seahawks had five in the game. But all the
offense could muster from the field position supplied by the
defense were a pair of Todd Peterson field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team effort, and we didn't get it done,'' Williams
said. ``Some days it's like that. You've got to take advantage of
big plays. Today, we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Joseph gave the offense another chance in the fourth
quarter by returning a punt 66 yards to the Kansas City 17. Again,
the offense failed as Peterson slapped a 38-yard field-goal attempt
wide left.
</P>
<P>
   The game was suspended with 7:10 remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Moon was dropped for a 1-yard loss on a broken play,
referee Phil Luckett was called to the sideline and told to send
the players to the locker room by Art McNally, NFL assistant
supervisor of officials. Fans also were advised to move to the
lower concourse of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seen some lightning go across the sky and, in my
judgment, the last that we saw was severe enough and too close to
the stadium. I felt it was time to pull everybody out,'' said
McNally, who called Luckett from his seat in the press box. ``We
cannot take a chance with the safety of the players and the fans in
the stands. We decided we would suspend the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the lightning delay, the two teams slipped, slopped and
sloshed to a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon lost the ball on the third play of the game and Seahawks
defensive end Phillip Daniels recovered the fumble at the Kansas
City 17-yard line. Three runs by Ricky Watters moved the ball to
the 4, but Moon's third-down pass to Mike Pritchard in the end zone
was batted incomplete by Chiefs cornerback James Hasty.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson then kicked a 22-yard field goal with 12:05 left in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks almost got the ball back on the Chiefs' second
possession when it slipped from Gannon's hand again on first down.
Sinclair recovered inside the Kansas City 25, but it was ruled an
incomplete pass. Replays showed that Gannon lost the ball on a pump
fake, but the incompletion ruling stood.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City tied the score just before the end of the quarter by
driving to a 22-yard field goal by Pete Stoyanovich. With the
middle of the field looking more like a giant slip-and-slide, the
Chiefs pounded away at the middle of the Seahawks' defense on a
10-play, 45-yard trudge.
</P>
<P>
   Donnell Bennett carried five times for 35 yards before being
forced to the sideline with a bruised right hand.
</P>
<P>
   The rain continued to pelt the field in the second quarter. The
Seahawks' first possession ended with a fumble by Watters, but they
got the ball back three players later when Sinclair forced a
Bennett fumble that was recovered by Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It started pouring rain again when the Seahawks got the ball
with 8:50 left in the half. When several bolts of lightning
crackled too near the stadium, the decision was made to suspend the
game.
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, John Friesz replaced Moon, who was hurt on
the run just before the delay.
</P>
<P>
   Before the night was over, the Seahawks had used each of their
quarterbacks. And as Chiefs linebacker Anthony Davis bellowed on
his way to the locker room, ``They used all three quarterbacks, and
none of them got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon was 0-for-2. Friesz was 8 of 19 for 52 yards. Jon Kitna was
3 of 12 for 42 yards. The Seahawks finished with only 167 yards and
other than Galloway's five catches, only one other wide receiver
caught a pass.
</P>
<P>
   On his first full series, Friesz threw a first-down pass to
Pritchard, who leaped for the ball but had it go off his hands.
Chiefs cornerback Dale Carter made a diving interception of the
carom and a 15-yard face mask penalty against Seahawks tight end
Deems May moved the ball to the Seattle 17. Six plays later, Gannon
scrambled into the end zone to give the Chiefs a 10-3 lead at the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Rison's TD, the Chiefs' longest pass play since 1990, came at
the end of the third quarter as he ran past Williams to take
Gannon's pass wide open. Rison then outran strong safety Jay
Bellamy to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran play action and we were up playing the run and he got
behind one of the safeties,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams admitted the blown coverage was his fault. Everyone
involved agreed the long pass was the difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it turned the momentum around,'' Gannon said.
``We actually had another play called when we were in the huddle.
That other play came in and it was a read route to Andre and he
made a great decision. ... He went right by them and I just tried
to put it out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Rison: ``We practiced that play, but it wasn't drawn up on
our script this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' offensive ineptness was exemplified by their first
possession of the fourth quarter. After Galloway picked up a first
down with a 9-yard completion, the Seahawks wound up with a
third-and-35 as tight end Carlester Crumpler false started, tackle
Howard Ballard was flagged for holding, Watters fumbled and then
was dropped for a 7-yard loss after taking a pass from Friesz.
Friesz's third-down pass was incomplete, but at least they didn't
lose yards on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna replaced Friesz late in the fourth quarter, but had a pass
picked off at the Chiefs' 1-yard line by Hasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about the one thing we've always believed in. You
play one play at a time,'' Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer said.
``When it's over you put it aside and go to the next one. They
certainly embraced that philosophy today. It was a pretty strong
performance by our defensive football team.''
</P>
<P>
   And another bitter loss at Arrowhead for the Seahawks.

UW KICKING GAME CAN NO LONGER GO WITHOUT HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The caller to ESPN's national sports radio show early
Sunday morning was frantic.
</P>
<P>
   She was dialing ``Pigpen,'' the Las Vegas-based host, from
Seattle, demanding accountability for the source of her disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle, you're on. But no more whining about the Huskies,''
Pigpen sneered.
</P>
<P>
   The woman had been at Husky Stadium on Saturday night, bundled
up in Gore-Tex and purple pride as she watched a young, patchwork
Husky team attempt a resurrection of pride and momentum in a
football season trounced by the previous weekend's drubbing at
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Saturday night's adventure in the rain?
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies should have, could have beaten Arizona, the woman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But any chance for resurrected pride and hope in 1998 was
crushed when Arizona quarterback Ortege Jenkins performed a Kerri
Strug gold medal somersault on the heads of the poor Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   After a stalwart attempt by the Husky defensive line to stop the
final Arizona drive, the cagey 'Cat QB vaulted himself into the
cool night air, then landed feet-first in the end zone to seal a
spectacular, come-from-behind Pac-10 win.
</P>
<P>
   But like most astute Husky fans, the caller understood the
Huskies' bitter 31-28 defeat was not decided by that amazing
80-yard scoring drive that all of Husky Nation will be forced to
relive as long as ``SportsCenter'' and other highlight shows replay
Jenkins' victorious work of acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
   The caller understood that the culprit in this unforgiving
defeat was the black hole known as the Husky kicking game. Her
outrage was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an alumni, I want to know where my kicker is!'' the caller
said.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? That sad, mad caller was speaking for all
Husky fans: Where have all the kickers gone?
</P>
<P>
   If UW coach Jim Lambright has an answer, it comes a week too
late (at least) to do his dispirited team or his peeved fan base
any shred of good.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, walk-on place-kicker Nick Lentz left the Washington
program. Lentz's disgruntled departure over the lack of a
scholarship put Lambright in the compromised position of sending
redshirt freshman Jim Skurski out on the field Saturday night to
perform one of the most important jobs in football.
</P>
<P>
   Skurski had connected on all of one field goal in his Washington
career.
</P>
<P>
   It should never have come down to this. The Washington kicking
game should not be relegated to holding your breath and praying
that field goals and extra points are not the difference between a
win and a bitter, unforgettable loss.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder if Lambright ever took a look across the
lake last season to his old buddy, Dennis Erickson. Special-teams
debacles led to four losses for the Seahawks last season. Fixing
that broken part was priority No. 1, which explains why a new
punter and new special-teams coach, Pete Rodriguez, were brought
in.
</P>
<P>
   Glaring holes demand immediate attention, college or NFL.
</P>
<P>
   True, Lambright was willing to accept responsibility for this
botched game. His pain was evident in the post-game news
conference, when he was visibly shaken and driven to ``shield'' his
players from media questions.
</P>
<P>
   But the real way for Lambright to have avoided having to
announce ``I'll save my poor team for answering about this
disastrous loss'' was to have looked at the Husky record book. That
way, Lambright would see there is no way a shaky kicking game is
going to go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington tradition for place-kickers is rich. Chuck
Nelson's 1982 field-goal percentage (25 of 26 field goals made for
96.2 percent) is still an NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jaeger, who also went on to a stellar NFL career and is now
kicking for the Chicago Bears, set a record for 80 field goals
during his 1983-86 Husky career.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lansford went for two seasons when he did not miss an extra
point, booting 71 of 71 over 22 games in 1978 and '79.
</P>
<P>
   Before Lentz walked out last week, he already was in limbo. He
had claimed a quadriceps pull. He had been placed in equal standing
with Skurski, although all this turmoil seems easily traced to
Lentz's contention that he was told he would be rewarded with a
scholarship if he contributed to the team.
</P>
<P>
   With his 7-for-10 field-goal kicking in 1997, Lentz was the
second-leading scorer for the Huskies _ which only proves that
kickers, even the most average, can make the difference. And Lentz
was the first ray of hope that the Huskies' kicking game could at
least connect on 50 percent of its attempts.
</P>
<P>
   In a college football world of diminished scholarship
opportunities, the Huskies have had the added displeasure of the
lingering effects of their Pac-10 sanctions. If this has made the
Husky coaching staff blind to the dangers of praying a walk-on
kicker will be the answer, this last week should prove the ultimate
eye-opener.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright obviously feels bad for letting down the players who
did everything they could to beat Arizona. Freshman tailback Willie
Hurst and backup quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo were weapons enough
to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   But as bad as Lambright feels, just think about poor Jim
Skurski, who missed two field goals and an extra point Saturday,
with two of those attempts blocked.
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to put a kicker on the field to ensure
important wins are signed, sealed and delivered, then it has to be
a kid good enough to earn a free ride. It's time for the Huskies to
sign, seal and deliver on this crucial part of the game.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Nine yards to destiny. Nine yards to mount a rocket
booster on Arizona's football season, perhaps giving it life all
the way to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   When University of Washington players saw on video Ortege
Jenkins' miraculous tote-and-tumble to the end zone Saturday night,
they had reason to be all the more chagrined. Jenkins, the Wildcat
quarterback, retreated all the way to the Husky 20 before making
his dash for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no doubt,'' Jenkins said in the euphoric Arizona locker
room. ``I don't know my vertical jump _ 37 (inches), 38, something
like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   With 12 seconds on the clock and Arizona owning no timeouts,
this is how the play unfolded:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona calls it ``A-2.'' Wildcat wide receiver Dennis Northcutt
and tight end Mike Lucky lined up left as Jenkins' two primary
targets. As the Huskies rushed four linemen, Jenkins backpedaled,
looked left and decided nothing was available.
</P>
<P>
   His right foot crossed the 20, and then he reversed himself,
sprinting up the middle. The Husky linemen were pushed to the
outside, so Jenkins was able to get his charge under way without
changing direction. By the 15, he was past the down linemen.
</P>
<P>
   He bolted straight ahead, and the Husky linebackers, who had
dropped into coverage, confronted him inside the 5, joined by free
safety Brendan Jones. Side by side, inside linebacker Marques
Hairston and Jones hunkered into squat positions at the 2, ready to
hammer Jenkins down. From Jenkins' right side, the other inside
linebacker, Lester Towns, moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Either Jenkins would score, or the game would end. Getting out
of bounds was not an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get squared up to hit him,'' Towns said, as he left
Hec Edmundson Pavilion at midnight. ``I don't know why everyone
went low. If they'd hit him high, he wouldn't have gone in.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins launched himself from the 4-yard line, seemingly into
the night sky. Hairston and Jones were foils, their minimal contact
only increased the arc of Jenkins' somersault.
</P>
<P>
   When he came down, he landed on his feet. Had he needed to, he
could have run to the University Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jumped so high,'' marveled Jones. ``I give him all the
credit in the world. He did what he had to do to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredible,'' said Jeff Woodruff, the Arizona running backs
coach who made his first return to Husky Stadium since his firing
by UW coach Jim Lambright after the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got hired (last winter), I looked at some of the
big plays of a year ago, and the thing I noticed, the guy made some
spectacular plays off-balance and out of position.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he's going to play basketball for Lute Olson (Jenkins
has been a deep reserve), he's got to be a pretty good player. When
I talked to Miles Simon and Jason Terry and Mike Bibby, they said
practicing against him was tougher than a lot of guys they played
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Tomey, the Arizona coach, said he had never seen a more
marvelous play in the crucible of a win-or-lose situation. Asked
what he thought when Jenkins rose at the 4, Tomey said, ``I just
know he's gonna go high.''
</P>
<P>
   Husky Stadium was almost empty when Jenkins, completing
interviews in the end zone, ran joyously up the tunnel. Scavanging
kids begged for his wristbands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't give you this one,'' Jenkins said. ``It's got the plays
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   With plays like his, who needs a script?

CHIEFS SINK SEAHAWKS ON LAKE ARROWHEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Another 10 minutes of rain Sunday night, and
Kansas City could have opened its first fresh seafood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The hastily rearranged halftime show featured Gordon Lightfoot
singing ``The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the best part of the Seahawks-Chiefs water-balloon fight was
that it provided Seattle a climatological preview of the new
roofless football stadium scheduled to open in 2002, not to mention
a name: Waterworld.
</P>
<P>
   True, weather in Seattle doesn't usually happen like this _ 3.6
inches of rain in less than two hours, accompanied by gales and a
light show with percussion that surpassed the best of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part of the game for the Seahawks was that it was the
same Seattle story in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   For the 16th time in the last 17 games in this place, the
Seahawks went down in the standard ignominious fashion. But instead
of a thud, they went down with a splash.
</P>
<P>
   In a game played mostly at flood stage, the Seahawks managed to
set a low-water mark in a 17-6 defeat. In a season filled with
optimism after a 3-0 start, they have lost two straight road games
to good teams _ the kind of games that they vowed to win to fulfill
the expensively promoted promise of turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't beat us _ we beat us,'' defensive tackle Sam Adams
said. ``If they beat us, we'd be concerned. But we've made the same
kind of mistakes two weeks in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's got to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, the defense was resolute, except for one hiccup that
allowed an 80-yard gamebreaker of a touchdown pass to Andre Rison.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the offense bordered on the inept.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the thunderstorm was abominable, the ball was slippery and
leaden, the field was sod cheesecake and the pratfalls were
hilarious. But unless they had mud caked over their ears and eyes,
the Seahawks will have a difficult time explaining the false
starts, misreads, blown plays and fundamental mistakes that had
little to do with abysmal conditions. The Chiefs were overboard in
the same brown ocean, and somehow learned to swim.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the environmental burlesque was the Seahawks' Voyage to
the Bottom of the Playbook _ again. Much as it happened last week
in Pittsburgh, the Seahawks were desperate for just one big play to
turn the game around.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the big play went to K.C. when quarterback Rich Gannon
connected with Rison at the end of the third quarter for the game's
second touchdown _ one that might as well have been worth 60 points
instead of six, given the Seahawk offensive breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at the weather, but at the same time, the
offense hasn't played well, maybe even going back to preseason,''
said quarterback John Friesz, who played most of the second half in
relief of injured Warren Moon. ``We just haven't played at a real
high level.''
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of the first-half cyclone, the futility was
understandable _ no pass completions, just two first downs and 37
yards rushing by the six-minute halftime, a concession to the
54-minute delay in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last game (against San Diego on Sunday here), I said it was
the worst conditions I'd ever seen,'' Chiefs coach Marty
Schottenheimer said. ``How little I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the airborne water was so dense, the upper deck
stands across from the press box could not be seen. Stadium lights
created a sheen on the rain-soaked field that for a few moments
created a lake-like glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was praying every time I got under center than I didn't
fumble the snap,'' Moon said. ``The ball was sitting in a couple
inches of water.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final play before play was temporarily halted _
supervisor of officials Art McNally said play either must be
stopped or yardage converted to fathoms _ Moon was sacked on a
busted play, and the hit cracked a rib. He never returned.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky guy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlucky Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half that was mostly free of wind, rain and
standing water, the Seahawks under Friesz squandered multiple
opportunities provided by five K.C. fumbles. The opening series of
the third quarter ended when Friesz missed a wide-open Joey
Galloway on a pass in the flat at midfield, throwing out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as close as I've come to throwing a pass backwards,''
Friesz said of his lost grip on the ball. ``Sometimes when you have
dry hands, it works against you. I think I'd rather have the ball
and my hands wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul-weather games are always field-position affairs that turn
on the running game and turnovers. They are manly sorts of jousts
that reveal who can turn calamity into opportunity. All you need to
know about the Seahawks on this black evening was that they had
more yards in penalties (88) than rushing (73). In this four-hour
trudge through sludge, the Seahawks were also revealed to be closer
to their past than their future.

CLINTON'S RATING DOWN ACROSS CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton's support in his political
stronghold of California has steadily eroded in recent weeks, with
his job approval rating sliding and more people expressing dislike
of him, a new Field Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   While 57 percent still approve of the chief executive's job
performance, a growing number _ 38 percent _ both disapprove and
believe he will not be effective if he stays in office.
</P>
<P>
   The findings released Sunday document ``a steady and marked
erosion'' in Clinton's public support statewide in the wake of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, said pollster Mervin Field. ``Clinton and
his aides and lawyers have been able to stem the tide running
against them . . . now their ability to withstand the tide seems to
be in question.''
</P>
<P>
   The stark evidence of growing irritation with Clinton in
California, with no end to the slide in sight, may have profound
implications for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a state where you would expect Clinton to be doing
better than the rest of the nation,'' said Field, noting that
Clinton has returned to the nation's most populous state 41 times
in his administration, largely because of the wide support he has
enjoyed in campaign and fund-raising trips.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Californians support a congressional censure of
Clinton, sizable numbers of voters _ though not majorities _ still
oppose impeachment or resignation, the poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet California voters _ while increasingly disapproving of
Clinton _ ``still don't see (independent counsel) Kenneth Starr as
a hero,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows 53 percent still disapprove of Starr's overall
job performance, compared to 40 percent who approve, a number that
has held surprisingly steady in the face of the revelations
regarding Clinton. And far more voters (57 percent) still believe
Starr is more interested in hurting Clinton than finding the truth
(35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Field, dean of California pollsters, had weeks ago predicted
such a slide, saying his studies of state public opinion were
reflecting trends seen during the development of President Richard
Nixon's Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since mid-September, when Starr made his report public and all
the details were revealed,'' in both videotapes and transcript,
Clinton has steadily suffered a marked decline in public support
that suggests no sign of reversal, said Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back at Watergate . . . the public started believing
that maybe Nixon was involved, (and) once there was documentation,
the support started dropping,'' Field has noted.
</P>
<P>
   The current poll shows that in California, while they are still
not in the majority, ``the public is contemplating (impeachment and
resignation) more than they had before,'' Field said. Among the
findings of the latest Field Poll:
</P>
<P>
   -- Clinton's job performance rating _ considered a critical
measure of his strength in office _ has dropped to 57 percent, with
a 38 percent disapproval rating. That compares to February, when
his job approval rating was 65 to 28. ``It only looks like eight
points ... but it's a huge drop,'' said Field, because the gap has
shrunk so dramatically between those numbers in a relatively short
time.
</P>
<P>
   -- 42 percent of voters now say they dislike Clinton
``somewhat'' or ``a lot,'' compared to 39 percent who say they like
him a lot or somewhat. Last February, those numbers were almost
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   -- Before the release of the Starr report, voters were evenly
divided (45 to 45) on Clinton's explanation of his affair with
Lewinsky. Now, nearly half are dissatisfied and 38 percent are
satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fewer voters now believe Clinton will be effective if he
remains in office. In February, a solid 77 percent held to that
belief; it dropped to 68 percent in August, following Clinton's
speech to the nation on his relationship with Lewinsky; it now
stands at 60 percent, the poll shows. ``The key thing, and the
dismaying thing for the country, is the (drop in) confidence
levels'' that the numbers reflect, said Field.
</P>
<P>
   -- A solid majority (57 percent) still favors censure or
reprimand of Clinton, and allowing him to remain in office _ but 59
percent of voters do not believe Congress should drop its probe or
action against Clinton, the poll shows. While they are not in the
majority, ``it's a sign when you get as many people as this (36
percent) saying to impeach him _ and 39 percent saying he should
resign,'' said Field. ``It's very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Californians are split on their views of the work of the
House Judiciary Committee in handling the probe of the sex scandal.
By a 42-to-37 percent rating, more voters disapprove of their work.
Most (41 percent) still believe the committee's work is moving at
the right pace, however, while 39 percent think that it's moving
too slowly. About 1 in 10 voters think the committee is moving too
rapidly, the poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   -- Two-thirds of state voters characterized the sex scandal's
damage to the nation as ``a great deal'' (34 percent), or ``some''
(33 percent). Another third said there was little or no damage, or
had no views on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   -- Public opinion on the Clinton sex scandal remains deeply
divided by both gender and party affiliation, the poll shows.
Democrats generally are far more supportive and approving of
Clinton, more favorable to the idea of censure and more likely to
believe Clinton would be effective if he serves out his term.
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally more supportive and less critical of Clinton
than are men. Pollster Mark DiCamillo attributes that difference to
the gender gap _ 57 percent of women are registered Democrats _ and
Clinton's cultivation of the women's vote by his focus on policy
issues they care about.
</P>
<P>
   -- Voters statewide appear ambivalent to the idea of President
Al Gore: Only 18 percent express ``a great deal'' of confidence in
Gore, with about a third saying they have some confidence, and 44
percent saying they have little or no confidence. Surprisingly, 30
percent said the selection of California U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein
as Gore's vice president would make them less supportive of a Gore
presidency versus more (25 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Field said those answers probably reflect voters' uneasiness
with a change in the presidency more than any particular negative
feelings about either Feinstein or Gore. ``The public doesn't like
the idea of contemplating the idea of a Gore presidency, or anybody
else being vice president'' yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Field Poll was based on a random statewide telephone sample
of 772 registered California voters, taken September 27-October 3.
The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points.

SNYDER INSISTS SUN DEVILS CAN TURN SEASON AROUND  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the anti-Devil.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Arizona State football team has emerged as a strange
alter-ego to the 1996 Sun Devils who went to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That group found unlikely ways to win. This season's team finds
unlikely ways to lose. Bounces and breaks often went the 1996
team's way. This group wouldn't recognize good fortune if it bit it
in the shoulder pad.
</P>
<P>
   It has meant the difference between a 5-0 and 2-3 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot go in front of my team now and say you played like
dogs. Because they didn't,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder spent most of Sunday trying to get a handle on his team
after a devastating 35-24 loss Saturday to Southern California. The
Trojans outscored the Sun Devils, 22-0, in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He also awaits word on starting quarterback Ryan Kealy, who was
knocked out of the game in the first series because of a
concussion. Snyder had nothing new to report but is optimistic that
Kealy will return to practice Tuesday, and he is expected to start
Saturday against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy's absence against USC was only part of the story. Two
fourth-quarter plays did irreparable damage: a blocked punt and an
interception. Both were returned for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Add a botched defensive play against Washington and ASU could be
3-0, instead of 1-2, in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should actually have a lot of confidence right now
because we know if we ever straighten up, we're going to be good,''
Snyder said. ``Maybe we don't understand how to win yet. But I have
a totally different taste in my mouth right now than I did after
the BYU (loss).''
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder also knows good teams find ways to win, and he's
still searching for an answer as to why this team can't close the
deal. Chemistry and immaturity are candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The clock always seems to run out on the Sun Devils, and the
season is beginning to tick away. ASU needs answers, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils sit in seventh place in the conference. They must
begin winning league games if they want a shot at a decent bowl.
Their Rose Bowl hopes are all but dead. Next in line for Pac-10
teams are, in descending order, the Holiday Bowl in San Diego, the
Sun Bowl in El Paso and the Aloha and Mele Kalikimaka bowls in
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we can get our team emotionally and physically
prepared like they were (Saturday) for the next six games, we'll
win a lot of those games,'' Snyder said. ``Six in a row would be
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   That would make ASU 8-3, the same regular season record the Sun
Devils had in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Six in a row won't be easy. Notre Dame visits Saturday, and ASU
has games remaining against undefeated Arizona and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder has only the Fighting Irish on his mind now, and if his
team hopes to win, it needs to prevent the mistakes that cost the
team against USC: a punt team breakdown that allowed USC's Antuan
Simmons to go untouched as he got a hand on Stephen Baker's punt,
and an offensive breakdown on the interception return.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, you go back and look at the punt,'' Snyder said. ``You
coach the technique of it, or you change the personnel. Two, with
the interception for a touchdown, I think partially that could be
attributed to a young quarterback trying to make a play who has
very little playing time and wasn't emotionally prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Elliott replaced Kealy during the first series. Elliott had
a solid game, despite some rookie mistakes, but he threw an
interception with 8:27 remaining in the game that David Gibson
returned for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to their place and outhit them,'' Snyder said. ``The
tempo was ours. I'm not mad at my team from that standpoint. I'm
mad at the other stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't close the game.'' &QL;

DAVIS LIKES BEATING TEAM THAT DUMPED HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Greg Davis, shipped out by the Cardinals two
seasons ago, wasn't mad Sunday, but he certainly got his ``evens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit this feels pretty good,'' said Davis, who
kicked field goals of 51, 40 and 34 yards for the Raiders on Sunday
as Oakland extinguished his former team, 23-20. ``I didn't want to
build this up too much, but when the fourth quarter rolled around,
I really wanted this one bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really bitter when they waived me _ it took the rest of
the season to get over it. But in retrospect, they made the right
decision. At that point, I was really upset with the organization
and had a terrible attitude. That's not healthy in the locker
room.''
</P>
<P>
   The parting stemmed from an two-year contract dispute. Davis
claimed the Cardinals owed him bonus money that they refused to
pay. The arbitrator ruled for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that came down, I knew I was gone,'' Davis said. ``But it
was really hard to come to work for two years while it was going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while Davis made good from 51 yards into the wind,
Cards Coach Vince Tobin elected not to allow his kicker, Joe
Nedney, to attempt a 52-yarder with the wind in third quarter, and
a 55-yarder into the wind that could've been a game-tying kick on
the game's final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a pulled groin. What was their excuse?'' said Davis,
whose injury resulted in his being pulled from kickoff duties by
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, however, the injury helped him on field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wearing a strap that restricts my leg, but on a shorter
distance kick, I'm able to swing it. It makes me use the motion I
need to kick. I can't over swing or I'll snap my leg. It's weird,
it's almost like the injury helped me. I hit from 52 in pre-game,
so I knew I could make it if I was asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many in Sun Devil Stadium, Davis said he didn't understand
why Tobin declined to give Nedney an opportunity to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good kicker,'' he said. ``He has a real strong leg.
From where he was, it was a 40 percent kick, which is a heck of a
lot better percentage than any other play they could've run. You
can't risk running a play with five seconds left.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedney, who made field goals of 41 and 29 yards, said he would
have enjoyed the game-tying chance but said it was a coaching
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those situations, I had 56 yards with a little
breeze in my face, and they thought they could hit a quick out and
get me a couple more yards,'' he said. ``He was trying to help me.
I can't say I would've made it, but I'd have given it a good ride.
I live for those chances.'' &QL;

METCALF SAYS FUMBLE STICKS IN HIS MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 and TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. -  &UR; Eric Metcalf didn't want to talk about his six
kickoff returns for 194 yards Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll remember this game for the fumble,'' Metcalf said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were leading the Oakland Raiders, 14-6, when
Metcalf fumbled a punt early in the second quarter and the Raiders'
 &UR; Kenny Shedd recovered at the Arizona 36.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland scored after that turnover and went on to collect 17
unanswered points in beating the Cardinals, 23-20, at Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll remember it because they got points out of it,'' Metcalf
said. ``It would be different if they didn't score.'' &QL; 
Help missing &QL; 
Former Arizona State cornerback  &UR; Eric Allen's triumphant return to
Sun Devil Stadium on Sunday was just a couple of feet away from
being a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The record will show Allen picked off a scrambling  &UR; Jake
Plummer's underthrown pass to the wide-open  &UR; Larry Centers in the
end zone, taking away beautiful field position at the Raiders'
16-yard line after rookie quarterback  &UR; Donald Hollas had fumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a late read,'' Allen said. ``He was scrambling,
but I didn't even see him scramble. But I knew I had a safety on
top of me, so I played the underneath portion and he underthrew the
pass. I didn't realize it until I saw the play on the replay board,
but our safety wasn't there.'' &QL; 
Missing seconds &QL; 
The Cardinals are still wondering what happened to 26 seconds on
the clock during the Raiders' final fourth-quarter possession.
Oakland's  &UR; Harvey &UR; Williams carried for three yards to set up a
third and 1 at Arizona's 42 with 7:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   After 26 seconds ran off the clock, the referee called an
official timeout and measured for a first down, which was given to
the Raiders, but no time was added back on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did ask the officials if the clock was right, or if they
shouldn't put more time on it,'' Cardinals defensive coordinator
Dave McGinnis said. ``They just didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those seconds might have proven pivotal at game's end, when the
Cardinals tried unsuccessfully to set up a potentially tying field
goal. &QL;

   Sometimes I want to take all of you out behind the barn and slap
a little sense into you, except I haven't lived on land with a barn
since I was a kid and even then it functioned much less as a barn
than a garage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But where I feel like knocking you conscious is beside the
point. Rather, the point is that for months now you've been so
focused on Bill and Monica and the attendant and repugnant cast of
hundreds that not one of you has remarked to me how astonishing it
is that scientists are on a roll, discovering all kinds of other
planets in the cosmos. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As I write this (about 2:35 p.m.), news has just broken that a
team of astronomers using the huge Keck telescope in Hawaii has
found two planets in orbit around sun-like stars. That brings to 12
the number of these planets discovered beyond our solar system in
the last few years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no proof yet that any of these dozen planets has even a
single junior college, Taco Bell or covered parking garage, any one
of which might indicate the presence of life. But you start adding
up planets at this rate and pretty soon the law of averages, if
any, will turn up one with dude ranches and telemarketers galore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but I'm a lot more interested in what
life forms on a planet orbiting the star HD187123 are up to than I
am in what a ditz like Monica Lewinsky is going to do with the rest
of her life besides write tell-all books and host her own talk show
and autograph baseballs in stadiums on Bimbo Night. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As magazine editor Lewis Lapham once said of the late Princess
Diana, I am not engaged by Monica's search for the needle of her
self in the haystack of her press clippings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you think I just made up the name of that star,
HD187123. No, no. Too many columnists have gotten into deep and
justifiable trouble this year for making up stuff. If I can find a
way around that, I won't do it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that HD187123 is the real name of one of the stars
around which a team of astronomers, who mostly are connected with
San Francisco State University, recently found a planet. The other
star with a newly found planet, just for the record, is HD210277. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If I were to make up the name of a star I'd do a lot sexier job
than HD210277. I'd call it something like Flame Pants. But, as I
say, enough about Bill Clinton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These two newly discovered planets, by the way, have orbits
quite dissimilar from one another. One circumnavigates HD210277 in
437 days, a couple of months longer than it takes Earth to travel
around our sun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the one around HD187123 is much goofier. It is so close to
its sun that it circles it about every three days. Hoo-boy. Imagine
starting Monday morning in January and slamming into December by
the time you go to bed on Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about the new planet discoveries is that
an amateur astronomer had something to do with them. I have nothing
against professional scientists, except that sometimes they tend to
get a little pretentious. Well, a lot pretentious, actually. But
it's nice to see amateurs do well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This one's name is Kevin Apps, an undergraduate at the
University of Sussex, which as far as I know is still in England. A
year or so ago he saw the list of stars this team of astronomers
planned to check for planets and told them 30 on their list weren't
good candidates. He suggested 30 better ones, and one turned out to
be HD187123. Way to go, Kevin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You know, Bill Clinton should be glad about this, too. It means
that if he ever gets sent to the clink for something, HD187123
won't be his prison number, it already having been spoken for. &QL;

 By STEVEN A. HOLMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Different reports, different eras, same subject:
race.
</P>
<P>
   Issued 30 years apart, the famous 1968 Kerner Commission study
on race and the newly issued report of President Clinton's advisory
board on race are a study in contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Kerner report, named for its chairman, Otto Kerner, former
governor of Illinois, was replete with dire warnings. It said the
country was becoming ``two societies, one black, one white _
separate and unequal.'' And it called for urgent government action
_ including hefty spending and, if necessary, tax increases _ to
address the problems of America's ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   The other, issued last month by a seven-member panel led by the
historian John Hope Franklin, is by many accounts a pallid
monograph. Its major recommendation is for a presidential council
on racial disparities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton officials say comparisons are unfair: The Kerner
Commission was an independent body, while the Clinton board was
little more than an extension of the White House, charged mainly
with taking the country's racial temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Probably a more telling explanation lies in the eras the two
bodies conducted their work. The Kerner Commission began its work
in 1967, a time of catastrophic race riots in Newark, Detroit and
scores of other cities. A sense of urgency, if not national panic,
reigned.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Franklin's panel worked during a time of relative
racial peace, marked by dramatic improvements in the status of
blacks (some the result of policies advocated by the Kerner
Commission) and public skepticism of government programs and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting reports _ excerpted below (with subheadings
added for emphasis) _ can be seen as bookends for an era of
activism followed by confusion over what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Then: Attack the Problem
</P>
<P>
   The only genuine, long-range solution from what has happened
lies in attack _mounted at every level _ upon the conditions that
breed despair and violence. All of us know what those conditions
are: ignorance, discrimination, slums, poverty, disease, not enough
jobs. We should attack these conditions _ not because we are
frightened by conflict, but because we are fired by conscience. _
 &UR; Opening statement by President Lyndon B. Johnson, July 27, 1967 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now: Let's Keep Working On It
</P>
<P>
   Today, I ask the American people to join me in a great national
effort to perfect the promise of America for this new time as we
seek to build our more perfect union ... That is the unfinished
work of our time, to lift the burden of race and redeem the promise
of America.
 &UR; _ Opening statement by President Clinton, June 14, 1997 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then: Divided We Fall
</P>
<P>
   To pursue our present course will involve the continuing
polarization of the American community and, ultimately, the
destruction of basic American values. _  &UR; Introduction to Kerner
report &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now: United We Stand
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, the Board heard stories and shared
experiences that reinforced their belief that we are a country
whose citizens are more united than divided. All too often,
however, racial differences and discrimination obstruct our ability
to move beyond race and color to recognize our common values.
 &UR; _Introduction to Clinton report &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then: The Aim Was `Visible Progress'
</P>
<P>
   It is time to adopt strategies for action that will produce
quick and visible progress. It is time to make good the promises of
American democracy to all citizens _ urban and rural, white and
black, Spanish-surname, American Indian and every minority group.
_ &UR; Kerner introduction &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now: The Aim Is `Dialogue'
</P>
<P>
   The Board struggled with the fact that there currently does not
exist a language or vocabulary that respects differences of opinion
and experience that often materialize during conversations about
race and racism in this country. The absence of such a language
created tensions and opportunities to expand the dialogue.
_ &UR; Clinton board's introduction &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then: Integrate the Schools
</P>
<P>
   We support integration as the priority education strategy
because it is essential to the future of American society ... It is
indispensable that opportunities for integration between the races
be expanded.
 &UR; _Kerner Commission &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now: Hey, That Was a Good Idea
</P>
<P>
   Emerging evidence shows that diversity in the education context,
including racial diversity is essential to provide all students
with a complete educational experience. To varying degrees in the
K-12 and higher education contexts, diversity can promote many
benefits that accrue to all students and society.
 &UR; _Clinton board &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then: The News Media Are Out to Lunch
</P>
<P>
   By and large, news organizations have failed to communicate to
both their black and white audiences a sense of the problems
America faces and the sources of potential solutions. The media
report and write from the standpoint of a white man's world. The
ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro's
burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed. _ &UR; Kerner
Commission &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now: What Media?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _The Clinton advisory board did not discuss the media. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Then: Subsidize Millions of New Homes
</P>
<P>
   In our view the dimension of the need calls for an unprecedented
national effort. We believe that the nation's housing programs must
be expanded to bring within the reach of low and moderate income
families 600,000 new and existing units next year and 6 million
units over the next five years.
 &UR; _Kerner Commission &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now: Segregation Is Regrettable
</P>
<P>
   Many poor minority residents live in segregated, isolated and
stigmatized neighborhoods. Racial segregation, limited job
opportunities, and discrimination continue to serve as a basis for
persistent minority poverty. As a result, efforts to remove these
barriers to prosperity are important, although not easy, and will
require commitment from government, business, the nonprofit
community and local communities. _ &UR; Clinton board &LR;

<TEXT>
<P>
   I am ashamed,'' wrote Fanny Burney, the English novelist, in
1778, ``of confessing that I have nothing to confess.''
</P>
<P>
   If she were alive today, she might have put her talents to use
as a speech writer or maybe a deposition coach for President
Clinton, so perfect was her grasp of the convoluting concept of
shame.
</P>
<P>
   Shaming people in public has always been a tantalizing idea to
Americans _ punishing wrongdoers by making them hang their heads
before their community. But a few years ago, there was a new burst
of interest in shaming.
</P>
<P>
   Judges began to order thieves to wear sandwich boards and walk
outside the stores they had stolen from. And the courts ordered
people convicted of assault or child molestation to put signs in
their yards announcing their transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton's opera of embarrassment has brought public shaming
to a new high. More than ever, it appears, people are in the mood
for good old red-faced humiliation. These days, you can get shamed
on television, on the World Wide Web, on the bumper sticker of your
car.
</P>
<P>
   In June, ``Forgive or Forget,'' a nationally syndicated TV show,
premiered, featuring people wringing out their guilt and begging
for forgiveness. A woman is ashamed that she let her boyfriend
think he was the father of her baby. A man is sorry he lost touch
with his daughter for years. A woman blames herself for getting her
sister addicted to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   They apologize, they confess, they grovel. And then, at the
prompting of the host, a woman named Mother Love, they stand before
a door on stage and nervously open it. If their victim is on the
other side, they kiss and make up. If no one is there, the guilty
one is left to dissolve in tearful desperation before the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Scarlet Letter ethic. This summer, a judge in
Massachusetts said chronic drunk drivers could be ordered to put
bright orange bumper stickers on their cars announcing their
problem and urging other drivers to report ``erratic driving'' to
the police.
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, the police department has organized ``shaming
details,'' in which people arrested for soliciting prostitution and
other street crimes are hauled in front of community members
waiting at the precinct house. As the accused stand before them
handcuffed, the citizens let loose with a kind of verbal stoning.
</P>
<P>
   They scold, saying things like, ``You're the reason our children
aren't safe in this neighborhood,'' said Lt. Marie Przynski, who
started the shaming program in the police precinct she commands.
Afterward, the accused are released, but the arrests stay on their
records and their names and license plate numbers are given to
neighborhood leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community loves it,'' Lieutenant Przynski said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Kansas City, Mo., started ``John TV,'' in which the
names, mug shots, birth dates and hometowns of men arrested for
trying to buy sex, and women arrested for trying to sell, it are
broadcast on the municipal cable channel. Mug shots of such
dignitaries as a fire department captain and a former federal
prosecutor have been shown, said Teresa Loar, the city councilwoman
who sponsored the legislation that created ``John TV.'' Thanks to
popular demand, she said, the show is now run four times each
Wednesday, up from once when it started.
</P>
<P>
   Its popularity has inspired another show, ``Slumlord of the
Month.'' The slumlord theme is big from Syracuse, which last year
began posting ``Slum Property'' signs in front of decrepit
buildings, to Des Moines, where officials recently decided to
publish the names of the owners of the city's worst properties.
</P>
<P>
   With all this energy invested in humiliation, does it work?
Nobody really knows yet, experts say. In Kansas City, Sgt. Jim
Connelly, supervisor of the police department's vice unit, said the
success of ``John TV'' was hard to measure. The recidivism rate has
not changed, he said, but some men seem to be more cautious about
whom they pick up, fearing that the women may be undercover
officers. ``It's not a cure-all,'' he said. ``I wish it was.''
</P>
<P>
   And was the decision of a woman in Eau Claire, Wis., a positive
result or a negative one? Convicted of welfare fraud, she chose to
go to jail instead of suffer the embarrassment of wearing a sign
that said, ``I stole food from poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Kahan, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School,
thinks shaming is generally a good idea because it provides an
inexpensive and morally satisfying alternative to imprisonment.
``Fines and community service don't strike people as appropriate,''
he said. ``They don't seem to be serious enough to fit the crime,
and community service seems uplifting rather than downgrading.''
Some critics object to shaming because it can also humiliate
innocent family members who live in the house with the sign outside
or drive the car with the bumper sticker on it.
</P>
<P>
   June Tangney, a professor of psychology at George Mason
University in Fairfax, Va., says shaming may make society feel
good, but it is unlikely to succeed at changing the behavior of the
person being humiliated, especially since those people are used to
flouting society's rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feelings of shame can actually have some pretty unintended
negative consequences,'' said Tangney, who has studied shame among
people who have made non-criminal mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people feel shamed or humiliated, they're likely to want
to hide and likely to avoid taking responsibility,'' she said. ``If
we are holding the person up to public humiliation, the offender's
focus then is on themselves and how they're being badly treated,
rather than a focus on the behavior and the consequences of the
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Will Rogers may have had the best advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live in such a way,'' he said, ``that you would not be ashamed
to sell your parrot to the town gossip.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, British Airways began issuing printed warnings to
abusive passengers, giving notice that continued misbehavior could
result in hefty fines and even jail sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The handouts, which British reporters immediately dubbed
``yellow cards'' after the warnings soccer players receive from
referees prior to being ejected from a game, are the latest
development in a two-year campaign by the airline industry to clamp
down on passengers who assault gate agents, flight attendants and
even pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and television stations around the world have
featured scores of accounts of what appears to be an alarming
increase in angry passengers who punch, kick, scratch, bite and
head-butt airline workers or one another.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an American Airlines flight from New York to Los
Angeles made an unscheduled landing in Denver to unload a passenger
who had become violent after a bodyguard asked him to stop
bothering members of the rock band Hootie and the Blowfish.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, a young British woman was sentenced to 15
months in prison for attacking three flight attendants on a British
Airways flight from New York to London in June. The woman had just
been denied entry into the United States and appeared to be drunk.
When the crew declined to serve her, she became violent, biting a
female flight attendant and crushing her leg with a food cart.
After being placed in handcuffs, she head-butted two other flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   The more dramatic examples of air rage have become modern
legends. Perhaps the most famous case was that of a 58-year-old
business executive from Greenwich, Conn., who got drunk on a United
Airlines flight from Buenos Aires to New York in 1995 and defecated
on a food cart.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the less-celebrated cases are even more disturbing, with
assaulted flight crews requiring stitches and extensive counseling.
``Getting beat up is not like in the Westerns,'' said Capt. Ed
Soliday, vice president of safety and security at United Airlines.
``People have a lot of mental trauma about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as deplorable as these incidents are, the question remains:
Are airline passengers really getting more unruly?
</P>
<P>
   Several airlines and unions representing pilots and flight
attendants are convinced they are. At their urging, the Federal
Aviation Administration, the Justice Department and the FBI have
stepped up efforts to prosecute aggressive passengers, resulting in
heavier fines and some lengthy prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But on closer inspection the rise in air rage appears to be a
lot like the famous crime wave in turn-of-century New York City
started by the journalists Lincoln Steffens and Jacob Riis, who
created a furor simply by reporting robberies and burglaries that
their newspapers had previously ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Because the number of airline passengers is growing each year,
it may not be surprising that the number of violent incidents is
also rising. But by any standard they are still relatively rare.
Airlines in the United States alone carried 600 million passengers
last year. The FAA reported a total of 196 incidents in which
passengers interfered with flight crews, which is a federal crime.
That's one incident for every three million passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is quick to say its records are incomplete. They
include only incidents that result in fines and other civil
penalties, not those referred to the authorities for criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring air rage is further complicated by the fact that each
airline has its own definition of what constitutes abusive
behavior. But the total number of reported incidents is still
small.
</P>
<P>
   United, the country's largest airline with 84 million passengers
last year, says it had 40 violent incidents from January through
August, down from 62 during the comparable period last year.
American, on the other hand, the second-largest carrier, said it
had 921 incidents last year, a 200 percent increase from 1994. But
unlike United, American includes verbal as well as physical
assaults in its statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Some widely accepted statistics are dubious. British Airways,
for example, said its new policy was prompted by a 400 percent
increase in air rage incidents around the world over the least
three years. Iain Jack, the carrier's head of security, said the
figure came from a presentation by an executive of Cathay Pacific
Airways at a seminar in Malaysia in May. It was ultimately traced
to an informal survey of a dozen airlines by an official of the
International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the question whether the airlines' concerted
crackdown on passenger violence in the last two years has led to an
increase in reported incidents.
</P>
<P>
   As part of their stepped-up campaigns, many airlines now
encourage employees to report incidents, offering them legal advice
and paid leave to testify in court. Before, staff were discouraged
from filing complaints because the airlines were wary of offending
customers. But many airlines changed their policies as a result of
pressure from the unions and the companies' impression that the
problem was growing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FAA and the Justice Department have pushed for
more arrests by the FBI and other federal agents. For example, 40
airport security personnel have been deputized as federal marshals
in Detroit to enable them to make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The intense interest of the news media has also helped attract
the attention of prosecutors and, as in the days of Steffens and
Riis, perhaps makes the problem appear more severe than it really
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not new by any means,'' said John Mazor, a spokesman
for the Air Line Pilots Association. ``But it is only in the last
two years that we have been able to attract the media attention and
the attention of judges and prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   Explanations for the alleged rise in air rage vary as widely as
the numbers. Some say it is due to excessive on-board drinking;
others say incidents occur when passengers are denied alcohol. The
flight attendants' unions point to overcrowding and the unrealistic
expectations of a stress-free experience raised by airline
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines point to the ``democratization'' of air travel, a
euphemism for the rising number of poorer passengers drawn to air
travel by bargain fares. But others say the inflated
self-importance of well-heeled passengers is to blame for most of
the violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Jack said 70 percent of the reported incidents on British
Airways were related to the airline's ban on smoking. But he
acknowledged that the airline really doesn't know why some
passengers become violent. It recently commissioned a psychology
professor to study the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics aside, union officials and airline executives insist
that the anecdotal evidence of increased passenger misbehavior is
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Stephen Luckey, a pilot at Northwest Airlines who is also
head of the Air Line Pilots Association's security committee,
recalled a case last year in which a passenger walked down the
aisle of a jumbo jet with his pants down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago,'' he said, ``if you would have told me about
something like that, I never would have believed it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days before Hurricane Georges struck the Gulf Coast last
week, storm forecasters faced one of their most trying
responsibilities: predicting the inherently uncertain behavior of a
hurricane in time to move people out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   The basic problem is that even though experts have improved
their ability to forecast the track of a hurricane by 30 or 40
percent in the last decade or so, the predictions are still off, on
average, by about 200 miles 72 hours before the storm's expected
landfall. In extreme cases, it takes 72 hours to carry out a mass
evacuation. Even 12 hours ahead, the error is still 40 to 50 miles.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to predicting the intensity of a storm when it
reaches land, forecasters admit they have even less skill. And they
have almost none in forecasting how large an area the hurricane
will affect once it comes ashore. ``We're back in the dark ages
relative to that,'' said Jerry Jarrell, the director of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami. ``I'm not sure anyone knows
where to begin to attack that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do forecasters do?
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal rule is that you can't afford to get people
killed because you're underprepared,'' Jarrell said as the center
began to wind down from its encounter with Georges late last week.
``So you have to overprepare. It's just that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   That means erring on the side of caution and issuing hurricane
watches for areas where the odds of the storm striking may be low.
But this carries a risk of its own. ``If you overprepare too
much,'' said Jarrell, ``you're going to have a public that doesn't
believe you.''
</P>
<P>
   After Georges ripped through the Caribbean, killing more than
300 people and leaving more than 150,000 homeless, it forced 30,000
to flee the Florida Keys and prompted the authorities to urge or
order some 1.5 million people to evacuate Louisiana alone.
Thousands more were told to leave coastal areas of Mississippi,
Alabama and the Florida panhandle. But clearly not everyone fled.
In fact, more people stayed in the Keys than left.
</P>
<P>
   The use and misuse of predictions in many fields is a topic only
now receiving attention from scientists, and uncertainty haunts
almost all attempts to predict natural phenomena. The atmosphere
presents a particularly tough problem because its fluid behavior is
so chaotic and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   With hurricanes, ``There is always error in the forecast, and
always will be'' said Dr. Jerry Mahlman, director of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory at Princeton University. ``The trick is to pound the
error down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahlman's laboratory has played a major role in reducing the
margin of error. Its global computer model of hurricane behavior,
in operation since 1995, is largely responsible for the recent
improvement in forecasting hurricane tracks. It is now the official
lead prediction model _ first among a group of models _ used both
by the National Hurricane Center and the Navy. Thirty-six hours
before Georges hit land, the center correctly predicted that the
storm would curl to the northeast of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   As coastal development along the Gulf and the Atlantic has
blossomed in the last few decades, expanding populations have made
evacuation an increasingly time-consuming and disruptive exercise.
But it isn't simply a matter of inconvenience. Estimates have put
the cost of evacuating a hurricane-prone stretch of built-up
coastline at hundreds of thousands of dollars a mile or more.
</P>
<P>
   A false alarm, then, is not to be shrugged off, nor is the
burden it puts on forecasters. ``These folks in the hurricane
center are under incredible pressures and I think they do
marvelously well in the face of those pressures,'' Mahlman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricane Center errs on the side of safety in two ways when
it issues hurricane warnings, Jarrell said. First, it expands the
area that it expects will actually experience hurricane-force
winds. ``We know we're overwarning probably by a factor of two,''
he said. This, he said, is an attempt to issue an honest forecast
while at the same time ``telling people how to allow for error.''
</P>
<P>
   The second way of building in a margin of safety, he said, is to
encourage local officials and other disaster managers to make their
preparations as if the hurricane will be one category stronger than
the forecast specifies. Hurricane intensity is rated in categories
from 1 to 5, with 5 the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Jarrell acknowledged, the caution does seem to be
excessive in retrospect. He also acknowledged the risk that if this
happens too much, people will not accept the forecasts in the
future. But the exercise is a tradeoff between that risk and the
need for people to respond to the threat of immediate danger. ``I
guess you hope their memory's not that long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jarrell said, the greatest value of improved
hurricane forecasts may be that bigger stretches of coastline can
now be eliminated from concern when warnings are issued. ``We are
expanding the number of people who don't have to worry,'' he said.

<P>
   For millions of people, Prozac and similar drugs have fulfilled
the promise of freedom from depression. But for some patients,
adjusting to a life without misery turns out to be far more
difficult than they imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and patients are discovering that recovery from
depression can bring a new array of personal problems, from social
uneasiness and crises of identity to professional and marital
strains. In short, feeling happy after years of being depressed can
be surprisingly unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people feel incredibly liberated,'' said John Oldham,
director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute. ``Others have
a rockier time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the advent of Prozac in 1988, a spate of written accounts,
most notably Peter Kramer's best-selling book, ``Listening to
Prozac'' (Viking, 1993), have documented the dramatic, and joyous,
rebirth the new antidepressants can bring. Far less well known is
the fact that the very patients who are helped by these drugs may
also undergo a turbulent period of adjustment in which they grapple
with unfamiliar identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most fundamental aspect of yourself has been ripped
away,'' said Lauren Slater, a writer and clinical psychologist in
Boston who started taking Prozac 10 years ago for a crippling
depression that began in childhood. The depression lifted, but she
was left with a lingering sense of bewilderment and grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about two years for me to stop feeling like such a
stranger to myself,'' Ms. Slater, who was one of the first patients
to take Prozac, recalled in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon has no name, has never been studied clinically
and has barely been described in popular or professional
literature. But clinicians who treat depression know it well.
``I've had more than a few patients who have read books like
`Prozac Nation' and `Listening to Prozac' who have come in and
said, `You know, I'm glad for some people it was this easy, but
this really doesn't tell my story,''' said Michael Thase, a
professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The unease that can accompany relief from depression _ call it
uplift anxiety _ manifests itself in a variety of ways. Besides
grieving for their former selves, the newly undepressed can
experience pressure to make up for lost time or feel ashamed of
needing to take medication. For many, emerging from depression
means having to negotiate the world in unaccustomed ways, as they
learn to assert themselves, take social risks and express anger _
things depressed people typically have trouble doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being plunked down in an entirely new culture,''
said Ms. Slater, 35, who chronicled her experience in ``Prozac
Diary,'' a memoir recently published by Random House. ``You have no
clue how to speak the language, how to get around. You're a person
without a map.''
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, uplift anxiety echoes the problems that can
accompany other radical changes of self, like those documented by
the neurologist Oliver Sacks. In his 1973 book ``Awakenings,'' for
example, Sacks chronicled what happened when patients ``frozen''
for decades by encephalitis lethargica were given the drug L-dopa.
The patients were restored to life, but had to learn to function in
a world that had long since passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   More than 65 million prescriptions for antidepressants were
dispensed in the United States in 1997, according to IMS Health, an
industry consulting concern. But the number of patients who
experience uplift anxiety is not known. ``It's not a rare
occurrence, and it's not a very frequent occurrence,'' said
Maurizio Fava, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School. ``I think it's something in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Those most likely to have problems feeling good, clinicians say,
are people who suffer from chronic depression, which affects
roughly 3 to 4 percent of American adults. ``If all you can
remember is depression, then there's no baseline to get back to,''
said John Markowitz, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry
at Cornell Medical Center. ``There's at least been a familiarity to
living in misery for 30 years or 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   People undoubtedly encountered this problem with older
antidepressants, clinicians say. But the huge popularity of newer
medications like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the
class of drugs that includes Prozac, has thrown the issue into
sharper relief. ``I don't think it was never seen in the past,''
said Kramer, the author and a clinical professor of psychiatry at
Brown University. ``What creates a social phenomenon is just how
widespread the prescribing of antidepressants is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients and clinicians interviewed about the adjustment to
well-being describe a range of reactions. ``Once you leave
depression, you're back in the world where people have problems and
have to make compromises and decisions and have too much to do,''
said one patient, an academic in her 40s at a Northeastern
university who recently emerged from a six-year depression with the
aid of Nardil, an older antidepressant. ``And it's more of a strain
to be in that world for a person who's had depression than it is
for a person who has a normal amount of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The patient, who requested anonymity, likened her experience to
that of a paroled convict slowly re-learning how to function on the
outside. Once active on the dinner-party circuit, she said, she is
having to teach herself how to entertain again. ``It's an effort,''
she said. ``You have to calculate things and figure out how much
time it takes you. If you're taking antidepressants, you might be
somewhat slowed down, so it might need more planning or more time
to do it or more help.''
</P>
<P>
   Some newly undepressed people feel great pressure to make up for
the years sacrificed to illness. ``I'm haunted by lost time,'' said
Ms. Slater, who underwent five hospitalizations for depression and
was unable to hold a job before she began taking Prozac. ``I've had
to work in some ways four or five times harder to catch up with my
peers. I did my doctoral program in two years, which is insane, but
I needed to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Others come out of depression only to discover that they're
stuck in jobs far below their abilities. ``While you're depressed,
you may feel you don't deserve any better,'' said Fava of Harvard.
But once the depression lifts, he said, ``a long track record of
underachievement may be quite upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, as the undepressed begin to relate differently to those
around them, family relationships can be compromised. Patients who
emerge from depression, clinicians say, often separate or divorce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon for people to have significant marriage or
partner problems upon recovery,'' Fava said. ``In depression, the
relationship sets itself in a certain way, and the moment you
change the balance, there's some sort of a reaction to it.''
</P>
<P>
   For some people, uplift anxiety can run its course in a matter
of weeks or months, clinicians say; for others it might take years
_ if it ever abates entirely. Some patients unable to adjust to
life without depression may furtively discontinue their medication,
said Oldham, who stressed the importance of warning patients of the
potential for feeling at sea.
</P>
<P>
   And the right kind of psychotherapy _ traditionally considered
an important adjunct to drug therapy _ can help ease a difficult
transition. ``What they really need to focus on is not what
happened in their childhood, but what do they want to do now,''
said Markowitz, who recommends interpersonal psychotherapy or
cognitive behavior therapy, short-term therapies designed to treat
depression.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Slater, the benefits of Prozac have been indisputable.
In the decade she's been on the drug, she has earned master's and
doctoral degrees, established a career as the director of a
community mental-health center, married happily and purchased a
home. But there remains, she said, a palpable sense of bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel _ I KNOW _ that something has been lost,'' she
said. ``And so the grief goes on, even while you get your bearings.
I think the sense of loss is part of being a Prozac patient.''

   &UR; Schroeder Ousts Kohl in German Election &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder, a Social Democrat, defeated Helmut Kohl to
become Chancellor of Germany, ending an era in Germany and opening
a new one in Europe, where center-left governments now dominate the
continent's politics.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of Kohl, the last of the European politicians who
were in office when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, reflects
Europe's new priorities as it grapples with the competitive
pressures of a global economy, overburdened welfare systems and
high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   And the vote reflected the profound changes in German society
that have followed the fall of the Berlin Wall. The huge cost of
unification, high unemployment in the formerly Communist part of
the country and a shift eastward, away from the conservative
Rhineland, all contributed to Kohl's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; California Sets Early Primary &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With 54 electoral votes, California has long been the 800-pound
gorilla of American politics, except when it comes to presidential
candidates. In an era of increasingly early primaries, the state's
June date made it an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill that will make California
more important than ever by moving its primary to the first Tuesday
in March, just after New Hampshire and Iowa. It will join New York
and other Eastern states in what may turn out to be a giant
national primary that ends the process almost before it has begun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fed Cuts Interest Rate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a month, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, had hinted that the global financial crisis might force
the central bank to put aside its concern about inflation and cut
interest rates. On Tuesday he acted, leading the Fed to cut its key
interest rate by a quarter point, to 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The move should give a small boost to the domestic economy by
reducing borrowing costs a bit for consumers and businesses. But
with concern growing that the global crisis could spread and
endanger the long American expansion, Greenspan mainly wanted to
send a message that he was on the case.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greenspan Questioned On Hedge Fund Rescue &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Washington tells welfare mothers not to count on government
handouts, so why did the Federal Reserve arrange a rescue for an
investment firm run by and for some of the world's richest people?
That was the question posed to Greenspan by the House Banking
Committee as he recounted the central bank's role in averting the
collapse of Long-Term Capital Management L.P., a hedge fund gone
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan answered that allowing the firm to fail would have
risked a meltdown in the markets, potentially derailing the
economy. There are always going to be failures in the marketplace,
he said, and Congress should not overreact by writing more
stringent financial regulations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Again, a Hint of Hope For Mideast Talks  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration pressed hard for a long-elusive
interim settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. President
Clinton met on Monday with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu and, Yasser Arafat, and again Tuesday with Arafat, and
invited them to return to Washington in mid-October to finish the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   That's just before the Nov. 3 Congressional elections, a time
when Clinton hopes to be seen as taking care of business despite
his other distractions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Blast From Space &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Observing repeating bursts of gamma rays from four distant
places in the galaxy, astronomers came up with an explanation, in
theory. When a star explodes, all that remains is a dense object
known as a neutron star. In rare cases, these objects must generate
extremely powerful magnetic fields. Scientists reported they have
compelling evidence of the existence of such stars, called
magnetars.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 27, an intense wave of gamma rays penetrated Earth's
upper atmosphere. It posed no health risk, but the radiation
briefly disturbed the quiet night sky with electric conditions
limiting radio transmission. Magnetars, calculations show, produce
the most powerful magnetic fields ever seen in the universe,
billions of times stronger than any on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; After 29 Years, A Budget Surplus  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It had been expected for months, but President Clinton held a
big ceremony anyway to announce that the dog days of the deficit
were over. For the first time in 29 years, the government would end
the fiscal year with a budget surplus, about $70 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But how long it will last? The president has proposed billions
of dollars in new spending. The Republicans agree with most of
those proposals and want a tax cut to boot.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the turmoil in the international financial
markets may wipe out the surplus before anyone can enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HMOs Shun Medicare &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 Medicare beneficiaries will have to find new
health insurance next year because they are in health maintenance
organizations that are cutting back their Medicare operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration told HMOs that they would not be
allowed to increase premiums or cut benefits for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Medicare agency,
said HMOs were making ``business decisions'' to withdraw from some
counties after concluding that ``it will no longer be profitable
for them'' to serve Medicare patients there.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mizrahi Shutters Design Shop &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The fashion world braced itself for a duller show season in
Bryant Park tents next month as Isaac Mizrahi, the ebullient
designer thought most likely to inherit the mantle of top designers
like Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, announced that he would close
his business. Chanel Inc., his backer since 1992, said it was
pulling out. Paradoxically, sales of Mizrahi's collection,
estimated at $20 million to $30 million, had begun to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Grand Central, at 85, Gets a Facelift &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Built in the heyday of train travel as a lustrous palace of
creamy marble walls and chandeliers, the Grand Central Terminal had
deteriorated in recent decades into a grimy symbol of urban
neglect. Now, at the age of 85, it has been restored to its former
Beaux Arts elegance.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal _ cleaned, polished and modernized at a cost of
$197 million over the last two years _ was rededicated in a
dazzling ceremony featuring trapeze artists, lasers and
whistle-blowing Metro-North train conductors providing authentic
sound effects for the debut performance of ``Grand Central!'' _ the
march.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Potholes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's not a good time to be a pothole in New York City. For
starters, it's a lot lonelier than it used to be. Back in 1994,
some 200,000 potholes livened up the city's streets, but mild
winters and diligent repair crews have slashed the number,
officials say, to 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the big hazard, if you happen to be a pothole, is all those
politicians fighting over who's going to fill you in. Alfonse
D'Amato, campaigning to retain his Senate seat, clearly revels in
his ``Senator Pothole'' image and could at any moment reach for a
shovel.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato prefers the metaphorical interpretation _
``Potholes,'' he says, ``represent the hopes and aspirations of our
people.'' _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is taking literal aim at these
little pockets of the New York experience.
</P>
<P>
   Guiliani, tireless crusader against such beloved combat sports
as extreme jaywalking and taxi bumper cars, now envisions a
crater-free utopia, vowing, with Operation Pothole Blitz, to fill
every blemish in the city's streets by December.
</P>
<P>
   So don't be surprised if some innocent pothole, simply going
about its business of jarring hubcaps loose, is suddenly
surrounded, the mayor's limo on one side, the senator's on the
other, shovels dueling in the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TV Culture &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At a lunch celebrating the start of the new TV season, the heads
of the six network programming departments pondered the future of
the television movie and declared that literature, of all things,
may be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The networks have all but announced an end to
ripped-from-the-headlines movies, their old staple. Instead, they
intend to make movies of such works as Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in
Wonderland,'' Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' and Dostoevsky's
``Crime and Punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, all those films will be shown this season on NBC,
which has made the biggest turn toward literary works in recent
seasons, producing successful movies out of such classic literary
material as ``Gulliver's Travels,'' ``Merlin'' and even ``The
Odyssey.''
</P>
<P>
   This season presents more of a challenge. The first literary
entry on NBC's schedule is ``Crime and Punishment,'' to be shown on
Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently worried about audience response to descriptions of a
dark tale of tortured spiritual redemption, NBC is not selling the
show with its usual high-decibel promotion blitz _ no ``Must-See
Dostoevsky!'' Instead, NBC is going for lots of shots of a scary
guy wielding an axe.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems NBC is also worried about how much Dostoevsky the
press can take. In its publicity package for the movie, the network
included the latest Penguin Classics edition of ``Crime and
Punishment,'' all 630 pages of it.
</P>
<P>
   For added insurance, NBC included Cliff's Notes. Yes, THOSE
Cliff's Notes _ the same little yellow-and-black booklets (``Crime
and Punishment'' in 84 pages!) that high school students hide in
their backpacks.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gen. Henry Shelton is a good soldier. But smart
salutes and muddy boots don't always take the hill, especially when
it's Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Shelton and the other Joint Chiefs of Staff
unexpectedly caught heavy fire from Senate Republicans, who berated
the military's top brass for the sin of not speaking up sooner and
louder about problems the officers say are eroding the Pentagon's
ability to fight wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were not candid to this member in the problems and
challenges that we faced,'' snapped Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and
decorated Navy pilot who spent more than five years as a prisoner
of war in North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the chiefs took a defensive crouch to wait out the
volleys. But when senators still attacked their integrity, the
four-stars hauled out their heavy artillery, and took aim at pet
projects of Congress that the Pentagon doesn't want, and at
unnecessary bases that lawmakers refuse to close.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucratic disputes that generals and senators usually hash
out in private suddenly got a very public airing. ``I am very
concerned of the implication that the gentlemen at this table
aren't being forthright and truthful,'' said Gen. Michael Ryan, the
Air Force chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The tongue-lashing from the Armed Services Committee was even
more startling because Republicans have long been the Pentagon's
most ardent supporters. ``This is a committee that is an advocate
for the United States military, no ifs, ands or buts,'' said Sen.
Dirk Kempthorne, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   So what prompted Republicans to turn their guns on trusted
allies?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, this is an election year, and Republicans have
sought to portray the Clinton administration as weak on defense,
saying it is burdening the military with too many foreign missions
while shortchanging the Pentagon's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also pointed to troubling signs of pilot
shortages, aging equipment and training cuts for some time now. But
those complaints lacked bite, because the chiefs had said the
situation was tight but manageable. That is, until last week, when
they complained in public before the senators. Taken aback, the
Republicans were angry at the generals for not giving them an
earlier opportunity to beat up on the White House over a juicy
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, conservatives felt the chiefs had violated an
unspoken pact to side with them publicly on crucial issues, even if
it means crossing the president, their commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Gen. Colin Powell, Shelton's most famous
predecessor, who looked like a soldier but was also a black-belt
political infighter. Powell even punched his ticket at the White
House with a brief stint as national security adviser to President
Ronald Reagan. Powell's strong opposition to Clinton's plan in 1993
to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the armed forces was music
to Republican ears.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Shelton, a commando with scant experience in the
political minefields of Washington, has irked Republicans on other
fronts. The chiefs have refused to endorse a Republican plan to
build a system to defend the country against long-range missile
strikes as soon as the technology is ready. Shelton says the threat
does not yet warrant constructing such a system.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Republicans and the military have crossed swords
before, only to make up, as most people believe they will this
time. But that doesn't stop many Republicans from pining for the
good old days with Powell.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: What punishment fits the crime?
 &HT;    (For release Oct. 7, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, here's where we're at:
</P>
<P>
   _ The House Judiciary hearings on Bill Clinton will drag on at
least until the first of the year and perhaps longer, fed
insatiably by partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ross Perot is grabbing any microphone he can get his little
hands on to call for a grass-roots drive to force Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   _ A self-proclaimed grass-roots organization which claims to be
nonpartisan has launched a campaign via the Web that limits
punishment of Clinton simply to censure.
</P>
<P>
   _ And former President Gerald Ford, he who pardoned Richard
Nixon, is calling for the president to stand before the Congress
and receive a public rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   There's something there for everyone!
</P>
<P>
   Probably that's why this sordid chapter of American history will
drag on until the next president is inaugurated in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is too proud to resign, so incredibly proud that he
will endure the ceaseless humiliation that will follow him for the
remainder of his term.
</P>
<P>
   What likely will have the most popular support is the Censure
And Move On movement on the Web. In the form of a cyberspace
petition, it seeks an end to the vulgar spectacle, regardless of
the offenses of Clinton _ if any.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of its visibility on the Web, the petition
drew 100,000 signatures, seeking a million by Election Day in
November.
</P>
<P>
   This likely will not satiate those who want Clinton served up
with an apple in his mouth. They will continue to press for
impeachment, knowing that the numbers presently are not there but
hoping that along the route, they will uncover even more to turn
the tide against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While resignation certainly is a splendid idea, we really don't
need that movement led by Perot. His TV bites on the issue almost
come off as comical. The carping Mr. Perot long ago lost the
respect of much of the American public. He can blame that on his
own image.
</P>
<P>
   When I read Ford's New York Times essay on rebuking Clinton
before a joint session of Congress, I kept conjuring the image of
Quasimodo, in chains, being mocked by the crowds. Clinton never
would agree to that; impeachment would seem a more tolerable course
to him.
</P>
<P>
   What all this boils down to is that there is no widely accepted
solution to the Clinton scandal. It will not go away, not for a
long time. What it also means is that this nation will remain
gridlocked in internecine warfare while the rest of the world looks
on in astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   With international crises aplenty, the United States hardly can
afford to lapse into an isolationism born of domestic paralysis. It
would be easy to tell those with whom we share this planet that we
have problems of our own and cannot be distracted at the moment,
but the world is on the verge of financial collapse; ethnic groups
still tear out the hearts of other ethnic groups; terrorists remain
fed and protected by rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   Can Bill Clinton, under siege, lead us through this, can he
effectively push programs through a hostile Congress; can he impose
U.S. will on those who are loath to accept it?
</P>
<P>
   I have my doubts, but that's what we face because no number of
the varied punishment choices, all fueled or opposed by spectrum
politics, will bring closure to that which is eating us alive.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Clinton who is under pressure; it is all of us.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: No change of underwear in Paris
 &HT;    By JOE MURRAY
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ I'm always happy to arrive in Paris. I'd have been even
happier if my luggage had arrived, too.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought ...?
</P>
<P>
   I got to the Houston airport in plenty of time, a couple of
hours before my plane was to leave.
</P>
<P>
   I checked in at the Continental counter and dropped off my one
piece of luggage, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The nice lady did mention that I'd have to check in again at the
gate.
</P>
<P>
   She should have added, ''And be there extra early or ye shall
surely die.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's fault but mine. By the time I made it to the gate,
having dawdled along the way, it was still a half hour or so until
flight time, but they'd already given up on me.
</P>
<P>
   They had given my seat away, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   What can you say?
</P>
<P>
   What I said, addressing the fellow on duty at the gate, was:
</P>
<P>
   ''You little rat fink you.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was as mild a comment as I could manage under the
circumstances _ almost a term of endearment compared to what I was
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Let me give you this bit of advice if you happen to be
traveling:
</P>
<P>
   Don't go calling the guy who controls your destiny, not to
mention your luggage, a rat fink.
</P>
<P>
   At the time I didn't think much about it. Since then, I've
thought about little else _ the way his eyes narrowed and his smile
broadened.
</P>
<P>
   He found a seat for me on the plane, no problem, though it
wasn't the seat I wanted, one next to a window so that I could get
some sleep.
</P>
<P>
   It's all but impossible for me to snooze in an aisle seat. Too
much of me hangs out into the aisle, and flight attendants run amok
keep running into me with their food carts.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. You can't have everything if you're flying coach.
Maybe having your luggage on the same flight is too much to expect.
</P>
<P>
   I think they knew it all the time. Even as the plane was
touching down in Paris, there was an on-board announcement for
''Mr. Moo-ree'' to check at the baggage pickup area ... ''for a big
surprise,'' they well could have added.
</P>
<P>
   Right away I should have smelled a rat fink.
</P>
<P>
   No luggage, no explanation. A nice lady gave me a claim check,
and I gave her my hotel address.
</P>
<P>
   She promised I would hear from them as soon as she found out
something. Never mind that she was taking off for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   I spent much of that afternoon and the next day trying to phone
the number I'd been given to check on my luggage and the lack
thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the line was busy. Sometimes nobody answered.
Sometimes I would get a fax signal.
</P>
<P>
   One time a nice lady actually answered, told me to hold on while
she checked and then, evidently, took off for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two hours later my bag finally caught up with me. That's
a long time between changes of underwear. Say la vee. When in
France, do as the French do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ha-ha, I'm only kidding when I say that the little
guy at the gate in Houston purposely misrouted my luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would be so cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody but a rat fink.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Pro-life taken to ridiculous depths
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some years ago I had to decide whether to ask that the
respirator that was keeping my 85-year-old mother alive be turned
off. I did ask. She died. The decision was painful. It was not
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Mom had made her wishes clear in a living will, and her body's
systems were misfiring randomly and shutting down one by one. Death
was inevitable. Postponing it meant needless, if only subconscious,
torment for her.
</P>
<P>
   As unpleasant as all that was, I can't even imagine how much
more traumatic it would have been if a grandstanding governor and
state legislator had forced me to fight in the courts for the right
to make a decision that state law permits. And to do so publicly,
with a media war room setting up around me and demonstrators
hounding me, often with amazing cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   That's the horror Michele Finn found herself in in Virginia when
she decided to have the feeding tube removed from her husband,
Hugh, who doctors agree has been in a ``persistent vegetative
state'' since an auto accident three and a half years ago and has
no chance of regaining consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume Gov. James S. Gilmore III and state legislator
Robert G. Marshall are sincere in believing what's afoot here is
the euthanasia they oppose as a companion violator of their
anti-abortion principles. But even if honestly motivated, their
intrusions can't be separated from their political context.
</P>
<P>
   Michele and Hugh Finn and their families have become unwitting
shuttlecocks in the battering back-and-forth of our open-ended and
fiercely politicized culture war.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore isn't an eager ideological belligerent like his
predecessor, fellow Republican George Allen, but as a conservative,
his deference to the party's doctrinaire right is ongoing. As
attorney general, he joined efforts to overturn the Brady
gun-control bill, fought pollution regulations, ended a ban against
public school buses carrying religious-school pupils and argued
against homosexual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore's inauguration this year found the hard-right Oliver
North in the dignitaries' box, along with religious-right heavies
Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. Robertson has contributed $50,000
to Gilmore campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gilmore has twice hauled Michele Finn into state courts in
an attempt to keep her husband technically alive, and the placards
of Marshall's assembled demonstrators, marching outside the nursing
home, have abused her with nastiness like ``Michele: Will You Eat
While Hugh Starves?'' The insensitivity to the actually living of
supposedly pro-life zealots continues to astound, though it no
longer should surprise.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress and in the statehouses, anti-abortion and allied
cultural throwbacks are pressing in dozens of small _ but
cumulatively important _ ways to invade the most intimate sexual
and other life issues of ordinary, unoffending Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Finns were spotted as a target of opportunity at a time when
the family's privacy should have been counted virtually sacred.
But, hey, you've got to put points on the political scoreboard when
you can.

CARDOSO HEADED FOR REELECTION IN BRAZIL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso appeared to
be headed for victory Sunday in his bid to become Brazil's first
re-elected leader, in elections that seemed driven more by economic
worries than by political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Superior Electoral Tribunal said early in the evening
that with 16.3 percent of ballots counted, Cardoso had 50.9 percent
of valid votes, just enough to avoid a second-round runoff. A
leftist candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, had 34.4 percent of
valid votes, according to the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   There has been little doubt in this country of 164 million that
the 67-year-old Cardoso, a popular Social Democrat, would win. But
his victory demonstrated the hope by Brazilians that he could
strengthen an $800 billion economy that has been rocked over the
past two months by crises in Asia and Russia, and whose collapse
could threaten markets and companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has lost nearly $30 billion in foreign capital since
August, prompting a steep rise in interest rates. The country's
currency, the real, appears headed for devaluation. Government
officials have met recently with the International Monetary Fund
and other agencies to negotiate a package of loans, but no
agreement has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard from people in places like New York's stock
market speak about Brazil'' by pulling out their investments, said
Joao Mendonca, 22, a local worker for Cardoso's Social Democratic
Party. ``Now it's time for Brazilian people to speak up with their
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso, a former finance minister, was the architect of the
1994 anti-inflation plan that now appears to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded Congress last year to lift a ban that had
prohibited executive office holders from serving two consecutive
terms. Now Cardoso needs congressional approval for three new
constitutional changes he has proposed to slow the government's
growing deficit and to restore investor confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   As an intense sun bore down on this beach-ringed resort city of
5 million residents Sunday, voters dutifully cast their votes as
the law demands for citizens over 18. Throughout the country,
Brazilians reported to elementary schools, government bank branches
and post offices, which for the day were converted into polling
precincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been cloudy lately, so the sun feels especially good,''
said Yvonne Rodrigues, an ebony-haired 24-year-old hotel worker who
cast her ballot in the morning and spent the afternoon at
Copacabana beach with two friends. ``The beach can either be a
distraction from voting or it can be your reward, depending on what
kind of person you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Even along Avenida Atlantico, the glittery drive that runs the
length of Impanema and Copacabana beaches, there was plenty of
politics to be seen and heard. Youngsters waved larger-than-life
banners promoting candidates, beach vendors peddling peanuts and
beer wore campaign hats, and the white marbled sidewalks were
coated with flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Protasio cast his ballot the way most urban voters do,
electronically, by punching a number into a small box. An image of
the candidate assigned to that number appeared on a screen. Another
button must be pressed to confirm the selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most important issue is our ecology and making sure
we use our resources in the best way possible,'' said Protasio, a
28-year-old computer worker and volunteer for the Green Party who
voted for one Cardoso's opponents, Ciro Gomes. ``Yes the economy is
important, but it's all tied together, economy and ecology.
</P>
<P>
   After casting their ballots, voters receive government-issued
receipts as proof of their vote. Those who do not vote run the risk
of being called before an administrative judge and cut off from
some public services, such as obtaining a passport.
</P>
<P>
   Marinha Lopes, a 55-year-old waitress in a family-owned
restaurant, did not mind the voting requirement on a day when it
seemed that most everyone headed for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the beach type because I don't really have the body
for it,'' said Lopes, who voted for Cardoso. ``Besides, I think
it's important to vote and to help keep the economy going strong.
He's the only one who can do that.''

 &HT;    Her story on a note pad:Abuse and, ultimately, abandonment
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There she sat, on the bench in the rain, a new suitcase at her
feet. She looked so very curious that all the Wal-Mart shoppers
couldn't help but stare at her just a little, with a sideways
glance, of course.
</P>
<P>
   She was wearing a pretty jumper, and she sat perched on the
metal seat for a long time _ by some accounts for four hours. She
clutched a doll close to her chest and rocked back and forth. She
put her head down, then swung it back, either in wild abandon or
mental unrest, no one was quite sure which; and it wasn't exactly
like scores of folks were stopping by to find out, to say howdy do.
</P>
<P>
   The first to approach her, really approach her, was Pat Beach,
an assistant manager at the fancy Wal-Mart up in Jupiter (it has a
McDonald's). She saw the woman about 2 o'clock when she went out
for a cigarette break, then again about an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she's waiting for a ride home, Beach thought. Or the bus.
</P>
<P>
   But about midafternoon a shopper, a woman, approached Beach as
she was making her rounds on the Wal-Mart floor. The shopper was
worried about the woman sitting outside, alone, rocking, holding a
doll. It was raining!
</P>
<P>
   So Beach walked right out there into the warm Sunday afternoon
Florida drizzle and stood in front of the curious woman.
</P>
<P>
   And she asked her flat out: ``Are you all right?''
</P>
<P>
   The woman lowered her head, practically all the way into her
lap, and shook her head no.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when Beach called the police.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six or seven hours, indeed until 11 o'clock that
night, police and state workers and even kind-hearted Pat Beach
checked out every little detail, every little hint of truth, they
could draw from this woman who seemed to appear from nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   They checked out the sister she said might live in Fort
Lauderdale and the four siblings she said she had, three of them
with the last name of Briggs. Police called every Briggs in the
phone book.
</P>
<P>
   They explored the possibility she was the woman reported missing
earlier that day from Cabana Colony, an older neighborhood just
north of The Gardens mall.
</P>
<P>
   They called some guy who graduated from Jupiter High School a
few years back because someone said they thought the man had a
mentally handicapped sister.
</P>
<P>
   Dead end, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   The harder they worked, the more confused _ and worried _ they
became.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really had us going,'' says Jupiter detective Amy
Facchine.
</P>
<P>
   The clear signs of thought
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter police officer Brent R. Hoosaccq was the first
official-type person to meet the woman that Sunday in August. By
then Beach had taken her inside, out of the rain, and into the
manager's office where everyone learned in quick fashion that, good
grief, this woman couldn't talk.
</P>
<P>
   She was either autistic or mute, they ventured _ no one was
certain which.
</P>
<P>
   She had a wallet with $750 inside, much of it in $100 bills, but
no I.D. She had a CD player. She had a suitcase with a pillow and a
blanket and all new clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in that suitcase was brand new,'' Beach says.
``Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But the police officer and the Wal-Mart assistant manager forged
ahead. At one point, some teenagers who work at the store and know
sign language stepped in and tried to communicate with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so proud of our staff that day,'' Beach says now.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually everyone realized that even though this woman
couldn't speak, she could do a couple of other interesting things _
and she could do them well.
</P>
<P>
   She had a good mind. She could think, that was for sure.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, every time this woman wanted to talk she would grab a
note pad right off the Wal-Mart manager's desk and write down her
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Things like: Mommy takes pictures of me and abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time we knew she could write,'' Beach says.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the first time police realized they might have
another kind of a problem on their hands. They called state social
workers.
</P>
<P>
   And she could draw like nobody's business. The character in the
Garfield cartoon strip. Winnie the Pooh. The Disney characters from
Space Jam.
</P>
<P>
   The woman spent the entire day at the pretty Wal-Mart in
Jupiter. She had some McDonald's hamburgers _ on the house. She
walked the floor with Pat Beach, the only person she'd open up to.
Word spread quickly, and all the service personnel at Wal-Mart were
worried sick about the mentally ill autistic woman apparently
abandoned outside their store. Another assistant manager even
reported to work so Beach could spend more time with the mystery
woman, befriend her, draw her out bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only person who established any significant communication
with her was Pat,'' Hoosac later wrote in his report.
</P>
<P>
   It was Beach who got the woman's name. What a coup that was!
</P>
<P>
   A name and then two
</P>
<P>
   Her name was Sachel Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   Briggs said she had four brothers and sisters. She told Beach
she'd been to Seattle and Washington and Paris. She told her she
was born at a military base in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even got out the map,'' Beach says. She said her father was
dead. Her mother abused her. Her stepfather was an alcoholic. But
whenever any of the investigators got too close, Briggs would
retreat. She'd beat her head against the wall or hide under a desk
and refuse to come out.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, though, when Beach went outside to have a
cigarette and Briggs went with her, they sat on the curb outside
the store and the woman, through motions and written words, said
she'd been dropped off there _ abandoned _ by someone in a red van.
</P>
<P>
   By your brother? Beach asked.
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   Your sister? Your father?
</P>
<P>
   No. No.
</P>
<P>
   Your mother? The woman nodded, emphatically, Yes!
</P>
<P>
   State officials took the woman away that night, to a safe place
where she could sleep, and they called in one of their best case
workers, a veteran with a knack for pulling the truth out of abuse
victims. Thus began the rather frantic, and costly, task of
figuring out just who this woman was and what should be done with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Facchine spent hours tracking every tip, big and small. She
attended meetings called to decide what to do for the woman. She
tracked leads with out-of-state calls. She tried to get close to
her. Nothing panned out.
</P>
<P>
   But within a week or so, pieces of the truth began to emerge,
and they were all rather curious.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out Sachel Briggs was not autistic.
</P>
<P>
   Sachel Briggs was not abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Sachel Briggs was a little smarter _ a lot smarter, really _
than they had first thought.
</P>
<P>
   Sachel Briggs wasn't even Sachel Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   She was a woman named Vicky Lynn Bell who had been reported
missing from a group home in Asheville, N.C., about a week earlier.
She'd signed out to take the bus to Wal-Mart _ there are two in
Asheville _ and had never come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Bell? She's a very nice lady,'' says Stan Bradley, who
runs the Haywood Heights home in west Asheville, where the woman
had last lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very artistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least that part was true.
</P>
<P>
   'She's a wanderer'
</P>
<P>
   Vicky Lynn Bell, who they believe turned 40 last January, likes
to move around, says Stan Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if she likes the attention or what,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a wanderer,'' says Colleen Bradley, Stan's wife, who
helps run the group home in Asheville. ``I think she likes that
type of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradleys first met Vicky Lynn Bell this past June, when
someone from the state psychiatric hospital called to say they had
a possible client for them. It was Bell. The Bradleys say Bell has
no known relatives in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Bell took up residence at the group home and made friends in
quick fashion. The most amazing thing about her was her artwork. It
was beautiful. In fact, Stan Bradley's sister-in-law paid Bell to
draw the Winnie the Pooh characters, which she had framed. The
drawing is hanging on her children's bedroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just super,'' Bradley said about the painting. ``I was
really impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But during the six weeks Bell lived at Haywood Heights, she
turned up missing twice. The first time, she signed herself out to
go to the Belecq Cherecq festival, an arts and crafts event in
Asheville. She planned to sell her artwork, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Vicky Lynn Bell wound up in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities there traced her back to Asheville, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called and said she wanted to come back,'' he remembers.
``So they put her on a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   When a worker from Bradley's home went to pick Bell up at the
Asheville bus station, ``she wasn't there,'' he said. She'd gotten
off. Somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, authorities called from Boston; they had Bell. This
time, Bradley was more careful. He had authorities put her on an
airplane. He drove more than two hours to Atlanta to pick her up.
</P>
<P>
   Vicky Lynn Bell was back home in Asheville _ until the end of
August when she signed herself out to go to Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later she sat, uttering no sounds, in the rain
outside Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart in Jupiter. Investigators think she sold
her artwork to pay her way here and give herself cash in her
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   A final, accented twist
</P>
<P>
   The woman now known as Vicky Lynn Bell refused written requests
from The Palm Beach Post for an interview. And Florida state social
workers would not discuss Bell's case or release any details of
their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   According to public records, the Social Security number given
for Vicky Lynn Bell is actually registered to a Tiffany R. Adams, a
woman who goes by several other names. The Social Security number
was issued in 1975 in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say she remains in the area,'' said Pam Heyer, with the
Florida Department of Children and Families, who refused all other
comment about Bell, citing confidentiality issues.
</P>
<P>
   And Pat Beach? She found out just the other day all about the
woman she befriended that steamy August day. Her feelings were
bruised, but just a bit, because she figures the woman needed help.
And she was glad to have provided it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My emotions ran very high that day,'' Beach said. ``It was
quite the ordeal. But I think she was reaching out for attention,
and that's how I'm going to look at this. That's how I have to look
at this.''
</P>
<P>
   But before we say goodbye to the saga of Vicky Lynn Bell, here's
one last interesting tidbit, one last turn:
</P>
<P>
   She can talk up a storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a very nice British accent,'' says Stan Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other times she left here, she didn't talk for a while,''
he said. ``I don't know if she's being cute, or what.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that state paperwork in North Carolina does not
classify Bell as either autistic or schizophrenic. He says she has
some ``mental issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not a bad person, she's really not. She just kind of
gets out and then forgets where she's supposed to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has her good days and her bad days but, hell, who out
there doesn't?''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Facchine said they got an inkling not too long ago
that Bell could talk. Bell was standing outside the group home
where she's living now _ she wants to stay in Florida and
authorities are obliging _ and a dog ran into the street.
Apparently, Bell hollered for the dog to get out of the road,
Facchine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is a little strange,'' said Facchine, who
closed out her part of the investigation late last month after it
became clear that the woman was not abandoned or autistic or
abused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to the fact that Bell has deceived investigators regarding
her identity, family, resident address and mental stability, the
investigation into possible abuse physically, mentally and sexually
has been unfounded,'' Facchine wrote. ``There is no evidence to
substantiate any charge of the aforementioned. This case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Vicky Lynn Bell wanders off again.

 &HT;    Secret codes of crime concealed in books, letters
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ ``God Bless You and Your Family,'' read the
printed birthday greeting. But inside the back flap of the card
were scribbled numbers carrying a much more ominous message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Code,'' explains Irma Fernandez, who helps oversee the prison
system's gang enforcement program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message was reporting to a member of an Hispanic prison
gang that an assault had been successfully carried out. We got it
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Fernandez headed the five-member unit at the
Estelle prison here _ part of the more than 50 specially trained
corrections officers across Texas who pore over thousands of pieces
of mail each day, intercepting and deciphering coded messages to
and from gang members in a script more suited to a James Bond movie
than prison. Sometimes the messages are written in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they are dots atop words in a handwritten letter.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they are hidden behind a stamp or disguised in a
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, officials at another Texas prison
confiscated an elaborate pencil sketch of a nude woman on a
background of flowers, drawn by a member of a Hispanic gang. In the
background was a message ordering a killing.
</P>
<P>
   A similar message was hidden in a crude drawing of a cave man
chiseling letters in a rock, done by a member of a white
supremacist gang. It too was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gangs have been using codes for years, and we've been
intercepting them for years,'' said Sam Buentello, the prison
system's top gang expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've tried just about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Example: Letters written with invisible ink _ made by convicts
with urine or with cleaning fluids _ that are readable when heat is
applied with an iron or hair dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Almost-invisible messages that are typed with a
ribbonless typewriter on the margins of a letter or in the folds of
an envelope. The recipient can read the message after lightly
tracing over the areas with a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Magazines and books that have words underlined on
random pages. By leafing through the pages, either front to back or
vice versa, a convict can read the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``By breaking the codes, we've been able over the years to stop
a number of crimes,'' Buentello said.
</P>
<P>
   He said thwarted crimes included murders of police officers, a
state judge, even prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, inmates have probably tried it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buentello and Fernandez said all correspondence to and from
confirmed gang members in prison _ except for that with their
lawyers _ is examined each day by gang intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
   Along with coding, the officers look for things such as whether
a convict is still active in a gang, Buentello said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the coded messages, this communications system
has its own vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   When a girlfriend or other visitor delivers a message verbally,
it's called ``sending a kite.'' Letter writers' mention of a
``green light'' can be code for a murder.
</P>
<P>
   The solution?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not stopping the flow of mail to and from prison gang
members _ even between convicts in different prisons, officials
said. That is something that was forbidden years ago by federal
court orders.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Fernandez, ``We read the mail. We know what's
going on.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The rules -- moving and boxing version
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget therapy and self-help books. People would lead better,
happier, more responsible lives if they put their stuff in boxes
more often.
</P>
<P>
   Simple, I know. But it cannot be denied.
</P>
<P>
   This might be the only good thing to come out of term limits. A
public servant who has to cart his stuff out of an office and put
his plaques in boxes every so often is a person who knows where
he's been. A person who will be more careful of paper in the
future. A person who, with a clean conscience, can tell the special
prosecutor he threw out those documents in the move. All of which
is sure to work for the betterment of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't even matter if you move after boxing, the boxing is
what counts. If for some perverse reason, you were to put
everything you own in a stack of boxes, then turned around and
unpack, you'd be a changed person for the effort. I promise. And a
good thing, too, because a person who would do something like that
could stand some serious changing.
</P>
<P>
   I recently launched into this task with abandon. I attempted to
apply with steely ruthless resolve the
Did-You-Take-It-Out-Of-The-Box-From-The-Last-Move? Rule, and the
even more rigorous
Did-You-Touch-Or-Use-Or-Read-This-Object-In-The-Last-Year? Rule.
</P>
<P>
   No more boxes of mystery parts, no carting the spent shells of
dead and dying batteries from place to place, no more shoe boxes of
twice-stamped eighth-sandwich-free cards. This time will be
different.
</P>
<P>
   The One-Move-And-You're-Out Rule for boxes is prudent and easy
enough. But like all simple rules, it attracts unexpected
complications that lurk in the shadows intent on mugging it.
</P>
<P>
   How about the box of Christmas stuff, for instance? Special
dispensation for seasonal items. How about the box of audio cable,
computer connectors and telephone line? Any one of those things
could transform a person into an audiovisual hero. Special
dispensation for technology. Box of baseball cards? Special
dispensation for objects of great value. Bearlike objects? Same
loophole.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the One-Year Rule that can really change your life. It
forces you to face the fact that barring disease, famine or general
shrinkage, those jeans will never fit you again. That barring
unemployment, illness or long-term loss of electric power, you will
never read Proust or ``Lee's Lieutenants.'' That a frying pan is an
overrated item in the age of microwavable burritos.
</P>
<P>
   The One-Year Rule is a harsh master. But fair.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for its hard dictates, the One-Year Rule grants
freedom from box-hefting, freedom from closet overflows and best of
all, the illusions of a simpler life and new start.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the older you get, the harder it is to follow such a
mandate. It's destructive of the past and when you earned some past
it should not be considered too disposable. The rule presumes you
knew, at some time in the year past, what was worthwhile in your
home. At least among things that can fit in a box. This is not
always the case even in a good year. Especially in a good year.
</P>
<P>
   And it is incompatible with literature. Many books sit on the
shelf just to compliment you for actually having read them at one
time. Others earn their space on the shelf for reminding you of
what you intend to read someday. The One-Year-Rule would devastate
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the One-Year Rule on the bookshelves and filled two
boxes with exceptions. By the third box I had thought of a good
half-dozen corollaries, exceptions and clarifications to the
One-Year Rule. I realized this inventiveness is wasted outside of
government work, tax law and accounting, but I was determined to be
consistent. At least for one more box.
</P>
<P>
   The One-Year-Rule is yielding fast to the pressures of packing.
I've given up all pretense of procedural fairness and use it only
to indict objects I don't like. The cat-scratch post? A failed
experiment the cat uses only to mock me. It hasn't been touched in
a year. It's history. The painted macaroni picture frame? Silently
condemned. But as for the rest, I'm afraid it will be boxed and
hefted again.
</P>
<P>
   The weight of the past is no metaphor. It's a workout. I do this
enough times and I'm certain to be in shape to deal with it.
</P>

 &HT;    Scandal coverage doesn't leave Salon a cut above
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh Salon, we hardly knew ye.
</P>
<P>
   No one can blame the editors of the online-only magazine at
http://www.salonmagazine.com for trying to expand its reporting
into the Beltway. In fact, it was Salon's coverage of the Monica
Lewinsky scandal that helped put the e-zine on the map. However, in
its quest for glory, page views and column inches, Salon may have
gone just one step too far.
</P>
<P>
   Salon is a magazine of literature, arts, culture and politics
that has been steadily gaining a loyal readership and attracting
top-notch writers from some of the best alternative and mainstream
media outlets in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Salon articles have been known to circulate via e-mail and hard
copy from friends to co-workers and back again. Loyal readers even
print out articles on everything from Caroline Knapp's essay on
living alone, to Lori Leibovich's twisted take on the MTV awards
and Tom Mashberg's essay sifting through the ashes of The Boston
Globe's Mike Barnicle scandal. The weekly feature ``Mothers Who
Think'' is also one of the site's most popular draws for its smart
and witty takes on motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that for Salon, good writing read by smart people
was not enough. Salon began to cover politics in the same smart,
sassy style as the rest of the magazine and although some
considered its coverage too pro-Clinton, the same could be said of
many other publications. But everything changed several weeks ago
when the magazine decided to publish an account of Rep. Henry
Hyde's (R-Ill.) affair, some 30 years ago. The story, and the
accompanying editorial from Salon Editor David Talbot made a media
splash of epic proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Salon was that the article drew attention to
the already well-respected magazine. The bad news is that the price
might have been too high. There were those who questioned the
relevance of the story, including the magazine's Washington bureau
chief, Jonathan Broder. Broder, 50, was quoted saying the Hyde
story made the magazine look like ````sex-obsessed hypocrites.''
Broder also called the C-SPAN call-in show Washington Journal to
further enunciate his position. ``There were no public issues
involved. Henry Hyde did not have this woman on his staff, on his
payroll. She was not a foreign agent. She did not go public with
her affair and she didn't sue him for sexual misconduct, so there
was no public issue involved, which I think has to be a standard
journalists use when deciding to write these things.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this sat well with Talbot, Salon's editor, who demanded
and got Broder's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot argues that Broder had to go. ``There are people trying
to shut down Salon because they don't like what we're publishing.
... The last thing we needed was for our Washington correspondent
to add fuel to that fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Broder shot back saying that Salon went with the Hyde story and
much of its Clinton coverage in an attempt to attract readers. ``A
lot of people have determined that sex sells,'' Broder said
Tuesday. ``(Talbot) made a decision that that's where he wants to
take Salon. That's where the money is ... I just don't want to go
there with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon's debacle is about the fate of Web journalism as much as
it is about politics. Any Internet analyst will tell you that when
it comes to the Web, sex does sell. Who can blame Talbot for
manipulating current events to draw readers to his Web site where
all you do is read.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot would argue that he's just trying to generate visits, the
online version of publishers saying they're just trying to sell
papers. Broder, the online journalist, found himself caught between
a publisher's desire to grab readers and his own personal code of
journalistic ethics. It's an unpleasant economic reality, but a
reality, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   What will ultimately happen to Salon? Talbot says he wants to
shift the magazine's focus from cultural and arts reporting to
breaking news, which will surely be a disappointment to loyal
readers. But the scandals surrounding the Salon scandal coverage
may have left the magazine something a little less than it once
was. As Broder put it, ``I think that (the Clinton scandal) is a
very ugly story and very smelly. And anyone who touches it ends up
smelling bad.''

 &HT;    Wall of muck threatens lake's fish
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 5 miles offshore in Lake Okeechobee, Don Fox leaped from
his skiff onto a beachhead of muck, cattails and scrabbly willow.
</P>
<P>
   At its edge, the mud squished underfoot, threatening to fall
away into the water. Finding a stable spot, Fox plunged a white
measuring stick down to the bottom of the muck pile: 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching this build up for three years,'' said Fox,
a biological administrator for the Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission. And more raw material arrives every minute, on
waves carrying silt and grasses.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news, Fox said: ``The lake is forming a new edge.'' A new
bank inside the old one.
</P>
<P>
   What's rising, he said, is a berm 35 to 40 miles long near the
lake's western shore, roughly from Okeechobee to Clewiston. Fifteen
to 70 feet across, it threatens to form an impenetrable wall
between the lake's open water and the shoreline marshes that
provide breeding grounds for fish.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said the berm eventually could turn the marshes into
hardwood swamps, eliminating the fish nurseries and the economy
they support.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and South Florida water managers largely agree on the cause:
Four years of unusually high lake levels have uprooted enormous
stretches of the plants in the marshes _ bulrushes, eel grass,
pepper grass and hydrilla. Waves have mixed the plants with silt
from the lake's bottom, creating the berm.
</P>
<P>
   They don't agree on what to do about it, however.
</P>
<P>
   Fox wants to remove the berm as soon as possible. But Barry
Rosen, a senior scientist at the South Florida Water Management
District, said researchers first must study the berm to make sure
removing it wouldn't cause more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't predict the costs, but said the studies would take a
year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said scientists don't know exactly what the berm is made
of, its precise location, how fast it is expanding or whether it
will fall apart naturally. He said it's possible the berm is no
worse in blocking fish than the thick cattail stands that already
crowded the marshes' edges.
</P>
<P>
   And removing the wall could allow the silt, loaded with
phosphorus, to penetrate the marshes' depths, he said. Phosphorus,
found in manure and fertilizers, already is blamed for cattails'
invasion of the marshes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want any unintended consequences,'' Rosen said. ``If
you took (the berm) out and all of a sudden allowed this
phosphorus-rich water to go into the pristine parts of the marsh
where the fish are breeding, and all of a sudden you had cattails
there, I'd say you blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that such berms often form and dissolve naturally,
and this one may be no different. Fox has little patience for such
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something we need to study to death,'' Fox said.
``That's one of the problems with the district _ research,
research, research.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kissimmee solution
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he advocates a cleanup similar to one that the
district, game commission and other agencies paid for two years ago
in Osceola County, where a berm had built up around Lake Kissimmee.
For $5 million, crews lowered water levels, scraped 24 miles of
shoreline and burned 9,900 acres of cattails and other weeds.
</P>
<P>
   The sediments will keep accumulating, requiring periodic
removal, game commission project leader Mike Hulon said. But he
said the results are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish have moved back to zones where they haven't been in 10
years,'' Hulon said. ``A lot of old anglers are saying this is back
to the way the lake used to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox acknowledged that natural forces are creating the berm,
aided by the water district, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
the federally built dike that encircles Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is a natural process,'' Fox said. ``But when you put a
gun to someone's head and pull the trigger, you've helped the
process along.''
</P>
<P>
   Water managers and the corps, which jointly manage Lake
Okeechobee, mostly blame rain for the high water levels that have
troubled it since 1995. But they also fault their water supply
system, which uses the lake as a 730-square-mile reservoir and
often keeps it high as a hedge against drought.
</P>
<P>
   When the corps releases water, it flows down the St. Lucie and
Caloosahatchee rivers _ slowly lowering the lake but quickly
upsetting those waterways' ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
   `It's a mudhole out there'
</P>
<P>
   Last winter and spring, those releases devastated coastal
fishing and tourism. Some scientists suspect that lake water also
caused a plague of lesion-covered fish in the St. Lucie and Indian
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The lake has suffered just as much from the high water, and both
the berm and the vanishing marshes are proof, Fox said. For
instance, bulrush _ worth $20,000 an acre in its value as fish
habitat _ has lost 96 percent of the 8,800 acres it occupied four
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said earlier berms have risen during episodes of high water,
but this one never subsided. He said he has seen it rise more than
a foot in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The berm also alarms Wayne Nelson, a West Palm Beach sport
fisherman and environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the result of 25 years of mismanagement of the
lake,'' Nelson said, endorsing Fox's call for quick action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lake is in the worst shape I've ever seen,'' he said.
``It's a mudhole out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other fishermen, Nelson is skeptical of the theory
that high water killed the marshes. He blames the district, which
sprays herbicides on water hyacinths and other aquatic weeds.
</P>
<P>
   District officials insist they only spray about 6,000 acres a
year, too small a territory to cause such a massive die-off. In any
case, the district passed its spraying duties to the corps
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The corps also is studying a district proposal to keep the lake
lower year-round _ a solution to the woes ailing both the lake and
the rivers.
</P>
<P>
   As for the berm, ``Let's do either one of two things,'' Fox
said. ``Either take it out or plant cypress trees on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Or condos,'' Rosen said.

 &HT;    Water district to quit touting plants it kills
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   South Florida water managers spend millions of dollars killing
foreign plants that invade the region.
</P>
<P>
   They also publish a booklet that lists some of those same plants
as examples of water-conserving landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the water managers say it makes lots of sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should promote plants that we're killing,''
said Dan Thayer, who heads the eradication of invasive weeds for
the South Florida Water Management District.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the district is set to become vegetatively correct. A
new plant guide due in early 1999 will spread the message that the
Australian pine, Brazilian pepper and about 30 other leafy
ne'er-do-wells are flora non grata.
</P>
<P>
   The invaders have few if any enemies in Florida, allowing them
to spread fast and overtake native plants.
</P>
<P>
   State law banned the sale and cultivation of the Australian pine
and Brazilian pepper in 1990. But that information was slow to
trickle into the district's guide to drought-hardy trees, grasses,
vines and shrubs, last updated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The guide has been slower to include warnings about legal plants
many scientists consider noxious, such as the popular carrotwood
and guava trees.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations among scientists, native-plant advocates,
landscapers and other water management districts have delayed the
booklet's new edition, district water conservation coordinator
Bruce Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all learning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said the guide was meant only to offer information on the
growth, nutritional requirements and water demand of 595 species
that are common in urban landscaping. But the problems began when
some residents interpreted it incorrectly as the district's stamp
of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Even some city governments have tried to adopt the guide as a
list of endorsed plants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a Bible of plants,'' Adams said. ``It has some
of the nasties in there because people have those on their
property.''
</P>
<P>
   Thayer, past president of the nonprofit Florida Exotic Pest
Plant Council, said the guide has blunted his attempts to warn
residents about the invaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say, `That carrotwood in your yard is a bad plant,' ''
Thayer said. ``But they'll say, `I got it as a recommendation from
your agency. It's in the guide.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the district has spent $1.7 million killing plants
listed in the guide, with the great bulk of that money going to
Australian pines and Brazilian peppers.
</P>
<P>
   The guide's original version in 1987 also included the
district's No. 1 plant enemy, the melaleuca tree, which has cost
$9.7 million to kill. But in the 1991 version, all melaleuca
information is crossed out to make it illegible.
</P>
<P>
   The '91 guide likewise crosses out information on the Australian
pine and Brazilian pepper _ but only under the heading of
``trees.'' The shrub section still includes full data on both
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The district has printed 12,000 to 50,000 guides each year at a
cost of 55 to 72 cents a copy, ending in 1995, Adams said. It has
about 2,500 copies left and is still distributing them.
</P>
<P>
   The new guide will stamp the pest plants with a warning, and
won't include information on how to grow them, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be full out that this is a problem plant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer's staff originally called for deleting all mention of the
invaders. But he said now he thinks it's better to teach people
about their dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, scientists and landscapers are debating which plants to
label pests. Adams said the negotiations became even more
complicated because the new guide is meant to apply statewide, not
just in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some species are fast-spreading pests near Miami
but not near Orlando or Jacksonville, where frost controls them.
Some varieties of oyster plant or yellow lantana can crowd out
native plants, but others don't.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal lists 33 plants as pests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's make sure we have a scientific basis for this list, not
just a thorn in someone's side,'' said Hugh Gramling of the Tampa
Bay Wholesale Growers Association, who has reviewed the proposed
list. ``Just because a few people say these plants are invasive
does not make them so.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: A generation distrustful of government
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When I was 7 I knew little of government. FDR
was president and the nation was up to its patriotic neck in World
War II. I'd never heard of politics.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that on Tuesdays I took a dime to school to buy ``war
stamps'' and when I had enough to fill up my book, I could trade it
in for a war bond. I knew that our neighbor, Mr. Sanders, was the
air raid warden for our block, and that Mrs. Albrecht's son, Billy,
had traded in his Ohio State football uniform for one of Uncle
Sam's.
</P>
<P>
   I learned from the movies that America was fighting on the side
of right and our enemies on both sides of the world were godless
warmongers. I knew that when John Wayne wasn't flying P-40s
(``Flying Tigers''), he was building runways on Pacific Ocean
atolls (``The Fighting Seabees'').
</P>
<P>
   And when I sang ``America the Beautiful'' in the elementary
school choir, I believed every last word of it, particularly the
part about being crowned with ``brotherhood from sea to shining
sea.''
</P>
<P>
   I was 7. I trusted my country. I trusted my president. It may
have been the last of an era.
</P>
<P>
   My 31-year-old son never had it so good. We were talking this
morning over breakfast, about the mess in Washington. I listened
and learned. Here's what he had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the extramarital affair that bothers me the most,
though after watching the demise of my parents' marriage for the
very same reason, I confess to being sensitized to the wretchedness
of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the lying that bothers me, either. In fact, growing
up in the late '60s and early '70s pretty much taught me one thing
_ politicians are liars, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my first memories about politics are of Walter
Cronkite with that little icon of the White House behind his left
shoulder, disseminating the events of Watergate on the evening
news. The first president I ever knew was a liar. Is there another
kind, I wondered?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first movie about politics that I remember was a rerun of
`The Candidate' starring Robert Redford. Besides looking an awful
lot like my dad, Redford's character appealed to me because he came
across as a common guy in an uncommon situation. He didn't pretend
to have all of the answers. Most of all, he lacked the
slick-politician persona and the ability to alter his stance to
suit the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won the election, and I remember thinking to myself: Wow!
The good guys do win once in a while. But apparently that's only in
the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too much later there was Iran-contra, complete with a
sitting president lying about his involvement, his underlings
wrapping themselves in the flag and claiming innocence, and the
vice president, his successor, toeing the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though our history books tell us of the privilege and honor of
serving our country, I was left with the impression that folks get
into politics not out of a sense of duty to their fellow men but
simply for the power and money that come with the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me most about this mess in Washington is the
president's lapse of common sense and amazingly poor judgment in
his choice of a `femme fatale.' It's tough to believe that a Rhodes
scholar couldn't see that `the stalker,' as her cohorts called her,
might not be the best choice for a discreet affair.
</P>
<P>
   This begs the question: What can Americans expect of his
judgment when he's making decisions regarding policy or military
action for our country?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting that the lure of a political victory is as
desirable an accomplishment to our president as having sex with an
intern, but how do we know at this point? Will he, in a grand
effort to clean up his past, make a truly shortsighted and
ill-advised decision that could have drastic effects on the
country? Does our nation run the risk of one day being blindsided
by the
</P>
<P>
   consequences of his inability to focus on anything other than
the conquest at hand?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm disappointed, but not surprised. Aside from all of
this, he's pretty much acting like any other 20th-century
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   My son talks, and I listen. And as I do, I can't help thinking
what a sad commentary this is on the legacy my generation has left
him. But what else might we expect from a generation who teethed on
Watergate?
</P>
<P>
   When he finishes, I can't help asking: ``Are you a Democrat or a
Republican?''
</P>
<P>
   His answer: ``I'm a GDI.''
</P>
<P>
   I can understand why.
</P>

 &HT;    From inside: Anger creates violent culture
 &HT;    By Jorge Antonio Renaud
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's note: Jorge Antonio Renaud, 41, is serving a 60-year
sentence at the Wynne prison unit in Huntsville for aggravated
robbery. Renaud was convicted in 1992 of robbing a Mr. Gatti's
restaurant and a Jack Brown Cleaners in Austin, a crime spree he
said was driven by a cocaine habit. He was working at the time as a
copy editor at the Austin American-Statesman. He becomes eligible
for parole in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ In 1977, when I first came to prison, the
convict code demanded that my courage be tested. The task fell to
my homeboys. I had seven fights my first day at Ferguson, the
gladiator unit, where inmates 21 years old and younger were
assigned.
</P>
<P>
   I left prison in late 1979 and returned in seven months, to stay
for seven years. Violence escalated dramatically in the mid-1980s
as convicts warred over the spoils left unclaimed when the building
tender system was dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   In August of 1984, my neighbor was stabbed to death on the run
(the hallway outside cells). As I mopped the blood that seeped into
my cell, I composed a poem for Tattoo, whose murder was the 12th in
what would prove a record-setting year for Texas prison homicides.
</P>
<P>
   I left again in 1987 and this time didn't return until 1992. I'd
heard the system had changed. An improved guard-to-inmate ratio had
allowed a clampdown on gang activities. New building
configurations, designed to provide officers unimpeded views of
living quarters, supposedly allowed guards to closely monitor
convicts and respond quickly to disturbances. I expected stricter
but quieter prisons.
</P>
<P>
   I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a man with whom I was sharing a cup of cocoa was almost
stabbed to death. His assailant chased him around the day room,
slashing whenever he was within reach. The guards, dozens strong,
stayed in the hall and lobbed gas canisters and insults at us with
equally ineffectual results, intervening only when another convict
snatched the shank away.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a man staggered past me, a 20-cent black pen dangling
from his punctured right eyeball, as rival Hispanic factions _ not
organized gangs, but homeboy groups called ``tangos'' _ rioted on
the Robertson Unit yard. I've seen three racially motivated riots _
Hispanics against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen innumerable shockingly brutal incidents erupt over the
most trivial insults, and sometimes for no reason other than to get
an inmate off the wing in order to burglarize his cell. I've seen
dozens upon dozens of Anglos broken _ forced to pay cash or provide
sex to stop the beatings they endured daily _ in what seems a
savage payback for the sins of all Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   Prisons are violent arenas. Brutality rarely hides its face
here. But violence in Texas prisons used to be predictable and,
thus, avoidable. You stayed away from drugs and alcohol; you kept
your mouth shut and minded your own business; you demonstrated a
willingness to defend yourself _ and you were allowed to do your
time in relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   This is no longer true. Violence in Texas prisons is so
mindlessly pervasive and its effects so widespread that the
inevitable has happened _ a group of released convicts are charged
with an act so atrocious that it has focused a spotlight on Texas
Department of Criminal Justice conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The response by officials has been depressingly familiar: Give
us more money, and we'll identify the most vicious predators and
build more ``Super Max'' units to bury them in.
</P>
<P>
   This is absurd. You can't lock away 100,000 convicts, and that
is what it would take. Criminal Justice officials _ especially
those watching the gangs _ are too quick to blame prison gangs for
all prison violence, and for the recent murder in Jasper in
particular. Their reasoning runs like this: The three ex-convicts
charged in that incident sported racist tattoos. They were
therefore in a prison gang, or affiliated, and they were simply
practicing what racist prison gangs preach.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dangerous oversimplification. The problem does not lie
primarily with gangs, at least not those identified by the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice. The problem is a huge influx of
young convicts with unimaginably long sentences, who are angry and
afraid and all too willing to band together in groups with racial
or geographical bonds. They cloak their despair in rage, and they
act out that rage on anyone not of their group.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting violence feeds the animosity of others, many of
whom have shorter sentences and carry their hate to the free world.
</P>
<P>
   Racial animosities in prison are intractable and deadly. If
racism is so tangible, so pervasive in the free world that the
country's president feels compelled to appoint a commission to
offer suggestions, how terrible must it be where society consigns
its deadliest men?
</P>
<P>
   And the system has no idea how to deal with it, other than to
integrate its cells and dorms willy-nilly, with only a cursory
attempt to classify convicts. In Texas prisons, the only way to
avoid integration is to stab someone of a different race. You can
tell officials that you are a stone-cold racist; you can have
hideously racist tattoos from head to toe; you can have a
documented history of having participated in racially motivated
riots _ but if the system orders you into a 9-by-12-foot cell with
a man of the race you detest, you must comply or lose class and
good time and privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Such forced intimacy does little but magnify negative
stereotypes.

 &HT;    Inmates face ugly choices, violent lives
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN -- After spending the past four years in prison, Brian
Collins, 31, knows the routine well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy comes in from the streets (and) the first thing that
happens is he gets checked _ by blacks, whites, everybody,'' said
the Mineral Wells resident who is serving 10 years for theft.
``This is how it goes, man. These dudes are going to charge you up
and see if you got heart, see if you're going to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most want money, sometimes sex.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to fight or you're going to tell the police
(guards) you need protection'' and get moved to a one-man cell.
</P>
<P>
   Collins says he chose the former.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he also chose the Aryan Circle, a white-supremacist
group well-known inside prison for fights against black and
Hispanic convicts. Collins says he is a major in the group, and he
proudly shows off the AC tattoo on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Is he racist?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think I probably am,'' Collins said. ``I'm the type of
person that ain't going to go out and try to hurt people just
because I don't like them. I'll probably just try to stay away from
them. But if somebody does something to me or someone I love, I'm
going to take care of my business with them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened a year ago at another prison when, as he
explains it, a member of a Hispanic gang ``stole something from one
of my brothers. We asked for it back and they said that we was a
bunch of whores. So I went and took care of business.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses. ``I caught him right out there on that (cellblock)
run. Stabbed him with a welding rod.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have stole.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe ``Flaco'' Saldivar, 51, spent more than 20 years in Texas
prisons before he joined a gang.
</P>
<P>
   And when he did, in 1993, he had little choice, he says. He was
from San Antonio, so he had to go with the Mexican Mafia. Like
black and white convicts split into gangs along racial lines,
Hispanics in Texas prisons mostly split by hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured if (other gangs in prison) were going to target me
as the enemy and I'm going to have to suffer the consequences, I
might as well join up and see if there are benefits to reap,'' said
Saldivar, serving a life term as a habitual thief.
</P>
<P>
   He was soon moved to solitary confinement, with members of that
gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that in lockup I wasn't in actual danger of being
assaulted by anybody. . . . A lot of the members I had met back in
the '60s and '70s . . . and I thought that if I joined up I could
help them out in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   He did.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Saldivar sits in a solitary cell at the Estelle
High-Security Unit outside Huntsville. He said he tries to stay
busy, so as to not ``let insanity or old age catch up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   And while he hopes he eventually will be paroled, he concedes he
may well die in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur Jones Jr. was 15 when he came to prison. Gerald Ford was
president and Texas prisons were still segregated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You felt you had that right'' to be segregated, recalls the
38-year-old convicted robber, serving a life term for shooting a
store clerk during a Beaumont robbery.
</P>
<P>
   By 1984, Texas prisons had been desegregated by a federal judge,
and racial tensions exploded. Gangs started forming and warring.
Beatings, stabbings and killings bloodied prison cellblocks almost
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, one of only a few black convicts in a dorm at the Ramsey
prison farm outside Houston, was marked for death by two members of
the white-supremacist Aryan Brotherhood as part of their initiation
rite into the gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was targeted because I was African American,'' Jones says.
``That was all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught me in the dorm. . . . I grappled with one, got his
shank. I threw him off, and (the other one) who was supposed to be
watching out then came at me. I stabbed both. One died. I was
acquitted in a trial. It was self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Jones was placed in a maximum-security cellblock with
members of the Self Defense Family, one of the first black prison
gangs in Texas. Prison officials tagged him as a member, too, even
though he insists he never was.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has served time in 11 different Texas prisons,
including more than three years in solitary confinement. Prison
officials list him as a suspected member of the Mandingo Warriors,
another black prison gang, a tie he also denies.
</P>
<P>
   During his 22 years in prison, Jones says, he has seen a gradual
rise in racial and ethnic tensions. ``It's more pronounced across
the board now,'' he says. ``You're dealing with a lot of
individuals in here who are highly uneducated . . . who are not
used to dealing with a problem in the right way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a dinosaur. I've seen the system all different ways. And
it's not good the way it was then. Or now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenton Keith Ford says he knows firsthand about violence and
hate and why convicts join gangs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, newly arrived on the Hilltop Unit near Gatesville to
serve a 15-year sentence for burglarizing a Tyler home, Ford said
he faced a choice: fight or be raped by other convicts. For
protection, he said, he joined the Aryan Brotherhood, a
white-supremacist prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, if you're white . . . you pay protection or give sex or
whatever they want,'' he said. ``I wasn't raised to be a racist any
more than any other white kid. But when I got to prison, I saw it
was different in here. Here, people can learn to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   At another prison, that hate exploded in a crude bomb _ a small
plastic mouthwash bottle filled with toilet tissue and match tips _
that he ignited with a cigarette lighter and threw into a black
convict's adjacent cell. It grew with the more-frequent fights he
had with black convicts, altercations that broke his jaw, knocked
out two teeth and left him with swollen testicles.
</P>
<P>
   Moved in 1995 to another cellblock where most of the convicts
were black, Ford said, he was overpowered and raped by a convict.
``I'd been turned out. . . . I couldn't fight anymore,'' Ford said,
explaining that in return for sex twice a week, the other convict
bought him commissary items _ chips, shampoo, candy, all common
barter in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you have to to stay alive in here. That's the way
I see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford now ponders his future from a one-man isolation cell at the
Hughes Unit outside Gatesville, where his sentence has been
extended to 23 years because of a new felony charge resulting from
the bomb incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there a breeding of hate in prison? Yes,'' he said. ``I'm
bitter. I'm angry because I'm stuck down here and my life is
getting away. How come I gotta ride with somebody to survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hate. But once people live around this
mentality in prison, they can hate.''

 &HT;    State's blind eye let gangsters link up
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Granado Jr., convicted Austin burglar, admitted member of
the Texas Syndicate prison gang, could be the king of second
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Missed second chances.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted nine years ago and sentenced to seven years in prison,
Granado, 28, got four chances at early freedom from state parole
officials. But in each case, he ended up back behind bars _ and
involved with the notorious Texas Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   If Granado was involved with the Texas Syndicate as a result of
one of his prison stays, as authorities suspect, parole officials
said they never considered that before they released him each time.
</P>
<P>
   Under new rules being drafted, that will change.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, all convicts will be reviewed for possible gang
ties before they are released from prison, said state Parole
Director Veronica Ballard. Members of prison gangs will be
monitored more closely than other parolees in an attempt to keep
them away from the gangs and keep them from returning to a life of
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation with Granado is a vestige of an old system that
will not be a problem in the future,'' said Stennett Posey, a
spokesman for the parole division of the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we thought of gangs as a (prison) problem. Now,
we realize it's something we have to deal with in paroles and
mandatory supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Under mandatory supervision, prisoners must be released and
placed under a parole officer's supervision when their time served
and good-behavior credits equal their sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, prison officials will notify parole
officials that they are preparing to release a gang member. The
convict will be prohibited from associating with other gang members
after release. He will be under ``super-intensive supervision,''
which can include wearing an electronic bracelet and allows parole
officers to make daily _ rather than the standard monthly _ visits
to the home and workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Gang members who violate parole rules will face an immediate
return to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The convicts will be required to participate in programs
designed to get them out of gangs and keep them out. The tattoos on
their arms and legs will be photographed so parole officials can
document their gang-related markings after they leave prison.
</P>
<P>
   Had the new procedures been in effect, officials say, Granado
might never have been released so many times _ or, perhaps, gotten
in so much more trouble.
</P>
<P>
   According to state files, Granado was sentenced to seven years
in prison in September 1989 for an Austin burglary. Paroled in
February 1990, he was back behind bars a year later for violating
parole rules and for ``association with persons with criminal
background,'' said Posey, then a parole commissioner who approved
Granado's initial release.
</P>
<P>
   Despite new charges against him, Granado was paroled again in
June 1991. By that October, parole officials had issued a warrant
for his arrest for failing to report to his parole officer.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern continued, with three more releases and arrests from
August 1994 until August, when police charged Granado and two other
men with engaging in organized crime in connection with the
November 1997 stabbing death of Anthony Reed, 24, outside a Sixth
Street club.
</P>
<P>
   Parole Board Chairman Victor Rodriguez said the close
supervision will include felons who come up for parole in the
future, and the hundreds of gang members who already are on parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make sure that all these people are supervised
more intensively,'' Rodriguez said. ``That should help us track
them better once they are out. It should help them by keeping them
away from gangs once they are out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it should make the public safer.''

 &HT;    Search to continue for LaSalle's flagship
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two groups unsuccessful in their quest to find
the long-lost flagship of the French explorer LaSalle announced
that they have joined forces in a renewed search.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Texas Historical Commission and the
National Underwater Marine Agency, a private maritime history group
based in Austin, said their joint venture in waters off Port
O'Connor is the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, state archaeologists unearth history themselves. They
sometimes issue search permits to qualified groups such as the
marine agency, but officials said they cannot remember a joint
search being mounted to find a shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   Six new underwater ``targets'' _ places where magnetic mapping
shows a concentration of metal that could be the site of l'Aimable
_ have been identified. Specially trained divers could begin
investigating them as soon as today, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the wreckage of l'Aimable, which ran aground and
sank in 1685, could provide new clues about Texas' earliest
settlers _ indeed, among the earliest settlers in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking for l'Aimable since 1978, and (the marine
agency) has been looking for it since last summer, so far without
success,'' said Jim Bruseth, director of antiquities protection for
the historical commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're combining those efforts in cooperative fashion to
extend the state's limited resources and move ahead with the
search, with twice as much effort. We're excited about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gronquist, an Austin lawyer who is president of the
nonprofit marine agency, echoed those sentiments. ``We're looking
forward to getting back at the search,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun County Judge Howard Hartzog, who said his county also is
part of the joint venture signed late last week, said while the six
new targets ``look very promising,'' only a recovery and analysis
of artifacts can verify whether any are l'Aimable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important, historic shipwreck that's out there
someplace,'' he said. ``We want to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   State archaeologists and divers came up empty-handed in 20 years
of searching. But the marine agency, working under a state-issued
search permit, last year hired a Houston firm to conduct aerial
magnetic mapping of the area. That search identified 26 possible
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In February, marine agency divers recovered several
barnacle-encrusted artifacts from the murky waters at one site.
After experts tentatively identified two as 17th century French
firearms, officials on March 2 announced they had found l'Aimable,
an event that made headlines worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Aug. 2, the discovery itself ran aground: State
officials announced that further investigation proved the relic was
a Spanish ship about 100 years more recent than LaSalle's. The
firearms were Spanish, not French.
</P>
<P>
   At several points after the February discovery, tensions flared
between the marine agency and state historical officials _ about
who should announce the discovery and when, about further diving at
the site, even about whether the marine agency's permit remained in
effect for a new search after the ship was found not to be
l'Aimable.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Friday those issues have been resolved with the
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a cooperative spirit,'' Hartzog said.

 &HT;    Inmate gangs extend their bloody grip to the streets (Part 1 of
3)
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started with angry words. Then someone got hit in the head
with a beer bottle. And the fight was on, first inside the Spirits
Dance Club and then on the corner outside, in the heart of Austin's
Sixth Street entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
   By the time police arrived a few minutes later, on this cool
night before Thanksgiving in 1997, two men had been stabbed.A third
was badly beaten. A fourth lay just inside the club, dying from
knife wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the attackers, detectives later learned, were members
of the notorious Texas Syndicate prison gang. A witness was with
the Pistoleros prison gang. Five years ago, that many members of
prison gangs at one crime scene might have surprised police.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   In what authorities warn is a growing menace, prison gangs
driven by racial and geographic animosities are coming of age in
Austin and most other major Texas cities. In the past few years,
some prison gangs have begun recruiting members of youth street
gangs as soldiers in a growing crime network seeking to gain
control of Texas' illegal drug markets. Their methods: murders,
shootings, beatings and home invasion robberies.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, police estimate that prison gang members may have
been involved in as many as 30 killings in four years. In Austin,
police say the death toll is six in just two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't stop these prison gangs, Texas cities could look
like Chicago did in the 1930s,'' warns Allan Polunsky, chairman of
the state prison system's governing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just something that's going on in the barrios.
It's not just drug dealers trying to knock each other off. It's
organized crime, pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison gang crime recently burst into public awareness with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   In June, two of three ex-convicts charged in the dragging death
of a black man in Jasper in East Texas were identified by
authorities as sympathizers of a white-supremacist prison gang, the
Aryan Brotherhood, that is blamed for eight slayings in four years.
</P>
<P>
   In July, 16 members of the Mexican Mafia, Texas' largest prison
gang, were indicted on racketeering and conspiracy charges in San
Antonio. Federal prosecutors blame the group for 14 killings in
four years, including San Antonio's worst mass murder, the shotgun
massacre of five people in a duplex a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Corpus Christi detectives arrested nine suspected
prison gang members in three of the city's nine slayings this year.
Still on the street, though, were more than 1,400 paroled prison
gang members who police say now live in that area.
</P>
<P>
   The growing alliance between street and prison gangs is ``one
big problem,'' says Travis County Sheriff Margo Frasier, whose
2,500 jail cells are filled with increasing numbers of prison gang
members and wannabees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people hate each other just because they are members of
different gangs,'' she said. ``They deal in intimidation. And that
mentality is a problem, whether it's out on the street or inside a
jail or a prison.''
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 convicts in Texas prisons _ more people than live in
Marble Falls _ are confirmed members of the seven prison gangs and
three lesser ``security threat'' groups, a number that has been
increasing steadily during the past seven years. Prison officials
say there are as many more whom they suspect _ but have not
confirmed _ of gang membership. Thousands more are free on parole,
officials say, although they have no specific count because they
only recently began keeping track of gang members separately. Of
the 30,000 convicts who have been paroled or freed from prison this
year, officials estimate that at least 3,000 probably have some
gang affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Texas has locked up more gang members in prison for
longer terms in recent years, isolating them in solitary cells and
monitoring their mail to thwart communication with the outside
world, local police and prison officials say the gangs' influence
on the street continues to grow. A key reason is the growing
affiliation with teen-age street gangs that has allowed prison
gangs to reach out in ever more violent and organized ways.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Thursday, a state Senate committee studying
gangs estimated there may be 145,000 members in 3,276 prison and
street gangs in Texas. That is second only to California, which has
4,927 gangs.
</P>
<P>
   For law-abiding Texans, the problem means continued burglaries
and theft, the property crimes that feed the drug trade, and
exposure to the gangs' hair trigger for violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broader issue here is the level of violence and what to do
about it,'' said Beth Pelz, an associate professor of criminal
justice at the University of Houston-Downtown who has studied
prison gangs for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger members are spontaneous, unpredictable. . . . They
are very impulsive. You ask them what they'll be doing in five
years, and they say they'll be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   While crimes such as drive-by shootings, auto thefts and
assaults committed by street gangs across Texas has declined during
the past two years _ down 28 percent in Austin _ violence by street
gangs in many cases has become more focused and more organized,
police say, as the street gangs have joined forces with prison
gangs competing for a bigger piece of the drug and crime market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence always has been a way of life for these gangs, but
it's reaching back to the streets more now,'' said Texas Department
of Criminal Justice Executive Director Wayne Scott, who has 26
years of experience in the prison business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human life has no value to these people.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point, police say, is the Austin stabbing death of
Anthony Reed.
</P>
<P>
   A furious fight
</P>
<P>
   Reed and two friends had been partying at Spirits Dance Club on
Nov. 26, 1997, when a fight started after a club patron became
jealous when another man talked with, maybe touched, his
girlfriend. Bouncers quickly moved the fracas outside.
</P>
<P>
   By the time police arrived a few minutes later, Chauncey Arnold,
21, and Willis Earls Jr., 19, were bleeding from severe stab
wounds. Reed was found unconscious just inside the club.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, witnesses described the fight as vicious,
furious _ ``Hispanics against blacks. . . . Everyone was
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent interviews and through their tattoos, police
identified two of the suspects _ Henry Granado Jr. and Abraham
``A.B.'' Palacios _ as members or affiliates of the Texas
Syndicate, the granddaddy of Texas prison gangs, with a
longstanding reputation for violence.
</P>
<P>
   Austin police were already well acquainted with the Texas
Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 3, 1997, Joe Martinez, 24, was fatally shot in the
temple by someone who fired through a window of his home in the 800
block of West Oltorf Street in South Austin, where he was watching
television with his brothers. Police identified one of the suspects
in the killing as a ``prospecto'' _ a Texas Syndicate recruit who
allegedly was paid $200 for the hit, ordered because gang members
thought Martinez had snitched to police.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 25, 1997, Juan Carlos Sandoval, 18, was shot to death at
the Travis Park apartments in the 1100 block of East Oltorf Street
after being assaulted by as many as 12 men whom police identified
as Texas Syndicate members or wannabees. Motive: to avenge
disrespect Sandoval had shown to a Texas Syndicate member during a
disagreement over a cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   On April 2, Christopher Rene Lopez, 19, and another man were
driving in Southeast Austin when a pedestrian _ whom police later
identified as a Texas Syndicate recruit _ fatally shot Lopez
through a window. The car crashed into a house.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, Lopez's father and cousin were jailed on
charges of attempted murder in the Aug. 20 ambush shooting of
Remberto Juarez, 20, also outside Spirits Dance Club, in what
police say was retaliation for Lopez's death.
</P>
<P>
   Police say two other slayings earlier this year in the Austin
area probably were carried out by members of two predominantly
Hispanic prison gangs _ the statewide Texas Syndicate and the San
Antonio-based Mexican Mafia _ that are competing for a stake in
Austin's drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of their victims are each other,'' said Lt. Manuel Pena,
head of the Austin Police Department's gang enforcement unit.
</P>
<P>
   Many more gang slayings have been reported across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Outside San Marcos, the bullet-riddled body of Austin resident
Willie Herbert Jr., 26, was found dumped near Five-Mile Dam on Jan.
14, 1997. Prison officials say he was killed in a gang hit.
</P>
<P>
   In Corpus Christi, authorities blame the Raza Unida prison gang
for three of the nine murders since January. In Houston, several
prison gangs are believed involved in a dozen killings in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, headquarters for the Mexican Mafia _ the largest
prison gang in terms of imprisoned membership, with more than 1,200
members inside prison _ narcotics Detective Val Lopez estimates the
gang has had a role in as many as 100 slayings since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back years ago, we had street gangs, and they were involved in
crime. (But) they had boundaries on what they would do,'' Lopez
said. ``As far as a lot of these prison gangs go, there are no
boundaries. That's what makes them dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidential police intelligence reports bolster his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coldhearted . . . violent . . . loyal,'' a Texas Department of
Public Safety report says of the Texas Syndicate. The report says
that to join, prospective members must kill someone the gang hates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is the only way out,'' the report notes.
</P>
<P>
   While the ``blood in, blood out'' code might be
exaggerated,authorities say there's no disputing that violence
binds members together.
</P>
<P>
   The recruiting ground
</P>
<P>
   In years past, police say, most Texas Syndicate members who
surfaced in Austin tried to keep a low profile or, as one
undercover detective explains it, ``just try to deal their dope and
lay low.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, teen-age street gangs with names like Latin Kings,
Outlawz or East Gran Varrio posed the greatest menace with drive-by
shootings, assaults and murders, said Ralph Dela Fuente, a
detective in Austin's gang unit.
</P>
<P>
   But as police cracked down and the young gangsters were sent to
prison beginning in the early 1990s, they were introduced to the
Texas Syndicate, Mexican Mafia and other entrenched prison gangs
that had begun organizing along racial lines more than a decade
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Many joined _ because of peer pressure, for protection from
sexual attacks, extortion and assaults. Or for prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 1995 or 1996, they had been down (in prison) for five or
six years, they'd completed their sentence, they were 24, 25 or 26,
they were freshly back from the joint, and they met back up with
their old homeys,'' Dela Fuente said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened? A lot of these homeys who had been in trouble,
but had never hit the big time, got involved in more serious
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, those young prison gang members also started
recruiting members directly from teen-age street gangs _ a trend
that police in several other large Texas cities began to notice two
to three years ago. Before that, the only way to get into a prison
gang had been to serve time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Syndicate needs soldiers out on the street, not
locked up someplace,'' Dela Fuente said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between prison and street gang members has become
so close, he said, that ``if these street gangs were corporations,
most of them would be subsidiaries of the Texas Syndicate or the
Mexican Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, prison gangs have increasingly focused their
recruiting efforts in county jails in Austin and other cities,
rather than mostly in prisons. In the jails, gang members often are
not isolated from other prisoners like they are in prison. New
recruits who served their time and went back to the streets began
to bolster the prison gangs' street force, and those who went on to
prison bolstered their numbers there. ``The growth was happening on
both sides of the fence,'' said Sam Buentello, the prison system's
top gang expert.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, the ranks of confirmed gang members have swelled
from 1,238 to more than 5,000 in prison _ faster than the overall
prison growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their numbers are up some, but the real increase is in
crime,'' a gang detective in Corpus Christi said. ``We have more
unsolved homicides, and a big reason for that is the prison gangs.
They are much more professional about the way they do them, they
don't talk, and it's harder to get information to solve those
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, police report much the same story. So far, though,
suspects have been jailed in four of the six killings linked to
prison gangs, and police say they have solid leads in the others.
</P>
<P>
   'Street tax' collections
</P>
<P>
   Police estimate that only about 80 members of the Texas
Syndicate are among the 2,500 or so gang members and wannabees
loose on Austin streets. Yet ``Ese Te,'' as members call it after
its initials in Spanish, probably ranks first in turf and clout.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, in the neighborhoods of East and South and North
Austin that the Texas Syndicate claims as its turf, the gang's
business fits a pattern of extortion and drugs, police say.
</P>
<P>
   It collects a 10 percent ``street tax'' from retail drug
dealers, many of whom it supplies with marijuana, cocaine, crack
cocaine or heroin. If members profit from crimes on their own, they
must pay the tax to the gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't pay, TS tells you: `You move out, or we come in
and rob you, or we'll shoot up your house, to where we get the
message across to you that you should start paying,' '' Dela Fuente
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police statistics bear out those words. In dozens of aggravated
assaults in the past year, suspected drug dealers were the victims
and prison gang members or affiliates were the prime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, investigators say, drug dealers are paying a tax
to both the Texas Syndicate and the Mexican Mafia, Austin's No. 2
prison gang, just to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, authorities have noticed another trend: gang
members' ownership or control of several area businesses,
mom-and-pop restaurants and beer joints mostly, where gang members
ostensibly go to work after they get out of prison. Police suspect
that the small businesses are little more than a front to launder
drug money and cover for other illegal activities such as burglary,
auto theft and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there are indications that Texas' growing threat from
prison gangs could be spreading regionally, even internationally.
Local and federal authorities in El Paso for several months have
been watching forays by the Barrio Azteca prison gang into the
Mexican drug trade and into California.
</P>
<P>
   Under increasing pressure from police and prison officials, the
gangs have begun to change. To thwart detection in prison and a
trip to solitary confinement, members have begun shunning the
traditional mark of membership, the distinctive tattoos known as
``plaques.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, police confirm, Texas Syndicate members have begun
referring to themselves as ``cuernos'' _ horns in Spanish _ rather
than ``carnales,'' a loose translation for brother in Spanish, as
they had. Instead of a TS tattoo, they are now sporting tiny horns
on their bodies. In El Paso, some street gangs now call themselves
``party crews.''
</P>
<P>
   But authorities in both cities say their illegal bent remains
the same.
</P>
<P>
   To thwart the gangs, state and local authorities in recent
months quietly have begun beefing up plans for a new gang computer
network, so they can more quickly exchange information about prison
gangs, their members and their criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials want to spend more than $100 million on four
new prisons to house Texas' most incorrigible convicts, hundreds of
them gang members. And during the next two years, they also want to
spend $1 million more on special gang-enforcement measures.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Texas' juvenile corrections agency wants to
spend millions more to build more single-prisoner cells, where gang
members and incorrigible street toughs can be isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, the San Antonio narcotics officer, is among those who say
such steps are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about the Mexican Mafia years ago, I
thought . . . that's in New York or Chicago or New Orleans. It's
not here in San Antonio,'' said Lopez, who attended high school in
San Antonio with several people who now are Mexican Mafia members _
including Heriberto Huerta, the reputed president, who is in
federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was here. And it's not going to just go away,'' Lopez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Polunsky, the prison board chairman, echoed those sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a metro area in Texas and you don't think prison
gangs are there, you're mistaken,'' he said. ``They are
everywhere.''

 &HT;    School bans red clothing
 &HT;    By Pamela Coleman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Round Rock High School administrators ordered
dozens of students wearing red clothing to change their garments
recently, after school officials prohibited wearing the color on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 students who wore the color to school were escorted to
the library, where their parents were called and told to bring
different clothing. Those who could not get new clothing were
placed in in-school suspension and told a conference would be
scheduled with their parents, said Principal Sherry Blackett.
</P>
<P>
   School officials said they are concerned about student safety
following a shooting in downtown Round Rock early Sunday that
injured two women, including a Round Rock High School sophomore,
and vandalism at the school. Police said the shooting was gang
related, but would not name the gangs involved.
</P>
<P>
   Blackett said red is a prominent color for the Bloods, Round
Rock's largest gang. However, Blackett did not explain the link
between the vandalism, the shooting and the targeting of Bloods
members or students wearing the Bloods color. ``We simply have
enforced the policy that says any clothing that has gang slogans,
symbols or colors may not be worn,'' said Blackett, who is in her
first year on the job at Round Rock High, which serves more than
3,600 students.
</P>
<P>
   Tally Tripp was among the students ordered to change clothes.
She showed up for class Friday wearing a red T-shirt,and had to
change into another shirt she uses for physical education class.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's mother said she is angered by the rule and can't afford
to buy new clothes for her daughter, whose wardrobe is largely red,
black and gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is such a lesson in absurdity _ where does this
end?'' said Cathy Brunicardi, Tripp's mother. ``If safety is really
an issue here because of colors, than get off the fence, withstand
the political firestorm and institute uniforms. We can't keep
adding colors of clothing to a banned list.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin schools do not ban any clothing based on color, said
district spokeswoman Kathy Anthony. However, other schools around
the country have tried similar bans as a way to fight gang
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Blackett, formerly a Corpus Christi administrator, said the ban
will remain in effect until those responsible for the vandalism are
identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Corpus Christi kids were being shot because they were
wearing someone else's color,'' she said. ``I'm asking the
community to understand the safety issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police, the shooting took place at about 1 a.m.
Sunday in the 1500 block of East Main Street. After exchanging
taunts, someone in a car fired a shotgun at a group of people in
and around a parked vehicle, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old woman was hit in the abdomen and chest. A
17-year-old woman was shot in the upper arm. The women, both of
Round Rock, were treated at Brackenridge Hospital and released on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police have charged five adults and one juvenile with engaging
in organized crime to commit aggravated assault with a deadly
weapon in connection with the shooting, said Sgt. Jack Abbott of
the Round Rock Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Roman, 18; Richard Martinez, 17; Kevin Simpson, 17; George
Wheeler, 18; Bennie Zuniga Oballe III, 18; and a 15-year-old
juvenile each face a first-degree felony charge punishable by five
to 99 years or life in prison and a fine of up to $10,000. All are
from Round Rock except Simpson, who is from Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Police said three of those arrested are known gang members.
Police have various criteria for identifying gang members
includingparticipation in criminal activity with other gang
members, the way they dress, the colors they wear and their
inclusion on gang membership lists, Abbott said. Blackett would not
say if any of the suspects were students at Round Rock High.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday or early Wednesday, vandals broke into the high
school and caused $10,000 in damage by spray painting red graffiti
in the art and gymnastics facilities, Blackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Blackett met with about 30 students wearing
predominantly red clothing and told them she would ban the color
from campus indefinitely. She later made the same announcement to
the entire student body. ''We're just enforcing the policy in the
student handbook given to every student,'' she said. The handbook
bans gang colors but does not state that red is a gang color.
</P>
<P>
   Interim School Superintendent Mike Jolly said Blackett has the
district's support. ``She's trying to head off a situation. If we
don't escalate it, I think it's going to work just fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ban has drawn the attention of the American Civil Liberties
Union, which will examine the issue on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very inappropriate,'' said Deirdre Feehan,
litigation coordinator. ``Although we are strongly supportive of
Principal Blackett's attempt to create a safe learning environment
for the kids, we have concerns about way she's going about it.
Wearing red is not a crime and wearing red does not indicate one is
in a gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackett said she has received many calls thanking her for
taking the action. ``To most of the students it's no problem,'' she
said. ``A small percent have an issue with it.''

 &HT;    Insurers told to cut liability rates by 13 percent
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas insurers will cut 13 percent, or nearly
$700 million, from the cost of liability policies next year under
an order from the state's top insurance regulator.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the cuts will mean a $47 savings for the
average Texas driver. That's $247.4 million less for the liability
portion of Texans' auto policies _ the only auto insurance coverage
required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance Commissioner Elton Bomer ordered the cuts, effective
Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions are the product of a 1995 law restricting the
number and types of lawsuits filed in the state, as well as the
amount of money that can be awarded to people who file
insurance-related lawsuits. In exchange for the limits on lawsuits
and damages, state legislators required insurers to share with
their customers money they save because of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The limits on lawsuits and damages commonly are referred to as
tort reform. It's Bomer's job to determine how much insurance
companies have saved each year because of tort reform and how much
they must share with customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pure and simple, tort reform legislation has created a
tremendous savings for Texans,'' Bomer said. ``Fewer frivolous
lawsuits and multimillion-dollar judgments, along with tougher
claims-handling practices, have clearly benefited both insurers and
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Ken Hoagland, a spokesman for Texans for Lawsuit Reform,
``Our old system was rife with abuses that made barrels of money
for plaintiffs attorneys and left consumers and business paying the
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the enactment of the 1995 tort reform law, Bomer has
ordered insurers to cut rates on seven types of liability insurance
by $2.2 billion, including next year's $697.9 million cut. Texans
and companies doing business in the state are expected to pay $5.4
billion for liability coverage next year. That would make the
$697.9 million cut a 13 percent savings.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Slivinske, a spokeswoman for the Texas Insurance
Organization, an industry group, said Bomer has overestimated the
industry's tort reform savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers benefit from a competitive market, which is the best
regulator of pricing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johns, another industry spokesman, said Texas insurers
have gone to great lengths to not only share tort reform savings
but also to cut rates due to savings from other factors, such as an
aging population that drives fewer miles, safer cars and improved
highway construction and designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance rates in Texas are at their lowest level in many
years,'' Johns said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Lambe, head of the consumer group Texas Watch, said more
cuts are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no surprise to find out insurers are saving money as a
result of changes in laws that limited their liability,'' Lambe
said. ``What is surprising is to see how the commissioner of
insurance has had to push, prod and threaten insurers before they
will do anything positive for Texas families and policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance companies have a long way to go in Texas before they
can claim they are responsive to Texas families.''
</P>
<P>
   D.J. Powers, an attorney for the Center for Economic Justice, an
advocate group for low-income Texans, said more cuts are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commissioner Bomer's inadequate rate reductions have thwarted
the Legislature's intent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Powers said rates for some insurance coverages have gone up
while claims have gone down, allowing companies to collect and keep
more money despite the tort reform liability cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bomer said insurers' tort-related savings have increased each
year since 1995 and that the tort-related cuts also have gone up
each year. For example, in 1996, the first year of tort reform rate
cuts, Bomer ordered insurers to reduce liability rates by $435.5
million. In 1998, the order was $656.4 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years of tort reform will mean that more than $2 billion
has stayed in the hands of Texas policyholders,'' Bomer said.

 &HT;    Former porn dealer opens Florida Christian rec center
 &HT;    By Paul Owers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ A Boynton Beach man whose company was sued
four years ago by Playboy Enterprises Inc. for reproducing nude
photos on a CD-ROM has formed a Christian youth group that plans to
open a recreation center in suburban Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kasanicky's Rock Youth Ministries is under contract to buy
the former Lake Worth Racquet and Swim Club at Lake Worth and
Coconut roads. The deal for the 5-acre parcel is set to close Dec.
1 for $310,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among the activities planned for the site are hockey,
basketball, skateboarding, swimming, rock climbing and
weightlifting. Middle and high school students would pay $10 a
month to use the facilities. The center, to be called The Rock, has
the backing of about 65 local businesses and churches and is
scheduled to open early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what we need to get the kids off the streets
and into a positive environment,'' Kasanicky said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kasanicky, a 32-year-old self-employed computer consultant, said
the idea to start the nondenominational organization came to him
last year shortly after he became a Christian and wanted to
influence children.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Kasanicky was president of Deerfield Beach-based
Starware Publishing Corp., which lost a $1.1 million judgment in
1995 to Playboy Enterprises for copyright violations and
infringement. U.S. District Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp ruled that
Starware and Kasanicky willfully violated copyright law when they
published the CD-ROM, which contained photos of celebrities LaToya
Jackson, Kim Basinger and Jessica Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   The parties later settled, and Starware went out of business in
early 1996, Kasanicky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly was a different part of my life,'' he said. ``I
realize now that pornography is very damaging and that it's one of
the evils of our society. I've certainly undergone a lot of changes
in my life, but if you didn't know me at all, my past certainly
would be something to be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Those working with Kasanicky on his current venture said they're
confident he has turned his life around and believe he deserves the
opportunity to minister to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be the first time that someone got a chance to do
something good after doing something bad,'' said Bob Giese,
president of the YMCA of the Palm Beaches and a board member of
Rock Youth Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Giese noted that the YMCA has hired employees who have had past
personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, people just need a chance to prove themselves,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Gaffey, a Boca Raton mother of four girls, said she met
Kasanicky a few years ago after he started coming to Spanish River
Church. She said she has no qualms about letting her two oldest
daughters, Ali, 13, and Emily, 11, spend time at The Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard that he had dabbled in X-rated stuff,'' Gaffey
said. ``But everyone has done something. I know he's a Christian,
and Christ changes your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Evans, a retired eye surgeon and current owner of the
Lake Worth Racquet and Swim Club, said he wasn't aware of the
Playboy lawsuit but still intends to go through with the sale.
Evans bought the club in 1986 for his son. It closed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already signed a contract,'' said Evans, a Palm City
resident. ``There's not much I can do about that. I'll just have to
see what happens and trust him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasanicky said donations from residents and local businesses and
churches helped raise the $1,000 down payment to buy the property.
The group will pay 10 percent at closing and finance the rest, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Additional plans for the center include a computer lab,
restaurant, a music studio and an auditorium for special events.
Kasanicky said he hopes to begin monthly youth meetings in
cooperation with churches.
</P>
<P>
   Donations, membership fees and food and T-shirt sales will help
finance The Rock, Kasanicky said. On Saturday, some 400 students
and adult volunteers gathered to help renovate the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done our homework,'' Kasanicky said. ``We want to reach
out to all kids and especially to those who don't know God.''

 &HT;    Mental health centers facing Medicare boot
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than 100 of the 130 privately run community
mental health centers in Texas may be defrauding Medicare by
failing to provide all required services and could be expelled from
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state officials are alarmed by the explosive growth
in the private centers. Medicare payments to the centers, whose
intensive therapy programs are supposed to keep severely mentally
ill people out of a hospital, have increased nationwide from $60
million in 1993 to $349 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some private centers around the country were using bingo games
and television as therapy sessions or serving people who were not
severely mentally ill, the inspector general of the U.S. Health and
Human Services Department, June Gibbs Brown, said this week. Twenty
centers, including seven in Texas, are being expelled from Medicare
immediately, and 60 others nationwide will be kicked out in the
next few months, federal officials said. The names of the centers
have not been released.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 private mental health centers that collect
Medicare operate across the country, with about 130 in Texas _
including one in Georgetown and one in Bastrop.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have found widespread problems in Texas but have
been hampered by their lack of authority to regulate the private
centers. Medicare is a federal program, and the state has no
jurisdiction to enforce the federal standards. There is no state
license the private centers must obtain.
</P>
<P>
   The private centers are different from the 38 public mental
health-mental retardation centers operating under contract with the
Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. The
public centers are regulated by the state, but the private ones are
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas had licensure, they probably would have caught these
bogus centers,'' said Spencer McClure, executive director of the
Texas Council of Community MHMR Centers.
</P>
<P>
   After McClure raised questions about the private centers in
1996, state officials urged the federal Health Care Financing
Administration to let them review the Medicare-funded homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Health, which was directed by the
federal government to collect basic information from the centers
when they applied for the Medicare program, gained additional
authority in 1997 to visit each center to determine whether it
provided all programs it claimed to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department visited 165 private centers and applicants
to the Medicare program. Only 27 of the 165 places offered the
services they claimed they provided, said Nance Stearman, director
of health facility compliance for the Texas Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unofficial estimates are that more than 100 community mental
health centers (in Texas) face termination of their Medicare
provider contract because they do not meet the federal
requirements,'' a Texas mental health department report said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Austin area, state health inspectors visited the
Williamson County Behavioral Health Center in Georgetown and the
Bastrop Behavioral Health Center. The on-site reviews found that
the Bastrop center provided all services it claimed to offer but
the Georgetown center did not, Stearman said.
</P>
<P>
   Melody Donges, a co-owner of the Georgetown center, said the
Williamson County center complies with all Medicare requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We meet the core requirements as set forth for community
mental health centers,'' she said. ``We do not do anything
fraudulent. We never have; we never will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are providing a wonderful service in the area,'' she said.
``We don't anticipate being one of the centers being targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   A key controversy in Texas centers on the Medicare requirement
that private community mental health centers must evaluate patients
for admission to state psychiatric hospitals. That requirement
conflicts with Texas rules, which allow only the 38 public mental
health centers to perform those evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Burns, owner of the Bastrop center and a director of the
Texas Association for Behavioral Health Care, said Congress did not
intend the public MHMR centers to have exclusive power to screen
patients for state hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be better for Medicare to go after the bad guys
rather than destroying this whole industry,'' he said.

 &HT;    Online publishing has a rich tradition
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic books and magazines are trendy. There are more
publishers on the Web than in New York these days. But publishing a
book electronically isn't a new idea.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the biggest and most important electronic publishing
project began way back in 1971. In those days, the World Wide Web
didn't exist, 1-megabyte files were considered enormous, and
computers were reserved for professionals or hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   It was within that context that Project Gutenberg began. A
fellow named Michael Hart was given an operator's account on the
Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the Materials Research Lab at the
University of Illinois. The notion was to create electronic texts
of documents in the public domain. Hart laboriously typed in the
text of the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Project Gutenberg is still around.
</P>
<P>
   And _ now that computer memories are enormous and high-speed
modems and data connections make it easy to transfer large files _
you can browse one of the world's largest free libraries in
electronic form from now until the end of your days and still not
read everything available. Go to http://sailor
</P>
<P>
   .gutenberg.org/by-title.html to get a notion of the range of the
titles there.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, you can download and read ``The Adventures of Tom
Sawyer'' one week and come back for ``Chemical Strategy in Peace
and War'' the next.
</P>
<P>
   A browser's paradise
</P>
<P>
   Just browsing the titles can be fun. You'll find ``Cicero's
Orations'' located not far away from President Clinton's
inauguration speech. ``The Communist Manifesto'' lives as a
friendly neighbor with ``The Compleat Angler.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the documents can be downloaded to your PC in the form
of plain ASCI text (which can be read by any word processor). Or,
if you want to speed the download, you can get the document in
compressed form as a ZIP file (a program such as PKUNZIP is needed
to decompress it ... you'll find decompression programs at a site
called Shareware.Com at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .shareware.com among other places).
</P>
<P>
   Another terrific source of online books is the University of
Virginia Electronic Text Library. Besides the selection of books in
English you'll also be able to find books and documents in Chinese,
German, French, Hebrew, Latin, Russian, Spanish and the
ever-popular Tibetan and Icelandic.
</P>
<P>
   Check in with Alex
</P>
<P>
   You'll also want to drop in at the Alex Catalogue at http://
</P>
<P>
   sunsite.berkeley.edu/alex/. Like the other sites, you'll be able
to search by author or title, and you'll also find links to other
electronic libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check out a site called Project Bartleby at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/. As you can see from the address,
it's located at Columbia University's College of Education. The
selection isn't as broad here, but there are some works that seem
unique to Bartleby.
</P>
<P>
   While most of us will prefer reading the old-fashioned way,
settled comfortably in a good chair on a lazy Sunday, electronic
texts have advantages that you may overlook. For instance, if
you're a student, you'll be able to use the search features in your
word processor to find references to specific terms. And, you'll
also be able to cut and paste when you need to quote from some of
these works.
</P>
<P>
   Or, use the electronic text as a sampler. Since books can be
expensive, you can use the electronic version to take a taste of an
unfamiliar work and then decide if you want to invest in the print
edition.

 &HT;    With release of Office, what else for the Mac?
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Serivce
<TEXT>
<P>
   True to its word, Microsoft this year released a long-awaited
new version of its Office suite of applications for the Mac market.
</P>
<P>
   The suite, which includes Word and Excel, has won generally
favorable reviews, sold well and is credited with helping to boost
Apple Computer's once sagging fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   But does Office represent the extent of Microsoft's renewed
commitment to the Mac platform? Many hope not and are calling for
the world's largest software developer to make more products for
the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest and most influential voice in this rising chorus is
Don Crabb, who writes a weekly online column.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for Mr. Jobs (Apple Computer Chief Executive Steven
Jobs) to visit Mr. Gates ... turn on his patented and effective
reality distortion field ... and convince them to start making an
across-the-board Microsoft commitment to the Mac,'' Crabb wrote in
a recent column.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Microsoft does make a lot of Mac software now. The
list includes such important products as Internet Explorer, Word,
Excel, Front Page and a World War II simulation game called Close
Combat. The company remains the single largest publisher of Mac
software.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are many Microsoft titles that are not
published for the Mac. They include the database Access, a personal
information manager Outlook and desktop publishing software
Publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Now each of these products would face serious competition from
Mac counterparts such as FileMaker, Now Up-To-Date and Print Shop.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Microsoft President Steve Ballmer recently said as much
in an online interview on Pioneer Planet Web site. ``There's no
economic return,'' Ballmer was quoted as saying. ``The cost of
rewriting the software to run on the Macintosh would be greater
than the (sales) revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   To Crabb that's a lot of hooey. He argues the Office suite is as
expensive and complex to develop as anything, and yet it has proved
hugely popular on the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less complex and expensive-to-develop education software
titles like Encarta or My Personal Tutor would take fewer resources
to produce, yet they would be category-killers on the Mac,'' wrote
Crabb.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what Crabb fails to point out is that there are many
Mac developers who wouldn't welcome a greater Microsoft presence in
the market. After all, what Microsoft might be killing is their
software.

 &HT;    Many users hold pocket-size computer close to the heart
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There goes Dad, writing in his diary again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I correct my wife. ``It's my personal digital
assistant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear that, Matt?'' my wife calls out to my son. ``It's
his personal digital assistant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah right,'' scoffs my son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well it is,'' I insist and stomp off to the closet of my room.
In my dark seclusion I have to admit my wife and son are right. The
PalmPilot I coddle in my hand has become as personal to me as a
diary.
</P>
<P>
   I use this pocket-size computer to jot down ideas, keep a
running grocery list, record when I've exercised and to remind me
of key appointments. And that's in addition to the PalmPilot's
electronic calendar, address book, calculator and to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   It truly has become my confidant, if a cruel one at times. I
won't soon forget the time it died during a change of batteries,
wiping out all my data. No diary I've ever kept treated me so
harshly. Still I wouldn't turn in my PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not alone in my affection for the PalmPilot. Just listen to
what TidBits writer Jeff Carlson said about this hand-held
computer: ``Take away my blender and I'll switch to a spoon. Try to
take my PalmPilot and I'll reach for a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   You tell 'em, Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot has become the Mac of the late 1990s, developing a
vocal cult following. And what do followers do in this age? They
publish Web sites in honor of their beloved.
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of them for the PalmPilot, but here are a few
of the better ones: PalmLife at http://www.palmlife.com/; The
Pickled PalmPilot at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .pickled.com/ and Palm Planet at http://palmtopplanet.interspeed
</P>
<P>
   .net/palm/palmplanet.shtml.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the PalmPilot so endearing? The reasons are many.
</P>
<P>
   For one, the PalmPilot is the right size. At 4.7 inches tall and
3.1 inches wide and less than an inch thick, it fits in almost any
pocket. It runs on two AA batteries that can power the thing for up
to a month.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the PalmPilot is convenient, made even more so
because it's always on (if the batteries aren't dead) and you can
write on it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not kidding. The PalmPilot really does recognize handwriting
in two ways. You can tap out words and numbers with the PalmPilot's
stylus on a little keyboard that appears on the bottom of the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can write directly on the screen. What you write isn't
English but a shorthand language that's easy to learn and
understand. It's part of the software called Graffiti that comes
with the PalmPilot. Graffiti turns that shorthand into English.
Forget a shorthand symbol and you can call up a directory of the
language on the PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to easily write transforms the PalmPilot from just
an interesting electronic gadget into something truly useful. You
can whip out your PalmPilot and jot down notes, appointments and
reminders nearly anywhere at any time. Then you can save and
categorize this information later at your convenience.
</P>
<P>
   This ease of use, reminiscent of the Mac, characterizes
everything about the PalmPilot. There's four buttons along the
bottom that let you jump immediately to your address book,
calendar, notes or to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   And like the Mac, the PalmPilot display screen includes a top
menu bar. From there you can copy, paste, edit or remove items.
Instead of clicking a mouse you tap the commands with the stylus.
There's also a find command that lets you quickly search for
things.
</P>
<P>
   While Mac-like, the PalmPilot is not particularly Mac-friendly.
For starters, many Mac users have complained it's difficult and
sometimes impossible to back up their PalmPilot data on a desktop
Mac. I experienced this same problem. On PCs, the transfer of data
is a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much Mac software for the PalmPilot. The opposite
is true for the PC model, which supports scores of applications.
</P>
<P>
   To 3Com's credit, it is trying to correct this imbalance. Last
spring it bought the first-rate personal information manager Claris
Organizer from Apple Computer. The company plans to refashion
Organizer as the core software of the Mac version of PalmPilot.
This software is expected to be released sometime this fall.
</P>
<P>
   PalmPilot's success, the first for a hand-held computer, has not
gone unnoticed. A score of other computer makers, including Casio,
Sharp and NEC, have entered the market with new products. Many of
them are using a specially-adapted version of Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   These new machines are adding things not included in the
PalmPilot. The Casio Cassiopeia A-10, for example, lets you dictate
notes. Other machines have color screens and let you write and
print memos.
</P>
<P>
   None of these competitors have yet knocked the PalmPilot from
first place, with its million-plus sales. Still the race has just
begun.
</P>
<P>
   THE PALMPILOT III AT A GLANCE
</P>
<P>
   Dimensions: 4.7 inches by 3.1 inches and 0.6 inches thick. It
weighs less than 6 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $399; an older, less capable version is still available
for $199
</P>
<P>
   Power: Runs on 2 AA batteries, which power the PalmPilot for up
to a month.
</P>
<P>
   Microprocessor: Motorola
</P>
<P>
   Maker: 3Com, which also owns modem brand U.S. Robotics
</P>
<P>
   Operating system: Unique to the PalmPilot, it's called Pilot
Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Screen: 160 pixels, black and white, touch sensitive
</P>
<P>
   Capacity: 20,000 names, calendar appointments and other assorted
information.
</P>
<P>
   Availability: There's a model each for Mac and Windows
computers, to which you can back up information. It's sold in most
computer stores, including discount chains such as Home Depot and
OfficeMax.

 &HT;    Check-It 98 utility is valuable tool for PC
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last, there is hope of a good night's sleep. No more fear, no
more fretting. My computer is ready for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I have never worried about whether my computer was
ready for what us computer geeks knowingly refer to as Y2K. The
major question is whether I am ready for the millennium, and so far
as I am aware there is no software available to prepare me for it.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, software to prepare a PC for the coming of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of a large suite of utilities called Check-It 98,
from Touchstone. Check-It, however, is more interesting from a
standpoint of what it tells you than what it does. It provides an
enormous amount of information on your system, and runs a great
many internal tests to make certain everything is working properly.
</P>
<P>
   If it finds something wrong, then either the program or the
manuals packed with it will provide some advice on what to do. In
terms of cures, Check-It provides very little. Its system tuneup,
for instance, consists of running Windows 95's ScanDisk and Disk
Defragmenter.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of testing and presenting detailed information on a
computer's components, I've seen nothing to equal it. It will run
separate tests on the drives, the system memory, the modem, the
motherboard, the ports and the video. It provides extremely
detailed information on all those items plus your Internet setup,
PCI bus, printer, available resources, SCSI setup if any, sound
system, PCMCIA cards. USB port, power management, networking and
other things so arcane that I'm not sure what they are.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, of course, this information is of no use at
all to the average user. However, let's say you're trying to
install a new video card and you can't seem to make it work. You
call the maker of the card for tech support. If a few usual
approaches don't work, one of the things the technician is going to
ask you is, ``What motherboard are you using?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that came with my computer'' is not the right answer.
There's every chance that the documentation that came with your
computer isn't going to tell you, either. This is part of the
information that Check-It provides; my motherboard is an Intel 686,
Model 5, Revision 1, with the Intel 440BX revision 2 chipset.
</P>
<P>
   The technician might also ask about your PCI bus, and Check-It
will provide you with enough information to melt his pocket
protector.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Tools section that allows you to maintain a benchmark
routine for your computer. It tests every portion of it, records
the results and compares them to the next set of benchmark tests
you run. This tells you whether something is gradually going south.
It will also back up a handful of files it considers most critical
to the operation, and restore them if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Check-It also comes with FastMove, a utility for the quick
transfer of files between two computers and a serial cable to
accomplish it, and with NetOptimizer, a modem utility I reviewed
and found very useful.
</P>
<P>
   Check-It is a very good utility to have, even for its rather
steep $90 price tag. Most users, unfortunately but understandably,
don't find utilities very sexy. If you wait until you've got a
problem to get something like this, it will help, but not nearly as
much as it would if you had been running it regularly before the
trouble came along.

   It's hard to find a school today that doesn't have computers.
But what, if any effect, are they having on education? In its
special fall issue on computers, FamilyCircle takes a look at this
important trend. It finds 6.3 million computers were in U.S. public
schools as of the 1996-97 school year. That represents a 186
percent increase from five years earlier. Internet access is also
growing in schools. FamilyCircle found 78 percent of all public
schools had at least one computer with Internet access.

   Read how Iridium is about to transform the telephone business in

last month finished building a wireless satellite service so people
can send and receive telephone calls from anywhere. That means you
can do it from the ocean surface, in the desert or in the middle of
a city center. It's powered by a constellation of 66 satellites.
They communicate with 13-ounce portable telephones. Wired dubs the

 &HT;    It's easier to move a PC if you've saved your boxes
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I once calculated that _ in my long life _ I have purchased 18
lawn mowers, 12 refrigerators and six leaf blowers. I have moved
more often than a con man on the lam. I should get a discount at
the rent-a-truck place.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned a lot by moving so often. For one thing, I've
learned that if you drop a futon down the stairs, it is best just
to let it go. Grabbing a speeding futon can be briefly interesting
but highly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Since I have lived with and around computers since before IBM
introduced the original IBM Personal Computer in 1981, I have also
acquired a fair to middlin' knowledge of how to move a personal
computer. Moving a PC has gotten easier over the years. When I
started with them, a computer's hard disk was as sensitive as a
teenager going through puberty. The slightest jolt could send your
hard disk to computer heaven.
</P>
<P>
   PCs and their hard disks are less sensitive these days, but
moving any electronic gear is still a delicate task. Since most of
us will end up moving a computer one of these days, let me offer
you some tips based on too much experience.
</P>
<P>
   Husted's first rule of PC moving is to save all boxes. Those
boxes with Styrofoam inserts can't be beat for moving computers,
monitors and printers. I know it's tempting to throw all the
packing material away. But they're customized just for your
equipment. It is the perfect way to move.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about hard disk drives, but there's another kind of
drive in your computer: a floppy disk drive. Cut a piece of
cardboard (the kind cleaners use when they fold shirts) and insert
it into the floppy disk drive. That'll keep the magnetic head of
the floppy drive from banging around. Make sure you leave a tab on
the outside of the cardboard so it is easy to remove.
</P>
<P>
   If you're moving from Atlanta to Oregon, you'll need to take
more care than if the PC is going across town. For really long
moves, you have to spend some time worrying about the accessory
cards inside your computer. These cards can become loose in their
slots _ even through they're secured with a screw. If that happens,
your computer will malfunction when you turn it on at the new
location. And in a few cases, the loose card can actually
permanently damage your computer by creating a short circuit.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to attack this problem. You can wait until
you arrive at the new location and remove and then reseat each of
these cards. Or, you can remove the cards before moving (making
sure to pack them in the anti-static pouches that they came in).
For most folks, it makes more sense to leave the cards in the
machine and reseat them when you arrive.
</P>
<P>
   If at all possible, try not to move your PC in the moving van or
a closed truck, especially in the hot summer. The extreme heat can
hurt the machine, and the ride also is much more harsh. The best
way to move a computer is to pack it away in the box and then to
carry the box inside your car.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, unless you are a whiz at assembling and reassembling
computer systems, it's a real time saver to mark all the
connections using stick-on labels. That way, you won't have to
puzzle around with, say, the sound card trying to figure which of
the identical jacks is used for your speakers.
</P>
<P>
   That's it, the short course in moving a computer. If you follow
these tips (and if you can avoid grabbing a speeding futon) you'll
soon be up and running again.

 &HT;    Horns get defensive
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It may be small. It may be fleeting. But it is
progress, and what the Texas Longhorns' defense did in a 59-21 win
over Rice last weekend put a contented feeling in its coach's
heart, which is progress of a whole different kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased, No. 1, with the win,'' defensive coordinator Carl
Reese said. ``Secondly, we didn't stink out the joint.''
</P>
<P>
   Victories come where you can find them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Longhorns (2-2) seach for more progress as they take
on the Big 12's most improved team, the Iowa State Cyclones.
</P>
<P>
   It gets redundant what the Horns' offense must do to win: Get
another serviceable game out of Major Applewhite _ another monster
one out of Ricky Williams _ and score most every time it touches
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, it's a brave new world.
</P>
<P>
   Against Rice last week, the defense held an opponent to three
touchdowns or fewer for the first time in 14 games, allowed only
218 yards to an option team and had as many sacks as its opponent
had completions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since I've been here, the players did not
get rattled,'' said Texas Coach Mack Brown, the Iowa State
receivers coach the last and only time the teams have met, a 17-9
Longhorns win in 1979. ``They did a good job adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're trying to take baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Five little piggies at a time, who:
</P>
<P>
   _ Went to mark it. Texas must stake out its turf by holding Iowa
State early and building on its collectively fragile confidence.
Iowa State has scored only 20 points in the first quarter, its
least productive period.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stayed home. The Cyclones run a one-back offense about 70
percent of the time and that back, junior Darren Davis, is a
tremendous cutback runner. Misdirections and reverses have killed
the Longhorns this year.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is also a very dangerous receiver. He's second on the team
in catches, turning a swing pass into a 65-yard touchdown against
Ball State last week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ate the most beef. That's the ISU offensive line, which
obviously hasn't let many juicy cuts slip past. The Cyclones line
up 300-pounders from tackle to tackle, who have done an equally
effective job opening holes (5.0 yards per carry) and closing them
(zero sacks allowed).
</P>
<P>
   _ Had none. Clue, that is, about what to do when the ball's in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   All season, Texas cornerbacks have shown an inability to play
the ball instead of the man, instant trouble when quarterback Todd
Bandhauer has been effective taking a three-step drop and throwing
the deep ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been our problem,'' Reese said. ``You can tell by how
many corners we've had out there. You want production. When the
ball's up deep, you'd better be making a play.''
</P>
<P>
   With last week's starter, freshman Ervis Hill, still hobbled
with a sore shin, the Horns plan to use the player he replaced, Joe
Walker, for more than just second-half mop-up duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's got a chance,'' Reese said. ``It's like a new life. It's
like playing poker and you run out of money and somebody just comes
up to you, hands you some money and says, 'Go ahead.' ``
</P>
<P>
   _ Ran all the way home. That's where Williams, the Longhorns
defense's biggest and best weapon, comes in.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones rank 55th against the rush, and that's the
lowest-rated unit Williams will face in the next seven games as he
chases Tony Dorsett's NCAA career rushing mark. He knows where home
is.

 &HT;    Auditors uncover red ink in parks
 &HT;    By Mike Leggett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas state parks are operating at an annual
multimillion-dollar deficit, a comprehensive state audit report
shows, and the system could be facing layoffs, park closures or
transfers, and an overhaul of current spending and income programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, officials in the state auditor's office said the
Parks and Wildlife Department is failing to accurately count paying
visitors and adequately maintain and operate parks to sustain
visitation levels. Andrew Sansom, the Parks and Wildlife
Department's executive director, requested the audit to determine
why the system is operating at a deficit and to develop a plan for
closing the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors reported that total revenues for state parks fall $10.1
million short of the $51.5 million needed annually for basic
operations and maintenance, even though the department has raised
revenues by at least 85 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The audit, which took nearly a year, recommended a review of the
parks inventory, with an eye toward operations that could be
reduced or altered.
</P>
<P>
   The Parks and Wildlife Department operates parks, natural areas
and historical sites throughout the state. A number of the
historical sites draw few visitors and thus lose money year after
year, the auditors found. Other areas are remote and undeveloped,
and entry fees are too low, despite recent increases, to allow them
to operate at a profit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is significance _ what assets should the state be
managing,'' Sansom said. ``There are more things we should do, but
we can't do them as long as we're dealing with sites of
insignificance. I'm not going to name specific parks.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a number of park properties have outdated, even
crumbling buildings, water and sewer systems and user facilities,
the audit found. To meet those critical repair needs, the
Legislature has authorized $60 million in bonds, which the
department plans to issue over five or six years. The auditor's
report said the department's repair schedule did not ensure that
critical repairs would be made quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom said his department is faced with a dilemma: The public
demands park access, but the parks do not have a strong financial
base in terms of entry fees. ``You could easily say the state
should keep on managing a San Jacinto Monument or Washington on the
Brazos,'' Samson said. ``We don't charge any entrance fees at those
sites, though.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the real issues is just how many people visit state parks
each year.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the Parks and Wildlife Department has claimed 20
million to 22 million visitors annually, even though revenues
always fell far short of the money that number should produce. The
auditor's report said that the actual number could be 25 percent
lower, or 5 million visitors fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have solid numbers,'' Sansom said. ``That was
shown by the disaster we had two years ago with that price
increase.'' Fees were raised, but that didn't substantially
increase revenue totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do something because the current system is not
giving us the kind of data you need to predict income,'' Sansom
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Cook, chief operations officer and assistant director of the
Parks and Wildlife Department, took over the effective top spot in
parks nearly a year ago, as Sansom and the nine-member commission
tried to begin reining in spending problems. He said the department
is trying to find an effective way to count visitors and thus
budget realistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We implemented a program so that we will know how many people
paid to get into our parks,'' Cook said. ``We still don't know how
many people there are total, and we need that number because we
have to be able to offer them facilities and services.'' Some user
groups such as youngsters and seniors don't pay the regular entry
fees to state parks. Charlie Hrncir, a certified public accountant
in the state auditor's office who worked on the project, said the
Parks and Wildlife Department's audit was neither the worst nor the
best in which he's been involved. ``There are some challenges
facing the department that are serious, though,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sansom said one of those challenges will be working with state
leaders in the next three to four years to identify parks that
could be closed or that could be shifted to other ownership or
operations responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, we have some parks that are totally within the
boundaries of some cities,'' he said. ``Why should we own that?
We're handing out $15 million a year for local park funds projects,
and maybe that's where some of that should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing parks or shifting ownership of some park sites to other
governmental entities _ the State Historical Society has been one
suggestion _ is a politically tricky move. Sansom said no decisions
would be made without the input of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The department's share of the state sales tax on sporting goods
comes to $15.5 million a year, and parks and wildlife officials
would love to be able to grab a bigger share of that $100 million
pot. However, that probably won't happen until the department
addresses more of the issues raised in the state audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not have the option of shutting down,'' Sansom said.
``It's clear that what we do is important to the people of Texas,
and I think clearly that we offer them a great bargain. But we have
to change to continue to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sansom identified three main areas of concentration. ``Shame on
us if by this time next year we haven't developed an accurate way
to count visitors,'' he said. ``We need to speed up our repair
program, and we need to find deficiencies in operations and
staffing. If that means moving more people into the field, that's
what we'll do.''

 &HT;    `Titanic' makes waves by offering closed-captioning
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year's blockbuster film ``Titanic'' was remarkable: $200
million to make, $1 billion-plus earned so far, 11 Oscars and a
plot that made us believe that in 1912 a steerage passenger
actually could meet and fall in love with someone from the rarified
air of first class.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie was even more noteworthy for another reason.
``Titanic'' was just the second feature film to be closed-captioned
for the deaf and hearing-impaired, following ``The Jackal,'' and
was one of the first ever shown with the captions in a regular
theater.
</P>
<P>
   The patented Rear Window Captioning System shows reversed
captions on an LED text display mounted in the rear of a theater.
Deaf and hard-of-hearing patrons use transparent acrylic panels
attached to their seats to reflect the captions so that they appear
superimposed on the movie screen. The reflective panels are
portable and adjustable, enabling the user to sit anywhere. The
system was co-developed by WGBH television and Rufus Butler Seder
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So far, General Cinema theaters in Indianapolis, Sherman Oaks,
Calif., and Lombard, Ill., are equipped with the system, but
Atlanta may not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is a market we're giving strong consideration to,''
said General Cinema spokesman Brian Callaghan. ``We're still
testing the technology and determining what location works best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts-based theater company is considering the
system for its 15-screen theater planned for Parkway Pointe on Cobb
Parkway, Callaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' and ``The Jackal'' also were described for the blind
and vision-impaired by WGBH's Descriptive Video Service as part of
the Motion Picture Access Project. Descriptive narration is
delivered via infrared or FM listening systems and headsets that
don't disturb other audience members. The descriptions highlight
key visual elements such as actions, settings and scene changes.
</P>
<P>
   A General Cinema theater in Framingham, Mass., is equipped with
the narration system, but Callaghan said the company would like to
install both systems if possible as new theaters come on line.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance is useless
</P>
<P>
   It's official: There's no escape from e-mail anywhere on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan Corp. has come out with the GSC 100, billed as the
world's first hand-held satellite-based global communicator and the
first of its type to gain FCC approval.
</P>
<P>
   The GSC 100 combines Orbcomm, a ring of low-Earth-orbit
messaging and data communications satellites, with the Global
Positioning System. Explorers in the jungles of Borneo, for
example, can communicate with anyone on Earth who has an e-mail
address, voice or fax service and let them know their position on
the globe to within about 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   When the user sends a ``GlobalGram'' from the GSC 100, the
message goes to an Orbcomm satellite, which relays it to a ground
station that routes it to the recipient via the Internet. The
process is reversed to receive a message.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail interface lets the user create, edit, forward, copy
and delete messages. The device will save up to 100 messages and
150 addresses, and includes GPS data in the message.
</P>
<P>
   This inability to get away from the Information Age doesn't come
cheap. The GSC 100 itself costs $999.
</P>
<P>
   May the Force be with you
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star Wars'' empire of movies, software, action figures and
the Force knows what has generated enough money in the 21 years of
its existence to buy most of the galaxies far, far away _ and the
local ones, too.
</P>
<P>
   And the whizzes at LucasArts Entertainment are nowhere near
being done. A two-CD interactive ``insider's guide'' due out this
fall is packed with facts and figures, trivia, never-seen film
footage and a preview of the long-awaited Episode I ``prequel''
movie expected to be released in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Behind the Magic'' is organized into sections that
detail characters (including creatures), locations, events and
technology through more than 2,500 photos, 600 pieces of production
art, 30 models, 40 minutes of digitized video, 20 minutes of audio
and 30 ship schematics. There's also a searchable database with
more than 700 entries.
</P>
<P>
   Want to know the difference between a TIE fighter and a TIE
interceptor? Need the skinny on B-wing, X-wing or Y-wing rebel
craft? How about a 3-D walk-through of the Millennium Falcon,
hosted by C-3PO? It's all here, along with lots more you might not
have known you needed to know.
</P>
<P>
   The set will have an estimated street price of $29.

 &HT;    In violence of prison life, inmate clans offer security
 &HT;    (Moves in two parts)
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (1)
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE COLONY, Texas _ Deep inside the Coffield prison, from
a tiny cage in a hallway, a young convict screams obscenities at
everyone. And no one.
</P>
<P>
   Down an adjacent corridor, an ``extraction team'' of guards in
riot
</P>
<P>
   helmets, padded vests and gas masks marches in lock step to a
cell where a convict has grabbed a mop from a trusty and is
threatening to hurt somebody. They spray him with tear gas and haul
him off in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Across the way, a guard walks briskly, a plastic shield in front
of him at every step to avoid being splattered with urine and feces
that some convicts are throwing through their cell bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to animal house,'' says an unsmiling guard.
</P>
<P>
   Several corridors away, an identical cellblock holds hundreds of
other convicts whom prison officials deem just as dangerous. But
here, where the Barrio Azteca prison gang lives, the stillness is
broken only by bouncing basketballs in a recreation yard and the
``Jerry Springer Show'' blaring on a television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how to do time,'' explains a gang member. ``We have
respect for each other. We enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the gangs are being blamed for increasing
violence in and out of prison, the reality in the maximum-security
lockups where gang members are segregated is orderly, almost
serene. The eerie calm highlights the central role gangs have come
to occupy in some Texas prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Even though gang activities are banned, membership has more than
quadrupled during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Even though prison officials' goal is to break up the gangs,
they house their members together because they're easier to manage
that way.
</P>
<P>
   And even though prison officials say they try to prevent gang
</P>
<P>
   activities, they have in some instances enlisted gang leaders in
efforts to maintain order.
</P>
<P>
   The Coffield Unit, about 60 miles southwest of Tyler, Texas,
holds about 1,000 of 5,000 confirmed gang members in Texas prisons,
more than any other unit. Entire cellblocks are filled with members
of Barrio Azteca, Mexican Mafia, Hermanos Pistoleros Latinos, Raza
Unida, Texas Mafia and Texas Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   One convict to a cell. All mail is closely monitored. No one
leaves his cell without handcuffs and constant escort, and only
then for up to two hours, for a shower or for recreation with other
gang members.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are increasing questions about whether the strict
rules are effective, about whether prison officials are doing
enough. ``In some cases, I think guards are encouraging and
allowing gang activity to happen,'' said Linda Reeves, with Texas
Inmate Family Association, an advocacy group. ``And that's not
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Scott, executive director of the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice, disagrees. ``Are we in charge? Absolutely. Are
these gangs calling the shots? Absolutely not,'' he said. ``By
keeping these gangs in a very controlled environment, we watch
everything they do. . . . They play by our rules.''
</P>
<P>
   On B Wing, where the Barrio Azteca members live, convicts say
the rules that count are those of the gang.
</P>
<P>
   Amid growing concern by police about the spreading influence of
prison gangs inside and outside prison, some legislative leaders
suggest that the segregation of gang members, in solitary
confinement with their colleagues, may not be the wisest choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cage them in administrative segregation, label them gang
members and never deal with them, never offer them any programs to
change their attitude or life, which is what we seem to be doing
now . We're probably going to see worse criminals when they come
out,'' said state Sen. John Whitmire, chairman of the Senate
Criminal Justice Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials defend the system as practical and proven, one
that avoids the bloody trouble that might come from mixing gang
members, even in small groups, even in solitary cells, next to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They earn this level of incarceration by their behavior,''
Scott said. ``Gangs or not, we have one of the safest prison
systems in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules of the gangs
</P>
<P>
   Although the guards enforce one set of rules, the gangs have a
code that exists alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   Yelling or speaking disrespectfully to fellow gang members will
result in a warning, sometimes delivered orally, sometimes in a
written message delivered by ``fishing lines,'' string and long
poles fashioned out of rolled-up newspaper with a hook on the end
to pass communiques from cell to cell, even between floors.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't heed the warning, a beating may be in store,
</P>
<P>
   administered on a recreation court or day room by the small
groups of gang members who are allowed out at the same time for
recreation, the only group activity permitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internal discipline'' is the way Warden Keith Price and other
prison officials sometimes describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, just as on the street, a gang member will break
the wrong rule, and a top member of the gang can order him killed.
At least three such death orders have been carried out this year in
Texas prisons, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Most recent: a July 3 stabbing at the Allred prison outside
Wichita Falls, where investigators suspect a Mexican Mafia member
was ordered killed. In June and July, gang members were responsible
for 94 major incidents in prison, ranging from assaults to weapon
possession to disobeying guards. Most were members of one gang
attacking members of another.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing gang numbers in prison has come growing
problems. Low parole rates and less time off for good behavior have
stripped away incentives to behave. More prisoners are serving more
time for more violent crimes. These conditions make prison a
fertile place for gangs, said Gary Johnson, director of the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice's prison division.
</P>
<P>
   And for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, officials say, pepper spray, tear gas grenades and
</P>
<P>
   physical force are being required to quell disturbances. In
recent
</P>
<P>
   months, more than two dozen prisons have experienced gang
problems.
</P>
<P>
   On July 19, guards used tear gas to subdue a fight between black
and Hispanic convicts in a dorm at the Segovia prison in South
Texas, but not before six combatants broke down a wall into an
adjacent dorm, according to a prison report.
</P>
<P>
   More common: a Sept. 9 stabbing at the Beto I Unit near
Tennessee Colony, one of 12 reported at the prison in a few weeks
involving members of the Puro Raza Mexicales gang and the rival
Tango Mexicales.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence, gang membership can offer protection from
</P>
<P>
   predators, even a sense of family, experts say. Or it can mean a
ticket to a unit with other members of their gang, such as Coffield
B Wing, where the Barrio Azteca members live in relative peace.
</P>
<P>
   Increased violence in prisons endangers not only gang members
but also guards and prisoners who are trying to straighten out
their lives, officials say. And taxpayers bear the cost of
increased security inside prisons. And one day, most convicts will
emerge from prison, back onto the streets, back into communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, a robber might have taken pride in never
using a gun. Now, they'll shoot someone first and then rob them,''
said Sam Buentello, the prison system's top gang expert.
</P>
<P>
   Hatred and bonding
</P>
<P>
   In the prison culture of barely suppressed anger, of predatory
behavior and rape, a place of enforced uniformity and harsh
routine, there is hate.
</P>
<P>
   And prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   In this place where 45 percent of convicts are black, 29 percent
are white and 26 percent are Hispanic, where 61 percent of the
employees are white, 23 percent are black and 15 percent are
Hispanic, race is a denominator for everyday life, especially in
the tougher maximum-security units.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, the same white uniforms, the same buzz-cut
hair, guards barking orders and convicts answering with epithets,
strip searches every time they come and go between their cells and
work, convicts seize on race and ethnicity as a bond.
</P>
<P>
   Or a reason to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Such hatred can breed violence that is furious and unthinkable,
like the June attack in Jasper that made national headlines, when
three white ex-convicts chained a man behind a pickup truck and
dragged him to death, just because he was black.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Petrick, a convicted Houston robber, knows well that
mentality of hate. Until 1993, he was a general for the Aryan
Brotherhood of Texas prison gang, a top leader who helped draft the
gang's constitution, someone other members once feared.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has renounced his membership, after refusing an
order to kill someone, they want to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it all. . . . I lived the rhetoric,'' he said from
behind the
</P>
<P>
   plastic window on an interview booth at the Goree Unit in
Huntsville, where he is in protective custody. ``But I didn't kill
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials say his path into the gang, and into the
mentality of hate, is typical.
</P>
<P>
   First arrested at age 13, a ``ball of hate looking for a place
to turn,'' Petrick said, he affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood
in 1985, while he was in the Harris County Jail, and joined four
years later. Having done prison time previously in California and
Minnesota, with a reputation for winning jailhouse fights, Petrick
probably seemed the perfect recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was extremely racist,'' he said, explaining that his views
grew from a troubled childhood in which ``I started hating and
focusing that hate. . . . I felt I had a good reason to hate
society.''
</P>
<P>
   In prison, he said, race became just another reason to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Race, Petrick said, is ``all you have left in here. We're
stripped down. The only identity we have in prison is our skin
color.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the racial and ethnic tensions, to try to adjust
convicts' attitudes before the inmates leave prison, officials
offer several anger-management and diversity lessons in prison
classrooms. But they are available only at the lower-security
units, generally not those where gang members and the tougher
convicts are locked up, and officials privately concede that their
effectiveness is limited if convicts have no desire to stop hating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to hate, they will hate,'' prison director
Scott said, noting that racial tensions tend to drop as the
security level of the prison decreases. ``People don't come to
prison for being good citizens. They come for breaking society's
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, a former prosecutor who chairs
a legislative committee studying prison gangs, agrees. But, like
other lawmakers and criminal justice academics, he questions
``whether race is actually the problem or whether it is really
other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We get this uncut, raw, X-rated view of racism in the prison
system,'' he said. ``But I think prison gangs are using racism as a
crutch to attract other individuals to join them, and we need to
address that.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, racism figured heavily in the formation of
prison gangs in Texas two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Until the late 1970s, Texas prisons were segregated by race and
run by convicts known as ``building tenders,'' trusted prisoners
whom guards allowed to supervise dorms and cellblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Then federal court orders desegregated prisons and outlawed the
</P>
<P>
   building tender system. Hispanics, whites and blacks were forced
to live with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Racial and ethnic tensions flared. And for protection against
assaults and thefts, convicts formed gangs, mostly along racial and
ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Syndicate, formed years earlier in California prisons
by
</P>
<P>
   Texans seeking to protect themselves, was first. Then came
groups with names such as Mexican Mafia, Texas Mafia, Mandingo
Warriors, Self Defense Family and the Aryan Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, Texas' seven prison gangs were big trouble. Of the 52
convict slayings in 1984-85, 48 were gang-related, prison officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 1,500 assaults on staff in 1985,'' said Buentello.
``All hell had broken loose.''

 &HT;    In violence of prison life, inmate clans offer security
 &HT;    (Moves in two parts)
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   Zero tolerance
</P>
<P>
   To regain control, prison officials adopted a zero-tolerance
policy
</P>
<P>
   that remains in effect today. If you are confirmed as a gang
member, you serve your sentence on lockdown, alone in a solitary
cell, with only an hour outside each day for exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, by the early 1990s, gangs started to grow again,
fed by an influx of young criminals who had grown up in street
gangs. In just a few years, the number of confirmed gang members
inside Texas prisons jumped from 1,280 to more than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Barrio Azteca, Raza Unida and Hermanos Pistoleros Latinos were
added to the gang list. But dozens more smaller groups of convicts,
less-organized but ganglike in mentality nonetheless, began to
spring up, sporting names like the Kingwood Chongos, Tango
Mexicales, Aggieland Crypt and Bud Club.
</P>
<P>
   In all, officials estimate that as many as 10,000 convicts may
be
</P>
<P>
   affiliated with some gang or group of some sort inside Texas
prisons. But in a prison system with only 8,200
solitary-confinement cells, of which gang members now occupy well
over half, there is simply no room to isolate them all.
</P>
<P>
   But that could soon change.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials have announced plans to build a new generation
of
</P>
<P>
   solitary-confinement units at a cost of more than $100 million
to hold the growing number of violent convicts and die-hard gang
members. With that will come another whopping price tag: $53 a day
to house a convict in the high-security unit compared with $38 a
day for a regular prison.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the first of those units, the Estelle High-Security
Unit
</P>
<P>
   outside Huntsville, was opened. At Super Max, as the unit is
known, the cells have no bars or windows to the outside, only a
steel door with two narrow windows and a slot to pass food trays
through. More than half of the 660 convicts in the Super Max unit
are gang members, people like Juan Garza, serving 20 years for auto
burglary in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, 31, is among a growing chorus of people who complain that
Super Max is too much _ too much isolation, too few programs, too
punitive an environment where convicts may only grow meaner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting in this cell 23 hours a day doesn't better anyone,''
said
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a ninth-grade dropout whom prison officials identify as a
member of the Mexican Mafia. ``People go crazy here. . . . There
are guys that actually sit in front of a mirror and carry on an
entire conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   To break the solitude, gang members communicate by ``the
phone,'' the air vents through which they can talk to each other.
Much to the chagrin of guards, they also have learned how to
``fish,'' pass written messages between cells with string passed
through a small crack beneath the steel cell doors.
</P>
<P>
   They play chess by making hand signs through the small plastic
window in their cell doors.
</P>
<P>
   And during their one hour of recreation a day, singly in small
</P>
<P>
   chain-link pens where guards are near with clipboards to record
any gang-related conversations, Garza said they can talk.
</P>
<P>
   But will such tough treatment force convicts to change for the
better?
</P>
<P>
   And will it stop or thwart gang activity?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, say prison officials, who insist that assaults and
misbehavior
</P>
<P>
   have dropped markedly at Super Max. Convicts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like tying up a dog, chaining him up . . . and
expecting him to come back five years later, 10 years later when
you haven't fed him right, you've mistreated him, and you go and
let him loose,'' Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is he going to do? Eventually, he's going to go and bite
</P>
<P>
   somebody. And then we end up chaining him right back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints and the high cost, prison officials
insist the new isolation beds are humane, and needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those beds will be filled as soon as we can get them open,''
said Allan Polunsky, a San Antonio lawyer who heads the prison
system's governing board. ``And the sooner the better.''
</P>
<P>
   In youth prisons
</P>
<P>
   At the Texas Youth Commission, Executive Director Steve Robinson
estimates that gang activity has jumped by 25 percent in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, in the first such uprising, teen-age delinquents
rioted at the Evins Regional Juvenile Center in Edinburg and took
control of a dorm for several hours. After 25 youth commission
staff members and 16 sheriff's deputies regained control, they
found graffiti for a Hispanic street gang _ one affiliated with a
prison gang _ amid the debris.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, delinquents tried the same thing at another
state school. And in May, officials thwarted plans for a similar
riot at the Crockett State School in East Texas. Twelve gang
leaders were locked up in solitary cells, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   For a corrections system where rehabilitation programs are the
</P>
<P>
   priority, not steel-and-concrete punishment, the trend is
ominous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a toxic mix,'' Robinson said, noting that 40 percent of
youth
</P>
<P>
   commission delinquents admit an affiliation with a street gang.
``Gangs threaten the whole of what we do, because gang influences
interfere with the programs that are a key to what we do. That's
where we start to lose ground in rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   While Robinson said no youth commission delinquents have been
found to be members of prison gangs, officials in recent months
have intercepted letters from adult convicts recruiting teen-age
offenders to join white-supremacist prison gangs. As a result,
correspondence from convicts is now are prohibited at youth
commission lockups.
</P>
<P>
   And youth commission officials are making plans to build
hundreds of single-cell lockups rather than traditional dorm-style
housing, where gang activity can be hard to control. About 40
percent of the agency's 3,000 beds are single-bunk.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to ``make gang behavior a lot more costly,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate ingenuity
</P>
<P>
   In the adult prisons, such a policy has been longstanding. And
while prison officials say it has curbed most violence, and
probably thwarted gang recruitment efforts inside prison, the
gangs' illicit ingenuity continues.
</P>
<P>
   Though prison rules prohibit tattooing, convicts still practice
it,
</P>
<P>
   using electronic parts from a vending machine or a fan, a needle
or razor blade, and a dye made from burned soap or ink. Prison
officials say tattooing is less prevalent now than in the past, a
result of gang members seeking to avoid the punishment for
detection: solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   At the Coffield Unit, guards recently discovered that a gang
member had used a smuggled hacksaw blade to cut the bottom track
off his cell door so he could slip out to attack a rival. At the
Estelle High-Security Unit, a gang member used scouring powder on a
shoelace to do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spend all day, every day trying to come up with ways to
beat us,'' said Michael Upshaw, warden of the Coffield cellblocks
that house gang members. ``And we work just as hard to keep them
from doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the white-supremacist Texas Aryan Brotherhood
tried to turn itself into a religious group _ the Church of Aryan
Christian Heritage Inc. _ as a way to force prison officials to let
members meet and correspond unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, the Fraternal Order of the Aryan
Brotherhood was incorporated to promote an Aryan, Christian
culture. Its corporate address: the Terrell prison unit near
Livingston, in East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Even in prison, the gangs maintain a hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Cantu, listed by prison officials as a general in the
Mexican
</P>
<P>
   Mafia, occupies a cell at the Coffield Unit. But rather than
talk with
</P>
<P>
   visitors, sometimes even guards, he speaks through a spokesman _
another convict on his cellblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the reality,'' he tells a reporter, rattling his cell
door.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is all I got to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He directs a reporter up one floor to another convict who, he
says in Spanish, is his ``official spokesman.'' That convict
declines to talk.
</P>
<P>
   The gangs have leaders who make major decisions for members at
one or several prisons. Some are called ``general,'' some
``president.'' In some gangs, such as the Barrio Azteca at
Coffield, rank can be denoted by the number of ``plumas,'' Spanish
for feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Saldivar, a member of the Mexican Mafia incarcerated at the
Estelle High-Security Unit, explains the hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might put somebody on restriction where we won't let him go
out for rec. But we try to do it as democratically as we can. We
pass around an envelope with different opinions on it. Everybody
has a chance to speak their piece. . . . We try to do it like they
do it in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   While convicts deny it, prison officials say they also use the
</P>
<P>
   messaging system to order violent crimes outside prison,
including murder.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment unsealed July 20 in San Antonio alleges
that eight members of the Mexican Mafia carried out 14 murders in
Texas between 1994 and 1997, including one in a state prison in
Brazoria County, in a conspiracy hatched inside and outside of
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Such allegations can add to a gang's clout inside the violent
prison. ``The members of these gangs do what they are told to do,''
Warden Price says. ``If one of their leaders tells them to shut up,
they shut up, because if they don't, they know there's consequences
_ harsh consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, he says, explains why the Barrio Azteca cellblock in B
Wing ``is probably one of the cleanest . . . one of the quietest
cellblocks on the entire unit. It's all gangsters.

Black.''
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hollywood seems to be taking note of the fact that the century
is racing to its conclusion. And just like the Victorians at the
end of the 19th century, with their seances and their interest in
the occult, movie makers are preoccupied with some very strange
stuff.
 &HT;    Witness the current and future spate of movies dealing with
death, dying, angels, the afterlife, heaven and hell.
 &HT;    Just out is Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May Come,'' a
romantic drama complete with special effects, set in the afterlife.
Williams literally goes through hell to be reunited with his former
wife and soulmate (Annabella Sciorra).
 &HT;    He's in heaven after dying in a car crash. His wife, however, is
down below _ after killing herself from grief at losing her husband
and family. Robin makes the journey from paradise to the underworld
to rescue his true love.
 &HT;    In November, Brad Pitt plays the Grim Reaper himself in the very
offbeat ``Meet Joe Black,'' inspired by the l934 Frederic March
classic ``Death Takes a Holiday.'' Death assumes the face of the
recently killed Pitt, who while vacationing from his gruesome
duties falls madly in love with businessman Anthony Hopkins'
daughter (Claire Forlani) and discovers there's more to life than
death.
 &HT;    ``There was much talk of death on the set and how we would like
to die,'' recalls Hopkins, who last worked with Pitt in the movie
``Legends of the Fall.''
 &HT;    Pitt may seem rather unlikely casting for a fellow usually
depicted in a hooded robe carrying a scythe, but Hollywood seems to
have a penchant for turning death into a pretty face. Remember
Robert Redford as the unwelcome visitor to a very old lady played
by Gladys Cooper in an early episode of ``The Twilight Zone''?.
 &HT;    Director Martin Brest says they chose Pitt to avoid being
gruesome and heavy handed about the topic. ``I thought Brad had
that slightly otherworldly presence we needed,'' he told
Entertainment Weekly.
 &HT;    Nicole Kidman also takes a foray into the realm of the
supernatural, teaming up with Sandra Bullock in ``Practical
Magic,'' a spiritual tale about two women who happen to be New
England witches. The film, which opens Oct. 9, is based on Alice
Hoffman's novel.
 &HT;    Also upcoming (Nov. 6) is ``Jack Frost,'' with Michael Keaton as
a musician who dies in a Christmas car crash and comes back to life
... as a snowman. ``He's a funny, hip guy,'' says Keaton, ``who's
been transferred to a new body and finds cool things to do with
it.'' (That's cool as in snow, presumably). Keaton stepped into
this role after George Clooney, who took over from Keaton as
Batman, dropped out.
 &HT;    Earlier this year Nicholas Cage stepped out of the afterlife in
``City of Angels,'' as the angelic being who falls in love with
surgeon Meg Ryan and decides he wants to enjoy earthly joys with
her. He makes it back in the land of living _ just as Meg
unfortunately exits. The weepy romance was quite a hit among teens.
 &HT;    Woody Allen, for whom a preoccupation with dying is nothing new,
this past year gave us ``Deconstructing Harry,'' which included his
rather hilarious descent by elevator into hell, accompanied by Old
Nick himself, played by Billy Crystal.
 &HT;    Of course, Hollywood long ago learned that movies about dying
can be very profitable. Films like ``Ordinary People'' (1980),
``Terms of Endearment'' (1983) and ``Philadelphia'' (1993) all told
stories in which key characters died.
 &HT;    In the same vein, Meryl Streep plays a mother dying of cancer in
``One True Thing,'' based on Anna Quindlan's l995 novel. The
performance will certainly earn Streep another Oscar nomination for
best actress.
 &HT;    In the tearjerker ``Stepmom'' (opening in December), Susan
Sarandon is a wife and mother who discovers she's dying and
reluctantly coaches her ex's new wife Julia Roberts to step into
her shoes.
 &HT;    And in ``The Theory of Flight'' (opening, believe it or not, on
Christmas Day) Helena Bonham Carter is dying of a neurological
disease and must use a wheelchair. She wants to lose her virginity
before she dies _ and asks Kenneth Branagh to help her achieve her
goal. (This is the couple's first on screen pairing since their
offscreen romance went public.)
 &HT;    In ``Patch Adams,'' Robin Williams is back as a doctor who tries
to treat his terminally ill patients with humor, ``looking at death
lightheartedly,'' as the actor puts it. In l999 Williams will show
up in ``Jakob The Liar,'' this time a cheery story about death and
the Warsaw ghetto. ``Yeah--that was a nice double bill,'' he muses,
``to go from 'Dreams' to 'Jakob the Liar.'''
 &HT;    How are we expected to take all this dwelling on the dark side
without running from the theater in panic? Meryl Streep for one
thinks the answer is perfectly natural. ``We need to feel something
when we go to movies,'' she says. ``We need to cry ... It's OK.''
 &HT;    She cites ``Titanic'' as the ideal death movie. ``Leonardo
DiCaprio goes down in the depths and the kids cry and they put down
their money to go again and again.''

CLINTON'S PERSONAL SITUATION MAY BE WORSENED BY ECONOMIC CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Although few have so far linked President Clinton's
personal problems with the world's apparently looming economic
crisis, a connection could well exist _ to his detriment.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend, officials of the leading industrial nations met
in Washington and agreed that economic difficulties are worsening.
That may be doubly bad news for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone agrees his high ratings in the polls despite the
Monica Lewinsky scandal revelations stem from the widely held
belief that, whatever else may be said, the president is running
the country well. In turn, this is a judgment based largely on the
high employment and good times most Americans have experienced
during his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But what if a spreading international recession gives a hard
knock to the U.S. economy too? Suppose joblessness rises by 2 or 3
percentage points from its current 4.6 percent rate? Or the
American middle class finds that the large sums it thought it made
on Wall Street have turned into worthless paper.
</P>
<P>
   In such a scenario, popular feeling about the president could
change overnight. After all, many of his predecessors found
themselves suddenly out of favor when times got tough through no
fault of their own. Let's not forget that George Bush appeared
invincible in early 1991 following the Persian Gulf War until the
economy turned sour. Look what happened then.
</P>
<P>
   It is an indelible rule of U.S. politics that the president gets
the pats on the back when the economy is in top gear and the blame
when it runs out of gas. In neither case may he bear much, if any,
legitimate responsibility, of course. But what does it matter? To
this day, Bush is probably mystified over why the recession in
1991-92 made him a one-term president.
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere of deepening economic gloom, many Americans who
have been ready to overlook the president's sexual misconduct so
long as he seemed to do his elected job well might begin having
second thoughts. Citizens who face foreclosure of their mortgage or
loss of their job will direct at least some of their rancor at the
White House and will let the Congress know.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the Lewinsky case may well assume even greater
importance, and the president will be in worse trouble.

   STORM-INSURANCE (Pacifica, Calif.) _ Nine families in Pacifica

And there went their flood insurance. By ERIC BRAZIL.

John Anderson, of Chuckey, Tenn., a safety wizzard. By JAY
JOCHNOWITZ.

   JUNK-MAIL (San Antiono) _ Benjamin Franklin was only partly

advertisements and letters yields billions of dollars in sales each
year. By DAVID UHLER.
</P>
<P>
   FREER-GALLERY (Washington) _ A railroad man's job loss 120 years

and older programs. By MATT BEER.

   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ It is natural to want to hang a

RHODE ISLAND ESTATE OFFERS A MENAGERIE IN GREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK SOMMER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, R.I. _ Edward Scissorhands would have felt right at
home in the whimsical Green Animals Topiary Garden overlooking
Narragansett Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The imagination and artistry the besieged android displayed in
turning living plants into fascinating shapes and sizes can be seen
here in the spiraling shrubs, geometric forms, ornamental designs
and in the garden's main attraction, the menagerie. The animals _
which include a giraffe, bear and cub, elephant, boar and swan _
are set in blooming flower gardens among berry patches, rose
gardens and fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   Green Animals, which boasts 80 pieces of topiary, including 21
animals, is the oldest and most northern topiary garden in the
United States. The seven-acre estate dates to 1872, when Thomas
Brayton purchased the land and asked his gardener, Joseph Carreiro,
who had seen a topiary in the Andes, to create one.
</P>
<P>
   Carreiro was superintendent for 40 years, and then succeeded by
his son-in-law, George Mendonca, who worked there for the same
length of time, and added new topiary, before retiring in 1985. In
1972, Brayton's daughter, Alice, left Green Animals to the
Preservation Society of Newport County, which opened the area to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 visitors annually come to marvel at the topiaries,
according to grounds manager Crisse MacFadyen Genga.
</P>
<P>
   A few chartered busloads of tourists were among the visitors at
Green Animals one early autumn day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always tell people this is the best time to visit, and they
can't believe it,'' said Genga, who for the past 10 years has been
maintaining the garden's forms, including many that have been a
constant here for nearly a century. ``I think everyone is thinking
fall and we're still in full-blown summer. It's one of the best
times to come because we usually don't get a frost before Oct. 31,
when we close.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the topiaries can be viewed immediately upon arrival,
from the little green man standing opposite the main entrance and
gift shop, to the nearby curved archway that beckons visitors
forward to the garden.

   Immediately inside is a rose garden, and then fruit trees and
flower beds ornamented with boxwood that were bursting last weekend
with an abundance of colorful plantings, including black-eyed
Susans, verbena, Indian Princess calendulas, Florists' Whites
ageratums, snapdragons, Cherry Pinwheel zinnias and Marien Lemoines
heliotropes.
</P>
<P>
   The topiary gardener's technique is to lead young plants into
animal shapes by letting the branches grow, weave and tie them onto
a frame with fishing line, and cut back the errant growth until the
desired form takes shape.
</P>
<P>
   At Green Animals, the structures used to shape the plants are
well camouflaged. The animals are sculpted from California privet
and yew, and the other topiaries are from California privet and
English boxwood.
</P>
<P>
   Lined up on the perimeter of the area known as the Formal
Garden, where the earliest topiaries reside, are shrubs shaped into
various forms and sizes, including a trophy cup, basket and
oversize and overstuffed chair. There are also shrubs that are
cylindrically shaped, and the first of three spirally sculpted
shrubs that resemble a horticultural corkscrew.
</P>
<P>
   More archways lead to the oldest and most prominent animals,
which date back to 1912. A camel, elephant, lion and 14-foot
giraffe stand mounted atop the bushes from where they have been
formed. They reside among a colorful display of perennials and
annuals, including daisies, blue heliotropes and Confetti lantana.
</P>
<P>
   The upper topiary site, which was added in the 1940s, has a
number of animals bunched together, including a rabbit, horse and
rider, hen, ostrich, reindeer, boar and swan. The most recent
additions, created in the 1970s, are a large, soft-looking bear
with cub, unicorn, dog and rooster.
</P>
<P>
   The animals and other topiary found at Green Animals differ
markedly, according to Genga, from those found at Disney World and
Disneyland, which have helped to popularize this form of landscape
design. The topiaries here are growing in the ground, she pointed
out, while the Disney topiaries often use ficus or ivy around the
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the second animal grounds are an array of horticultural
sights, including an herb garden, gourd arbor, berry patch,
vegetable garden, children's garden, 30-foot reed grass and a fish
pond.
</P>
<P>
   Also open to the public is the white clapboard home once used by
the Braytons, which is bordered by a wide veranda from which
visitors can move to and fro in rocking chairs while gazing out
over the bay. Inside, the 10 rooms, with original furnishings, are
open for viewing, along with collections on the second floor of
turn-of-the-century toys, dolls and dollhouses, and games.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the toys are a tin Ferris wheel and 19th-century
horse-drawn hook-and-ladder truck. One custom-made dollhouse,
befitting the excesses of the rich on a small island known for the
princely estates of nearby Newport, had electrical wiring and a
functional doorbell.
</P>
<P>
   There are also several battle-scene dioramas on the second
floor, most with miniature tin or cast-aluminum soldiers, such as
one that depicts British infantrymen at war with Zulu warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Green Animals is one of several topiaries open to the public on
the East Coast. Others include the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in
Miami and the Magnolia Plantation Gardens in Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The history of topiaries in the United States, however, is a
short one compared to Europe. The word topiarius in Latin means
garden, and topiary gardens can be traced back to ancient Rome,
when Pliny the Younger, who lived from A.D. 62 to A.D. 113, had
one.
</P>
<P>
   Topiaries were commonly owned by royalty and landed gentry in
England and Europe 300 years ago, and today they remain commonplace
in Britain. Topiaries can also be found in a number of other
countries, including France, Italy, Japan, Australia and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Grounds manager Genga said Green Animals saw a surge of interest
after ``Edward Scissorhands'' played movie theaters. Not
surprisingly, it's one of her favorite films.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our hero. That was a great movie, and a lot of people
responded to that when they came to visit,'' Genga said. ``Oh, God.
It's a wonderful movie. I've seen it many, many times.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The Green Animals Topiary Garden is located on Cory's Lane off
state Route 114 in Portsmouth. It is open May 1 to Oct. 31 from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. Tickets are $8 for adults, $5 for students and $3.50
for children. For information, call the Preservation Society of
Newport, 401-847-1000.)

   Talk about an inspiring story! Ken Hakuta has become famous for
the Wacky Wall Walker, those slime-covered plastic creatures that
ooze down vertical surfaces. But Hakuta didn't even come up with
the idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a tiny
fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire!
</P>

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a

$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the

with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own

about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   My father was a young and energetic broker employed by a big
textile company, an immigrant's son prospering for the first time,
when his boss summoned him one day and said that because of
corporate setbacks, my father would have to accept a wage cut.
</P>
<P>
   He refused.
</P>
<P>
   Impetuously, he and another young broker resigned, rented an
office on Worth Street, and within a year they were earning more
than they ever had. They not only brokered trades in cotton cloth,
but purchased cloth themselves, gambling on resale at quick
profits.
</P>
<P>
   My father was an entrepreneur or, more precisely, he exhibited
some of the characteristics of an entrepreneur. The concept _ to
break with routine, to innovate, to seize an opportunity, to
develop something new _ is as old as capitalism. But the word
itself and the characteristics it suggests have become popular
among Americans only in the last 15 years as everyone, not just
immigrants and their children, struggles for a place in a rapidly
changing, increasingly competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is spending billions of dollars on the
restless, entrepreneurial endeavor to develop popular new products
or to rejigger old ones to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Only a volatile stock market threatens to curtail this energy by
depriving entrepreneurs, particularly small entrepreneurs, of some
of the financing they need to carry out their ideas. Big companies
have more cash savings to draw on and easier access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurial activity became a concern to the general
public in the 1980s, when we all thought that the United States was
falling behind, and that the rest of the world, particularly Japan,
would sink us,'' said William J. Baumol, an economist and historian
at New York University. ``As soon as people started worrying about
this, they said that Japan was entrepreneurial and America had lost
the spirit of entrepreneurship. And we began self-consciously to
reacquire that spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   My father, getting started in the 1920s, never thought of
himself as an entrepreneur. For him, the entrepreneurial spirit, a
term coming into vogue in his final years, resided exclusively in
energetic small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Small business has a role, of course. Starting a business, being
your own boss, risking your savings, operating with high energy _
all these characteristics appear in the evolving definition of the
entrepreneurial spirit, first described in the early 1800s by
Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist.
</P>
<P>
   But innovation and invention are its essence. And while a Sam
Walton (Wal-Mart) or a Steven Jobs (Apple) or a James Clark and
Marc Andreessen (Netscape) still emerge from the ranks of the
lone-wolf entrepreneurs, innovation and invention occur as often
today in big companies as in small ones. More often, probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that entrepreneurial innovation has
become the prime competitive weapon, and industry can no longer
wait for the occasional geniuses to come along with something
new,'' Baumol said. ``Companies have had to routinize invention and
innovation. And the big companies have the money to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical corporation, certainly
does. Its scientists, who develop drugs at Merck's laboratories,
are encouraged to take on the additional task of scouting outside
the company for promising new research or new technologies that
might lead to the development of a future drug.
</P>
<P>
   When they find this promising outside research they make their
case to a Merck board for money to finance or to buy the outside
research or to form a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entrepreneur to me,'' said Bennett M. Shapiro, the
executive vice president of Merck's worldwide basic research, ``is
someone who picks up something not going on at Merck, but is
important to the future development of a drug, and then makes the
case for why we should fund a relationship, as if he were an
independent entrepreneur appealing to venture capitalists for
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Merck's 5,000 scientists are so entrepreneurial, but
those who are, and succeed in bringing valuable research to Merck,
get handsome payoffs in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the entrepreneurial flexibility now evident in big
companies, millions of Americans appear to believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies; that is,
owner-operated companies with fewer than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The great attention focused on Silicon Valley start-ups feeds
this view. So do venture capitalists, who buy into the start-ups,
hoping that their innovative products will run up big sales,
quickly raising the value of the venture capitalist's investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration and the National Federation of
Independent Business, a powerful Washington lobbying group
representing small companies, also foster the perspective that
small companies are the chief source of entrepreneurial activity.
For this reason, among several others, small companies should get
government support in the form of special tax breaks and special
exemptions from some regulations. Or so the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rawest sense of entrepreneurial,'' said William Dennis,
the federation's director of research, ``if I establish a new firm,
I have taken an entrepreneurial act. I have acted in the belief
that I know something others don't, and I am exploiting an
advantage others do not have.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an appealing thought at a time when self-employment is a
big phenomenon, particularly among immigrants and among workers who
have been laid off by corporations. By this definition, a Korean
immigrant, for example, is entrepreneurial if he sets up a flower
kiosk on a street corner, acting on an insight that, in his view, a
competitor on the opposite corner has failed to grasp. He is acting
on the belief that he will draw more customers because his new
kiosk is closer than his competitor's to a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists agree that starting a business is
entrepreneurial. But if the Korean immigrant's kiosk survives and
he then presides over a routine daily operation, as most small
business owners do, is he still entrepreneurial?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, unless he regains that status by giving his
operation another entrepreneurial kick. David Allen, who founded
Allen Associates in the Boston suburb of Ayer, fits this pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after earning an engineering degree 35 years ago, Allen
began a company to manufacture and sell a wire-and-sponge device
that he had invented and patented to keep corsages moist. The
device sold, and for 20 years, he earned a steady five-figure
income. His entrepreneurial start-up faded into a
nonentrepreneurial, day-to-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   When their two sons became teen-agers in the early '80s, Marie
Allen joined her husband, bringing to the enterprise a background
in, and a yen for, marketing. She soon hit on a way to increase
sales revenues from the 600 wholesale florists who were her
husband's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to regional trade shows, Allen said: ``We look for
promising new products that people are trying to introduce into the
floral industry, but cannot manage to sell. Marie takes them to
market with our products; we currently are selling 25 different
items to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Annual revenue for the Allens has nearly quadrupled to $1.1
million from $300,000, when Mrs. Allen came aboard 15 years ago,
and it has reawakened the family business.
</P>
<P>
   From Adam Smith's day, the entrepreneurial spirit, in one guise
or another, has been a huge source of change and expansion for the
capitalist market system. The great early-20th century economist,
Joseph A. Schumpeter, gave the concept its modern, expansive twist,
defining an entrepreneur as someone who breaks with routine.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurial function, he wrote, ``does not essentially
consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the
conditions which the enterprise exploits. It consists in getting
things done'' right down to ``making a success of a particular kind
of sausage or toothbrush.''

<P>
   WOODSIDE, Calif. _ John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture
capitalist, scans the room at Bucks, a folksy cafe in this affluent
bedroom community, and notes that he recognizes about half the
financiers, hardware engineers and software hackers who are seated.
</P>
<P>
   Shoch is doing what he does best. He calls it ``surfing'':
looking for the next big thing in the nation's technology
heartland. He is a key player in a remarkably efficient system that
brings together vast pools of capital and good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs everywhere in Silicon Valley that the region is
no longer an unconnected bunch of competitors located near the
Stanford University campus, which gave birth to the valley's first
company, Hewlett-Packard Company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, changing jobs in Silicon Valley Inc. is now as simple
as turning into a new driveway on the way to work, or as simple an
idea as the newly created garage.com, which matches entrepreneurs
with venture-capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   A walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto, increasingly the
valley's brain center, will take you past the brand-new offices of
Accel Partners, one of the valley's premier venture-capital firms.
The partners are upstairs; downstairs,
``entrepreneurs-in-residence'' are busy incubating start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   This financing mechanism has created the semiconductor chip, the
digital watch, video games, the personal computer and most recently
the commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Time in the valley seems compressed. This is evident from the
exploding megahertz ratings of microprocessor chips to the
ballooning megabyte storage capacities of memory chips and disk
drives, making everything move faster at an ever-increasing rate.
Around the valley it is best described as living on Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   For Shoch, whose firm, Asset Management, has just completed a
$100 million-plus fund, these are both heady and nervous times.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing, in Shoch's parlance, means catching the next big wave
of technology innovation. And despite the fact that there are more
and more billions of venture-capital dollars flowing into the
valley each year, it is complicated. (The recent stock-market
jitters have left venture capitalists here nervous but still
enthusiastic; in short, holding their breath.)
</P>
<P>
   While the pace of change has become predictable, charting the
direction of change is still an art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'll paddle furiously to catch a wave that fails
to materialize,'' Shoch said. ``While at other times the wave will
appear suddenly and you'll find yourself paddling just as furiously
to try to catch it before it leaves you behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley venture capitalists have made their
reputation by finding and riding a certain wave. For example, in
1989 John Hummer and Ann Winblad established the first
venture-capital firm to focus exclusively on software companies,
just when the software industry was blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   And there are legendary figures, like John Doerr, a partner at
Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers. Doerr has had the knack of
making the best investments spanning three eras: personal
computers, workstations and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, everyone was convinced that the next big
thing would be interactive digital television. The vision: Happy
families would sit in their living rooms in front of their TVs and
bank, shop, communicate with other people and be entertained. The
living room has so far not proven to be the right place for
interacting with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Missteps like these have led to absurdities like a Florida
market trial in which a Silicon Valley company tried to hook up TV
sets to computer workstations that had been fine-tuned to pump
movies and digital information into homes. The concept failed
because it cost more than many families want to spend: $25,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, of course, is that in Silicon Valley the term
``visionary'' usually describes a job title and not an ability. If
you pressure venture capitalists over a meal at Il Fornaio in Palo
Alto, they will confess that they expect a shakeout and acknowledge
that they are concerned about the huge capital flows coming into
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence can be seen in the remarkable appreciation of
the value of new deals _ there is just too much money chasing too
few great ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment the risks seem to be outweighed by the
incredible opportunities inspired by the emergence of cyberspace.
While everyone was looking the other way, the Internet sneaked up
on Silicon Valley and sent the venture-capital community racing to
finance start-ups like Netscape Communications, Yahoo, Excite,
Infoseek and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has cranked up the valley's economy to
a feverish pitch. Companies like Apple Computer and Sun
Microsystems have been reinvigorated by the boom in Internet
commerce. There are so many new companies being formed that initial
public offerings are no longer the typical outcome for a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than five times as many companies created each
year as there are available IPO dollars. Consequently, acquisition
has become an endgame for most start-ups, according to Technologic
Partners, a firm that monitors venture capital in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn has made the valley even more of a technology
hothouse, attracting a new kind of venture backer _ large
technology companies like AT&AMP;T, Lucent, Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Intel executives once referred to the valley's
venture community as ``vulture capitalists'' because they would
entice employees away to start to new chip ventures, the company is
now running the valley's largest venture fund, valued at more than
$300 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the boom-time atmosphere, there are signs that the
Internet wave is cresting and that Silicon Valley is entering one
of those periods between new technologies and new industries.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is no certainty about the next big thing after the
Internet, but everyone is looking. Is it wireless data or is the
time finally right for interactive digital television?
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the valley is on the brink of an epochal
shift, perhaps from the world of electronic to optical computing.
Such a shift has been predicted for many years by some of the
valley's best thinkers. The world of optical computing is much more
in tune with the communications-rich future that now seems all
around.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom here, however, is that any new invention is
subject to the ``15-year'' rule: It usually takes at least 15 years
for a new technology to make it from the laboratory to the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where timing is everything _ the right investment at
the wrong moment can be just as disastrous as making the wrong bet
_ a venture capitalist can be left with a lot of sleepless nights,
even in the best of times.

   EVANSTON, Ill. _ As the sun begins its pink descent behind the
neo-Gothic spire of Deering Library, two barefoot students lazily
toss a Frisbee across a great expanse of lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Four flights up, in Northwestern University's Leverone Hall, 18
students and a professor are gathered around a classroom table.
</P>
<P>
   The talk this July evening is not of Dante or of the
pre-Socratics. It is of angel investors, price-earnings ratios and
what it means to work for a company so young that its founders
still have no desks or no telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The students, led by Steven Rogers, a clinical professor of
management, are spending their summer working for start-up
companies in the area in what may turn into full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All the students are in the master's of management program of
Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, one of scores of
business schools that over the last five years have built programs
and majors in entrepreneurship studies, an arresting mix of the
plainly pragmatic and the utterly ephemeral.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by student and alumni demand, no field is hotter today in
business studies than that of entrepreneurship. Whereas a
generation ago the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune
500 company and climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent
desire nowadays seems to be to come up with a marketable idea,
start a company and work for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murray Low, who directs entrepreneurship studies at
Columbia University, scholarship in the field is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s there were only a few scholarly journals
devoted to new businesses. Today there are 26, most of them started
in the last five years. In 1980, there were 18 entrepreneurship
chairs at business schools. Today there are more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Katz of St. Louis University, who has been tracking this
growth, says that in a 1991 study of the approximately 300
accredited business schools in the country, a couple dozen were
found to offer some course work in entrepreneurship. Today, about
120 of them offer it as a major.
</P>
<P>
   While defining entrepreneurship studies remains problematic,
scholars in the field agree that its sudden popularity has several
roots. First, the corporate downsizing of the '80s changed the view
that a good corporate job meant long-term security.
</P>
<P>
   Second, technology and globalization have changed the way the
world does business. A product's shelf life has been greatly
reduced, and challenges from remote places mean that companies need
flexibility, which is a challenge for large, formal hierarchies of
traditional corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, scholars say, young people have grown up in an
environment that emphasizes independence and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurship is really about the three P's: pride, passion
and perseverance,'' said A. Barry Merkin, a clinical professor of
entrepreneurship at Kellogg. ``It's about risk-taking, boldness and
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The best analogy, Merkin noted, is to sports. ``Intuitive
qualities are essential, but few can reach real heights without
coaching,'' he said. ``There are basic things to learn, like
accounting and finance, but also narrower areas like writing a
business plan, raising capital. I also try to give my students a
feeling of what it is like to go through something like this, the
tensions and frustrations, because folks who go into this without
realizing what they are doing will face nervous breakdowns, heart
attacks and divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not matters, either the business plans or the heart
attacks, most academics with Ph.D.'s want to teach or to study.
There is a lack of reliable data on start-up companies, and without
data it is hard to produce rigorous scholarship, the grist of
academic careers.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a split, because alumni are donating truckloads
of dollars to set up centers and chairs in entrepreneurship, yet
there are no scholars to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   New York University is a good example. Its Stern School of
Business has four endowed chairs of entrepreneurship, two unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see entrepreneurship as a word in search of a meaning in the
academic sense,'' said George Daly, Stern's dean. ``Academics sort
themselves into these little silos, and entrepreneurship is not
easily matched for them. But the role being played by small,
innovative enterprises in our society is phenomenal and should be
studied. The challenge is to persuade academics to look beyond
their own boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Business schools are increasingly turning to practitioners
rather than scholars to teach entrepreneurship, either alone or
paired with a more traditional professor. That is why Merkin of
Kellogg is called a ``clinical professor,'' on the model of medical
school professors who are M.D.s rather than Ph.D.'s. This, too, has
caused tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, tenured professors consider businessmen
without Ph.D's to be lower-life forms,'' said Kenneth P. Morse, the
founder of high-tech ventures and managing director of the
Entrepreneurship Center at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Sloan School of Management. ``But there were 1 million
start-ups in the world last year, and anyone who wants to be
involved in such a start-up has a lot to learn _ how to pick the
funding, how to give a raise, how not to run out of money. This is
different from what used to be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Young scholars are beginning to take the plunge. One is Paul A.
Gompers, an associate professor of business administration at
Harvard Business School. Gompers acknowledges the difficulty in
gathering data but says the field is too exciting to allow that to
be a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get data from private consulting firms or through large
pension funds or endowments that provide access to their files,''
Gompers said. ``A lot of it is hand-collected. I'm putting together
data on 1,300 firms, collecting a complete financial history, their
boards of directors, scales of compensation to study how they
operate and grow. I have hired 10 to 15 research assistants during
the course of this project over the last two and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much of what goes on at entrepreneurship centers
today consists of students going through the motions of setting up
new ventures, and sometimes actually doing the ventures. Business
school has turned into a kind of laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Business-plan competitions, both local and national, have grown
rapidly in scale with students presenting their plans to venture
capitalists and competing for donated prize money to help them set
up companies.
</P>
<P>
   One such winner was Evan Schumacher, a 29-year-old native of
Boston who finished at Northwestern this spring. His plan called
for setting up a software company that tracks global shipping,
freight and customs management for international firms.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher won the Kellogg competition and took his plan to
Austin, Tex., in May for national finals. He was a finalist, and as
he walked off the stage after his presentation, his wireless
microphone still clipped to his lapel, a man in the audience
approached him and asked how much he needed.
</P>
<P>
   The man became the company's first angel investor, in for
$250,000. The company, Celarix, was born at the end of June in
Chicago. So far, it has raised $500,000 from investors and is
planning to raise another $1 million to $2 million from venture
capitalist firms. A third employee will join the company this
month.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WAYNE, N.J. _ Drive west from Manhattan, through the Lincoln
Tunnel and into the thick of one of the many commercial
bloodstreams that feeds the suburban beast engulfing New York City.
Go about 20 miles from the Hudson River to a nondescript office
building that overlooks a 14-theater multiplex and a warehouse-size
Costco. That is where you'll find, on the third floor, a modest
little company called Audible Inc., which just happens to have
outsize ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unlikely location, certainly, for a three-year-old
Internet start-up, one that hopes to create a big audience for
something completely different: custom audio information delivered
on demand over the Web to portable devices you can listen to any
time and anywhere, say, while jogging or driving to work.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the guy who founded the company, Donald Katz, who is
46 and the author of three highly acclaimed nonfiction books, is a
rather unlikely entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Katz never marched to anyone's beat but his own. In starting
Audible, he drew on his own experiences as a writer combined with
the thirst to create something new from the seemingly limitless
potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audible seeks to wed the oldest of human technologies, the
spoken word, with the newest of technologies,'' he said with
characteristic ardor. ``We want to be a leader in teaching the
Internet to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating that vision into a successful business will not be
easy. Audible is losing plenty of money.
</P>
<P>
   The company has about 35 employees, its own portable player and
a Web site (www.audible.com) where users can immediately download
from a selection of 16,000 hours of copyrighted audio files
containing everything from traditional read-aloud books like Frank
McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes'' ($9) to bundles of advice ($3 to $13)
from the Harvard Business Review and such. For all its success in
building a new infrastructure, however, the company is just
beginning to attract paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Katz is accustomed to taking risks. For two decades, from the
time he left graduate school at the London School of Economics in
1975, Katz was a free-lance journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Katz turned his attention to money and
business. Originally from Chicago, he decided to write a book about
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Company, his hometown giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, the once-great store of the American middle class and one
of the most secretive corporations in the country, was in the midst
of an immense crisis. Katz persuaded Edward Telling, its chief
executive, to give him carte blanche access to the company. The
book, ``The Big Store,'' took six years to research and write.
</P>
<P>
   Katz followed with two other books that also required him to
open closed doors, one a look at the post-World War middle-class
experience told through a single extended family that revealed its
most intimate secrets, and the other an inside look at Nike and its
reclusive chairman, Phil Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In business, surprisingly, Katz did find a subject worthy of
epic treatment. And he discovered he had a taste for it.
</P>
<P>
   With Ed Lau, his college roommate who moved into the computer
industry, Katz began to develop an idea for a business that would
deliver radio programs and audio books through the Internet. His
next book project, on the convergence of digital technologies, was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I couldn't write into reality,'' Katz said.
``I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a fresh outlet for the powers of persuasion that had
opened so many doors in his writing career. The first big convert
was Tim Mott, now a wealthy private investor in Ketchum, Idaho, who
is renowned in Silicon Valley as a co-founder of Electronic Arts,
the computer-game maker, and Macromedia, a software company
specializing in multimedia graphic-design applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls all the time about start-up ideas, and I probably
look at least one business plan a week,'' Mott said. ``Over the
course of five years, I've seen, maybe, four that I wanted to
commit money and time. This was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mott as chairman, they made the round of venture-capital
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's business experience and Don's visionary ideas were a
powerful combination,'' said Kevin Compton, a partner at Kleiner
Perkins who became their chief backer there. ``Three minutes into
conversation you could just feel his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Audible is built around the premise that lots of people are
willing to pay regularly to fill their time _ on the go _ with
constantly changing packages of verbal packages of entertainment,
news and practical advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising is the potential for pumping millions of
mobile workers full of management information, corporate training
and ``time-shifted'' business news while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   To make all that possible, Audible had to design its own
portable player. It is roughly the size and shape of an electric
razor, holds two hours of audio and plugs into a personal computer
through a cradle similar to one used in hand-held computers. People
can carry the battery-powered gadget anywhere, listen to it through
headphones or play clips in a car stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Programs are stored on a computer, ready to refill the player as
soon as it is returned to its cradle, which remains attached to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the player is also an Achilles heel. It
is relatively expensive, costing $200 as a stand-alone purchase.
Two hours is not enough storage time, particularly since lots of
audio books run three to four hours. And it is not easy for the
technologically challenged to try.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome these drawbacks, Audible is developing a
second-generation player with greater abilities and is exploring
new pricing plans similar to those used to sell mobile-phone
services, in which buyers would receive the player at a steep
reduction if they sign up for a subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Relying mostly on word of mouth, Audible says it has attracted
more than 5,000 customers and shipped about 3,000 players. Those
using the player spend an average of about $20 a month on fresh
content.
</P>
<P>
   But Audible's real ace in the hole is not the player but the
rights it has painstakingly sewn up with dozens of content
providers. It is introducing new programs _ from an audio digest of
The Wall Street Journal to National Public Radio's ``Fresh Air''
program _ that will be sent automatically to a subscriber's
computer.
</P>
<P>
   And it will adapt all Audible's products so they can be played
on a variety of portable devices, beginning with the hand-held
organizers powered by Microsoft's Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent stock-market turmoil, Audible's outside
investors, who own about 56 percent of the company (the founders
and employees own the rest) remained cautious about going public,
insisting they do not intend to sell stock until the company is
generating a growing and predictable revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good thing, given the uncertainty about even the most
promising Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no in-between,'' said Paul Hawken, the author of
``Growing a Business'' and an entrepreneur who co-founded Smith &AMP;
Hawken, the mail-order garden-supply company. ``Either Audible will
be a billion-dollar-plus company or it will be wallpaper. I suspect
it will be the former.''

<P>
   Whenever I look at my bank statement, I think of Ken Hakuta, aka
Dr. Fad. Best known as the inventor of the Wacky Wall Walker, he
made some $20 million from slime-covered plastic creatures that
ooze down vertical surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come up with the
idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a tiny fraction
of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire and is a prominent
figure on the lecture and convention circuits.
</P>
<P>
   With one simple idea he achieved the American dream _ money and
fame.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless Hakutas _ inventors of the pet rock, sliced
bread, the rolling lint remover, the better mousetrap. And I want
to be one. But I'm too busy writing articles like this one to
follow up on any get-rich-quick schemes, and I can't seem to put
the energy into starting a corporation dedicated to carrying out my
ideas. So I have decided to give them away.
</P>
<P>
   1. Some clever wag has beaten me to the idea of portable gyms:
trainers who park outside your home in vans full of exercise
equipment. But no one has come up with portable baby sitters. Tired
of having to constantly call home during a dinner date to check on
your child or to leave a movie early to deal with a small
emergency? With a portable baby sitter, your child can follow you
around on your date or outing in an RV with toys, a bed and a
licensed sitter. Now you can look in on your little one during
theater intermissions and deal with a crisis without abandoning
your plans.
</P>
<P>
   2. Copyright millennium slogans or register Web site domain
names that corporations will eventually want to buy from you. Some
examples of slogans include ``A new car for a new millennium'' or
``Relief for the morning after the millennium.'' For Web sites, you
could try to cut yourself in on a piece of Mr. Hakuta's millions
and register a wackywallwalker.com.
</P>
<P>
   3. The inventions of tow ropes and chairlifts revolutionized
skiing, enabling entrepreneurs to open ridiculously overpriced ski
resorts. So where are the surf resorts? Tow ropes, jet skis and
above-water conveyer belts could drop surfers off at their favorite
wave and save them from exhausting, time-consuming paddling. Of
course, some surfers will complain that paddling to the wave is
integral to the sport, but soon surfing anywhere besides a resort
will seem as antiquated as hiking uphill to ski.
</P>
<P>
   4. The best entrepreneurs come up with products nobody has heard
of and then persuade the public that it can't live without them.
Here is my candidate: by developing a system to measure the sense
of smell (akin to the eye-chart test), an entrepreneur can make a
fortune by inventing smelling aids for people with deficient
olfactory nerves.
</P>
<P>
   5. Create a line of address books, cell phones, wallets and
purses that, like cordless telephones, beep when they're lost. Even
better, for obsessive message-checkers not satisfied with pagers,
devise a key chain or a small toy that lights up whenever their
answering machine takes a call. In addition, a huge market has
opened up in Japan for cellular phone accessories that could be
exploited in America: different styles of straps and antennae,
trinkets to make phones ring differently and lights that flash when
the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   6. Become an apartment broker in a competitive city like New
York or San Francisco. But instead of representing realtors or
buildings, start a trustworthy company that represents renters.
They can tell you exactly what they want, then you find it and pay
a deposit to reserve the apartment until they can see it. To corner
the market, you could pay apartment owners a fee to give you a copy
of their listing on the same day they send it to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   7. There are sperm banks, but no public egg banks. These would
be for working women who don't want to have children until they
retire. This way, women can finally stop the ticking of that
biological clock by depositing an egg when they're in their 20s or
30s. The egg will then be preserved until a woman is ready to rear
a child.
</P>
<P>
   8. The best ice cream in the world is Bertillon, a French
delicacy with flavors so precise that anyone marketing it in
America could revolutionize the ice-cream business the way Jelly
Bellys cornered the jelly bean market. This is not a joke, but a
way to a better society.
</P>
<P>
   9. One reason people drive when they're drunk is because they
don't want to have to take a cab home and then wake up in the
morning without their car. By creating an 800-IM-DRUNK line in
car-oriented cities like Los Angeles and Dallas, this problem could
be solved. The service would actually drive a chauffeur to a
restaurant, club or house to take the inebriated client home (or
even to another bar or party) in his or her own car.
</P>
<P>
   10. I was recently notified that someone had taken my idea of
making custom fortune cookies for parties. But kids' dolls could be
personalized in a similar way by having a talking toy like Tickle
Me Elmo or Teletubby and replacing its voice chip with a homemade
one. It could either have personalized messages (``Get to work,
George'') or just undoll-like comments. (``Gee whiz, cover up your
bellybutton, it looks obscene.'')
</P>
<P>
   Space prohibits me from elaborating on more ideas. But with
hundreds of thousands of people reading this, it seems very likely
that within the next 24 hours these baker's-dozen recommendations
will soon be patented and put into development.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy,'' Richards said. ``I was making money, but I
couldn't talk to anyone about the great show I saw last night or
the great record I found. It was a job.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1992, she started her own company: Thrill Jockey Records,
named after a gang of delinquents in a B movie. It would release
music she cared about and let the musicians decide what to release,
how to package it and run their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a company where the artists' expectations and the
labels' abilities were in line,'' she said. ``I don't think major
labels are inherently evil or out to destroy the world. I just
don't happen to use music that fits their system.''
</P>
<P>
   That music, Richards said, is simply ``what I like.'' Thrill
Jockey is a leading outlet for what some critics have named
``post-rock'': instrumentals that elude categorization as jazz, pop
tunes or dance music. The label's best-selling band is Tortoise,
whose most recent album has sold nearly 100,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey has also released albums by the
neo-Appalachian duo Freakwater, two women who sing about hard
times; the electronic group Oval, which has built compositions on
the sounds of skipping CDs; and the Nerve, a peppy alternative-rock
band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of freaky, left-of-center stuff that she puts out,
but at the same time there's a big enough audience so that she can
make a living,'' said Nic Harcourt, the creative music director of
KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif., and the host of the station's
``Morning Becomes Eclectic,'' a program that the music business on
the West Coast follows closely.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, Thrill Jockey has released 60 albums (both as CDs
and old-fashioned vinyl LPs), singles and EPs. All but three
releases have broken even or turned a profit. By contrast, 80
percent to 90 percent of albums from major labels post losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey works on a grass-roots scale, seeking sales in
thousands rather than millions; its typical release breaks even
with sales of 1,500 CDs and 500 LPs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Thrill Jockey's profit was $183,000, and while that
is probably less than what Columbia Records spends on catering, it
is a success story in independent rock.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Richards, who is 33 years old, did everything
herself, from signing talent to lining up band interviews. Now
Thrill Jockey has three other full-time employees and one part
timer and is about to buy its own small building.
</P>
<P>
   Richards started Thrill Jockey while working four days a week at
Pier Platters, an alternative-rock record store in Hoboken, N.J.
She ran the label from her third-floor walk-up apartment on Avenue
C in Manhattan, carrying mail-order CDs to UPS because she didn't
ship enough to qualify for a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Her capital was $20,000 from her grandmother, $10,000 from her
father and the $5,000 from her savings account; she has never
needed another infusion. Her business advisers were people who had
started their own labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly asking advice from people: cheaper places to
press things, ways to cut corners,'' she said. ``One thing about
independently distributed record labels is that you don't get this
competitive feeling. As long as you are willing to reciprocate with
information, people are happy to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Richards moved from New York to Chicago, where her main
manufacturer and distributor, Touch and Go, is based. Rent and
taxes are considerably lower than they are in New York, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent companies are stepping stones for bands that
hope to be discovered by major labels. By contract, the smaller
labels then share in the profits from the major-label releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to spend my time as a farm label,'' Richards
said. ``From a business standpoint, it would be better to have
bands bound to contracts so I'd get a piece of their future. But I
don't want to make money from a system I don't support.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey makes unusually generous deals with musicians.
Once an album breaks even, the label and the musicians each get 50
percent of the gross receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the net comes down, they actually get more than me,''
Richards said. Contracts are often literally a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Richards chooses bands that, she thinks, can benefit from the
scale of her company and will stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If becoming famous is their primary focus, then we're not the
right label for them,'' she said. ``But if they want to continue to
make music and live off that, then that's a goal we can achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey records most albums for under $3,000, one
three-hundredth of what a band like U2 spends, and advertises
sparingly. Video clips tend to be made by friends of the bands or
as projects by art students, though they have been shown
occasionally on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey depends largely on the unpaid promotion of college
radio stations and reviews in the press, but it also uses club disk
jockeys and skateboarding magazines to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each record is totally different,'' Richards said. ``It's not
as if I sold a really great new garbage can or a nice clock. Your
most popular band this year could be completely unpopular next
year. My company has to be flexible and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my company to stay in business and do well,'' Richards
said. ``But the creative stuff was always the motivation that
sparked it. It wasn't, I see a way to make money better. It was, I
can make this artist's experience better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot of work,'' Richards added. ``But it never feels
like a job.''

<P>
   Even as children, many of them spotted a business angle nobody
else did, and milked it for all it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
figured he could make more money if he hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected and even had the presence of mind to ply his trade
outside his neighborhood so that the mothers wouldn't catch on to
his scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was out of high school, Blue owned and operated two
drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy growing up in a village in India 100 miles north of New
Delhi, Vinod Gupta, the founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of
business information in Omaha with projected sales this year of
$250 million, caught frogs at a swamp and sold them to a research
laboratory for lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   In college, he rented entire passenger-train cars to make a
36-hour trip to New Delhi, and then sold seat tickets individually
for a quick 25 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Not every successful business owner can boast of such an early
flair for salesmanship. But even those who drifted or were pushed
into entrepreneurial careers seem to have a natural bent for
seizing opportunities that make competitors wonder why on earth
they didn't think of that themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what defines them? They are an eclectic lot who operate
ventures that vary from grocery stores to Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Jonovic, a consultant in Cleveland who has advised
hundreds of family businesses, says he never fails to be astonished
by the ``raw diversity'' of American entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at some of them and you ask, `My God, how'd that
happen?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that prides itself on individualism and counts
literally millions of entrepreneurs, it is a question worth asking.
Small businesses, roughly defined as ventures controlled by their
founders and taking in less than $250 million in revenue a year,
are an enormous force in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   But what drives their owners to strike out on their own rather
than take refuge in the predictability and perks of salaried jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The experts, of course, have their views. Jonovic says true
entrepreneurs are marked by a combination of ``tunnel-vision
dedication'' and supreme self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   David G. Winter, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, said they are propelled by a zeal to excel at whatever
they do, a trait he calls ``achievement motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this optimism, this exuberance, this boldness,''
Winter said, which can take the form of restlessness, especially if
their business grows into a larger, bureaucratic organization they
can't control. If that happens, he said, ``they may be so unable to
deal with it that they get dismissed by their board. Or they may
quit and start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said entrepreneurs often display a streak of
authoritarianism because they believe their method is the only way
to do things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing their best is what matters most to them, as opposed to a
concern with friendship or power,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs, he added, tend to come from middle-class
backgrounds, not blue-collar homes or wealthy families, ``which
still view small business as a step downward into vulgar trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonovic said that many entrepreneurs are tightfisted, not out of
greed but because each dollar they earn represents a small fraction
of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a successful entrepreneur who ended up in a nursing
home and wouldn't pay for a private room because he wanted to keep
his estate above $1 million,'' Jonovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs themselves cite a long list of self-defining
characteristics and attributes: decisiveness, resilience, focus, a
love of battle, a penchant for risk-taking, workaholism, good
social skills.
</P>
<P>
   But as they recount their histories, two core themes leap out,
flip sides of the same coin: They want to be their own boss, and
they show an uncanny knack for detecting opportunities that others
missed.
</P>
<P>
   For most entrepreneurs, it all begins with the realization that
working for somebody else just isn't a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go it alone can be liberating, but it can also
be scary because it means cutting off the corporate safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Eric B. Segal, the president of the Kenzer Corp., an
executive-recruiting firm in New York, recalls the near-panic he
and his partner, Robert D. Kenzer, felt in the early days of
running their company in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Segal had been a corporate executive in the retail industry, but
quit a high-paying job after he got what he viewed as an
insufficient raise. As he and Kenzer scrambled to find clients, he
said, he kept thinking: Where's the check? Where's Mommy?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rules you learn from working in big business, but
nobody's prepared for flying without the net until you do it,''
said Segal, who is 55. ``It's frightening. I see a lot of corporate
guys who can't make the conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   But many entrepreneurs insist that the absence of security is a
small price to pay for the freedom to operate at their own pace and
on their own scale.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Yellin, a small-business consultant who works out of her
Manhattan apartment, says she is determined to remain a one-person
show earning just enough money to live comfortably and ``feed my
cat Fancy Feasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Yellin is quick to see business possibilities in
humdrum circumstances. A telemarketing specialist who has made an
instructional tape titled ``Warming Up to Cold Calling,'' Yellin,
46, has even figured out how to turn phone pitches she receives at
home to her financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the callers are terrible at selling,'' she said.
``That gives me an opportunity to call their bosses and say, `You
should book me for some training.'''

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Deborah L. Jacobs, lawyer-turned-writer, gave a heartfelt
compliment to the young man who arrived with his helper to clean
her house in Brooklyn recently: the name of his service was awfully
clever. But she wasn't going to leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you trademarked it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   He had not, he told Jacobs, who happened to be the author of
``Legal Smarts for Small Business.'' And that answer worried her,
enough that she will not disclose the name of the young
entrepreneur's business until he has finished scurrying around to
obtain trademark protection.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a name that isn't trademarked can be used by someone
else unless the first person brings out expensive legal artillery
to stop the competition.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one example, Jacobs said, of how small-business
owners forge ahead optimistically, figuring that nothing can go
wrong, when they should part with a few hundred dollars, or a few
thousand depending on the legal task, for a lawyer who, by training
and temperament, can anticipate everything going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far can an entrepreneur get without a lawyer?'' she said.
``Pretty far. But it can cost you a lot, a whole lot, later.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the typical entrepreneurial attitude,'' said Fred S.
Steingold, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the author of ``The
Legal Guide for Starting and Running a Small Business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get along with their business, and they're not
detail-oriented,'' he said. ``They're impatient. That's what makes
them good entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tiny service businesses, of course, start and run fine
without professional advice; a dog walker or a window washer can
obtain a business license (and probably should in many cities, for
tax reasons), file a Schedule C and never pay for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a retail or a professional business, Jacobs said, ``as a
sole proprietor you can absolutely hang out your shingle without
consulting a lawyer, although if you're operating out of your house
you might want to check the zoning rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But any other form of ownership _ partnership and any type of
corporation _ requires legal and probably accounting guidance.
</P>
<P>
   On the complexity scale, the simplest is a partnership, which
most experts say should begin with a written agreement spelling
out, for example, what happens if one owner dies or quits the
business. This is well-charted territory, especially since the
Uniform Partnership Act governs in almost all states, and by
following legal guides for the general public and form books that
contain standard agreements, most people can do the paperwork and
whatever modifications they want.
</P>
<P>
   But even Steingold, whose publisher, Nolo Press, produces
self-help books and software, suggests that a lawyer review an
agreement. He gives the same advice for forming a simple
corporation _ with the preliminary note that owners might want to
first ask a lawyer whether they need to incorporate.
</P>
<P>
   (The main advantage, ordinarily, is protection of the individual
owners from legal liabilities. There are tax advantages and
disadvantages, too, best sorted out by an accountant.)
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork _ state filing papers, articles of incorporation
and shareholder provisions _ is manageable for most people; Nolo
Press, among others, publishes general guides and versions specific
to several states, including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Having a lawyer review the documents is fairly painless: in
Steingold's case, about an hour of his time, or $175. For handling
the whole process, his flat fee in most cases is $600. (In big
cities, where costs are generally higher, charges can run as high
as $2,000.)
</P>
<P>
   As for buying a business, whatever you plan to do, Steingold
said, self-education and self-representation won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need advice on whether to buy the assets or just the
corporate shell,'' he said. ``The typical purchase agreement is
pretty complicated. There are all kinds of decisions about how it's
going to be financed. Then there are 10 to 20 documents that show
up at a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, he said, will come into a lawyer's office with a
proposed sales contract that originated with the seller or came
from a form book, ``but it would be difficult for somebody who
doesn't have any legal experience to go through a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourself accounting is not recommended either, but
entrepreneurs can keep bills down by doing the prep work. Software
programs offer simplified bookkeeping tasks and enable people to
monitor cash-flow statements and projections.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone starting a business should be thoroughly immersed in
those numbers anyway, said Ginny Beauchamp, the vice president of
the National Association for the Self-Employed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beauchamp added, however small the business, ``having an
accountant do audits a couple times a year is a very good idea, and
if your business is growing by leaps and bounds, obviously you need
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the simplest sole proprietorships can do without
accountants for tax planning and preparation. Businesses can get in
trouble for failing to keep up with changes in tax law, as many did
several years ago when they failed to amend their Keough plans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a quarter of small-business owners were delinquent in
filing new plans with the Internal Revenue Service, many because
they were unaware of the new requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said small-business owners, whether through
cost-consciousness or hopeful ignorance, make two mistakes in
circumventing lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said, they wave off legal advice until they are in
trouble. She mentioned the entrepreneur who spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars making a CD-ROM called ``The First Electronic
Jewish Bookshelf.'' His product brought a warning letter from
Microsoft, which was using the term ``bookshelf.'' At that point,
the entrepreneur had to get a lawyer and enter extremely expensive
settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Second, she said, ``many attempt to play amateur lawyer.''
Jacobs recommends self-help books to pare legal costs and identify
business concerns. Nolo's, she advised, ``are very well researched
and well written and provide great background.'' Even after
practicing law for six years, she does not hesitate to hire others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I need a specialized kind of legal help, I hire the best
expert I can,'' she said. ``I would no sooner be an amateur in the
legal field than I would be an amateur electrician and rewire my
house.''

<P>
   My father was a young and energetic broker employed by a big
textile company, an immigrant's son prospering for the first time,
when his boss summoned him one day and said that because of
corporate setbacks, my father would have to accept a wage cut.
</P>
<P>
   He refused.
</P>
<P>
   Impetuously, he and another young broker resigned, rented an
office on Worth Street, and within a year they were earning more
than they ever had. They not only brokered trades in cotton cloth,
but purchased cloth themselves, gambling on resale at quick
profits.
</P>
<P>
   My father was an entrepreneur or, more precisely, he exhibited
some of the characteristics of an entrepreneur. The concept _ to
break with routine, to innovate, to seize an opportunity, to
develop something new _ is as old as capitalism. But the word
itself and the characteristics it suggests have become popular
among Americans only in the last 15 years as everyone, not just
immigrants and their children, struggles for a place in a rapidly
changing, increasingly competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is spending billions of dollars on the
restless, entrepreneurial endeavor to develop popular new products
or to rejigger old ones to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Only a volatile stock market threatens to curtail this energy by
depriving entrepreneurs, particularly small entrepreneurs, of some
of the financing they need to carry out their ideas. Big companies
have more cash savings to draw on and easier access to credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurial activity became a concern to the general
public in the 1980s, when we all thought that the United States was
falling behind, and that the rest of the world, particularly Japan,
would sink us,'' said William J. Baumol, an economist and historian
at New York University. ``As soon as people started worrying about
this, they said that Japan was entrepreneurial and America had lost
the spirit of entrepreneurship. And we began self-consciously to
reacquire that spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   My father, getting started in the 1920s, never thought of
himself as an entrepreneur. For him, the entrepreneurial spirit, a
term coming into vogue in his final years, resided exclusively in
energetic small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   Small business has a role, of course. Starting a business, being
your own boss, risking your savings, operating with high energy _
all these characteristics appear in the evolving definition of the
entrepreneurial spirit, first described in the early 1800s by
Jean-Baptiste Say, a French economist.
</P>
<P>
   But innovation and invention are its essence. And while a Sam
Walton (Wal-Mart) or a Steven Jobs (Apple) or a James Clark and
Marc Andreessen (Netscape) still emerge from the ranks of the
lone-wolf entrepreneurs, innovation and invention occur as often
today in big companies as in small ones. More often, probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that entrepreneurial innovation has
become the prime competitive weapon, and industry can no longer
wait for the occasional geniuses to come along with something
new,'' Baumol said. ``Companies have had to routinize invention and
innovation. And the big companies have the money to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical corporation, certainly
does. Its scientists, who develop drugs at Merck's laboratories,
are encouraged to take on the additional task of scouting outside
the company for promising new research or new technologies that
might lead to the development of a future drug.
</P>
<P>
   When they find this promising outside research they make their
case to a Merck board for money to finance or to buy the outside
research or to form a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``An entrepreneur to me,'' said Bennett M. Shapiro, the
executive vice president of Merck's worldwide basic research, ``is
someone who picks up something not going on at Merck, but is
important to the future development of a drug, and then makes the
case for why we should fund a relationship, as if he were an
independent entrepreneur appealing to venture capitalists for
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Merck's 5,000 scientists are so entrepreneurial, but
those who are, and succeed in bringing valuable research to Merck,
get handsome payoffs in stock options.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the entrepreneurial flexibility now evident in big
companies, millions of Americans appear to believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies; that is,
owner-operated companies with fewer than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The great attention focused on Silicon Valley start-ups feeds
this view. So do venture capitalists, who buy into the start-ups,
hoping that their innovative products will run up big sales,
quickly raising the value of the venture capitalist's investment.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Administration and the National Federation of
Independent Business, a powerful Washington lobbying group
representing small companies, also foster the perspective that
small companies are the chief source of entrepreneurial activity.
For this reason, among several others, small companies should get
government support in the form of special tax breaks and special
exemptions from some regulations. Or so the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the rawest sense of entrepreneurial,'' said William Dennis,
the federation's director of research, ``if I establish a new firm,
I have taken an entrepreneurial act. I have acted in the belief
that I know something others don't, and I am exploiting an
advantage others do not have.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an appealing thought at a time when self-employment is a
big phenomenon, particularly among immigrants and among workers who
have been laid off by corporations. By this definition, a Korean
immigrant, for example, is entrepreneurial if he sets up a flower
kiosk on a street corner, acting on an insight that, in his view, a
competitor on the opposite corner has failed to grasp. He is acting
on the belief that he will draw more customers because his new
kiosk is closer than his competitor's to a bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists agree that starting a business is
entrepreneurial. But if the Korean immigrant's kiosk survives and
he then presides over a routine daily operation, as most small
business owners do, is he still entrepreneurial?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, unless he regains that status by giving his
operation another entrepreneurial kick. David Allen, who founded
Allen Associates in the Boston suburb of Ayer, fits this pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after earning an engineering degree 35 years ago, Allen
began a company to manufacture and sell a wire-and-sponge device
that he had invented and patented to keep corsages moist. The
device sold, and for 20 years, he earned a steady five-figure
income. His entrepreneurial start-up faded into a
nonentrepreneurial, day-to-day operation.
</P>
<P>
   When their two sons became teen-agers in the early '80s, Marie
Allen joined her husband, bringing to the enterprise a background
in, and a yen for, marketing. She soon hit on a way to increase
sales revenues from the 600 wholesale florists who were her
husband's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling to regional trade shows, Allen said: ``We look for
promising new products that people are trying to introduce into the
floral industry, but cannot manage to sell. Marie takes them to
market with our products; we currently are selling 25 different
items to our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Annual revenue for the Allens has nearly quadrupled to $1.1
million from $300,000, when Mrs. Allen came aboard 15 years ago,
and it has reawakened the family business.
</P>
<P>
   From Adam Smith's day, the entrepreneurial spirit, in one guise
or another, has been a huge source of change and expansion for the
capitalist market system. The great early-20th century economist,
Joseph A. Schumpeter, gave the concept its modern, expansive twist,
defining an entrepreneur as someone who breaks with routine.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurial function, he wrote, ``does not essentially
consist in either inventing anything or otherwise creating the
conditions which the enterprise exploits. It consists in getting
things done'' right down to ``making a success of a particular kind
of sausage or toothbrush.''

<P>
   WOODSIDE, Calif. _ John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture
capitalist, scans the room at Bucks, a folksy cafe in this affluent
bedroom community, and notes that he recognizes about half the
financiers, hardware engineers and software hackers who are seated.
</P>
<P>
   Shoch is doing what he does best. He calls it ``surfing'':
looking for the next big thing in the nation's technology
heartland. He is a key player in a remarkably efficient system that
brings together vast pools of capital and good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs everywhere in Silicon Valley that the region is
no longer an unconnected bunch of competitors located near the
Stanford University campus, which gave birth to the valley's first
company, Hewlett-Packard Company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, changing jobs in Silicon Valley Inc. is now as simple
as turning into a new driveway on the way to work, or as simple an
idea as the newly created garage.com, which matches entrepreneurs
with venture-capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   A walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto, increasingly the
valley's brain center, will take you past the brand-new offices of
Accel Partners, one of the valley's premier venture-capital firms.
The partners are upstairs; downstairs,
``entrepreneurs-in-residence'' are busy incubating start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   This financing mechanism has created the semiconductor chip, the
digital watch, video games, the personal computer and most recently
the commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Time in the valley seems compressed. This is evident from the
exploding megahertz ratings of microprocessor chips to the
ballooning megabyte storage capacities of memory chips and disk
drives, making everything move faster at an ever-increasing rate.
Around the valley it is best described as living on Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   For Shoch, whose firm, Asset Management, has just completed a
$100 million-plus fund, these are both heady and nervous times.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing, in Shoch's parlance, means catching the next big wave
of technology innovation. And despite the fact that there are more
and more billions of venture-capital dollars flowing into the
valley each year, it is complicated. (The recent stock-market
jitters have left venture capitalists here nervous but still
enthusiastic; in short, holding their breath.)
</P>
<P>
   While the pace of change has become predictable, charting the
direction of change is still an art form.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'll paddle furiously to catch a wave that fails
to materialize,'' Shoch said. ``While at other times the wave will
appear suddenly and you'll find yourself paddling just as furiously
to try to catch it before it leaves you behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Silicon Valley venture capitalists have made their
reputation by finding and riding a certain wave. For example, in
1989 John Hummer and Ann Winblad established the first
venture-capital firm to focus exclusively on software companies,
just when the software industry was blossoming.
</P>
<P>
   And there are legendary figures, like John Doerr, a partner at
Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers. Doerr has had the knack of
making the best investments spanning three eras: personal
computers, workstations and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, everyone was convinced that the next big
thing would be interactive digital television. The vision: Happy
families would sit in their living rooms in front of their TVs and
bank, shop, communicate with other people and be entertained. The
living room has so far not proven to be the right place for
interacting with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Missteps like these have led to absurdities like a Florida
market trial in which a Silicon Valley company tried to hook up TV
sets to computer workstations that had been fine-tuned to pump
movies and digital information into homes. The concept failed
because it cost more than many families want to spend: $25,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, of course, is that in Silicon Valley the term
``visionary'' usually describes a job title and not an ability. If
you pressure venture capitalists over a meal at Il Fornaio in Palo
Alto, they will confess that they expect a shakeout and acknowledge
that they are concerned about the huge capital flows coming into
the valley.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence can be seen in the remarkable appreciation of
the value of new deals _ there is just too much money chasing too
few great ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But for the moment the risks seem to be outweighed by the
incredible opportunities inspired by the emergence of cyberspace.
While everyone was looking the other way, the Internet sneaked up
on Silicon Valley and sent the venture-capital community racing to
finance start-ups like Netscape Communications, Yahoo, Excite,
Infoseek and Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has cranked up the valley's economy to
a feverish pitch. Companies like Apple Computer and Sun
Microsystems have been reinvigorated by the boom in Internet
commerce. There are so many new companies being formed that initial
public offerings are no longer the typical outcome for a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than five times as many companies created each
year as there are available IPO dollars. Consequently, acquisition
has become an endgame for most start-ups, according to Technologic
Partners, a firm that monitors venture capital in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   That in turn has made the valley even more of a technology
hothouse, attracting a new kind of venture backer _ large
technology companies like AT&AMP;T, Lucent, Intel and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Intel executives once referred to the valley's
venture community as ``vulture capitalists'' because they would
entice employees away to start to new chip ventures, the company is
now running the valley's largest venture fund, valued at more than
$300 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the boom-time atmosphere, there are signs that the
Internet wave is cresting and that Silicon Valley is entering one
of those periods between new technologies and new industries.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is no certainty about the next big thing after the
Internet, but everyone is looking. Is it wireless data or is the
time finally right for interactive digital television?
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the valley is on the brink of an epochal
shift, perhaps from the world of electronic to optical computing.
Such a shift has been predicted for many years by some of the
valley's best thinkers. The world of optical computing is much more
in tune with the communications-rich future that now seems all
around.
</P>
<P>
   The common wisdom here, however, is that any new invention is
subject to the ``15-year'' rule: It usually takes at least 15 years
for a new technology to make it from the laboratory to the market.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where timing is everything _ the right investment at
the wrong moment can be just as disastrous as making the wrong bet
_ a venture capitalist can be left with a lot of sleepless nights,
even in the best of times.

<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ As the sun begins its pink descent behind the
neo-Gothic spire of Deering Library, two barefoot students lazily
toss a Frisbee across a great expanse of lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Four flights up, in Northwestern University's Leverone Hall, 18
students and a professor are gathered around a classroom table.
</P>
<P>
   The talk this July evening is not of Dante or of the
pre-Socratics. It is of angel investors, price-earnings ratios and
what it means to work for a company so young that its founders
still have no desks or no telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   The students, led by Steven Rogers, a clinical professor of
management, are spending their summer working for start-up
companies in the area in what may turn into full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   All the students are in the master's of management program of
Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, one of scores of
business schools that over the last five years have built programs
and majors in entrepreneurship studies, an arresting mix of the
plainly pragmatic and the utterly ephemeral.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by student and alumni demand, no field is hotter today in
business studies than that of entrepreneurship. Whereas a
generation ago the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune
500 company and climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent
desire nowadays seems to be to come up with a marketable idea,
start a company and work for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Murray Low, who directs entrepreneurship studies at
Columbia University, scholarship in the field is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s there were only a few scholarly journals
devoted to new businesses. Today there are 26, most of them started
in the last five years. In 1980, there were 18 entrepreneurship
chairs at business schools. Today there are more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Katz of St. Louis University, who has been tracking this
growth, says that in a 1991 study of the approximately 300
accredited business schools in the country, a couple dozen were
found to offer some course work in entrepreneurship. Today, about
120 of them offer it as a major.
</P>
<P>
   While defining entrepreneurship studies remains problematic,
scholars in the field agree that its sudden popularity has several
roots. First, the corporate downsizing of the '80s changed the view
that a good corporate job meant long-term security.
</P>
<P>
   Second, technology and globalization have changed the way the
world does business. A product's shelf life has been greatly
reduced, and challenges from remote places mean that companies need
flexibility, which is a challenge for large, formal hierarchies of
traditional corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, scholars say, young people have grown up in an
environment that emphasizes independence and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurship is really about the three P's: pride, passion
and perseverance,'' said A. Barry Merkin, a clinical professor of
entrepreneurship at Kellogg. ``It's about risk-taking, boldness and
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The best analogy, Merkin noted, is to sports. ``Intuitive
qualities are essential, but few can reach real heights without
coaching,'' he said. ``There are basic things to learn, like
accounting and finance, but also narrower areas like writing a
business plan, raising capital. I also try to give my students a
feeling of what it is like to go through something like this, the
tensions and frustrations, because folks who go into this without
realizing what they are doing will face nervous breakdowns, heart
attacks and divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not matters, either the business plans or the heart
attacks, most academics with Ph.D.'s want to teach or to study.
There is a lack of reliable data on start-up companies, and without
data it is hard to produce rigorous scholarship, the grist of
academic careers.
</P>
<P>
   This has created a split, because alumni are donating truckloads
of dollars to set up centers and chairs in entrepreneurship, yet
there are no scholars to fill them.
</P>
<P>
   New York University is a good example. Its Stern School of
Business has four endowed chairs of entrepreneurship, two unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see entrepreneurship as a word in search of a meaning in the
academic sense,'' said George Daly, Stern's dean. ``Academics sort
themselves into these little silos, and entrepreneurship is not
easily matched for them. But the role being played by small,
innovative enterprises in our society is phenomenal and should be
studied. The challenge is to persuade academics to look beyond
their own boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Business schools are increasingly turning to practitioners
rather than scholars to teach entrepreneurship, either alone or
paired with a more traditional professor. That is why Merkin of
Kellogg is called a ``clinical professor,'' on the model of medical
school professors who are M.D.s rather than Ph.D.'s. This, too, has
caused tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, tenured professors consider businessmen
without Ph.D's to be lower-life forms,'' said Kenneth P. Morse, the
founder of high-tech ventures and managing director of the
Entrepreneurship Center at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology Sloan School of Management. ``But there were 1 million
start-ups in the world last year, and anyone who wants to be
involved in such a start-up has a lot to learn _ how to pick the
funding, how to give a raise, how not to run out of money. This is
different from what used to be taught.''
</P>
<P>
   Young scholars are beginning to take the plunge. One is Paul A.
Gompers, an associate professor of business administration at
Harvard Business School. Gompers acknowledges the difficulty in
gathering data but says the field is too exciting to allow that to
be a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get data from private consulting firms or through large
pension funds or endowments that provide access to their files,''
Gompers said. ``A lot of it is hand-collected. I'm putting together
data on 1,300 firms, collecting a complete financial history, their
boards of directors, scales of compensation to study how they
operate and grow. I have hired 10 to 15 research assistants during
the course of this project over the last two and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much of what goes on at entrepreneurship centers
today consists of students going through the motions of setting up
new ventures, and sometimes actually doing the ventures. Business
school has turned into a kind of laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Business-plan competitions, both local and national, have grown
rapidly in scale with students presenting their plans to venture
capitalists and competing for donated prize money to help them set
up companies.
</P>
<P>
   One such winner was Evan Schumacher, a 29-year-old native of
Boston who finished at Northwestern this spring. His plan called
for setting up a software company that tracks global shipping,
freight and customs management for international firms.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher won the Kellogg competition and took his plan to
Austin, Tex., in May for national finals. He was a finalist, and as
he walked off the stage after his presentation, his wireless
microphone still clipped to his lapel, a man in the audience
approached him and asked how much he needed.
</P>
<P>
   The man became the company's first angel investor, in for
$250,000. The company, Celarix, was born at the end of June in
Chicago. So far, it has raised $500,000 from investors and is
planning to raise another $1 million to $2 million from venture
capitalist firms. A third employee will join the company this
month.

<P>
   WAYNE, N.J. _ Drive west from Manhattan, through the Lincoln
Tunnel and into the thick of one of the many commercial
bloodstreams that feeds the suburban beast engulfing New York City.
Go about 20 miles from the Hudson River to a nondescript office
building that overlooks a 14-theater multiplex and a warehouse-size
Costco. That is where you'll find, on the third floor, a modest
little company called Audible Inc., which just happens to have
outsize ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unlikely location, certainly, for a three-year-old
Internet start-up, one that hopes to create a big audience for
something completely different: custom audio information delivered
on demand over the Web to portable devices you can listen to any
time and anywhere, say, while jogging or driving to work.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the guy who founded the company, Donald Katz, who is
46 and the author of three highly acclaimed nonfiction books, is a
rather unlikely entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Katz never marched to anyone's beat but his own. In starting
Audible, he drew on his own experiences as a writer combined with
the thirst to create something new from the seemingly limitless
potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audible seeks to wed the oldest of human technologies, the
spoken word, with the newest of technologies,'' he said with
characteristic ardor. ``We want to be a leader in teaching the
Internet to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating that vision into a successful business will not be
easy. Audible is losing plenty of money.
</P>
<P>
   The company has about 35 employees, its own portable player and
a Web site (www.audible.com) where users can immediately download
from a selection of 16,000 hours of copyrighted audio files
containing everything from traditional read-aloud books like Frank
McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes'' ($9) to bundles of advice ($3 to $13)
from the Harvard Business Review and such. For all its success in
building a new infrastructure, however, the company is just
beginning to attract paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Katz is accustomed to taking risks. For two decades, from the
time he left graduate school at the London School of Economics in
1975, Katz was a free-lance journalist.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, Katz turned his attention to money and
business. Originally from Chicago, he decided to write a book about
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Company, his hometown giant.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, the once-great store of the American middle class and one
of the most secretive corporations in the country, was in the midst
of an immense crisis. Katz persuaded Edward Telling, its chief
executive, to give him carte blanche access to the company. The
book, ``The Big Store,'' took six years to research and write.
</P>
<P>
   Katz followed with two other books that also required him to
open closed doors, one a look at the post-World War middle-class
experience told through a single extended family that revealed its
most intimate secrets, and the other an inside look at Nike and its
reclusive chairman, Phil Knight.
</P>
<P>
   In business, surprisingly, Katz did find a subject worthy of
epic treatment. And he discovered he had a taste for it.
</P>
<P>
   With Ed Lau, his college roommate who moved into the computer
industry, Katz began to develop an idea for a business that would
deliver radio programs and audio books through the Internet. His
next book project, on the convergence of digital technologies, was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I couldn't write into reality,'' Katz said.
``I had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a fresh outlet for the powers of persuasion that had
opened so many doors in his writing career. The first big convert
was Tim Mott, now a wealthy private investor in Ketchum, Idaho, who
is renowned in Silicon Valley as a co-founder of Electronic Arts,
the computer-game maker, and Macromedia, a software company
specializing in multimedia graphic-design applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls all the time about start-up ideas, and I probably
look at least one business plan a week,'' Mott said. ``Over the
course of five years, I've seen, maybe, four that I wanted to
commit money and time. This was one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mott as chairman, they made the round of venture-capital
firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's business experience and Don's visionary ideas were a
powerful combination,'' said Kevin Compton, a partner at Kleiner
Perkins who became their chief backer there. ``Three minutes into
conversation you could just feel his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Audible is built around the premise that lots of people are
willing to pay regularly to fill their time _ on the go _ with
constantly changing packages of verbal packages of entertainment,
news and practical advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even more promising is the potential for pumping millions of
mobile workers full of management information, corporate training
and ``time-shifted'' business news while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   To make all that possible, Audible had to design its own
portable player. It is roughly the size and shape of an electric
razor, holds two hours of audio and plugs into a personal computer
through a cradle similar to one used in hand-held computers. People
can carry the battery-powered gadget anywhere, listen to it through
headphones or play clips in a car stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Programs are stored on a computer, ready to refill the player as
soon as it is returned to its cradle, which remains attached to the
computer.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, though, the player is also an Achilles heel. It
is relatively expensive, costing $200 as a stand-alone purchase.
Two hours is not enough storage time, particularly since lots of
audio books run three to four hours. And it is not easy for the
technologically challenged to try.
</P>
<P>
   To overcome these drawbacks, Audible is developing a
second-generation player with greater abilities and is exploring
new pricing plans similar to those used to sell mobile-phone
services, in which buyers would receive the player at a steep
reduction if they sign up for a subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Relying mostly on word of mouth, Audible says it has attracted
more than 5,000 customers and shipped about 3,000 players. Those
using the player spend an average of about $20 a month on fresh
content.
</P>
<P>
   But Audible's real ace in the hole is not the player but the
rights it has painstakingly sewn up with dozens of content
providers. It is introducing new programs _ from an audio digest of
The Wall Street Journal to National Public Radio's ``Fresh Air''
program _ that will be sent automatically to a subscriber's
computer.
</P>
<P>
   And it will adapt all Audible's products so they can be played
on a variety of portable devices, beginning with the hand-held
organizers powered by Microsoft's Windows CE software.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent stock-market turmoil, Audible's outside
investors, who own about 56 percent of the company (the founders
and employees own the rest) remained cautious about going public,
insisting they do not intend to sell stock until the company is
generating a growing and predictable revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a good thing, given the uncertainty about even the most
promising Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no in-between,'' said Paul Hawken, the author of
``Growing a Business'' and an entrepreneur who co-founded Smith &AMP;
Hawken, the mail-order garden-supply company. ``Either Audible will
be a billion-dollar-plus company or it will be wallpaper. I suspect
it will be the former.''

   Whenever I look at my bank statement, I think of Ken Hakuta, aka
Dr. Fad. Best known as the inventor of the Wacky Wall Walker, he
made some $20 million from slime-covered plastic creatures that
ooze down vertical surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come up with the
idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a tiny fraction
of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire and is a prominent
figure on the lecture and convention circuits.
</P>
<P>
   With one simple idea he achieved the American dream _ money and
fame.
</P>
<P>
   There are countless Hakutas _ inventors of the pet rock, sliced
bread, the rolling lint remover, the better mousetrap. And I want
to be one. But I'm too busy writing articles like this one to
follow up on any get-rich-quick schemes, and I can't seem to put
the energy into starting a corporation dedicated to carrying out my
ideas. So I have decided to give them away.
</P>
<P>
   1. Some clever wag has beaten me to the idea of portable gyms:
trainers who park outside your home in vans full of exercise
equipment. But no one has come up with portable baby sitters. Tired
of having to constantly call home during a dinner date to check on
your child or to leave a movie early to deal with a small
emergency? With a portable baby sitter, your child can follow you
around on your date or outing in an RV with toys, a bed and a
licensed sitter. Now you can look in on your little one during
theater intermissions and deal with a crisis without abandoning
your plans.
</P>
<P>
   2. Copyright millennium slogans or register Web site domain
names that corporations will eventually want to buy from you. Some
examples of slogans include ``A new car for a new millennium'' or
``Relief for the morning after the millennium.'' For Web sites, you
could try to cut yourself in on a piece of Mr. Hakuta's millions
and register a wackywallwalker.com.
</P>
<P>
   3. The inventions of tow ropes and chairlifts revolutionized
skiing, enabling entrepreneurs to open ridiculously overpriced ski
resorts. So where are the surf resorts? Tow ropes, jet skis and
above-water conveyer belts could drop surfers off at their favorite
wave and save them from exhausting, time-consuming paddling. Of
course, some surfers will complain that paddling to the wave is
integral to the sport, but soon surfing anywhere besides a resort
will seem as antiquated as hiking uphill to ski.
</P>
<P>
   4. The best entrepreneurs come up with products nobody has heard
of and then persuade the public that it can't live without them.
Here is my candidate: by developing a system to measure the sense
of smell (akin to the eye-chart test), an entrepreneur can make a
fortune by inventing smelling aids for people with deficient
olfactory nerves.
</P>
<P>
   5. Create a line of address books, cell phones, wallets and
purses that, like cordless telephones, beep when they're lost. Even
better, for obsessive message-checkers not satisfied with pagers,
devise a key chain or a small toy that lights up whenever their
answering machine takes a call. In addition, a huge market has
opened up in Japan for cellular phone accessories that could be
exploited in America: different styles of straps and antennae,
trinkets to make phones ring differently and lights that flash when
the phone rings.
</P>
<P>
   6. Become an apartment broker in a competitive city like New
York or San Francisco. But instead of representing realtors or
buildings, start a trustworthy company that represents renters.
They can tell you exactly what they want, then you find it and pay
a deposit to reserve the apartment until they can see it. To corner
the market, you could pay apartment owners a fee to give you a copy
of their listing on the same day they send it to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   7. There are sperm banks, but no public egg banks. These would
be for working women who don't want to have children until they
retire. This way, women can finally stop the ticking of that
biological clock by depositing an egg when they're in their 20s or
30s. The egg will then be preserved until a woman is ready to rear
a child.
</P>
<P>
   8. The best ice cream in the world is Bertillon, a French
delicacy with flavors so precise that anyone marketing it in
America could revolutionize the ice-cream business the way Jelly
Bellys cornered the jelly bean market. This is not a joke, but a
way to a better society.
</P>
<P>
   9. One reason people drive when they're drunk is because they
don't want to have to take a cab home and then wake up in the
morning without their car. By creating an 800-IM-DRUNK line in
car-oriented cities like Los Angeles and Dallas, this problem could
be solved. The service would actually drive a chauffeur to a
restaurant, club or house to take the inebriated client home (or
even to another bar or party) in his or her own car.
</P>
<P>
   10. I was recently notified that someone had taken my idea of
making custom fortune cookies for parties. But kids' dolls could be
personalized in a similar way by having a talking toy like Tickle
Me Elmo or Teletubby and replacing its voice chip with a homemade
one. It could either have personalized messages (``Get to work,
George'') or just undoll-like comments. (``Gee whiz, cover up your
bellybutton, it looks obscene.'')
</P>
<P>
   Space prohibits me from elaborating on more ideas. But with
hundreds of thousands of people reading this, it seems very likely
that within the next 24 hours these baker's-dozen recommendations
will soon be patented and put into development.

 &HT;    
 By JON PARELES 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't happy,'' Richards said. ``I was making money, but I
couldn't talk to anyone about the great show I saw last night or
the great record I found. It was a job.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1992, she started her own company: Thrill Jockey Records,
named after a gang of delinquents in a B movie. It would release
music she cared about and let the musicians decide what to release,
how to package it and run their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a company where the artists' expectations and the
labels' abilities were in line,'' she said. ``I don't think major
labels are inherently evil or out to destroy the world. I just
don't happen to use music that fits their system.''
</P>
<P>
   That music, Richards said, is simply ``what I like.'' Thrill
Jockey is a leading outlet for what some critics have named
``post-rock'': instrumentals that elude categorization as jazz, pop
tunes or dance music. The label's best-selling band is Tortoise,
whose most recent album has sold nearly 100,000 worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey has also released albums by the
neo-Appalachian duo Freakwater, two women who sing about hard
times; the electronic group Oval, which has built compositions on
the sounds of skipping CDs; and the Nerve, a peppy alternative-rock
band.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of freaky, left-of-center stuff that she puts out,
but at the same time there's a big enough audience so that she can
make a living,'' said Nic Harcourt, the creative music director of
KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, Calif., and the host of the station's
``Morning Becomes Eclectic,'' a program that the music business on
the West Coast follows closely.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, Thrill Jockey has released 60 albums (both as CDs
and old-fashioned vinyl LPs), singles and EPs. All but three
releases have broken even or turned a profit. By contrast, 80
percent to 90 percent of albums from major labels post losses.
</P>
<P>
   But Thrill Jockey works on a grass-roots scale, seeking sales in
thousands rather than millions; its typical release breaks even
with sales of 1,500 CDs and 500 LPs.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Thrill Jockey's profit was $183,000, and while that
is probably less than what Columbia Records spends on catering, it
is a success story in independent rock.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, Richards, who is 33 years old, did everything
herself, from signing talent to lining up band interviews. Now
Thrill Jockey has three other full-time employees and one part
timer and is about to buy its own small building.
</P>
<P>
   Richards started Thrill Jockey while working four days a week at
Pier Platters, an alternative-rock record store in Hoboken, N.J.
She ran the label from her third-floor walk-up apartment on Avenue
C in Manhattan, carrying mail-order CDs to UPS because she didn't
ship enough to qualify for a pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Her capital was $20,000 from her grandmother, $10,000 from her
father and the $5,000 from her savings account; she has never
needed another infusion. Her business advisers were people who had
started their own labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was constantly asking advice from people: cheaper places to
press things, ways to cut corners,'' she said. ``One thing about
independently distributed record labels is that you don't get this
competitive feeling. As long as you are willing to reciprocate with
information, people are happy to give it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Richards moved from New York to Chicago, where her main
manufacturer and distributor, Touch and Go, is based. Rent and
taxes are considerably lower than they are in New York, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Many independent companies are stepping stones for bands that
hope to be discovered by major labels. By contract, the smaller
labels then share in the profits from the major-label releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to spend my time as a farm label,'' Richards
said. ``From a business standpoint, it would be better to have
bands bound to contracts so I'd get a piece of their future. But I
don't want to make money from a system I don't support.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey makes unusually generous deals with musicians.
Once an album breaks even, the label and the musicians each get 50
percent of the gross receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the net comes down, they actually get more than me,''
Richards said. Contracts are often literally a handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Richards chooses bands that, she thinks, can benefit from the
scale of her company and will stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``If becoming famous is their primary focus, then we're not the
right label for them,'' she said. ``But if they want to continue to
make music and live off that, then that's a goal we can achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey records most albums for under $3,000, one
three-hundredth of what a band like U2 spends, and advertises
sparingly. Video clips tend to be made by friends of the bands or
as projects by art students, though they have been shown
occasionally on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Thrill Jockey depends largely on the unpaid promotion of college
radio stations and reviews in the press, but it also uses club disk
jockeys and skateboarding magazines to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each record is totally different,'' Richards said. ``It's not
as if I sold a really great new garbage can or a nice clock. Your
most popular band this year could be completely unpopular next
year. My company has to be flexible and adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my company to stay in business and do well,'' Richards
said. ``But the creative stuff was always the motivation that
sparked it. It wasn't, I see a way to make money better. It was, I
can make this artist's experience better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot of work,'' Richards added. ``But it never feels
like a job.''

   Even as children, many of them spotted a business angle nobody
else did, and milked it for all it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
figured he could make more money if he hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected and even had the presence of mind to ply his trade
outside his neighborhood so that the mothers wouldn't catch on to
his scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was out of high school, Blue owned and operated two
drug stores.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy growing up in a village in India 100 miles north of New
Delhi, Vinod Gupta, the founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of
business information in Omaha with projected sales this year of
$250 million, caught frogs at a swamp and sold them to a research
laboratory for lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   In college, he rented entire passenger-train cars to make a
36-hour trip to New Delhi, and then sold seat tickets individually
for a quick 25 percent profit.
</P>
<P>
   Not every successful business owner can boast of such an early
flair for salesmanship. But even those who drifted or were pushed
into entrepreneurial careers seem to have a natural bent for
seizing opportunities that make competitors wonder why on earth
they didn't think of that themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what defines them? They are an eclectic lot who operate
ventures that vary from grocery stores to Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Jonovic, a consultant in Cleveland who has advised
hundreds of family businesses, says he never fails to be astonished
by the ``raw diversity'' of American entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at some of them and you ask, `My God, how'd that
happen?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that prides itself on individualism and counts
literally millions of entrepreneurs, it is a question worth asking.
Small businesses, roughly defined as ventures controlled by their
founders and taking in less than $250 million in revenue a year,
are an enormous force in the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   But what drives their owners to strike out on their own rather
than take refuge in the predictability and perks of salaried jobs?
</P>
<P>
   The experts, of course, have their views. Jonovic says true
entrepreneurs are marked by a combination of ``tunnel-vision
dedication'' and supreme self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   David G. Winter, a professor of psychology at the University of
Michigan, said they are propelled by a zeal to excel at whatever
they do, a trait he calls ``achievement motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have this optimism, this exuberance, this boldness,''
Winter said, which can take the form of restlessness, especially if
their business grows into a larger, bureaucratic organization they
can't control. If that happens, he said, ``they may be so unable to
deal with it that they get dismissed by their board. Or they may
quit and start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said entrepreneurs often display a streak of
authoritarianism because they believe their method is the only way
to do things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing their best is what matters most to them, as opposed to a
concern with friendship or power,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs, he added, tend to come from middle-class
backgrounds, not blue-collar homes or wealthy families, ``which
still view small business as a step downward into vulgar trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonovic said that many entrepreneurs are tightfisted, not out of
greed but because each dollar they earn represents a small fraction
of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a successful entrepreneur who ended up in a nursing
home and wouldn't pay for a private room because he wanted to keep
his estate above $1 million,'' Jonovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs themselves cite a long list of self-defining
characteristics and attributes: decisiveness, resilience, focus, a
love of battle, a penchant for risk-taking, workaholism, good
social skills.
</P>
<P>
   But as they recount their histories, two core themes leap out,
flip sides of the same coin: They want to be their own boss, and
they show an uncanny knack for detecting opportunities that others
missed.
</P>
<P>
   For most entrepreneurs, it all begins with the realization that
working for somebody else just isn't a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go it alone can be liberating, but it can also
be scary because it means cutting off the corporate safety net.
</P>
<P>
   Eric B. Segal, the president of the Kenzer Corp., an
executive-recruiting firm in New York, recalls the near-panic he
and his partner, Robert D. Kenzer, felt in the early days of
running their company in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Segal had been a corporate executive in the retail industry, but
quit a high-paying job after he got what he viewed as an
insufficient raise. As he and Kenzer scrambled to find clients, he
said, he kept thinking: Where's the check? Where's Mommy?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are rules you learn from working in big business, but
nobody's prepared for flying without the net until you do it,''
said Segal, who is 55. ``It's frightening. I see a lot of corporate
guys who can't make the conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   But many entrepreneurs insist that the absence of security is a
small price to pay for the freedom to operate at their own pace and
on their own scale.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Yellin, a small-business consultant who works out of her
Manhattan apartment, says she is determined to remain a one-person
show earning just enough money to live comfortably and ``feed my
cat Fancy Feasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Yellin is quick to see business possibilities in
humdrum circumstances. A telemarketing specialist who has made an
instructional tape titled ``Warming Up to Cold Calling,'' Yellin,
46, has even figured out how to turn phone pitches she receives at
home to her financial advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the callers are terrible at selling,'' she said.
``That gives me an opportunity to call their bosses and say, `You
should book me for some training.'''

 By LAURA MANSNERUS 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Deborah L. Jacobs, lawyer-turned-writer, gave a heartfelt
compliment to the young man who arrived with his helper to clean
her house in Brooklyn recently: the name of his service was awfully
clever. But she wasn't going to leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you trademarked it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   He had not, he told Jacobs, who happened to be the author of
``Legal Smarts for Small Business.'' And that answer worried her,
enough that she will not disclose the name of the young
entrepreneur's business until he has finished scurrying around to
obtain trademark protection.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a name that isn't trademarked can be used by someone
else unless the first person brings out expensive legal artillery
to stop the competition.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one example, Jacobs said, of how small-business
owners forge ahead optimistically, figuring that nothing can go
wrong, when they should part with a few hundred dollars, or a few
thousand depending on the legal task, for a lawyer who, by training
and temperament, can anticipate everything going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far can an entrepreneur get without a lawyer?'' she said.
``Pretty far. But it can cost you a lot, a whole lot, later.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the typical entrepreneurial attitude,'' said Fred S.
Steingold, a lawyer in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the author of ``The
Legal Guide for Starting and Running a Small Business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to get along with their business, and they're not
detail-oriented,'' he said. ``They're impatient. That's what makes
them good entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some tiny service businesses, of course, start and run fine
without professional advice; a dog walker or a window washer can
obtain a business license (and probably should in many cities, for
tax reasons), file a Schedule C and never pay for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a retail or a professional business, Jacobs said, ``as a
sole proprietor you can absolutely hang out your shingle without
consulting a lawyer, although if you're operating out of your house
you might want to check the zoning rules.''
</P>
<P>
   But any other form of ownership _ partnership and any type of
corporation _ requires legal and probably accounting guidance.
</P>
<P>
   On the complexity scale, the simplest is a partnership, which
most experts say should begin with a written agreement spelling
out, for example, what happens if one owner dies or quits the
business. This is well-charted territory, especially since the
Uniform Partnership Act governs in almost all states, and by
following legal guides for the general public and form books that
contain standard agreements, most people can do the paperwork and
whatever modifications they want.
</P>
<P>
   But even Steingold, whose publisher, Nolo Press, produces
self-help books and software, suggests that a lawyer review an
agreement. He gives the same advice for forming a simple
corporation _ with the preliminary note that owners might want to
first ask a lawyer whether they need to incorporate.
</P>
<P>
   (The main advantage, ordinarily, is protection of the individual
owners from legal liabilities. There are tax advantages and
disadvantages, too, best sorted out by an accountant.)
</P>
<P>
   The paperwork _ state filing papers, articles of incorporation
and shareholder provisions _ is manageable for most people; Nolo
Press, among others, publishes general guides and versions specific
to several states, including New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Having a lawyer review the documents is fairly painless: in
Steingold's case, about an hour of his time, or $175. For handling
the whole process, his flat fee in most cases is $600. (In big
cities, where costs are generally higher, charges can run as high
as $2,000.)
</P>
<P>
   As for buying a business, whatever you plan to do, Steingold
said, self-education and self-representation won't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need advice on whether to buy the assets or just the
corporate shell,'' he said. ``The typical purchase agreement is
pretty complicated. There are all kinds of decisions about how it's
going to be financed. Then there are 10 to 20 documents that show
up at a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, he said, will come into a lawyer's office with a
proposed sales contract that originated with the seller or came
from a form book, ``but it would be difficult for somebody who
doesn't have any legal experience to go through a closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Do-it-yourself accounting is not recommended either, but
entrepreneurs can keep bills down by doing the prep work. Software
programs offer simplified bookkeeping tasks and enable people to
monitor cash-flow statements and projections.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone starting a business should be thoroughly immersed in
those numbers anyway, said Ginny Beauchamp, the vice president of
the National Association for the Self-Employed in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beauchamp added, however small the business, ``having an
accountant do audits a couple times a year is a very good idea, and
if your business is growing by leaps and bounds, obviously you need
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the simplest sole proprietorships can do without
accountants for tax planning and preparation. Businesses can get in
trouble for failing to keep up with changes in tax law, as many did
several years ago when they failed to amend their Keough plans.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a quarter of small-business owners were delinquent in
filing new plans with the Internal Revenue Service, many because
they were unaware of the new requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said small-business owners, whether through
cost-consciousness or hopeful ignorance, make two mistakes in
circumventing lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   First, she said, they wave off legal advice until they are in
trouble. She mentioned the entrepreneur who spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars making a CD-ROM called ``The First Electronic
Jewish Bookshelf.'' His product brought a warning letter from
Microsoft, which was using the term ``bookshelf.'' At that point,
the entrepreneur had to get a lawyer and enter extremely expensive
settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Second, she said, ``many attempt to play amateur lawyer.''
Jacobs recommends self-help books to pare legal costs and identify
business concerns. Nolo's, she advised, ``are very well researched
and well written and provide great background.'' Even after
practicing law for six years, she does not hesitate to hire others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I need a specialized kind of legal help, I hire the best
expert I can,'' she said. ``I would no sooner be an amateur in the
legal field than I would be an amateur electrician and rewire my
house.''

FREER GALLERY MARKS 75TH ANNIVERSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL CRAIG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A railroad man's job loss 120 years ago proved to
be a gain for the nation because it resulted in the unique
collection of Oriental and American art housed at the Smithsonian
Institution's Freer Gallery in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 75th anniversary of the gallery opening in 1923 will be
observed Oct. 11 by a special exhibition of 100 new works acquired
for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   They include examples of sculpture, painting, ceramics,
calligraphy and metalware produced over a period of 4,000 years
throughout a wide area of Asia. Many are associated with royalty,
such as the Emperor Shah Jahan, builder of the Taj Mahal in India.
They will be exhibited through next April 11.
</P>
<P>
   The new works are significant additions to the collection
originally deeded to the nation in 1906 by Charles Lang Freer, who
made his fortune as a manufacturer of rail cars.
</P>
<P>
   When Freer lost his job in an 1878 Indiana rail merger, he
pooled his money with a friend and started a rail car building
enterprise in Michigan that made him rich. Retiring at the age of
45, he traveled throughout the world collecting art.
</P>
<P>
   Freer offered his collection of about 9,000 works to the
Smithsonian in 1904, but the institution's Board of Regents
hesitated to accept it because of conditions attached. They were
finally persuaded by President Theodore Roosevelt who met with them
and, pounding the arm of his chair, told them to accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Freer's bequest included money to house the collection in a new
building next to the Smithsonian's ``castle'' on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery's holdings now total 28,000 objects. The original
collection included art from the Near and Far East and a
distinguished group of works by American artists, notably James
McNeill Whistler, who was a friend of Freer's. One of the most
unusual is Whistler's ``Peacock Room,'' reassembled in the museum.
Of great importance to Biblical scholars are the museum's
5th-century Christian manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   The Freer Gallery and the adjoining 10-year-old Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery, devoted to Asian art, are located on Jefferson
Drive at 12th St. S.W. in Washington. They are open free to the
public every day but Dec. 25.

HOW TO ESCAPE THE DELUGE OF JUNK MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Graphic available on Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID UHLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Benjamin Franklin was only two-thirds right when
he noted that nothing in this world is certain but death and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He never got any junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   More politely referred to as direct mail, the mass-marketing
technique of unsolicited catalogs, advertisements and letters
(``Congratulations, Mr. Franklin! You've Won $30 Million!!!'')
hadn't yet been invented when the author, statesman and founding
father wrote about life's certainties in 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   If he had known about junk mail, perhaps old Ben _ who also
served as our country's first postmaster general _ might have done
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, plenty of cost-conscious consumers and coupon clippers
look forward to the daily flow of fliers, advertising slicks and
colorful catalogs in their mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, however, there are hundreds of books and
Internet sites that offer tips and tricks to stop direct mail,
telemarketing phone calls and unwanted computer e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can stop it,'' said Marc Eisenson, co-author of ``Stop
Junk Mail Forever'' (Telemarketing &AMP; Spam, Too). ``But you've got
to be vigilant and keep on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why junk mail keeps flowing and telephone solicitors
don't take ``no'' for an answer:
</P>
<P>
   _ Direct marketing in the United States yielded nearly $1.3
trillion in sales in 1997, according to a survey by the WEFA Group,
one of the world's largest economic information and consulting
firms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers responding to direct mail solicitations spent $244.3
billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1996, 62.1 percent of all women made a catalog sales
purchase, as did 50.6 of all men.
</P>
<P>
   You live, therefore you get junk mail. It's that simple.

RUSSIA'S MIDDLE CLASS FALLS WITH THE RUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MOSCOW _ Amid the carnage caused by Russia's economic collapse
_ the billion-dollar losses incurred by foreign investors, the
worldwide shock waves and the deepening domestic turmoil _ lies a
less obvious, but no less significant, casualty: Moscow's
middle-class dream.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of urban, upwardly mobile Muscovites suddenly
have found themselves out of work, and more are set to follow. That
is far more important to the mood of the country than the foreign
adventurers who have lost their well-paid jobs and the high-flying
oligarchs who have watched their financial empires crumble.
</P>
<P>
   The people who not long ago provided a ray of optimism in this
long-suffering country have suddenly fallen under a deep spell of
gloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so confident; I knew would happen tomorrow; I could
make plans. ... I could afford more and more,'' said Natalya, 25,
an executive at a public relations company that was booming weeks
ago but now is about to go bust. ``I got so used to it that I still
cannot accept that this is no longer the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the crisis, Russia did not have a middle class in
the American sense of a stable, prosperous majority. Crime,
corruption, political squabbling and bureaucratic inertia have
sapped efforts to reform Russia's economy and have left much of the
country no better off than they were under communism.
</P>
<P>
   But what Russia did have, especially in Moscow's booming
economy, was a gradually growing class of young professionals who
subscribed to many of the values of the middle class in Western
countries.
</P>
<P>
   These Russians found work at private companies that were
prohibited in the communist system, but which flourished after the
Soviet collapse in 1991. They earned salaries that allowed them to
spend their money in ways that were unavailable to all but a few
elites under communism.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike generations of Muscovites before them, but like their
counterparts elsewhere, these Russian yuppies had hard evidence
that with professionalism, hard work and dedication anyone could
write their own ticket to a better life.
</P>
<P>
   They dreamed of a Russia one day integrated with the league of
stable, prosperous democracies, and they saw themselves as a big
part of that future. Many Western policy makers and commentators
bought into that dream, predicting the inevitable expansion of
Moscow's middle-class values to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream vanished on Aug. 17, the day the Russian
government, facing bankruptcy, devalued the ruble and defaulted on
its foreign and domestic debts. The ensuing panic froze the
country's biggest banks, instantly wiping out the savings of
millions of people, halting business across nine time zones and
bringing in a government that is toying with the idea of bringing
back the state-controlled economy of the past. Moscow's optimistic
young generation of professionals was left its first taste of
failure and an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important psychological defeat. We thought we were
the masters of our own destiny,'' said Lena Porman, 28, whose job
as an importer of fine French wines dried up overnight as the
plunging ruble made imports too expensive. ``We thought everything
we dreamed of was just around the corner. Now it's hard to say what
will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Porman had a plan that was based on the idea that people would
always pay good money for someone who could tell a $2,000 bottle of
Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1961 from an ordinary Bordeaux. She saved
and invested wisely, or so she thought, until her earnings
disappeared on Aug. 17. She thought she would soon be able to
afford a new apartment, and someday start a business of her own.
And Porman, like a dozen other young Muscovites interviewed for
this story, firmly believed that Russia had a stable and
irreversible market economy.
</P>
<P>
   They thought so because Moscow's economy boomed despite the
street fighting in 1993 and the war in Chechnya, despite the wage
and pension arrears suffered in most regions outside the capital
since 1995, and despite the recent political instability caused by
President Boris N. Yeltsin's shaky health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to having a sick czar, to hearing gunfire, but
this is totally new,'' said Sergei Lysakov, 24, the deputy editor
of Russian Financial News, an agency that supplied business news to
financial companies working in Moscow. Right now, most of those
companies have shut down, and Russian Financial News is likely to
follow them. Lysakov was making $1,500 a month, over five times the
official average Russian wage. He just bought a new apartment,
which he has spent most of his money on furnishing. Now, he faces
unemployment, or, if he can latch onto a job, a huge pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as a shock to people whose lives have only improved
over the past few years: people like Stas Ivashkevich, 27, who
steadily worked his way up from the housekeeping department at a
Moscow hotel in 1993 to assistant manager at a new Holiday Inn that
was supposed to open outside the capital this year. Now the project
has been put on hold, and Ivashkevich's job is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to living freely and having money, we are used to
the idea we can go to the store and buy jeans,'' Ivashkevich said.
``It's hard to imagine standing in line for toilet paper.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no toilet paper shortages in Moscow yet. But other
certainties he has grown accustomed to have disappeared in the
crisis, such as a steady paycheck. Ivashkevich's employers are
paying him only a portion of his salary. Most companies that have
survived have begun cutting staff and slashing salaries and
benefits _ a practice no American middle-class workers would stand
for.
</P>
<P>
   But few Muscovites who have jobs dare challenge their employers.
One reason is that most professionals are paid a portion of their
salary under the counter, as part of employer schemes to avoid
payroll and income taxes. Another reason employees keep their
grievances to themselves is the uncertain job environment.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200,000 professionals have been laid off in Moscow,
and indications are that more layoffs will follow. At a recent job
fair in the capital, securities analysts and auditors who had been
pulling down salaries in the mid-five figures lined up for work in
factories, the city bus system or in other state-owned entities
that offered wages of about $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has a job spends his time worrying how long he will
keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the waiting that gets to you,'' said Oksana Pevnaya, 21,
an accountant with the struggling Russian oil major, Yukos, who was
recently laid off. ``After a while, you don't work. The last month,
everyone was waiting for the bad news, drinking a lot of coffee and
thinking about being unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pevnaya got the ax on Aug. 27, 10 days after the crisis began,
when her whole department was called to a meeting where their boss
gave them the news.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, she was lucky. Some of the firings over the past few
weeks have been much messier. One brokerage announced firings by
reading the unlucky employees' names over an intercom. At another
firm, workers checked their voice mail to find a message notifying
them that they were unemployed. The news magazine Itogi reported
that often, workers have shown up at their jobs to find their
offices sealed shut.
</P>
<P>
   Merciful as it was, Pevnaya's firing put a damper on her plans
for this fall to get married to Maxim Nechayev, 21, a sales manager
at the Moscow office of German consumer goods giant Bosch/Siemens.
So far, Nechayev still has his job _ Russians have rushed to buy
consumer goods as their faith in the ruble evaporates. But his
plans to seek a career in a multinational auditing firm are on
hold. So is that big honeymoon, and the apartment the two hoped to
buy; instead they will squeeze into her parents' apartment. And the
big victim is the young couple's belief in the stability of their
young lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out to be an illusion,'' Nechayev said. ``You can't
trust the government, you can't trust the banks. Nothing will ever
be the same.''

Russian income taxes.

<P>
   Natalya is a teller at the branch of Sberbank, the Russian state
savings bank, located directly on the floor below the state tax
inspectorate. This is a perfectly acceptable place to pay one's
personal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the reporter said. ``This is my tax payment. You have to
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalya rolled her eyes. A colleague clucked her tongue. Was
this guy nuts? No one in Russia pays taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then let's go spend it,'' she said, fairly seriously. ``Let's
go on a cruise. Let's buy a Mediterranean villa. Better we should
have it than one of our leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the reporter said, firmly. It wasn't that much _ about
$3,000. Then again, that's close to a year's salary for a teller at
Sberbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're so intent on throwing it away, then why not just
give it to me?'' Natalya insisted as the colleague nodded in
earnest. ``I won't tell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said the reporter, wearily.
</P>
<P>
   He goes through this every year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this year is special. Russia is in the midst of its worst
economic crisis since the collapse of communist rule in 1991. The
banking system is all but paralyzed, the national currency has lost
60 percent of its value, prices are soaring. The government is
essentially bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Tax collection, always lower than expected in Russia, has
plummeted, because the banks aren't working and it's become
difficult to pay, unless you like carrying large sums of cash
around to banks.
</P>
<P>
   But other than a few poor saps, most of them foreigners like our
reporter friend, pretty much no one is doing that. In this crisis,
Russians are rushing to do whatever they can to not pay. One reason
is that it is so easy to cheat. Most businesses keep two sets of
books, one for the tax inspector, one with the real numbers for the
protection rackets that you have to pay. Most private companies
employ various loopholes to allow their employees to avoid paying
taxes. One favorite tactic was to pay employees a small, official
sum, then make a deposit in a high-interest bank account in the
employee's name. The employee then received interest payments,
which were nontaxable, as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's last chief tax inspector, Boris Fyodorov, vowed to end
this practice. But Fyodorov was fired last week. The new tax boss,
Georgy Boos, has yet to make his plans known.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Boos does, there is another, more fundamental reason
why no one wants to pay: People avoid taxes in Russia because they
figure the state's going to get them anyway. Mother Russia wants
their money, usually in the form of bribes to one or several of her
employees. And then there is the sense many Russians like Natalya
have: that their tax ruble will be squandered on some high-ranking
official's Mediterranean villa.
</P>
<P>
   Some business people, it must be said, believed in the
government of former Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko. You remember
him: the boyish, inexperienced 35-year-old who nonetheless had some
serious plans for getting Russia's economy on track. But
Kiriyenko's government in August unexpectedly devalued the ruble
and defaulted on Russia's foreign and domestic debts, setting off
the current crisis. Just about everyone lost money. Confidence in
the Russian government, never high, is at an all-time low. An no
one expects anything but more pain from the new government of Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who can is getting his money out of the country,'' a
Moscow businessman said last week. ``Some people were starting to
run their businesses in a legitimate way, paying taxes and
everything, but that has ended now. No one believes anything the
government says anymore.''

GLOBE ERRED IN DENYING BARNICLE HIS SAY ON THE OP-ED PAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACK THOMAS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The exodus of Globe columnists Patricia Smith and Mike Barnicle
has been a bumpy ride for Boston, but keep your seat belts
fastened, because there's another turbulent chapter being written.
</P>
<P>
   By now most of the staff, and many readers, too, are exhausted
by the calamitous and mystifying sequence of events that forced the
newspaper to demand the resignation of two Metro columnists found
guilty of fabricating people and quotations.
</P>
<P>
   This story is a monster that refuses to die: A reporter from
American Journalism Review has been in Boston for interviews. The
Phoenix is preparing an update for Thursday. Boston magazine is on
the newsstand with another long-winded article. Club Passim in
Cambridge sold every ticket for Saturday's presentation of poetry
by Patricia Smith billed as an unflinching look at her resignation
and the firestorm that followed. Barnicle, meanwhile, turned up
again on David Brudnoy's talk show and on WBZ-TV to explain to Bob
Lobel why he's happy the Red Sox made the playoffs. He also popped
up as a guest on WGBH-TV's ``Greater Boston'' for what turned out
to be a flatulent interview with an obsequious Emily Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barnicle was accused of several violations of ethics,
what forced his resignation was a 1995 column that described two
boys with cancer who became friends at Children's Hospital in 1994.
As Barnicle told the story, after the death of the black child, the
white family gave the black parents a check for $10,000. The column
contained quotations by the parents. Challenged in August, Barnicle
conceded that he'd never spoken to anyone in the family and that
the story had been told to him by a hospital employee, now dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe demanded his resignation, and rightly so, for even if
the story proved true, Barnicle was guilty of dishonesty for making
up quotations and also for writing as though he had interviewed the
family.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, a newspaper in Maine discovered a case that
bore a resemblance to Barnicle's story, although the details were
dramatically different: the Maine family is white, not black; the
amount of the check was $5,000, not $10,000; the boy was 5, not 9;
he died in 1987, not 1994; the cause was heart disease, not cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming vindication, Barnicle submitted a column to the op-ed
page of the Globe maintaining that his original story had been
true, although flawed in the telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used my memory to tell an honest story,'' he wrote in the
column submitted to the Globe. ``But clearly, this cannot be done
any longer in a business intent on wearing a one-size-fits-all suit
of standards. Every single day, good journalists make honest
mistakes reporting news and the letters to the editor box is
swollen with complaints about inaccuracies. Does this mean
reporters fail to grasp the meaning of changing standards? Or is it
simply that they are human?''
</P>
<P>
   The new Barnicle column set off a debate. Some editors said it
should be printed because Patricia Smith had been afforded the
courtesy of a goodbye column in which she apologized for her
misdeeds, although less penitently that many had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Others editors said no, that the Barnicle column added little
new information, that Barnicle's argument was specious. Moreover,
while Smith had acknowledged her transgression, Barnicle insisted
he had done nothing wrong and that, indeed, he was the victim
because his personal and professional life had been savaged for
what he called a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the publisher, Benjamin Taylor, decided the column
would not be printed. A few days later, Barnicle attempted to have
the column published in a full-page advertisement for which he was
willing to pay $36,000. The publisher vetoed that idea, too.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Globe not to make the Barnicle column
available to readers _ preferably on the op-ed page but at least as
an advertisement _ is a misjudgment for four reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, Barnicle deserves no less an opportunity to explain
himself in a final column than Patricia Smith. It makes no
difference whether he admits to sin or not. The op-ed page is not a
confessional.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the fear that publication of the column would expose
readers to an unreasonable argument serves to underestimate
readers. From time to time they are exposed to unreasonable
arguments on Globe editorial pages without losing their capacity to
judge right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Third, by not publishing the Barnicle column the Globe sows
doubt even among loyal readers who may wonder whether the newspaper
has something to hide or whether the newspaper lacks the confidence
to defend its decision.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the Globe has an honorable history of opening its
pages even to those with ideas that are disagreeable, offensive,
even wrong, and that is a reputation rigorously to be guarded.
</P>
<P>
   If the Globe cannot bring itself to provide space on the op-ed
page for Barnicle's column, it cannot in good conscience deny him
the right to express his thoughts in an advertisement. The Globe
could take Barnicle's $36,000, double it, and donate the sum to a
local university to be used to finance an annual conference on
ethics in journalism that would serve to remind all of us of our
allegiance to truth and to the First Amendment.

ICE LEFT MARK ON NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST BASE, Maine _ There's a remote blueberry field here that
was once prime beachfront property, as its flat, wide-open sandy
expanse ringed by woods attests. But that was a long, long time
ago. Today, this sandy beach _ the remains of a river delta flowing
into the Atlantic _ sits 260 feet above sea level and about 10
miles in from the coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best-preserved elevated shoreline in the
East,'' says geologist Harold Borns of the University of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   It is a graphic reminder of an era 12,000 years ago when the
Laurentide ice sheet that had blanketed North America for 100,000
years suddenly began to melt, dramatically raising the sea level
and pushing the ocean farther and farther inland. At the peak of
its advance, the Atlantic's waves reached nearly to the foot of Mt.
Katahdin, now almost 100 miles inland.
</P>
<P>
   This remote place got its name of East Base back in the 1850s
when Jefferson Davis, before he became the president of the
Confederacy, was a surveyor mapping the Maine coast and chose it as
the eastern end of a long survey baseline. But the unusual expanse
of flat, open meadow amid millions of acres of forest probably
attracted the attention of almost every human visitor to the
region; native Americans may have been harvesting blueberries here
millenia before the first Europeans arrived _ and may even have
noted its beachlike topography.
</P>
<P>
   It is not, however, the only place in the region marked by
seemingly out-of-place topography. New England's hills and fields
are etched with the story of glaciers advancing and retreating,
features intriguing enough to draw the attention of a group of 100
glaciologists, geologists and other scientists who last month
toured the coast while attending a conference on Antarctica at the
University of Maine in Orono. They were closely examining
formations that may help them better understand the geological
features that are being sculpted today by retreating glaciers
everywhere from Alaska to the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   The kinds of details they were looking at in the Maine soil may
play a part in unravelling questions that could have a bearing on
our future. Geologists believe the behavior of the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet, for example, may be critically affected by the precise
characteristics of the loose material underneath it _ material
similar to that left behind by glaciers as they retreated from New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent of the region's glacial remains are a series of
moraines _ straight ridges of sand and rock that run in dozens of
mostly-parallel lines along a strip 10 to 30 miles wide that hugs
the coast _ each marking a temporary edge of the vast ice sheet, as
it paused briefly in its fitful episodes of advance and retreat.
Like a conveyor belt, the glacier left these long piles of debris
behind as it slowly backed away.
</P>
<P>
   Similar features are seen throughout New England; the islands of
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, as well as Cape Cod itself, are
made up of moraines left at the ice sheet's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of Maine's roads are built along the crests of these
moraines, which provide high, straight and well-drained ridgelines
that extend for miles. But to the geologists, their complex
arrangements and cross-sections, occasionally exposed in a gravel
pit or a road cut, are a textbook _ albeit a sometimes cryptic one
_ on the dynamics of the glacier's centuries of back-and-forth
movements.
</P>
<P>
   After the sea rose and surged inland with the melting glaciers,
it then began a swift retreat _ not because the sea level sank
again, but because the land, relieved of the pressure of a layer of
ice two miles thick, began to rise. As it rebounded, it pushed the
seashore back, past its present boundary and far out onto the
continental shelf. Then, as the land stabilized, the rising sea
again began to move inland, slowly advancing to its present
position.
</P>
<P>
   The recent history of the sea's rise can be read in the dozens
of river estuaries along the Maine coast. As early as 1632, farmers
built dikes along these estuaries, enclosing fields to keep out the
saltwater so they could harvest hay and send it by barge to sell in
Boston's Haymarket.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the old dikes can be dated precisely through town
records, and their changing levels over the years give a precise
chronology of the changes in sea level. Borns and his colleagues
have found that one stretch of northern Maine, for example, has
been sinking at the rate of three feet per century _ a rate more
rapid than anywhere else in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   For scientists trying to decipher the meaning of changes in the
world's ice sheets today, and to forecast what they may portend for
changes in sea level over the coming centuries, understanding the
sequence of events and how quickly changes took place during the
glacial retreat in New England could provide important insights.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat of the Ice Age glaciers very closely resembled the
process that many geologists fear could someday happen in West
Antarctica. ``How soon can it happen, and how fast can it happen?''
asks Terence Hughes, a specialist in glacial movements at the
University of Maine. It's clear that dramatic changes in sea level
took place here over a span of a few thousand years, but recent
evidence suggests that much of the change may actually have taken
place in short, far more rapid bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Studying the retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet from North
America at the end of the last Ice Age may help to provide some
answers. And, says Hughes, ``the record of its collapse is right
here in these fields.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is natural to want to hang a ``monster'' sign
around the neck of David Cash Jr., to disavow any connection
between him and the rest of the human race. And, because there is
no law with which to punish him, it is instinctive to hope that he
somehow disappears from our midst as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old sophomore at the University of California at
Berkeley seems a perfect candidate for societal abandonment, a man
beyond our capabilities to, as Shelley put it, ``forgive wrongs
darker than death or night.'' Guilty of an unfathomable failure of
morality, David Cash remains remorseless and without regret.
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, 1997, in a Las Vegas casino women's room, Cash
watched from an adjacent toilet stall as his best friend restrained
a struggling 7-year-old girl and smothered her screams with one
hand. Although he has altered his story since, saying he never
believed the child's life was in danger, Cash earlier told a Nevada
grand jury: ``I didn't know what to expect _ something bad. I
probably feared the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cash walked out of the restroom and left 7-year-old Sherrice
Iverson to her fate: sexual molestation and death by strangulation.
According to two of Cash's former high school pals, Cash told them
he watched the sexual molestation. Cash himself told Nora Zamichow
of the Los Angeles Times that, just before he and his friend,
Jeremy Strohmeyer, joined Cash's father for a car ride back to the
young men's homes in Long Beach, Cash asked his friend if Sherrice
had been sexually aroused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you ask if the little girl was aroused?'' the Times
reporter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, it's just the way I think,'' Cash answered.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Strohmeyer pleaded guilty to Sherrice's molestation
and murder, and received a life sentence without possibility of
parole. Cash, who committed no crime by refusing to interfere and
by staying silent about the murder, has meanwhile managed to
fashion himself into a one-dimensional cut-out of a fiend. On radio
talk shows, in newspaper interviews, alongside an even-handed but
quietly horrified Ed Bradley during ``60 Minutes,'' the young man
continues to reveal his personal moral vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   He says he feels sorrier for Strohmeyer than for the murdered
child _ after all, he didn't know her. He once said his newfound
notoriety makes it easier to ``score with women.'' He says he just
wants to get on with his life, majoring in, of all things, nuclear
engineering. He says if he had it to do over again, he'd make the
same choices.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Cash turns his pale, unexceptional face to the world
and does not say, ``I'm sorry, I did a horrible thing,'' the easier
he is to hate, the more we want to wash our hands of him. Clearly,
this boy-man is not lying or in denial; he does not believe he did
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After Cash's ``60 Minutes'' appearance, local television
stations interviewed many of his fellow students. Their reactions
spanned the emotional spectrum, from outrage to indifference. One
thoughtful young man told a TV reporter: ``There is something real
wrong with this guy. He needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he does. Further, we as a society need for him to be
helped. A civilized, healthy society comprised not just of human
animals, but of conscious, moral human beings, needs for David Cash
to comprehend the enormity of his moral breach and to stagger under
the burden of that understanding. We need to witness this more than
we need any physical punishment (legal or vigilante) that might now
be exacted on him. We certainly need it more than we need for him
to ``put this behind'' him, masquerade as a normal person and take
an undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But who will help Cash? Who will try to invade and break open
his frozen heart? Who will attempt to find his soul? If his parents
were up to the job, we likely would have seen something of them by
now. It appears they have not stepped forward to publicly denounce
their son or reaffirm their love for him. Their absence _ as their
boy digs himself in deeper on the talk shows, in the newspaper
interviews, on ``60 Minutes'' _ indicates their impotence, gross
stupidity or suspect moral integrity.
</P>
<P>
   So, to whom does the task fall? Is Cash's best hope for
comprehending what he has done tucked away in organized religion?
In legitimate psychotherapy? Somewhere in the great public
University of California? Isn't there someone among us, some group
of people, who understands what is wrong with David Cash Jr. and
has the experience or expertise to attempt to reach him?
</P>
<P>
   God knows, any member of the human race has the moral authority
to try.

CALIFORNIA SHAKES UP PRIMARY SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the past 14 years, the presidential campaign
has been dominated by the mostly Southern, mostly conservative
Super Tuesday primary vote. The results now seem predictable: White
House terms for two conservative Republicans, Ronald Reagan and
George Bush, and two terms for one Southern Democrat, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But with the stroke of a pen by California Governor Pete Wilson,
the presidential campaign has been radically altered. On March 7,
2000, just two weeks after the New Hampshire primary, a mighty,
mostly moderate bicoastal conglomeration of states is slated to
hold primaries that could go a long way toward determining the
nominees of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   While some New England officials expressed horror that
California will be voting on the same day as five ``Yankee Day''
states, the end result might help a moderate Republican or
Democrat, who has done well in the region but has not made as big
an impact on the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as sometimes happens with changing political rules,
the result might turn out to be the opposite of what is intended.
</P>
<P>
   The change might make it impossible for all but well-funded
candidates to compete, giving a sizable advantage to wealthy
candidates like Steve Forbes, who financed his own campaign in
1996. A lesser-funded newcomer, on the other hand, would find it
difficult to gain notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that this will change the world,'' Republican
consultant Stuart Stevens said. ``The question is, what is this
world going to look like? I imagine the people happiest about this
is someone like Steve Forbes, a checkbook candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if Wilson runs in 2000, and some of his allies
privately said he backed the primary plan to boost his chances,
then he would automatically be considered a ``favorite son''
candidate. That might prompt other prospects to write off the
state. Still, such a scenario could boost Wilson into the
front-runner category, if only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   The new primary schedule also affects Democrats. Vice President
Al Gore, probably the best-known and best-funded candidate, is such
an obvious beneficiary of the new calendar that many suspect he
helped engineer the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my adversaries in California have made it clear this
is a Gore initiative,'' said Massachusetts Secretary of State
William Galvin, who tried unsuccessfully to talk California
officials out of moving up the primary date.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides have said the vice president has nothing to do with
the California primary schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible Democratic beneficiary is Senator John F.
Kerry, who would be expected to do well in New England and also
might find a constituency in California and other states voting on
March 7. If Kerry taps the fortune of his wife, Teresa Heinz, he
could run a well-financed campaign blitz. Kerry has not ruled out
using his wife's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, this would be a strategic asset for John,'' said
John Marttila, a longtime Kerry adviser. ``His record and
background would have great appeal in a state like California ...
and he has raised a lot of money out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the downside, Marttila said, is ``the fantastic pressure it
will put on fund-raising. This would give Gore an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the advantage of the March 7 grouping may be
overblown for Democrats. After all, former Massachusetts Governor
Michael Dukakis won the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988
under the old schedule that emphasized Southern conservative
states.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact is expected to be on the Republican side
because of the opening it may provide for moderates who have fared
poorly in recent presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   If a moderate Republican such as William Weld had been drawing a
campaign game plan, he could hardly have come up with a better
scenario. Under the current plan, the 10 to 12 states that plan to
participate on March 7 are uniquely suited to boost a possible
candidate such as Weld or Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule also would benefit Texas Governor George W. Bush,
due partly to his name recognition and funding. The goveror also
could begin his campaign as a centrist who would not have to move
to the right during the Southern primaries, a strategy that would
help in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The March 7 primary tentatively includes all the New England
states except New Hampshire, as well as California, New York,
Maryland, Colorado, and Georgia. Moreover, Wilson is trying to get
Oregon and Washington to join in, creating a Pacific primary on the
same day as a big Northeast vote.

ANTICHOICE REPUBLICANS PLAY DANGEROUS GAMES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON -- More scenes from Newt Gingrich's dysfunctional
House:
</P>
<P>
   _Late Thursday evening, the forces of revolution and anarchy
inside the conservative movement's tent were able to prevent
legislation paying for the basic operations of the government from
even coming to a final vote. The measure split the Republican
majority more than in half, with the antis in control for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   _Well into Friday, legislation paying for the country's farm
programs, including special assistance for drought and other
economic disaster victims, languished among Senate and House
negotiators. The intransigent bad guys, as usual, were members of
Gingrich's perpetually petulant majority.
</P>
<P>
   And in both these cases of Marx Brothers government, the major
reason was the same: the dirty, petty, increasingly vicious,
so-called politics of abortion. While one bunch of Gingrich's
majority is obsessed with investigating sex, another seems equally
obsessed with regulating sex and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's problem got a certain amount of media attention
because it combined cruelty with absurdity in an effort to keep
female federal employees from having access to health insurance
plans offering contraceptive services. This bit of government
micromanagement of family life would have occurred at the same time
federal worker insurance plans are competing without right-wing
interference to offer sexually excited guys coverage for their
Viagra pills.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an effort led by Representative Nita Lowey, Democrat
of New York, this attempt has so far gone nowhere and, thanks to
Thursday's chaotic vote, is even less likely to, which one hopes
will permit more attention to focus on the far more pernicious
politics being played with the agriculture legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In this behind-the-scenes fight, the bad guy is Dr. Tom Coburn,
Republican of Oklahoma, who dishonors the Muskogee-based seat held
for a decade by an independent populist adept at bipartisanship,
the late Mike Synar. Coburn's Web site includes a lengthy account
of his activities in promotion of abstinence, but his real work is
in subversion of a woman's constitutional right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's latest game is to attach to the farm bill a provision
barring the Food and Drug Administration from doing research,
testing, or anything else (including approval for sale) involving
drugs ``for the chemical inducement of abortion.'' It passed the
House narrowly in June, and supporters refused to let the overall
bill go forward to final passage without it. The Republicans gave
up late Friday, but only after loud protests that they were
delaying aid to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   This is an excellent example of what happens when political
movement language gets into legislation. Another is the political
invention of ``partial birth abortion.'' And in neither case is the
remedy proposed targeted on the outrage claimed by right-to-lifers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of late-term abortion methods, the bill Clinton
successfully vetoed would have invaded medical decisions early in
pregnancy, and ignored health consequences for women later on _
both concepts being flagrantly illegal under Roe v. Wade and
regularly found to be so by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In Coburn's case, his proposal may appear aimed at the
abortifacient drug RU-486, but its blunderbuss impact would be much
wider. Opponents, led by Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of
Connecticut, have marshaled an impressive array of evidence _ from
drug companies, the FDA, and the medical community _ that Coburn
would end up targeting drugs whose side effects as opposed to
purpose can include miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, as DeLauro has summarized these professional
views, we're now talking about pregnant women with cancer who
undergo a broad variety of chemotherapy treatments; we also could
be talking hypertension, cirrhosis, arthritis, venous thrombosis,
ulcers, epilepsy, uterine fibrosis, ectopic pregnancies, and severe
viral infections. In addition, De Lauro said his proposal would
strip the FDA of its important responsibility to monitor research
and testing the drug companies themselves do on potential new
products designed to induce miscarriages without surgical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   For all those reasons, it is very hard to imagine anything like
the Coburn monstrosity becoming law. Such a prediction is even
easier in the case of the contraceptive insurance coverage issue,
because both houses of Congress are already on record in support.
</P>
<P>
   However, the real point is the increasing bitterness of
antichoice politics, and the extent to which Gingrich's House
enables the movement's obstructionism. Playing legislative games
with flagrantly illegal and cruel proposals that single out
vulnerable people attempting to exercise a constitutional right is
beneath contempt.

WORLD TURNS SPOTLIGHT   ON A PRECARIOUS BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ The world is watching to see if Brazil can
avoid fiscal disaster. If it falls, it will take with it many of
the regional economies and further threaten a global market
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was expected to defeat his
nearest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, easily. ``He's the one
who fixed the economy before and he's the best one to fix it
again,'' said Adalberto Moreisa, a 27-year-old electronics store
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   The last three months have brought Carnaval-like gyrations to
its $800 billion economy, the world's eighth largest. The country's
financial market, the Bovespa, has lost more than 30 percent of its
value since the beginning of the year. Interest rates have more
than doubled, to over 50 percent, and foreign investors have pulled
out more than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the early market panic in August was, as officials here
argued, a result of the crises in Asia and Russia. But Brazil's own
flaws have become more apparent as it has moved into the world
spotlight, and preserving its economy has become a leading topic
among President Clinton and other world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some gains in privatization and economic policies, the
government deficit has mushroomed to $100 billion. The currency,
most agree, is overvalued. And the gap between the wealthy and the
poor has become the largest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how quickly Cardoso can unite a fragmented Brazilian
Congress _ notorious for its horse-trading members who seldom
follow party lines _ to pass badly needed constitutional reforms to
reduce the country's whopping deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the fiscal adjustments we need to make depend on how
quickly we can get constitutional reform,'' said Jose Antonio Pena
Garcia, chief economist for BankBoston in Brazil. ``Reform takes
longer here because the president has to negotiate with different
parties and with different interests within the same party.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 parties have at least one representative in
Congress, and politicians switch their affiliations regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso, a former Marxist and now member of the center-left
Social Democratic Party, needs a strong showing by his five-party
centrist coalition to push through constitutional reforms necessary
to lure back frightened investors who have withdrawn billions of
dollars over the last two months and to bolster the country's
shaken currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to privatization and administrative reforms that
were adopted in the 1988 constitution, and to a currency
stabilization plan that Cardoso implemented in 1994, Brazil has
enjoyed several consecutive years of economic growth and lower
inflation. But federal spending has risen dramatically, and Brazil
now runs a deficit equaling 7 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   To cut the deficit, the Cardoso administration has promised to
deliver three major constitutional amendments. The first would
alter civil service rules to trim payrolls by requiring workers to
be evaluated and fired if they fail their reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The second amendment would reduce Brazil's generous social
security and pension system, which now absorbs about 1 percent of
GDP and carries a $24 billion deficit, by capping benefits and
requiring workers to contribute more to help pay for the growing
number of recipients who are living longer.
</P>
<P>
   The third and most controversial plan would simplify the
nation's tax structure and shift a larger percentage of costs for
services to state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil imposes about 60 different taxes. This makes tax evasion
easy and pervasive, according to Pena. Although the 1988
constitution provided the provinces with millions of dollars in
additional funds, many locally distributed services, such as health
care, remain heavily subsidized by federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts believe Cardoso can pursuade the Senate,
which is generally pro-Cardoso, to approve the proposals. Eleven
days ago, leaders of the Senate and lower Chamber of Deputies stood
with Cardoso and backed the amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, however, may be among the rank-and-file members
of the lower house, where there is a larger and more vocal
opposition from the left, and from many of the 5,500 municipal
leaders who don't want to shoulder more expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working hard to reduce our expenses, and this is
the opposite of what we're fighting for,'' said Sao Paulo Mayor
Celso Pitta do Nascimento. ``We mayors make a strong group, and we
won't let this pass easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the reforms offer dire warnings if the
measures are not passed soon: Investors who have deserted the
markets will stay away, interest rates will continue to skyrocket,
and the real will spiral downward.
</P>
<P>
   David Cleary, a historian at Harvard University, said that a
currency crisis might be the catalyst needed to unite Brazil's
assorted political interests. ``The left-wing will likely make lots
of noise, but the people are worried about losing the gains of the
past few years,'' Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the real is overvalued, but there is no
consensus about how much it needs to be adjusted. (Currently, $1 US
equals about 1.20 reais.) Economists have predicted devaluations
ranging from 10 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation would hurt the United States, which sells a fifth
of its exports to Brazil, because US products would become more
expensive for Brazilian consumers. And the United States is
Brazil's top trading partner after the European Union. Any drop in
the real will also affect other Latin American markets, especially
Argentina and Mexico, which like Brazil have tried hard in recent
years to attract and keep investors' dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Brazil's 163 million people fear that any help from
foreign sources such as the International Monetary Fund would come
with the brutal discipline they experienced in the 1980s, when the
IMF bailed them out from triple-digit inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy A. Bush, a banking analyst and senior vice president
at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. in New Jersey, said Brazil's climate is far
different from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political situation is stronger now and officials are
being more honest,'' Bush said. ``There are problems, but it's not
like we saw before when even the country's leaders were sending
their own capital out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there are different financing plans being discussed for
Brazil, notably a $30 billion loan package from the IMF, the US
Federal Reserve, and private banks. But the Cardoso administration
has not yet publicly asked for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso may make such a request this week if he avoids a runoff
election for a second four-year term by winning at least 51 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Any backlash against the incumbent over a currency devaluation
or a stiff IMF package probably will not last long. Unlike
Indonesia's Suharto, who was forced from office because of the
economic crisis, or Russia's Boris N. Yeltsin, whose power has been
severely diminished, Cardoso still enjoys broad popularity,
especially among the country's poorer residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fernando Henrique was the one who strengthened us when we were
weak,'' said Elza dos Santos, a Sao Paulo street vendor. ``We'll
have to see if he can make another miracle happen.''

IF GOP GAINS 5 US SENATE SEATS, DEMOCRATS' HOPES SMOKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In next month's election, the key number is five.
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans gain an additional five US Senate seats on
Nov. 3, they will have 60 _ the number needed to shut off floor
debate and pass whatever bills they want.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Senate Democrats can endlessley debate, or
filibuster, any measure they view as truly objectionable. The
threat of a filibuster is often enough to prompt Republicans to
compromise on, or even abandon, measures that have strong, unified
Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the media's focus has been on whether the
Democrats will win a few more seats in the House of Representatives
_ or maybe even regain control there _ the higher stakes are in the
Senate, where 60 seats are in striking range of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, Democrats were to gain five Senate seats,
they would regain control of the chamber. And that, of course,
could stop the GOP agenda in its tracks, and could provide an
opportunity for Democrats to get their bills passed and signed into
law by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   These five seats are also important to his future. This
election, as both parties suggest, is a referendum on whether the
GOP has gone too far in its efforts to humiliate Clinton, as it has
proceeded toward an impeachment inquiry. Democratic victories will
answer ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why the president, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and many
other key Democrats are making an all-out effort to bolster their
party's chances of gaining seats in the House and, at the very
least, stop the GOP from adding five Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   For organized labor and working families, the loss of five
Senate seats to the GOP could be disastrous. That GOP majority
could pass the so-called Team Employees and Management Act _ or
TEAM Act _ which would replace strong unions with very weak, sham
company unions. Not to mention other legislation, already filed,
denying workers overtime pay until they had worked 80 hours in a
week, rather than 40.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican 60-seat majority could repeal the Davis-Bacon Act,
which has long protected the prevailing wage for public
construction projects. With this repeal, the average nationwide
prevailing wage of $30,000 could be reduced even further.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a strengthened GOP could pass legislation weakening
labor's ability to help raise money for its congressional
supporters, or to counter misleading GOP advertising campaigns
aimed at passing anti-union legislation, including a bill that
would abolish the right of workers to organize into a union.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, a 60-40 GOP majority could help Republicans
pass bills that would allow the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration to fine workers, not employers, for safety
violations _ and exempt employers from complying with OSHA laws.
</P>
<P>
   Pension funds could be raided by employers, and social security
could be privatized. Any Democratic efforts to pass bills aimed at
significantly improving family access to affordable health care
would likely be doomed.
</P>
<P>
   The list of potential disasters goes on and on. But some
Democrats are focusing not only on how they can prevent the loss of
five seats, but also on how to win five seats _ and regain control
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fund-raising
letter, political director Steve Hildebrand suggests several
scenarios to ``Take Back the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hildebrand writes that of the 34 Senate seats being contested
this year, 14 are held by Republicans, 15 by Democrats and five are
``open'' _ that is, with no incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic scenario involves these states:
</P>
<P>
   _Arkansas _ where an open seat is being sought by Democrat
Blanche Lambert Lincoln, a former two-term congresswoman, and
Republican Fay Boozman, a conservative who, according to
Hildebrand, is viewed as being ``to the right of Jesse Helms'' and
is considered extreme even by many Republicans. A Democratic
committee poll this summer gave Lincoln a 31-point lead over
Boozman.
</P>
<P>
   _Indiana _ where an open seat is being sought by two-term
Governor Evan Bayh, a Democrat, and Paul Hemke, a Republican. Bayh,
Hildebrand writes, ``is well-positioned to win this race.''
</P>
<P>
   _Colorado _ where GOP incumbent Ben Nighthorse Campbell is
challenged by Democrat Dottie Lamm, wife of Richard Lamm, the
former governor. Campbell's campaign reportedly suffers ``from his
highly-publicized switch to the Republican Party after winning the
1992 election as a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   _Georgia _ where Republican incumbent Paul Coverdell, considered
by Democrats to be vulnerable because of his ultraconservative
stands, is up against Michael Coles, a businessman who ran a
credible race against House Speaker Newt Gingrich two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _Missouri _ where a popular Democratic hopeful, Attorney General
Jay Nixon, is challenging incumbent Senator Kit Bond.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee hopes
to raise enough money to help reelect 15 incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   As Hildebrand and other Democrats know, it will be difficult to
regain control of the Senate, particularly in this, an off year.
But with enough financial support, some Democrats could make the
new class elected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining some of these five ``best bet'' Senate seats would, at
the very least, offset other losses. But even if the Democrats fail
to gain any seats, keeping the number at 55-45 would at least
assure that the Democratic debate goes on.
</P>
<P>
   That is a far better outcome than seeing the GOP boost its
strength by that key number five.

CLINTON TAKES BOWS, BUT OTHERS HELPED CREATE BUDGET SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens when the Federal Reserve Bank orchestrates a $3.65
billion rescue of a failed hedge fund? What would have happened if
the Fed had not intervened in the meltdown of Long Term Capital
Management? What will happen as a result of the Fed's intervention?
These questions haunt financial markets today and raise a larger
issue that affects the culture of American politics. That issue is
known as moral hazard.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple concept. To quote The Wall Street Journal, moral
hazard is a ``term the financial community uses to describe the
distortions introduced by the prospect of not having to pay for
your sins, in this case financial ones. The prospect of government
bailouts leads to abandonment of credit standards and assessments.
As moral hazard grows, you get a market so skewed by the
expectations of bailouts that vital signs about genuine risk no
longer get through. Eventually, the danger turns into one of
systemic collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps appropriate that the collapse of Long Term Capital
Management was brought about by Russia's default on its financial
obligations last month. Long Term Capital had 8 percent (or as much
as $125 billion, depending on how you count the value of derivative
financial products) of its highly leveraged funds in Russia, not
because it thought Russia was a good investment, but rather because
it thought Russia too big to fail. Prior to the default, Russia was
literally printing money to meet its obligations. Cross-border
investors were reaping huge returns.
</P>
<P>
   Long Term Capital bet billions of dollars on a morally hazardous
certainty: that the United States and the International Monetary
Fund would always come to the rescue of an economically perilous
country with thousands of potentially ``loose'' nuclear warheads.
Russia's default made that certainty uncertain, and within days
margin calls came raining down on Long Term Capital's Greenwich,
Conn., headquarters. Long Term Capital sold what it could to meet
its obligations, but after selling the good stuff, it was left with
a ton of useless paper. No one would buy it, at any price. And the
game was over.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve did the right thing in jawboning Long Term
Capital's creditors into becoming a consortium of cash infusion.
Allowing Long Term Capital to collapse might have spelled disaster
for the world's financial system and completely undone the market
for derivative products. An orderly liquidation of the hedge funds
portfolio over three years allows the financial markets to regain
their balance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that in so doing, the Fed has re-raised the issue
of moral hazard. In a recent post on the financial news Web site
thestreet.com, David Kansas wrote that Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin, prior to Long Term Capital's collapse, believed that moral
hazard had diminished as an issue, ``primarily because a lot of
those who invested in more speculative projects in places like
Russia and Asia have already suffered steep losses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting,'' Rubin told Kansas, ``if you look at what
happened to investors and creditors and others over the past year.
Enormous losses have been sustained, so the moral hazard issue that
people have been concerned about is not nearly as potent as it used
to be because people have taken the kinds of losses that hopefully
will induce more careful investment and credit extension.'' Rubin
went on to say that moral hazard issues will not stand in the way
of the United States providing ``national assistance where it is
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing national assistance where it is needed makes sense,
especially in those cases where US national security interests are
involved. Organizing the rescue of a private hedge fund, the very
definition of a risky financial vehicle, is another matter
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, no public monies were involved. Yes, it is true that the
rescue scheme is better than watching $50 trillion of derivative
products chain react and come home to roost. And yes, it is true
that Long Term Capital Management's partners are forever disgraced
and face the real possibility of prosecution under the Federal Wire
Fraud Act.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, the signal sent by the Federal Reserve's
intervention says that the rules that apply to the rest of us do
not apply to certain elites. Any other hedge fund would have been
shut down by Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch in a three-minute phone
call. Long Term Capital gets a cash infusion of $3.65 billion and
is allowed to continue to charge a management fee that would make
Fidelity blush.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has been sending this signal for a long time, but
with heightened frequency of late. The most noxious recent example
of Washington moral hazard is, of course, the contention that
President Clinton should not be impeached for perjury, obstruction
of justice, and misuse of executive power because he has a high job
performance rating in public opinion polls. The effect of all this
on the body politic is toxic. It teaches people to believe that
they can never be too cynical.

A STAR IN WAITING: TALENTS TUG AT TEEN'S FUTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWCASTLE, Wash. _ As a little girl _ not long ago _ Vicki Noon
used to clown around for home videos, pretending to be Ariel of
``The Little Mermaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ariel on her seaside rock, Vicki would climb atop her bunk
bed and sing achingly in her bright, powerful voice about being
``part of your world.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki is 13 now, and if she became part of our world any faster,
she'd risk getting the bends.
</P>
<P>
   After just a year or so of voice lessons, the Newcastle
eighth-grader has already landed three plum roles, including the
juvenile lead in Seattle's A Contemporary Theatre's fall production
of ``Violet.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, which runs Oct. 22 through Nov. 15, won the 1997 New
York Critics Circle Award for best musical.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Vicki won lead roles in two musicals at the Washington
Academy of Performing Arts. The fast-growing Redmond school was
co-founded by Deborah Hadley, former prima ballerina with Pacific
Northest Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, a last-minute cast change thrust Vicki into the
role of Dorothy in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' giving her less than five
days to learn a part that normally takes Academykarin: i left
Academy up all the way through because i think it's needed for
clarity--pat students a month or two to prepare. In late August, on
a less frantic note, she played the rags-to-riches heroine of
``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki is still a little girl in lots of many ways _
freckle-faced, with a thatch of dark, chin-length hair, and glasses
she wears everywhere except onstage. At 5-foot-3, she packs 105
pounds of coiled energy into the compact body of an athlete _
hidden somewhere under her baggy overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she's a kid who has just discovered she's got talent
that could land her on top of the world. The joy of performing
makes her feel like she's already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes me happy,'' Vicki said, face glowing. ``I love
it. I think it's so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, she faces tough career choices. On one hand, theater
pros say she has the raw, oversized talent to make it on Broadway.
Some compare her to the young Judy Garland, although there's no
trace of Garland's fragility in Vicki's bubbly personality and
clarion vocal style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime voice,'' said Jerry Tassin, one of
her Academy mentors. ``This girl has a set of pipes I have not
heard in years. It's a Broadway belt, is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Her singing coach, Ann Evans Zavada, said that in 10 years of
teaching, she has had only two other students of Vicki's caliber,
neither of whom has lived up to their early promise. One was
sidetracked by her social life. The other was a boy soprano who
sang with Seattle Opera until his voice changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Vicki has a clearer understanding of the professional
world and what she needs to do to be involved in it,'' Zavada said.
``And she wants to be involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Vicki also is a nearly straight-A student and
a star soccer player who, according to her coach, could make it to
the U.S. Women's Team if she weren't distracted by pipe dreams.
Last season she scored 23 of her team's 67 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit,'' said Norm Robinson, coach of her Gold
Select youth team in Renton. ``Her dribbling skills are incredible.
She has good ball control and she's fast. She has great moves.''
</P>
<P>
   But with theater work stealing time from soccer practice,
Robinson is pressing her to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a little girl with a lot of talent who's getting pulled
in two different directions,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouoyant, twinkly-eyed and still innocent enough to be thrilled
by her good fortune, Vicki is frank about her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be on Broadway,'' she said with a happy giggle.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big leap for a girl who, three years ago, was too shy to
sing in a talent show on a vacation cruise. Instead, she joined a
lip-synch contest for adult women _ and won, putting body and soul
into a pantomime of Aretha Franklin's signature song, ``Respect.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year of song and dance training _ with many more to come
_ she has the erect, grounded posture of a gymnast and holds the
stage with quiet confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really nice to have around,'' said Kira Tassin, 14, who
appeared with her in ``Oz'' and ``Annie,'' ``because sometimes when
we have to run through something again, she makes a joke of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blowing off steam at an early rehearsal for ``Annie'' one day,
Vicki and another girl briefly hammed it up behind the director's
back during a boy's vocal solo.
</P>
<P>
   Threading through the darkened rows of seats, the two girls
shimmied in tandem _ arms outspread, shoulders gyrating in a broad,
chorus-girl sendup. Onstage, the cast cracked up.
</P>
<P>
   Director Kelly Willis whirled around _ long, red hair whipping.
She laughed, then admonished ``Vicki, sit down!''
</P>
<P>
   But it's all business now for Vicki, who's in rehearsal for
ACT's production of ``Violet.'' The show features two veterans of
last fall's New York premiere _ Lauren Ward, who originated the
adult lead role of Violet, and director Susan H. Schulman.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1964, it tells of a young mountain woman who sets out by
bus for Tulsa in hopes of finding a television evangelist who can
heal her disfigured face. Joined by two unlikely traveling
companions, Violet finally comes to understand her own strength and
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In flashbacks, Vicki plays the young Violet, who is maimed when
her father accidentally hits her in the face with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only in about five scenes,'' said Vicki, who crammed for
her audition during a half-hour with Willis, using the
International Phonetic Alphabet to master a passable Southern
accent. She also twanged her way through the song, ``Delta Dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ACT casting director Margaret Layne said Vicki seems to produce
her powerful vocals without effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense she's pushing to get the volume she does,''
Layne said. ``There's no straining. It's as natural as breathing.
She has a big, bright, unmannered voice that you can't listen to
without smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   She also projects uncanny self-confidence for such a rank
beginner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicki does one of the most poised auditions that I've ever
seen anyone do,'' Layne said. ``She's very relaxed. I think a lot
of that has to do with the support she gets from her family. They
do a lot to help her keep things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki and her sister, Andrea, 17, spend time with both parents,
who divorced last year after 18 years of marriage but remain
friendly. Mom Liz Noon, 36, certifies Boeing airplane systems for
the Federal Aviation Administration. Dad Tim Noon, 42, is a Boeing
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki and Andrea, who wants to be a pediatrician, say they're
very close, though they occasionally squabble over little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll both just crack up,'' Andrea said. ``Our fights
last for about two minutes, then we'll laugh for five.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea said most of her friends don't mind Vicki tagging along
because she's ``amusing.'' But some are annoyed by her tendency to
hog the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Willis and Tassin, who teach dance and musical
theater at the Academy, had to convince Vicki she had a voice worth
developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to sing in front of people at first,'' Vicki
said. ``I know that I have a good voice, but I don't want to flaunt
it in front of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now she says, ``I'm glad I can't see the faces of the
people (in the audience). I think it would scare me if they weren't
liking it or were bored or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki's first big stage role was in the Academy's summer
production of ``The Wizard of Oz.'' It was a nerve-racking affair
that propelled her from the Munchkin chorus line to the role of
Dorothy in distressingly short order.
</P>
<P>
   At dress rehearsal, four days after she got the part, she still
hadn't learned all the songs. The next night, when the curtain
rose, she had it down cold.
</P>
<P>
   Her heroic performance knocked the socks off co-star Greg
Palmer, an independent TV film producer and former KING/5 reporter,
who played the Wizard. He saw her as ``an incredibly hard-working
tot with a singing voice that sounds like she's a 35-year-old
pro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has, as far as I can tell, perfect pitch and easily
filled a thousand-seat hall, with or without sound amplification,''
Palmer said. ``She has what could be just a stunning career ahead
of her. I just think there's no limit to how far she can go.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Oz,'' Vicki's life assumed a whirlwind quality. She and
Andrea were vacationing with their dad in North Carolina this past
summer when ACT called Vicki back for a second audition for
``Violet,'' this time before the director and musical staff.
</P>
<P>
   As one of six finalists, she had no guarantees of anything
except a disrupted vacation and an extra $400 in travel expenses.
In the end, her father drove her to the airport from the beach
house near Cape Hatteras and put her on a puddle-jumper to
Jacksonville, N.C. Traveling solo, she changed planes in
Charlottesville, Va.; Washington, D.C., and Phoenix before arriving
back in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Layne said Vicki managed to project the right combination of
resilience and toughness for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``And of course,'' Layne said, ``she sings like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Zavada said Vicki has an ``excellent transition'' between the
upper and lower ranges _ a seamlessness that some women spend years
trying to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Vicki can span at least three octaves _ less than
Mariah Carey's four, but twice as much as the average person. Her
sound comes from the shape of her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really wide across the cheeks,'' Zavada said. ``The
shape of the (vocal) cords is really the same on everybody. It's
really the resonating chambers that change the timbre and quality
of the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of coaching, Vicki has less vocal tension
and better breath control, which should see her through eight
performances a week in ``Violet.'' But she still has years of
training and hard work ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't encourage her to cruise,'' said Zavada. She tells
Vicki, ``Sure, this is fine, but what's it going to be like when
you're 15, or 17? You have to keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   Tassin, artistic co-director of the Washington Academy, said
it's important to keep Vicki ``unaware'' and suitably humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she gets out there and feels she's so successful she's
already where she needs to be, that will be her downfall,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We have her at a very important time of her
life. The talent is there, she's ready to train. If we get her
through the next few years and give her that solid base, she will
go!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vicki still has the pressures of school and soccer.
Coach Robinson has complained to Liz Noon about Vicki's absences,
saying it breeds resentment among girls who show up faithfully but
don't always get to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did kind of blow up with each other once,'' Robinson said,
``because I was fed up with her not being at practice, and I had
parents on my back.''
</P>
<P>
   They have since smoothed things over, although Saturday
rehearsals for ``Violet'' have forced Vicki to suspend soccer
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Noon, meanwhile, worries about the emotional wear and tear
of a performing career. This fall he vetoed Vicki's request to skip
eighth grade and go directly into the Academy's performance-focused
high school, the Conservatory. Maybe next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 13. She's my little girl,'' he said, as Vicki perched on
his knee with her arm around his shoulder. ``I'm worried about her
still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I worry about is, how is this affecting Andrea?
It used to be Andrea who had all the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea, herself a star soccer and tennis player, smiled wanly.
</P>
<P>
   Given Vicki's assorted talents, it isn't exactly ``Broadway or
bust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this voice or musical theater doesn't work out,'' said Liz
Noon, ``she could be a great engineer, she could be a doctor, she
could be anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``I would like to see her be able to use her
voice because I think that's her biggest talent. And she loves it,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Robinson understands how dreams of stardom can overshadow
the thrill of a well-placed soccer kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of dreams,'' he said, ``are great dreams to have.''

WOMEN'S SPORTS ON TRIAL AS UNC COACH FACES SUIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ A jubilant coach hugs a smiling player after
winning a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of that innocent embrace appeared in a glossy guide to
women's soccer at the University of North Carolina. But that was
before the most dominant team in women's sports lost its sense of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the photo has disappeared, deleted from this year's guide
in response to a lawsuit by two former players who say they were
sexually harassed and emotionally abused by coach Anson Dorrance, a
legend in the world of women's athletics. Dorrance denies the
charges, and the school is standing behind him along with more than
100 current and former players.
</P>
<P>
   As Dorrance fights to clear his name, and the plaintiffs battle
to force his ouster and win $12 million in damages, the lawsuit is
reverberating far beyond Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it involve a coaching icon, it comes at a time of
soaring popularity of women's sports, a simultaneous drop in the
percentage of female coaches, and a heightened concern about the
balance of sexual power in workplaces, classrooms, and now, even on
playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the lawsuit has jolted school sports programs
nationwide, particularly among women's teams with male coaches, as
participants wonder how to preserve the bonds between coaches and
players, without trampling appropriate boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what the truth is about Anson Dorrance,'' said
Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports Foundation
in New York. ``But it's obvious this whole issue of intimate
relationships by authority figures with students or people who are
working for them is one that is causing great concern and a lot of
soul-searching, and rightfully so.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, there are more immediate worries, such as the
reputation of a university steeped in sporting tradition, and the
future of a sports dynasty that has won 15 national titles in 17
years. Former UNC men's basketball coach Dean Smith, a giant in the
game, said only half-jokingly last year that ``this is a women's
soccer school. We're just trying to keep up with them.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the small concerns. Consider the fate of the
hugging photo, which appeared in the team's 1997 media guide.
</P>
<P>
   Neither plaintiff is the player being hugged by Dorrance. Yet,
rather than using it in this year's guide, the school substituted a
photo of Dorrance standing by himself. ``You don't want people
taking things the wrong way,'' said Dave Lohse, UNC director of
media relations for Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, near the homes
of both women, involves two ex-UNC players: scoring star Debbie
Keller, 23, a ``Carolina legend'' who now plays on the US National
Team, and whose No. 8 is one of only six jerseys retired by the
school team; and Melissa Jennings, 19, a non-scholarship goalie
whose teammates questioned her work ethic and who was dropped from
the team in May. Neither would comment on the lawsuit, their lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side is Dorrance, 47, a married father of three who
is celebrated in soccer circles as a motivational and tactical
genius. Dorrance's record in 19 full seasons is a staggering 417
wins, 16 losses and 11 ties.
</P>
<P>
   After having weathered the ``humiliating and embarrassing''
first days after the lawsuit was filed in August, Dorrance says he
is determined to prove his innocence. On the advice of his lawyer,
he declined to comment on specific allegations, but denied
harassing players or abusing his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has hurt my mother and it hurts my family, but the team
has taken care of itself very quickly. This crisis forced us to
band together,'' said Dorrance, whose Tar Heels opened the season
with eight straight wins and a No. 1 national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans no change in his style or behavior, with one
exception. In the closest he came to blaming his accusers, Dorrance
said: ``All of us are going to be a lot more thorough about the
sort of people we admit into this environment, this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Keller, he said only, ``Debbie had a fantastic career here
and was wonderfully coachable.'' He had no comment on Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, the women allege that Dorrance on several
occasions made ``an uninvited sexual advance'' toward Keller. It
claims he repeatedly made inappropriate physical contact, touching
her body, and stroking her hair.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also accuses Dorrance of interrogating his players
about their personal lives and sexual activities; of coercing team
members to report to him the sexual activities of other players; of
making lewd and degrading comments about players; of repeatedly
calling Keller to monitor her personal life; and of sending Keller
an intimidating and harassing e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations involving Jennings revolve primarily around
money and alcohol, and Dorrance and the university already have
acknowledged some mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings asserts that Dorrance ordered her to withdraw $400 from
her bank account to buy Gatorade and supplies for her teammates and
an opposing team when the coaches found themselves without money.
The lawsuit also says Dorrance encouraged her to drink alcohol,
despite knowing she was under age and, as a Mormon, abstained from
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Jennings's father in June, in the midst of failed
discussions to head off the lawsuit, Dorrance apologized for using
``poor judgment'' in asking to borrow money and said he
``understands that alcoholic beverages must not be allowed at any
activity involving team members.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorrance also admits in the letter that he engaged in
``inappropriate'' group discussions ``of a jesting or teasing
nature'' with players, but said he never discussed sex during
one-on-one meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Buried deeper in the 19-page lawsuit _ and almost entirely
overlooked in press accounts _ is an assertion by Keller that some
of Dorrance's supporters suspect might be the real reason for the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Keller accuses Dorrance of interfering with her efforts to
obtain custom soccer shoes from Nike and Adidas when she was
recovering from a heel injury. Despite winning national
player-of-the-year honors in 1995 and 1996, Keller was prevented by
her heel injury from joining the US Olympic team, costing her a
gold medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says that Dorrance blocked Keller's bid for special
shoes as part of a complicated attempt to play the shoe companies
against each other while negotiating a lucrative Nike sponsorship
deal. That deal, a university official said, will pay him roughly
$450,000 over four years, a significant boost over his $50,000
coaching salary.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for Keller and Jennings, Louis Varchetto, said he
could not comment on individual acusations, but said the lawsuit
was based on the entire pattern of Dorrance's behavior. He
dismissed the outpouring of support by the school and UNC players,
comparing the situation to President Clinton's sexual imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will blindly follow someone they like, whether they
know the truth or not,'' Varchetto said.
</P>
<P>
   At a team practice last week, talk of the lawsuit was replaced
by the sound of Dorrance calling out commands and advice to two
dozen young women darting about on an immaculately groomed field.
Dorrance was quick to praise a good shot or a smart defense, and
just as quick to order a player to do five sit-ups for failing to
accelerate after passing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former players _ all of whom call Dorrance by his
first name _ were effusive in defense of their coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Anson pats you on the shoulder and says `good job,' he's
just being a coach,'' said senior Tiffany Roberts, a member of the
national team who roomed with Keller and considers her a good
friend. ``She thought it was sexual harassment, but none of us have
had any problem with Anson.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the sidelines sat Dorrance's mother, Peggy, in a straw hat
and tennis shoes. ``This is such a tough time,'' she said, her
voice cracking. ``He has the highest ethical standard of any person
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But Craig Jennings, whose daughter Melissa is still attending
UNC, said in a telephone interview from Illinois that Dorrance
exploited his position. ``A professor has power over a student for
one grade. A coach has far more power, and he can use that power
like Anson did, to gain control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Dorrance, the lawsuit names the school and nine other
university officials, including former University of Massachusetts
President Michael K. Hooker, now UNC chancellor, and assistant UNC
coach Tracy Ducar, who plays with Keller on the national team. The
additional defendants are mostly accused of failing to stop
Dorrance's inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at all the evidence, and we don't think there's
anything there to justify the charges,'' Hooker said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear when the case will come to trial. Whatever the
eventual outcome, already the lawsuit has focused attention on the
issue of male coaches of female athletes. It came just three months
after two former Syracuse women's tennis players filed a $25
million harassment lawsuit against the school's male coach.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Lopiano of the Women's Sports Foundation offers a
hard-line set of standards for coaches: ``You shouldn't be alone
with players, one on one. You shouldn't be in equipment rooms with
them. You shouldn't be in social situations. You are a teacher, and
the distance between the teacher and the student is a guarantee of
objectivity and proper limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches, both male and female, said the case has forced
them to review their actions but would not cause them to adopt a
policy quite so strict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It heightens awareness, and you think about guidelines, but
I'm not going to change my coaching style,'' said US National Team
coach Tony Diccico.
</P>
<P>
   April Heinrichs, a former UNC soccer star who now coaches at the
University of Virginia, said the issue affects both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality and gender should never be an issue in coaching. If
I were coaching young males, I wouldn't call them stud muffin or
sweetie or good-looking. I wouldn't make reference to their body or
body type,'' she said. ``Once we get away from the specifics about
Anson, maybe the benefit will be that we can start to educate
people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PORTAGE, Alaska _ The visitors center must have seemed like a
can't-miss idea when it opened in 1984 and quickly became a top
tourist attraction. People flocked to the site to take in the
dramatic view of the crystalline blue Portage Glacier that the
center's floor-to-ceiling windows offered.
</P>
<P>
   How things have changed. Now, tourists watch a film about the
famed glacier, complete with scenes of gigantic chunks breaking off
into the water. Then, the curtains are pulled back from the viewing
windows to reveal _ a lake.
</P>
<P>
   Portage Glacier has retreated out of sight behind a ridge a mile
off, melting away to leave behind a lake dotted with icebergs.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come as a surprise that Portage Glacier, like others,
went into reverse gear; what was startling was its pell-mell pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to knock on my consciousness that (global
warming) is real,'' said visitors center interpreter Charlu Choate.
``The glacier retreated around the corner out of our view about 26
years before geologists predicted &UR; . &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Portage Glacier's disappearance is a stark example of the
quickening retreat of glaciers outside the polar regions, what a
growing number of scientists believe is an early indicator of the
effects of global warming. While the Earth's average temperature
has increased by 1 degree Fahrenheit this century, temperatures in
northerly locations such as Alaska, northwestern Canada, and
Siberia have risen as much as 5 degrees because the Earth's air and
water circulation patterns diffuse increased heat to the coldest
regions.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain glaciers _ they account for most of the world's
glaciers outside of Greenland and Antarctica _ appear to have been
dramatically affected by the higher temperatures, including the
record hot years of the past decade. On average, says the
Switzerland-based World Glacier Monitoring Service, glaciers
thinned about 12 feet from 1980 to 1995 and more since then, but
still a relatively small percentage of the glaciers' total bulk.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Alaska, where 29,000 square miles of land are still
ice-covered, some of the retreats have been spectacular. Columbia
Glacier has retreated eight miles since 1982, releasing icebergs
all over Prince William Sound. (The Exxon Valdez tore itself open
on Bligh Reef in 1989 in part because the crew was trying to avoid
an iceberg from Columbia Glacier.)
</P>
<P>
   Glaciologists at the US Geological Survey, though, are more
concerned about the less spectacular but record-breaking retreat of
two glaciers in south-central Alaska thought to be especially
sensitive to air temperature. Wolverine Glacier in southern Alaska
thinned an unprecedented 24 feet between 1989 and 1995, while
Gulkana Glacier near Fairbanks thinned by 15 feet, even though
neither is exposed to standing water, which speeds the melting
process.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fact that glaciers are melting alone doesn't prove
that the higher temperatures were caused by human actions, and
glaciologists are quick to point out that a cooling trend could
help fatten them up again. After all, the planet just ended a long
cooling trend called ``The Little Ice Age'' a couple of centuries
ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, the global meltdown dramatically illustrates what just
a small change in temperature can do to the Earth's ice cover. If
temperature rises by as little as 4 degrees over the next century,
as the scientific Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
predicts, glaciologists believe that up to half the planet's
mountain glaciers could melt away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the dwindling mountain glaciers have attracted relatively
little attention, perhaps because they are tiny compared to the
massive ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica that have shrunk
little and, together, account for 95 percent of the Earth's
glaciers.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Trabant of the US Geological Survey says some
regions, such as the Pacific Northwest, will feel the consequences.
They will have less water to drink, to generate hydro-electric
power or even to provide spawning grounds for salmon if the
glaciers melt. Mountain glaciers, he noted, are a key water source
in some regions, particularly in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer air has an even more direct effect on the permafrost, the
frozen ground on which Alaskans have built houses, roads, and other
structures. Already, the effect of the softening permafrost can be
seen in the state's ``drunken forests'' _ where trees tilt
chaotically as the soil yields. And in northern Canada, mudslides
have become frequent because of the soft ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more insidious than it is blatantly hazardous,'' Trabant
said of the glaciers' retreat.
</P>
<P>
   If the mountain glaciers are going, they are not going quietly.
Matanuska Glacier, about 80 miles northeast of Anchorage, burps and
bloops, fizzles and gurgles, as rivulets of water race down the
ice, carving caves and chasms as it melts. Though ``watching a
glacier melt'' is a popular synonym in Alaska for ``boring,'' the
process is dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the land in front of Matanuska Glacier, called its
``terminal moraine,'' resembles a muddy construction site. It is
full of rocks and dirt dragged down from the mountains by the
glacier. Over time, pioneer plants such as fireweed will grow in
the muck, revegetating the land and creating habitat for insects
and animals.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, a retreating glacier is a construction site, but the
work is done over many centuries.
</P>
<P>
   What begins as snow in the mountains is compressed into
blue-tinted glacier crystals as more snow piles on top. Then, the
crystals begin a long, slow slide down the mountain, making ripples
on the surface and continuously scouring the rock below. At Portage
Glacier, the trip from snowflake to the lake of meltwater below
takes 50 to 80 years.
</P>
<P>
   And south coastal Alaska is still a glacial work in progress.
The valley floors here weren't clear until about 6,000 years ago _
compared to 10,000 years ago in New England _ and ice fields bigger
than Rhode Island still sit atop the mountains, turning the waters
below green-blue from the mineral-heavy meltwater.
</P>
<P>
   Glaciologists point out that the current glacial retreat must be
seen in the context of long time scales. At the height of the last
Ice Age, 17,000 years ago, 30 percent of the world was covered in
ice, compared to 10 percent today, and when it thawed, the sea
level rose 330 feet. That makes the current melt seem modest.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, glaciologists stress that the current warming trend is
still a blip on the planetary screen that could reverse itself as
quickly as it came.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine J. Crossen, chair of the Geology Department at the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks, points out that there have been
periods of major glacial advance even since the Middle Ages,
especially during the ``Little Ice Age'' from 1450 to about 1850.
The advance of the cold wiped out Viking colonies in Greenland,
where crops would no longer grow, and prompted protests from Swiss
farmers who objected being taxed on farm fields trapped under the
ice.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating predictions of the glaciers' fate &UR; : &LR; 
Glaciers are not governed solely by air temperature. The amount of
snow, the glacier's fuel, is also important, as is whether the
glacier's ``face,'' or lower end, is in water, which transfers heat
to to the ice 20 times more efficiently than air.
</P>
<P>
   Portage Glacier, for example, probably started melting because
of the warming climate, but the deep meltwater lake it created has
since become the driving force of its accelerating retreat &UR; .  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   However, the simultaneous timing of glacial retreat and rising
global temperatures, especially in recent years, is hard to ignore.
More than three quarters of the 60 glaciers tracked by the World
Glacier Monitoring Services shrank between 1980 to 1995, the
warmest years in recorded weather history.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the increase of the last few decades has been most
pronounced at northerly latitudes, which tend to be home to more
glaciers. One study found that since 1980, spring has come
progressively earlier north of the 45th parallel, while Trabant
found that the number of days warm enough to melt Gulkana Glacier
each year has increased from 142 to 160 since 1966.
</P>
<P>
   That's evidence enough for the glaciologists at the World
Glacier Monitoring Service, which monitors 60 glaciers in 16
countries. The Swiss glaciologists concluded that the melting ice
increasingly looks like human handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beginning of this rapid secular glacier retreat tendency
was probably little affected by human activity,'' they concluded in
a 1996 report. ``However ... recent shrinking of glaciers for the
first time now coincides with a man-induced radiative forcing'' _
in other words, global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Crossen of the University of Alaska is less certain, but she
doesn't necessarily disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't entirely dismiss the fact that the Industrial
Revolution is the cause of the glaciers' retreat,'' she said,
referring to the rapid increase in emissions of heat-trapping
carbon dioxide that began with the rise of industry. ``To me, it's
a percentage thing.''

WHO CAN GET THROUGH TO THIS COLD, HARD CASH?

 (Refiling to add dropped text)   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It is natural to want to hang a ``monster'' sign
around the neck of David Cash Jr., to disavow any connection
between him and the rest of the human race. And, because there is
no law with which to punish him, it is instinctive to hope that he
somehow disappears from our midst as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old sophomore at the University of California at
Berkeley seems a perfect candidate for societal abandonment, a man
beyond our capabilities to, as Shelley put it, ``forgive wrongs
darker than death or night.'' Guilty of an unfathomable failure of
morality, David Cash remains remorseless and without regret.
</P>
<P>
   On May 25, 1997, in a Las Vegas casino women's room, Cash
watched from an adjacent toilet stall as his best friend restrained
a struggling 7-year-old girl and smothered her screams with one
hand. Although he has altered his story since, saying he never
believed the child's life was in danger, Cash earlier told a Nevada
grand jury: ``I didn't know what to expect _ something bad. I
probably feared the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cash walked out of the restroom and left 7-year-old Sherrice
Iverson to her fate: sexual molestation and death by strangulation.
According to two of Cash's former high school pals, Cash told them
he watched the sexual molestation. Cash himself told Nora Zamichow
of the Los Angeles Times that, just before he and his friend,
Jeremy Strohmeyer, joined Cash's father for a car ride back to the
young men's homes in Long Beach, Cash asked his friend if Sherrice
had been sexually aroused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you ask if the little girl was aroused?'' the Times
reporter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, it's just the way I think,'' Cash answered.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Strohmeyer pleaded guilty to Sherrice's molestation
and murder, and received a life sentence without possibility of
parole. Cash, who committed no crime by refusing to interfere and
by staying silent about the murder, has meanwhile managed to
fashion himself into a one-dimensional cut-out of a fiend. On radio
talk shows, in newspaper interviews, alongside an even-handed but
quietly horrified Ed Bradley during ``60 Minutes,'' the young man
continues to reveal his personal moral vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   He says he feels sorrier for Strohmeyer than for the murdered
child _ after all, he didn't know her. He once said his newfound
notoriety makes it easier to ``score with women.'' He says he just
wants to get on with his life, majoring in, of all things, nuclear
engineering. He says if he had it to do over again, he'd make the
same choices.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Cash turns his pale, unexceptional face to the world
and does not say, ``I'm sorry, I did a horrible thing,'' the easier
he is to hate, the more we want to wash our hands of him. Clearly,
this boy-man is not lying or in denial; he does not believe he did
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After Cash's ``60 Minutes'' appearance, local television
stations interviewed many of his fellow students. Their reactions
spanned the emotional spectrum, from outrage to indifference. One
thoughtful young man told a TV reporter: ``There is something real
wrong with this guy. He needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he does. Further, we as a society need for him to be
helped. A civilized, healthy society comprised not just of human
animals, but of conscious, moral human beings, needs for David Cash
to comprehend the enormity of his moral breach and to stagger under
the burden of that understanding. We need to witness this more than
we need any physical punishment (legal or vigilante) that might now
be exacted on him. We certainly need it more than we need for him
to ``put this behind'' him, masquerade as a normal person and take
an undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But who will help Cash? Who will try to invade and break open
his frozen heart? Who will attempt to find his soul? If his parents
were up to the job, we likely would have seen something of them by
now. It appears they have not stepped forward to publicly denounce
their son or reaffirm their love for him. Their absence _ as their
boy digs himself in deeper on the talk shows, in the newspaper
interviews, on ``60 Minutes'' _ indicates their impotence, gross
stupidity or suspect moral integrity.
</P>
<P>
   So, to whom does the task fall? Is Cash's best hope for
comprehending what he has done tucked away in organized religion?
In legitimate psychotherapy? Somewhere in the great public
University of California? Isn't there someone among us, some group
of people, who understands what is wrong with David Cash Jr. and
has the experience or expertise to attempt to reach him?
</P>
<P>
   God knows, any member of the human race has the moral authority
to try.

CALIFORNIA SHAKES UP PRIMARY SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the past 14 years, the presidential campaign
has been dominated by the mostly Southern, mostly conservative
Super Tuesday primary vote. The results now seem predictable: White
House terms for two conservative Republicans, Ronald Reagan and
George Bush, and two terms for one Southern Democrat, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But with the stroke of a pen by California Governor Pete Wilson,
the presidential campaign has been radically altered. On March 7,
2000, just two weeks after the New Hampshire primary, a mighty,
mostly moderate bicoastal conglomeration of states is slated to
hold primaries that could go a long way toward determining the
nominees of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   While some New England officials expressed horror that
California will be voting on the same day as five ``Yankee Day''
states, the end result might help a moderate Republican or
Democrat, who has done well in the region but has not made as big
an impact on the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, as sometimes happens with changing political rules,
the result might turn out to be the opposite of what is intended.
</P>
<P>
   The change might make it impossible for all but well-funded
candidates to compete, giving a sizable advantage to wealthy
candidates like Steve Forbes, who financed his own campaign in
1996. A lesser-funded newcomer, on the other hand, would find it
difficult to gain notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree that this will change the world,'' Republican
consultant Stuart Stevens said. ``The question is, what is this
world going to look like? I imagine the people happiest about this
is someone like Steve Forbes, a checkbook candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if Wilson runs in 2000, and some of his allies
privately said he backed the primary plan to boost his chances,
then he would automatically be considered a ``favorite son''
candidate. That might prompt other prospects to write off the
state. Still, such a scenario could boost Wilson into the
front-runner category, if only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   The new primary schedule also affects Democrats. Vice President
Al Gore, probably the best-known and best-funded candidate, is such
an obvious beneficiary of the new calendar that many suspect he
helped engineer the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my adversaries in California have made it clear this
is a Gore initiative,'' said Massachusetts Secretary of State
William Galvin, who tried unsuccessfully to talk California
officials out of moving up the primary date.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides have said the vice president has nothing to do with
the California primary schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible Democratic beneficiary is Senator John F.
Kerry, who would be expected to do well in New England and also
might find a constituency in California and other states voting on
March 7. If Kerry taps the fortune of his wife, Teresa Heinz, he
could run a well-financed campaign blitz. Kerry has not ruled out
using his wife's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, this would be a strategic asset for John,'' said
John Marttila, a longtime Kerry adviser. ``His record and
background would have great appeal in a state like California ...
and he has raised a lot of money out there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the downside, Marttila said, is ``the fantastic pressure it
will put on fund-raising. This would give Gore an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the advantage of the March 7 grouping may be
overblown for Democrats. After all, former Massachusetts Governor
Michael Dukakis won the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988
under the old schedule that emphasized Southern conservative
states.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact is expected to be on the Republican side
because of the opening it may provide for moderates who have fared
poorly in recent presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   If a moderate Republican such as William Weld had been drawing a
campaign game plan, he could hardly have come up with a better
scenario. Under the current plan, the 10 to 12 states that plan to
participate on March 7 are uniquely suited to boost a possible
candidate such as Weld or Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule also would benefit Texas Governor George W. Bush,
due partly to his name recognition and funding. The goveror also
could begin his campaign as a centrist who would not have to move
to the right during the Southern primaries, a strategy that would
help in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The March 7 primary tentatively includes all the New England
states except New Hampshire, as well as California, New York,
Maryland, Colorado, and Georgia. Moreover, Wilson is trying to get
Oregon and Washington to join in, creating a Pacific primary on the
same day as a big Northeast vote.

MOM VS. GENE AUTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling to add dropped text)   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I was maybe 6-years-old, 7 tops.
</P>
<P>
   The president was an old bald guy named Eisenhower, who'd been a
soldier once. The heavyweight champion of the world was Rocky
Marciano, from up around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest movie star in the world was John Wayne. The hottest
singer around was somebody named Patti Page, who sang about doggies
in windows. And there was this boring guy on our 12-inch,
black-and-white Emerson television set at least a couple of nights
a week. His name was Arthur Godfrey. He played a ukulele.
</P>
<P>
   That was what the world was like the day that Gene Autry knocked
me out cold. And _ it scares me to think about it _ but I remember
it like it was yesterday. Those were the thoughts that hit me the
other night. I was listening to the radio when the news came on.
Gene Autry was dead at 91.
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself, ``He was how old? Good God!''
</P>
<P>
   The wanton hours fly past. Mark Twain said that. Or maybe I just
think it was he who said it because I grew up in the town where he
spent much of his life. You think of Mark Twain, and you think of
the Mississippi. But he was a struggling writer with a terrific
line of bullfeathers who'd married the richest woman in Elmira,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Twain lived out his days in my home town, sucking up bourbon and
scribbling on the old lady's dime. When I was a kid, the downtown
hotel was named after him. That's where Autry knocked me cold.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I ought to explain that.
</P>
<P>
   Autry came to town to put on a few shows at the Colonial
Theater, only a block from where Twain's house had stood. The city
fathers, in their wisdom, had long before permitted the house to be
torn down and a shopping plaza to be erected on its site. But
Autry's only interest in anything remotely connected to Mark Twain
was the hotel bar, the Connecticut Yankee Lounge, to which he
retreated between shows.
</P>
<P>
   My mother had taken me to one of those show. Afterwards, she'd
dragged me across the street to the hotel restaurant for ice cream.
Then Autry himself had entered, with his cowboy hat and his camel
hair overcoat. He retreated to the bar for sustenance before
cruising back across the street for the next show.
</P>
<P>
   When Autry came in, I was so excited that I spit ice cream clear
across the table. My mother ordered me to settle down, but I
couldn't. I kept slipping away from the table to peek through the
swinging doors to the bar and watch Autry slug down manhattans. He
never did that in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Autry got up, threw some bills on the bar and hit those
swinging doors, catching me right between the eyes. I went out like
a light. First graders have glass jaws.
</P>
<P>
   I awakened to see Autry against a wall, wide-eyed, with my
mother about to rip him into shreds while a frantic waiter pleaded
with her to, ``Please, lady, calm down.'' Finally, she did, and
Autry hustled out of the place like it was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of her life, my mother never had a good word to say
about Autry. I always liked the guy, although not as much as Roy
Rogers, my very first hero, who died in July. I met him once, too,
in 1974, in one of his restaurants on Long Island. I was surprised
to discover that Roy Rogers was sort of a little guy _ very
gracious and polite, but short. My mother wasn't very big, either.
</P>
<P>
   But she probably could have kicked his butt, too.

 &HT;    Hunting game misses mark
 &HT;    ``Rocky Mountain Trophy Hunter''
 &HT;    (For PCs, by Wizard Works, http://www.wizworks.com, $24.99)
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Sponaas of Duluth says ``Rocky Mountain Trophy Hunter''
might be good for some gamers, but not for him. He said the CD-ROM
hunting program was neither educational nor a challenge to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of corny, and it wasn't that much fun,'' the
15-year-old reviewer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trophy Hunter,'' an interactive hunting game, lets players
track and shoot big-game animals in the wilds of the Rocky
Mountains. Players hunt for bighorn sheep, bear, elk and moose in a
variety of environments and may select from weapons including
shotgun, rifle, compound bow, muzzle loader and six-shot revolver.
</P>
<P>
   As in real life, hunters track animals using calls, bait and
binoculars and must deal with extreme weather conditions such as
rain, snow, and thunder and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking methods also include aerial maps, with hot-spot
markers, compass and wind indicator, path and bedding areas, and
rubbing and droppings. There are even blood trails, for when errant
shots don't bring an animal down immediately. Players must always
be mindful of wind direction and choose location accordingly,
because if the animals detect a hunter's scent, they will turn and
run.
</P>
<P>
   Successful hunters get to display their kills in a trophy room.
</P>
<P>
   David said that despite the maker's claim of an ultra-realistic
hunting environment, the graphics of ``Trophy Hunter'' were ``not
all that good, and the scenery and the animals sometimes didn't
seem to match.'' He didn't like the sounds either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too time-consuming trying to find the animals, and the
game got kind of repetitive,'' David said.

   New sites promote
</P>
<P>
   safer Net surfing
</P>
<P>
   Despite possible hazards, there are many great ways young people
can use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some simple rules for surfing the Net or participating in chat
areas can help kids preserve their innocence and possibly save
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A number of ways to make Web surfing safe for kids are outlined
on a new Web site, called SafeKids.com, http://www.safekids.com,
which premiered last month. The site is the brainchild of Larry
Magid, child online safety advocate, technology journalist and
national Internet expert. Magid is also the author of the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children's popular booklets,
``Child Safety on the Information Highway'' and ``Teen Safety on
the Information Highway.''
</P>
<P>
   SafeKids.com provides specific steps parents can take to teach
their children critical thinking about safety and privacy and to
improve communication with children and teens about what is or is
not good for them.
</P>
<P>
   SafeKids.com includes links to informative sites for kids,
parents and teachers, links to child-safe search engines and a
complete directory of parental control programs, or ``filters,''
which automatically determine the sites a youngster may access.
</P>
<P>
   A site for teens, SafeTeens
</P>
<P>
   .com (http://www.safeteens
</P>
<P>
   .com), was also launched in September.
</P>
<P>
   The two sites will be updated regularly and serve as a resource
for the America Links Up Campaign, which started Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Magid says that while filtering software is an option,
parent-child communication is a more critical component to
protecting children in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to talk with your kids about how to behave in
cyberspace,'' Magid said. ``The purpose of SafeKids.com and
SafeTeens.com is to help users better understand the issues and
their options and take responsibility themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about critical thinking. The judgment skills kids
learn surfing the Net will serve them in all aspects of life,''
Magid said. ``Filters, like crossing guards, have their place. But
eventually kids have to learn to look both ways when the crossing
guard isn't around.''
</P>
<P>
   SafeKids.com and SafeTeens
</P>
<P>
   .com approach cyber-safety in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``While young children usually pay attention and obey what their
parents teach them, teens have a tendency to push up against
authority,'' Magid said. ``At SafeKids.com, we educate parents
about how to work with their children. At SafeTeens
</P>
<P>
   .com, we communicate directly with teens to empower their
Internet skills, encourage them to avoid the unsavory side of the
Internet and help them educate their parents about the online
world.''
</P>
<P>
   September was also the premiere of the SafeKids newsletter
(subscribe(at)safekids.com), a free weekly e-mail that informs
parents and teachers about new sites and Internet child-related
developments. It is compiled for SafeKids.com by the staff of
SageWay.com, a leading child advocacy site.
</P>
<P>
   The sites' initial corporate sponsors include America Online,
Disney.com, Network Solutions and SmarterKids.com. Yahoo!, Lycos,
TalkCity, Link Exchange and 1WEBCAST are providing promotional
support. Additional assistance is provided by the National Center
for Missing and Exploited Children.

WORLD TURNS SPOTLIGHT   ON A PRECARIOUS BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ The world is watching to see if Brazil can
avoid fiscal disaster. If it falls, it will take with it many of
the regional economies and further threaten a global market
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was expected to defeat his
nearest rival, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, easily. ``He's the one
who fixed the economy before and he's the best one to fix it
again,'' said Adalberto Moreisa, a 27-year-old electronics store
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   The last three months have brought Carnaval-like gyrations to
its $800 billion economy, the world's eighth largest. The country's
financial market, the Bovespa, has lost more than 30 percent of its
value since the beginning of the year. Interest rates have more
than doubled, to over 50 percent, and foreign investors have pulled
out more than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the early market panic in August was, as officials here
argued, a result of the crises in Asia and Russia. But Brazil's own
flaws have become more apparent as it has moved into the world
spotlight, and preserving its economy has become a leading topic
among President Clinton and other world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some gains in privatization and economic policies, the
government deficit has mushroomed to $100 billion. The currency,
most agree, is overvalued. And the gap between the wealthy and the
poor has become the largest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how quickly Cardoso can unite a fragmented Brazilian
Congress _ notorious for its horse-trading members who seldom
follow party lines _ to pass badly needed constitutional reforms to
reduce the country's whopping deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the fiscal adjustments we need to make depend on how
quickly we can get constitutional reform,'' said Jose Antonio Pena
Garcia, chief economist for BankBoston in Brazil. ``Reform takes
longer here because the president has to negotiate with different
parties and with different interests within the same party.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 parties have at least one representative in
Congress, and politicians switch their affiliations regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso, a former Marxist and now member of the center-left
Social Democratic Party, needs a strong showing by his five-party
centrist coalition to push through constitutional reforms necessary
to lure back frightened investors who have withdrawn billions of
dollars over the last two months and to bolster the country's
shaken currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to privatization and administrative reforms that
were adopted in the 1988 constitution, and to a currency
stabilization plan that Cardoso implemented in 1994, Brazil has
enjoyed several consecutive years of economic growth and lower
inflation. But federal spending has risen dramatically, and Brazil
now runs a deficit equaling 7 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   To cut the deficit, the Cardoso administration has promised to
deliver three major constitutional amendments. The first would
alter civil service rules to trim payrolls by requiring workers to
be evaluated and fired if they fail their reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The second amendment would reduce Brazil's generous social
security and pension system, which now absorbs about 1 percent of
GDP and carries a $24 billion deficit, by capping benefits and
requiring workers to contribute more to help pay for the growing
number of recipients who are living longer.
</P>
<P>
   The third and most controversial plan would simplify the
nation's tax structure and shift a larger percentage of costs for
services to state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil imposes about 60 different taxes. This makes tax evasion
easy and pervasive, according to Pena. Although the 1988
constitution provided the provinces with millions of dollars in
additional funds, many locally distributed services, such as health
care, remain heavily subsidized by federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts believe Cardoso can pursuade the Senate,
which is generally pro-Cardoso, to approve the proposals. Eleven
days ago, leaders of the Senate and lower Chamber of Deputies stood
with Cardoso and backed the amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, however, may be among the rank-and-file members
of the lower house, where there is a larger and more vocal
opposition from the left, and from many of the 5,500 municipal
leaders who don't want to shoulder more expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working hard to reduce our expenses, and this is
the opposite of what we're fighting for,'' said Sao Paulo Mayor
Celso Pitta do Nascimento. ``We mayors make a strong group, and we
won't let this pass easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the reforms offer dire warnings if the
measures are not passed soon: Investors who have deserted the
markets will stay away, interest rates will continue to skyrocket,
and the real will spiral downward.
</P>
<P>
   David Cleary, a historian at Harvard University, said that a
currency crisis might be the catalyst needed to unite Brazil's
assorted political interests. ``The left-wing will likely make lots
of noise, but the people are worried about losing the gains of the
past few years,'' Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that the real is overvalued, but there is no
consensus about how much it needs to be adjusted. (Currently, $1 US
equals about 1.20 reais.) Economists have predicted devaluations
ranging from 10 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A devaluation would hurt the United States, which sells a fifth
of its exports to Brazil, because US products would become more
expensive for Brazilian consumers. And the United States is
Brazil's top trading partner after the European Union. Any drop in
the real will also affect other Latin American markets, especially
Argentina and Mexico, which like Brazil have tried hard in recent
years to attract and keep investors' dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Brazil's 163 million people fear that any help from
foreign sources such as the International Monetary Fund would come
with the brutal discipline they experienced in the 1980s, when the
IMF bailed them out from triple-digit inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy A. Bush, a banking analyst and senior vice president
at Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. in New Jersey, said Brazil's climate is far
different from a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political situation is stronger now and officials are
being more honest,'' Bush said. ``There are problems, but it's not
like we saw before when even the country's leaders were sending
their own capital out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Already there are different financing plans being discussed for
Brazil, notably a $30 billion loan package from the IMF, the US
Federal Reserve, and private banks. But the Cardoso administration
has not yet publicly asked for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso may make such a request this week if he avoids a runoff
election for a second four-year term by winning at least 51 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Any backlash against the incumbent over a currency devaluation
or a stiff IMF package probably will not last long. Unlike
Indonesia's Suharto, who was forced from office because of the
economic crisis, or Russia's Boris N. Yeltsin, whose power has been
severely diminished, Cardoso still enjoys broad popularity,
especially among the country's poorer residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fernando Henrique was the one who strengthened us when we were
weak,'' said Elza dos Santos, a Sao Paulo street vendor. ``We'll
have to see if he can make another miracle happen.''

SOCIAL SECURITY: THE SAFETY NET AGAINST HEDGE-PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For openers, the two guys who won the economics
prize from the Nobel foundation by all rights ought to turn in
their medals and citations and whatever is left of the cash.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the theories, for which they were honored among all those
who practice what justly has been described as the dismal science,
work better some times than others. Their investment scheme, called
a hedge fund, required extremely wealthy partners to begin with. It
made them filthy rich in the process, but is now on its knees, kept
from total disintegration by a rescue fund put together by
distinguished financial institutions and shepherded by the Federal
Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, investors lost 90 percent of their stake.
This is the way the much-vaunted free market is supposed to work.
You puts up your money and you takes your chances. But pause a
moment while the supposedly inviolate and occasionally harsh market
forces are temporarily suspended on behalf of the especially worthy
among us.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, in
defending the rescue as absolutely essential to the welfare of the
entire world, also let drop a hint that maybe the original
investors might be benefiting as time goes on.
</P>
<P>
   This is a great comfort to those of us fretting about where
their next $100 million was going to come from.
</P>
<P>
   Just think, these are the guys, or their like, who could have
their hands on our Social Security money if the plans to take it
wholly or partially private are actually implemented. Consider what
these investment wizards would be able to wreak if they grasped
that sweet honey pot.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is a clear shortage of economists in our
society. We need more of them to explain the processes of the
marketplace, and expound on the exceptions as they arise, in order
to guide the simpler souls who thought they had a grasp on the
rules of the game, but actually, hah hah, really didn't get the
entire point after all. The pluperfect experts' specialty is that
they have all the answers after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, these guys are the masters of the universe. And
if they were playing in their own sandbox, who could care? But so
often it turns out that whatever scheme they saddled up on begins
to threaten the well-being of the rest of the world, first, second
or third. Then there is good reason to place a steadier hand on the
reins.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem appears to be the bankers who bankrolled
these buccaneers. Now bankers are supposed to be buttoned up and up
tight and extremely careful with the money. Yet on occasion some
break the usual mold _ you know, the people who lend you money only
if you don't need it or own assets that exceed the value of the
loan. Along comes a wispy chance to score the odd $20 million or
$30 million or so, and out the window they go, head first, on a
handshake with an old buddy and golfing partner.
</P>
<P>
   There is an explanation for such behavior. You can test yourself
on it. Get in a group surrounding a rich person, and watch how
people who are not rich, or considerably less rich, behave. First
of all, the rich one is invariably the speaker, the others are
there to provide an audience. Attending to whatever the speaker has
to say, the eyes of the listeners grow big. Their manner becomes
diffident and entirely deferential. They hang on every phrase,
endorse every opinion, because nothing commands quite as much
respect as the man or woman who owns the loot.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind whether the riches were earned through creative
efforts of their own or whether they were inherited from a more
capable forebear. If you are rich you are understood to be
possessed of higher virtues and capabilities than the
less-well-endowed humanity.
</P>
<P>
   It's even a tacit part of some religions: God rewards the
virtuous, so if you have large means you obviously have a
concomitant quantity of goodness. In that congregation, the rich
deserve their wealth just as others earned their poverty by their
moral delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   Comforted by the reassurance from the highest levels that the
financial powers that be are truly only looking after the general
welfare, we can face the future with confidence. We know, as surely
as we are able to know anything, that when the next high-wire
walker stumbles, the net will be in place and taut beneath, to
provide protection against whatever fate looms. It begins to become
clear that is what is really meant by providing society with a
safety net. Now why could we have not seen that in the first place?

WHITFIELD SINGS ON THE `WICKED STAGE' OF CABARET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wesla Whitfield has brought back a lost art by making old songs
sound new every time she sings them.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on stools in rooms still dark but no longer smoky,
Whitfield performs songs as conversations with her husband,
arranger-pianist Mike Greensill; with the other musicians; with the
composers and lyricists; with the audience; and, most of all, with
her own experience. Her voice is deep-rooted as a tree, as
responsive to the breath of emotion as a leaf in the wind, and
sweet as sap. Whitfield sings it like it is; she has known despair
and hope, and she's come out a cockeyed optimist. As she sings
``When You Wish Upon a Star,'' you believe your dreams will come
true because she does, and hers did.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield, now 51, emerged in the piano bars of San Francisco in
the early 1970s when she was a member of the chorus of the San
Francisco Opera.
</P>
<P>
   (In those days, and indeed until quite recently, her first name,
always pronounced ``Wesla,'' was spelled ``Weslia.'' Not long ago,
Whitfield met the friend of her mother's for whom she was named,
and learned that the older woman spelled her name the way it was
pronounced; Whitfield decided that sounded good to her, and she's
made the change.)
</P>
<P>
   During the '80s, Whitfield became a West Coast phenomenon and
her self-produced recordings began to trickle eastward. By the
'90s, she was touring regularly, appearing prominently in New York.
She has sung in Carnegie Hall, and Hillary Clinton invited her to
sing in the White House. Last year she made her Boston debut at
Scullers, captivating the audience with the warmth of her voice and
personality, the immediacy of her emotions, the gentleness of her
humor. She returns there Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, People published a profile of Whitfield that may
have been the first timemany fans of her recordings learned that
in 1977 she had been shot in the back by kids playing with a gun,
and that she has been paralyzed from the waist down ever since.
This had never been mentioned in the biographical material in any
of her albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it?'' Whitfield said recently during a phone
conversation from her home in California. ``It's got nothing to do
with my music. The thing I've come to realize _ you can write this
down _ is that life is unfair. No matter how good I get as a
singer, it is always going to be qualified by my disability, and
that's what's unfair. So my way of railing against it, very gently,
is not to make an issue of it. I cook and run the vacuum cleaner
because I gotta. There's really only one thing I can't do, I can't
walk, and that's not very limiting at all, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield said the impulse to be a singer ``was always there,
from the age of 3. The piano was my first instrument, and I got as
far as John Thompson's Red Book No.4. I was not one of those
brilliant prodigies because my heart wasn't in it, but it was a
fabulous foundation for later. My mother had all this sheet music
in the piano bench, and I used the songs for sight reading, and I
loved them. In high school I sang in the chorus and in my senior
year I was Fiona in a production of `Brigadoon.' My voice was a
high soprano _ it still is, but not in public _ and my heroine was
Beverly Sills. I had a small voice and I learned a million tricks
to make myself heard.''
</P>
<P>
   At San Francisco State, Whitfield majored in music and took
drama classes; from there she went straight into the chorus of the
San Francisco Opera. ``It wasn't as impressive as it sounds, but it
was a union gig, so I made really nice money. I thought singing in
the chorus might get me somewhere, but from the chorus, you don't
graduate into anything. But I was just out of school, and what did
I know? Still, it was a fabulous experience to stand behind such
people as Beverly Sills, Joan Sutherland, and Shirley Verrett, and
I can say that I sang with all three tenors.''
</P>
<P>
   After performances, Whitfield found herself gravitating to the
piano bars. ``In the opera, all anyone thought about was `the
voice'; in the piano bars, the most important thing was the song,
and that's where my heart was. I still warm up with my old
exercises everyday and still sing the little Italian art songs I
started out with _ they keep everything open and free. I want to
keep in good vocal shape because that's the only way I will be able
to convey everything I want to convey. My voice keeps stretching _
I can still sing up to high C, and now I can go down to E-flat
below middle C, which believe me I could never have done back when
I was in college. I vocalise at the top to make the middle
stronger. Because I vocalise, I know I'm not going to get too
tired, or catch up in my throat. My classical training gives me a
fabulous leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Frank Sinatra always liked to say; he wanted to sing
with a pop sound and a classical technique. Whitfield admits she
had something to learn about popular styles. ``I always wanted to
be something other than Kathy Lee Gifford, but I was certainly
going down that road until I met my husband Mike Greensill. I
didn't have any sense of how to interpret the songs in something
other than a completely literal way.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield explains how she works with Greensill. ``We both find
songs we might like, and each of us tries to have a clear idea of
how to do it before we talk to each other. We're going to have to
defend our own point of view, and we say things to each other that
we would not say to any other musician _ getting better at what we
do is the most important thing in the world to each of us. We try
it each other's way _ and I always win. Then he makes an
arrangement, and we rehearse it until we either say it's time to
take it out into the light of day, or throw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Greensill's arrangements are sophisticated, swinging, literate,
and often surprising _ ballads get shaken out; upbeat tunes reveal
a core of sadness. Whitfield had worked with Greensill often before
they married in 1986. ``It wasn't a great romantic moment _ after
all, we were both married to other people at the time. He came into
a club where I was working in 1981 and was invited to sit in. He
did some arrangements for me and I invited him to play for little
gigs I was doing. We began working together regularly and became
very good friends for four years. Then, all of a sudden, we looked
at each other in a different way and realized we were in very deep
do-do. Both of us are very nice people, so we were very proper
about it; we didn't have a dalliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1985, Whitfield and Greensill made their own albums
for sale at their performances. ``We called our label Myoho, a
Buddhist term for `constant reality changing phenomenon.' The CDs
were a calling card, a record of what it is we do. After we had
done three of these, Orrin Keepnews at HighNote got interested in
us, and put us on his label. We've just finished our 11th album,
which should be out by the time we get to Boston. It's called `High
Standards.'''
</P>
<P>
   Recently Whitfield and Greensill have been working on an
autobiographical show, ``Life Upon the Wicked Stage.'' ``We had our
first runthrough last night. I've written the text, which is about
my life and about my life onstage, and we have pictures of me at
various times. I talk and wave my arms around. But mostly I sing;
the songs, and there are 15 or 16 of them, come in at just the
right moment. We're hoping to go around the college circuit and
into concert halls with this. In those venues, people come to
listen instead of drink, and we live for people who listen.''
</P>
<P>
   The heyday of cabaret singing came in the '30s and '40s;
survivors of the era kept the art alive through the 1970s. The new
generation has produced some adroit mimics and some spectacular
exercises in self-delusion, but not much that is personal and
therefore inimitable. Whitfield is an exception _ she has heard
everything and everyone, but she never tries to sound like anyone
else. She feels the real source of the resurgence of interest in
this art form is the literature itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular music in the early and middle 1950s was abysmal,''
Whitfield recalls. ``It wasn't Eddie Fisher's fault, the stuff he
sang; even Rosemary Clooney sang junk. In that context rock sounded
very exciting, and I have a great respect for rock of that era _ it
had a beat, but before long the beat obliterated everything else.
The reason the old songs are coming back is its great strength,
something we've also seen in country music, and that's that these
songs tell a story and tell it truthfully. Lorenz Hart writing in
1930 still speaks directly to every man and woman who's ever been
in and out of love. That's why this music is coming back and people
are liking it; that's why Carly Simon is making albums of
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield harbors no illusions about the glamor of nightclubs,
although she loves singing in them. ``In the movies, the girl
singer sings one song in a room that is completely filled and with
a 20-piece orchestra you never see and she's a star overnight. We
all play those movies in our heads, even though the reality is so
different. The small clubs, like Scullers, have always been run out
of love, and that will always be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Whitfield performs about 150 nights a year, and would like
to do more. ``We do OK. We'd love more money, of course, but it's
mostly for our own satisfaction. The day will come when I'm not
able to do it anymore, so I have to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she harbors no bitterness about the 12-year-old boys,
never caught, who shot her that night in 1977. She told People,
``They were kids who were out alone with guns. That tells you
something about what their lives are like. I know _ and this isn't
meant to sound Pollyannish _ that my experiences have been better
than anything that could have come their way. If they are alive,
they are in prison. And I've had this fabulous life.'' Today,
Whitfield says, ``The Boston Globe isn't calling them up. I haven't
been through any more than most other people; what happened to me
was just more dramatic. Yes, it ages you; yes, it molds you; yes,
it mooshes your brain around. That's what life does _ if you're
lucky.''

MOM VS. GENE AUTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I was maybe 6-years-old, 7 tops.
</P>
<P>
   The president was an old bald guy named Eisenhower, who'd been a
soldier once. The heavyweight champion of the world was Rocky
Marciano, from up around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest movie star in the world was John Wayne. The hottest
singer around was somebody named Patti Page, who sang about doggies
in windows. And there was this boring guy on our 12-inch,
black-and-white Emerson television set at least a couple of nights
a week. His name was Arthur Godfrey. He played a ukulele.
</P>
<P>
   That was what the world was like the day that Gene Autry knocked
me out cold. And _ it scares me to think about it _ but I remember
it like it was yesterday. Those were the thoughts that hit me the
other night. I was listening to the radio when the news came on.
Gene Autry was dead at 91.
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself, ``He was how old? Good God!''
</P>
<P>
   The wanton hours fly past. Mark Twain said that. Or maybe I just
think it was he who said it because I grew up in the town where he
spent much of his life. You think of Mark Twain, and you think of
the Mississippi. But he was a struggling writer with a terrific
line of bullfeathers who'd married the richest woman in Elmira,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Twain lived out his days in my home town, sucking up bourbon and
scribbling on the old lady's dime. When I was a kid, the downtown
hotel was named after him. That's where Autry knocked me cold.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I ought to explain that.
</P>
<P>
   Autry came to town to put on a few shows at the Colonial
Theater, only a block from where Twain's house had stood. The city
fathers, in their wisdom, had long before permitted the house to be
torn down and a shopping plaza to be erected on its site. But
Autry's only interest in anything remotely connected to Mark Twain
was the hotel bar, the Connecticut Yankee Lounge, to which he
retreated between shows.
</P>
<P>
   My mother had taken me to one of those show. Afterwards, she'd
dragged me across the street to the hotel restaurant for ice cream.
Then Autry himself had entered, with his cowboy hat and his camel
hair overcoat. He retreated to the bar for sustenance before
cruising back across the street for the next show.
</P>
<P>
   When Autry came in, I was so excited that I spit ice cream clear
across the table. My mother ordered me to settle down, but I
couldn't. I kept slipping away from the table to peek through the
swinging doors to the bar and watch Autry slug down manhattans. He
never did that in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Autry got up, threw some bills on the bar and hit those
swinging doors, catching me right between the eyes. I went out like
a light. First graders have glass jaws.
</P>
<P>
   I awakened to see Autry against a wall, wide-eyed, with my
mother about to rip him into shreds while a frantic waiter pleaded
with her to, ``Please, lady, calm down.'' Finally, she did, and
Autry hustled out of the place like it was on fire.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of her life, my mother never had a good word to say
about Autry. I always liked the guy, although not as much as Roy
Rogers, my very first hero, who died in July. I met him once, too,
in 1974, in one of his restaurants on Long Island. I was surprised
to discover that Roy Rogers was sort of a little guy _ very
gracious and polite, but short. My mother wasn't very big, either.
</P>
<P>
   But she probably could have kicked his butt, too.

ROBIN WILLIAMS' JOURNEY FROM HEAVEN TO HELL LACKS ORIGINALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being in heaven alone, without the one you love _ that would be
hell, wouldn't it? It's a great idea for a movie, and ``What Dreams
May Come'' uses this thought as its story. Director Vincent Ward, a
New Zealander with a silvery visual aptitude, has made this theme
his own province in previous work _ he seems to seek it out.
</P>
<P>
   In his film ``Map of the Human Heart,'' he featured a
protagonist who had a taste of heaven and had it snatched it away.
That also happens to Chris (Robin Williams), who meets the woman he
falls in love with while sailing alone _ and his heaven on earth
begins immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After losing their two children in a car accident, Chris and his
wife (Annabella Sciorra) slump into lives of quiet misery. Then
Chris dies while helping at the site of a car crash. (It's the best
scene in ``Dreams''; Ward's ability for shifting mood swiftly
serves him well here.)
</P>
<P>
   Working with a group of technical wizards, Ward has found a way
to create a screen tableau that looks like an Impressionist
painting that hasn't quite dried. It's a visualization of an
incomplete heaven _ Chris' wife was a painter, and he's plopped
down into a realization of one of her paintings.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, ``What Dreams May Come'' settles into an almost
morbid sentimentality. A blurry presence trying to help Chris
reconcile himself to the idea of being dead turns out to be Albert
(Cuba Gooding Jr.), his medical school mentor. (Although at first,
Gooding sounds so much like Michael Jackson that you think his idea
of heaven may be an episode of ``Pop-Up Video.'')
</P>
<P>
   The first section of the movie drips Nutrasweet from time to
time, but you have no preparation for the gooeyness that rolls out
in waves after that. With bodies floating and gamboling as huge,
light-splashed stairs and arches loom in the distance, heaven looks
like the McDonald's at the Mall of America.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris' wife kills herself, he discovers that she's going to
hell _ not just because she's a suicide, but because hell is the
place for people who haven't forgiven themselves, which, of course,
explains why heaven turns out to be so empty.
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Albert, along with a guide (Max von Sydow), make the
journey to reclaim Chris' wife from hell. They pass through horrid
spots that make the voyage a religious version of a mixed metaphor:
They sail over a river full of lost souls, themselves rendered in
black and white, that seems like the River Styx as re-created for
an Obsession ad.
</P>
<P>
   Their boat is appropriately named Cerberus, and you can't help
wondering whether Chris knows of von Sydow's having played Death in
Bergman movies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's such a need for comparisons because ``Dreams''
seems so second-hand, despite fitful moments of originality. Those
brief, unique moments _ be it a damp, painted Dreamland, or Chris'
last view of his kids driving away, both shimmery and sad, or an
expanse of land that turns out to be made out of faces (purgatory)
_ make the prevailing lumpiness all the more frustrating. Ward's
talents don't include consistency, which is his biggest problem in
``Dreams,'' an inoffensive, suburban turn on ``Paradise Lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matheson, from whose novel the movie comes, has also
written about loss and the journey back to acceptance with more a
bent toward science fiction than we see here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreams'' is supposed to be about resilience, but there are so
many crinkly faces smiling through the tears that it feels
unremitting in its winsomeness. Williams plays it mostly straight
here. He's a nice guy, too nice to be so driven. Everyone in the
movie is very nice, so it robs the actors of weight.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dreams,'' heaven drifts slowly _ very slowly _ into the
Talking Heads definition, a place where nothing ever happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' is rated PG-13 for adult language and
scenes of violence and death.

ANTICHOICE REPUBLICANS PLAY DANGEROUS GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- More scenes from Newt Gingrich's dysfunctional
House:
</P>
<P>
   _Late Thursday evening, the forces of revolution and anarchy
inside the conservative movement's tent were able to prevent
legislation paying for the basic operations of the government from
even coming to a final vote. The measure split the Republican
majority more than in half, with the antis in control for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   _Well into Friday, legislation paying for the country's farm
programs, including special assistance for drought and other
economic disaster victims, languished among Senate and House
negotiators. The intransigent bad guys, as usual, were members of
Gingrich's perpetually petulant majority.
</P>
<P>
   And in both these cases of Marx Brothers government, the major
reason was the same: the dirty, petty, increasingly vicious,
so-called politics of abortion. While one bunch of Gingrich's
majority is obsessed with investigating sex, another seems equally
obsessed with regulating sex and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's problem got a certain amount of media attention
because it combined cruelty with absurdity in an effort to keep
female federal employees from having access to health insurance
plans offering contraceptive services. This bit of government
micromanagement of family life would have occurred at the same time
federal worker insurance plans are competing without right-wing
interference to offer sexually excited guys coverage for their
Viagra pills.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an effort led by Representative Nita Lowey, Democrat
of New York, this attempt has so far gone nowhere and, thanks to
Thursday's chaotic vote, is even less likely to, which one hopes
will permit more attention to focus on the far more pernicious
politics being played with the agriculture legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In this behind-the-scenes fight, the bad guy is Dr. Tom Coburn,
Republican of Oklahoma, who dishonors the Muskogee-based seat held
for a decade by an independent populist adept at bipartisanship,
the late Mike Synar. Coburn's Web site includes a lengthy account
of his activities in promotion of abstinence, but his real work is
in subversion of a woman's constitutional right to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn's latest game is to attach to the farm bill a provision
barring the Food and Drug Administration from doing research,
testing, or anything else (including approval for sale) involving
drugs ``for the chemical inducement of abortion.'' It passed the
House narrowly in June, and supporters refused to let the overall
bill go forward to final passage without it. The Republicans gave
up late Friday, but only after loud protests that they were
delaying aid to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   This is an excellent example of what happens when political
movement language gets into legislation. Another is the political
invention of ``partial birth abortion.'' And in neither case is the
remedy proposed targeted on the outrage claimed by right-to-lifers.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of late-term abortion methods, the bill Clinton
successfully vetoed would have invaded medical decisions early in
pregnancy, and ignored health consequences for women later on _
both concepts being flagrantly illegal under Roe v. Wade and
regularly found to be so by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In Coburn's case, his proposal may appear aimed at the
abortifacient drug RU-486, but its blunderbuss impact would be much
wider. Opponents, led by Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of
Connecticut, have marshaled an impressive array of evidence _ from
drug companies, the FDA, and the medical community _ that Coburn
would end up targeting drugs whose side effects as opposed to
purpose can include miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, as DeLauro has summarized these professional
views, we're now talking about pregnant women with cancer who
undergo a broad variety of chemotherapy treatments; we also could
be talking hypertension, cirrhosis, arthritis, venous thrombosis,
ulcers, epilepsy, uterine fibrosis, ectopic pregnancies, and severe
viral infections. In addition, De Lauro said his proposal would
strip the FDA of its important responsibility to monitor research
and testing the drug companies themselves do on potential new
products designed to induce miscarriages without surgical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   For all those reasons, it is very hard to imagine anything like
the Coburn monstrosity becoming law. Such a prediction is even
easier in the case of the contraceptive insurance coverage issue,
because both houses of Congress are already on record in support.
</P>
<P>
   However, the real point is the increasing bitterness of
antichoice politics, and the extent to which Gingrich's House
enables the movement's obstructionism. Playing legislative games
with flagrantly illegal and cruel proposals that single out
vulnerable people attempting to exercise a constitutional right is
beneath contempt.

HOW TO ESCAPE THE DELUGE OF JUNK MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling to add dropped text)   (EDs: Graphic available on Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID UHLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Benjamin Franklin was only two-thirds right when
he noted that nothing in this world is certain but death and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   He never got any junk mail.
</P>
<P>
   More politely referred to as direct mail, the mass-marketing
technique of unsolicited catalogs, advertisements and letters
(``Congratulations, Mr. Franklin! You've Won $30 Million!!!'')
hadn't yet been invented when the author, statesman and founding
father wrote about life's certainties in 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   If he had known about junk mail, perhaps old Ben _ who also
served as our country's first postmaster general _ might have done
something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Today, plenty of cost-conscious consumers and coupon clippers
look forward to the daily flow of fliers, advertising slicks and
colorful catalogs in their mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, however, there are hundreds of books and
Internet sites that offer tips and tricks to stop direct mail,
telemarketing phone calls and unwanted computer e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can stop it,'' said Marc Eisenson, co-author of ``Stop
Junk Mail Forever'' (Telemarketing &AMP; Spam, Too). ``But you've got
to be vigilant and keep on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why junk mail keeps flowing and telephone solicitors
don't take ``no'' for an answer:
</P>
<P>
   _ Direct marketing in the United States yielded nearly $1.3
trillion in sales in 1997, according to a survey by the WEFA Group,
one of the world's largest economic information and consulting
firms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consumers responding to direct mail solicitations spent $244.3
billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1996, 62.1 percent of all women made a catalog sales
purchase, as did 50.6 of all men.
</P>
<P>
   You live, therefore you get junk mail. It's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a new car. Apply for a credit card. Fill out a warranty
form. Change your address. Have a baby. When you buy something at a
store and the clerk asks for your name and address, rest assured
you are not being added to the company's holiday card list. Dozens
of daily activities land unwitting people on the massive lists of
the world's direct mailers and marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the difference between junk mail and direct
mail is in the mailbox of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Cox Target Media in Florida, which franchises
the Val-Pak mail operations around the country, said ``people call
all the time to get on the mailing list.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the coupons,'' said Chuck Relyea, address
information manager for Val-Pak. The coupons in Val-Pak come from
small local companies, ``mom-and-pop'' businesses that share the
envelope with other advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at ADVO Inc., another big direct mail marketer, say
surveys show that 75 percent of people read advertising mail and 34
percent make purchases based on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often think people don't want clutter in their mailboxes,''
said Brian Sanders, chief marketing officer for ADVO in
Connecticut. ``But the reality is people want information.
Consumers today want to make smart choices when they buy
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Vesna Huzovic, media relations manager for the Direct Marketing
Association, said the organization's 4,100 members ``are trying to
provide a service and give something to somebody who is interested
specifically in that topic area.''
</P>

WOMEN'S SPORTS ON TRIAL AS UNC COACH FACES SUIT

<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ A jubilant coach hugs a smiling player after
winning a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   A photo of that innocent embrace appeared in a glossy guide to
women's soccer at the University of North Carolina. But that was
before the most dominant team in women's sports lost its sense of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the photo has disappeared, deleted from this year's guide
in response to a lawsuit by two former players who say they were
sexually harassed and emotionally abused by coach Anson Dorrance, a
legend in the world of women's athletics. Dorrance denies the
charges, and the school is standing behind him along with more than
100 current and former players.
</P>
<P>
   As Dorrance fights to clear his name, and the plaintiffs battle
to force his ouster and win $12 million in damages, the lawsuit is
reverberating far beyond Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it involve a coaching icon, it comes at a time of
soaring popularity of women's sports, a simultaneous drop in the
percentage of female coaches, and a heightened concern about the
balance of sexual power in workplaces, classrooms, and now, even on
playing fields.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the lawsuit has jolted school sports programs
nationwide, particularly among women's teams with male coaches, as
participants wonder how to preserve the bonds between coaches and
players, without trampling appropriate boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows what the truth is about Anson Dorrance,'' said
Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports Foundation
in New York. ``But it's obvious this whole issue of intimate
relationships by authority figures with students or people who are
working for them is one that is causing great concern and a lot of
soul-searching, and rightfully so.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, though, there are more immediate worries, such as the
reputation of a university steeped in sporting tradition, and the
future of a sports dynasty that has won 15 national titles in 17
years. Former UNC men's basketball coach Dean Smith, a giant in the
game, said only half-jokingly last year that ``this is a women's
soccer school. We're just trying to keep up with them.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the small concerns. Consider the fate of the
hugging photo, which appeared in the team's 1997 media guide.
</P>
<P>
   Neither plaintiff is the player being hugged by Dorrance. Yet,
rather than using it in this year's guide, the school substituted a
photo of Dorrance standing by himself. ``You don't want people
taking things the wrong way,'' said Dave Lohse, UNC director of
media relations for Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, near the homes
of both women, involves two ex-UNC players: scoring star Debbie
Keller, 23, a ``Carolina legend'' who now plays on the US National
Team, and whose No. 8 is one of only six jerseys retired by the
school team; and Melissa Jennings, 19, a non-scholarship goalie
whose teammates questioned her work ethic and who was dropped from
the team in May. Neither would comment on the lawsuit, their lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side is Dorrance, 47, a married father of three who
is celebrated in soccer circles as a motivational and tactical
genius. Dorrance's record in 19 full seasons is a staggering 417
wins, 16 losses and 11 ties.
</P>
<P>
   After having weathered the ``humiliating and embarrassing''
first days after the lawsuit was filed in August, Dorrance says he
is determined to prove his innocence. On the advice of his lawyer,
he declined to comment on specific allegations, but denied
harassing players or abusing his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has hurt my mother and it hurts my family, but the team
has taken care of itself very quickly. This crisis forced us to
band together,'' said Dorrance, whose Tar Heels opened the season
with eight straight wins and a No. 1 national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans no change in his style or behavior, with one
exception. In the closest he came to blaming his accusers, Dorrance
said: ``All of us are going to be a lot more thorough about the
sort of people we admit into this environment, this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Keller, he said only, ``Debbie had a fantastic career here
and was wonderfully coachable.'' He had no comment on Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, the women allege that Dorrance on several
occasions made ``an uninvited sexual advance'' toward Keller. It
claims he repeatedly made inappropriate physical contact, touching
her body, and stroking her hair.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also accuses Dorrance of interrogating his players
about their personal lives and sexual activities; of coercing team
members to report to him the sexual activities of other players; of
making lewd and degrading comments about players; of repeatedly
calling Keller to monitor her personal life; and of sending Keller
an intimidating and harassing e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations involving Jennings revolve primarily around
money and alcohol, and Dorrance and the university already have
acknowledged some mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings asserts that Dorrance ordered her to withdraw $400 from
her bank account to buy Gatorade and supplies for her teammates and
an opposing team when the coaches found themselves without money.
The lawsuit also says Dorrance encouraged her to drink alcohol,
despite knowing she was under age and, as a Mormon, abstained from
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Jennings's father in June, in the midst of failed
discussions to head off the lawsuit, Dorrance apologized for using
``poor judgment'' in asking to borrow money and said he
``understands that alcoholic beverages must not be allowed at any
activity involving team members.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorrance also admits in the letter that he engaged in
``inappropriate'' group discussions ``of a jesting or teasing
nature'' with players, but said he never discussed sex during
one-on-one meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Buried deeper in the 19-page lawsuit _ and almost entirely
overlooked in press accounts _ is an assertion by Keller that some
of Dorrance's supporters suspect might be the real reason for the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Keller accuses Dorrance of interfering with her efforts to
obtain custom soccer shoes from Nike and Adidas when she was
recovering from a heel injury. Despite winning national
player-of-the-year honors in 1995 and 1996, Keller was prevented by
her heel injury from joining the US Olympic team, costing her a
gold medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says that Dorrance blocked Keller's bid for special
shoes as part of a complicated attempt to play the shoe companies
against each other while negotiating a lucrative Nike sponsorship
deal. That deal, a university official said, will pay him roughly
$450,000 over four years, a significant boost over his $50,000
coaching salary.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for Keller and Jennings, Louis Varchetto, said he
could not comment on individual acusations, but said the lawsuit
was based on the entire pattern of Dorrance's behavior. He
dismissed the outpouring of support by the school and UNC players,
comparing the situation to President Clinton's sexual imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will blindly follow someone they like, whether they
know the truth or not,'' Varchetto said.
</P>
<P>
   At a team practice last week, talk of the lawsuit was replaced
by the sound of Dorrance calling out commands and advice to two
dozen young women darting about on an immaculately groomed field.
Dorrance was quick to praise a good shot or a smart defense, and
just as quick to order a player to do five sit-ups for failing to
accelerate after passing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former players _ all of whom call Dorrance by his
first name _ were effusive in defense of their coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Anson pats you on the shoulder and says `good job,' he's
just being a coach,'' said senior Tiffany Roberts, a member of the
national team who roomed with Keller and considers her a good
friend. ``She thought it was sexual harassment, but none of us have
had any problem with Anson.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the sidelines sat Dorrance's mother, Peggy, in a straw hat
and tennis shoes. ``This is such a tough time,'' she said, her
voice cracking. ``He has the highest ethical standard of any person
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But Craig Jennings, whose daughter Melissa is still attending
UNC, said in a telephone interview from Illinois that Dorrance
exploited his position. ``A professor has power over a student for
one grade. A coach has far more power, and he can use that power
like Anson did, to gain control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Dorrance, the lawsuit names the school and nine other
university officials, including former University of Massachusetts
President Michael K. Hooker, now UNC chancellor, and assistant UNC
coach Tracy Ducar, who plays with Keller on the national team. The
additional defendants are mostly accused of failing to stop
Dorrance's inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at all the evidence, and we don't think there's
anything there to justify the charges,'' Hooker said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear when the case will come to trial. Whatever the
eventual outcome, already the lawsuit has focused attention on the
issue of male coaches of female athletes. It came just three months
after two former Syracuse women's tennis players filed a $25
million harassment lawsuit against the school's male coach.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Lopiano of the Women's Sports Foundation offers a
hard-line set of standards for coaches: ``You shouldn't be alone
with players, one on one. You shouldn't be in equipment rooms with
them. You shouldn't be in social situations. You are a teacher, and
the distance between the teacher and the student is a guarantee of
objectivity and proper limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches, both male and female, said the case has forced
them to review their actions but would not cause them to adopt a
policy quite so strict.
</P>
<P>
   ``It heightens awareness, and you think about guidelines, but
I'm not going to change my coaching style,'' said US National Team
coach Tony Diccico.
</P>
<P>
   April Heinrichs, a former UNC soccer star who now coaches at the
University of Virginia, said the issue affects both sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality and gender should never be an issue in coaching. If
I were coaching young males, I wouldn't call them stud muffin or
sweetie or good-looking. I wouldn't make reference to their body or
body type,'' she said. ``Once we get away from the specifics about
Anson, maybe the benefit will be that we can start to educate
people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWCASTLE, Wash. _ As a little girl _ not long ago _ Vicki Noon
used to clown around for home videos, pretending to be Ariel of
``The Little Mermaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ariel on her seaside rock, Vicki would climb atop her bunk
bed and sing achingly in her bright, powerful voice about being
``part of your world.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki is 13 now, and if she became part of our world any faster,
she'd risk getting the bends.
</P>
<P>
   After just a year or so of voice lessons, the Newcastle
eighth-grader has already landed three plum roles, including the
juvenile lead in Seattle's A Contemporary Theatre's fall production
of ``Violet.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, which runs Oct. 22 through Nov. 15, won the 1997 New
York Critics Circle Award for best musical.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Vicki won lead roles in two musicals at the Washington
Academy of Performing Arts. The fast-growing Redmond school was
co-founded by Deborah Hadley, former prima ballerina with Pacific
Northest Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, a last-minute cast change thrust Vicki into the
role of Dorothy in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' giving her less than five
days to learn a part that normally takes Academykarin: i left
Academy up all the way through because i think it's needed for
clarity--pat students a month or two to prepare. In late August, on
a less frantic note, she played the rags-to-riches heroine of
``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki is still a little girl in lots of many ways _
freckle-faced, with a thatch of dark, chin-length hair, and glasses
she wears everywhere except onstage. At 5-foot-3, she packs 105
pounds of coiled energy into the compact body of an athlete _
hidden somewhere under her baggy overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she's a kid who has just discovered she's got talent
that could land her on top of the world. The joy of performing
makes her feel like she's already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes me happy,'' Vicki said, face glowing. ``I love
it. I think it's so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, she faces tough career choices. On one hand, theater
pros say she has the raw, oversized talent to make it on Broadway.
Some compare her to the young Judy Garland, although there's no
trace of Garland's fragility in Vicki's bubbly personality and
clarion vocal style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime voice,'' said Jerry Tassin, one of
her Academy mentors. ``This girl has a set of pipes I have not
heard in years. It's a Broadway belt, is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Her singing coach, Ann Evans Zavada, said that in 10 years of
teaching, she has had only two other students of Vicki's caliber,
neither of whom has lived up to their early promise. One was
sidetracked by her social life. The other was a boy soprano who
sang with Seattle Opera until his voice changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Vicki has a clearer understanding of the professional
world and what she needs to do to be involved in it,'' Zavada said.
``And she wants to be involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Vicki also is a nearly straight-A student and
a star soccer player who, according to her coach, could make it to
the U.S. Women's Team if she weren't distracted by pipe dreams.
Last season she scored 23 of her team's 67 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit,'' said Norm Robinson, coach of her Gold
Select youth team in Renton. ``Her dribbling skills are incredible.
She has good ball control and she's fast. She has great moves.''
</P>
<P>
   But with theater work stealing time from soccer practice,
Robinson is pressing her to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a little girl with a lot of talent who's getting pulled
in two different directions,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouoyant, twinkly-eyed and still innocent enough to be thrilled
by her good fortune, Vicki is frank about her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be on Broadway,'' she said with a happy giggle.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big leap for a girl who, three years ago, was too shy to
sing in a talent show on a vacation cruise. Instead, she joined a
lip-synch contest for adult women _ and won, putting body and soul
into a pantomime of Aretha Franklin's signature song, ``Respect.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year of song and dance training _ with many more to come
_ she has the erect, grounded posture of a gymnast and holds the
stage with quiet confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really nice to have around,'' said Kira Tassin, 14, who
appeared with her in ``Oz'' and ``Annie,'' ``because sometimes when
we have to run through something again, she makes a joke of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blowing off steam at an early rehearsal for ``Annie'' one day,
Vicki and another girl briefly hammed it up behind the director's
back during a boy's vocal solo.
</P>
<P>
   Threading through the darkened rows of seats, the two girls
shimmied in tandem _ arms outspread, shoulders gyrating in a broad,
chorus-girl sendup. Onstage, the cast cracked up.
</P>
<P>
   Director Kelly Willis whirled around _ long, red hair whipping.
She laughed, then admonished ``Vicki, sit down!''
</P>
<P>
   But it's all business now for Vicki, who's in rehearsal for
ACT's production of ``Violet.'' The show features two veterans of
last fall's New York premiere _ Lauren Ward, who originated the
adult lead role of Violet, and director Susan H. Schulman.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1964, it tells of a young mountain woman who sets out by
bus for Tulsa in hopes of finding a television evangelist who can
heal her disfigured face. Joined by two unlikely traveling
companions, Violet finally comes to understand her own strength and
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In flashbacks, Vicki plays the young Violet, who is maimed when
her father accidentally hits her in the face with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only in about five scenes,'' said Vicki, who crammed for
her audition during a half-hour with Willis, using the
International Phonetic Alphabet to master a passable Southern
accent. She also twanged her way through the song, ``Delta Dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ACT casting director Margaret Layne said Vicki seems to produce
her powerful vocals without effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense she's pushing to get the volume she does,''
Layne said. ``There's no straining. It's as natural as breathing.
She has a big, bright, unmannered voice that you can't listen to
without smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   She also projects uncanny self-confidence for such a rank
beginner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicki does one of the most poised auditions that I've ever
seen anyone do,'' Layne said. ``She's very relaxed. I think a lot
of that has to do with the support she gets from her family. They
do a lot to help her keep things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki and her sister, Andrea, 17, spend time with both parents,
who divorced last year after 18 years of marriage but remain
friendly. Mom Liz Noon, 36, certifies Boeing airplane systems for
the Federal Aviation Administration. Dad Tim Noon, 42, is a Boeing
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki and Andrea, who wants to be a pediatrician, say they're
very close, though they occasionally squabble over little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll both just crack up,'' Andrea said. ``Our fights
last for about two minutes, then we'll laugh for five.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea said most of her friends don't mind Vicki tagging along
because she's ``amusing.'' But some are annoyed by her tendency to
hog the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Willis and Tassin, who teach dance and musical
theater at the Academy, had to convince Vicki she had a voice worth
developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to sing in front of people at first,'' Vicki
said. ``I know that I have a good voice, but I don't want to flaunt
it in front of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now she says, ``I'm glad I can't see the faces of the
people (in the audience). I think it would scare me if they weren't
liking it or were bored or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki's first big stage role was in the Academy's summer
production of ``The Wizard of Oz.'' It was a nerve-racking affair
that propelled her from the Munchkin chorus line to the role of
Dorothy in distressingly short order.
</P>
<P>
   At dress rehearsal, four days after she got the part, she still
hadn't learned all the songs. The next night, when the curtain
rose, she had it down cold.
</P>
<P>
   Her heroic performance knocked the socks off co-star Greg
Palmer, an independent TV film producer and former KING/5 reporter,
who played the Wizard. He saw her as ``an incredibly hard-working
tot with a singing voice that sounds like she's a 35-year-old
pro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has, as far as I can tell, perfect pitch and easily
filled a thousand-seat hall, with or without sound amplification,''
Palmer said. ``She has what could be just a stunning career ahead
of her. I just think there's no limit to how far she can go.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Oz,'' Vicki's life assumed a whirlwind quality. She and
Andrea were vacationing with their dad in North Carolina this past
summer when ACT called Vicki back for a second audition for
``Violet,'' this time before the director and musical staff.
</P>
<P>
   As one of six finalists, she had no guarantees of anything
except a disrupted vacation and an extra $400 in travel expenses.
In the end, her father drove her to the airport from the beach
house near Cape Hatteras and put her on a puddle-jumper to
Jacksonville, N.C. Traveling solo, she changed planes in
Charlottesville, Va.; Washington, D.C., and Phoenix before arriving
back in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Layne said Vicki managed to project the right combination of
resilience and toughness for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``And of course,'' Layne said, ``she sings like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Zavada said Vicki has an ``excellent transition'' between the
upper and lower ranges _ a seamlessness that some women spend years
trying to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Vicki can span at least three octaves _ less than
Mariah Carey's four, but twice as much as the average person. Her
sound comes from the shape of her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really wide across the cheeks,'' Zavada said. ``The
shape of the (vocal) cords is really the same on everybody. It's
really the resonating chambers that change the timbre and quality
of the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of coaching, Vicki has less vocal tension
and better breath control, which should see her through eight
performances a week in ``Violet.'' But she still has years of
training and hard work ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't encourage her to cruise,'' said Zavada. She tells
Vicki, ``Sure, this is fine, but what's it going to be like when
you're 15, or 17? You have to keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   Tassin, artistic co-director of the Washington Academy, said
it's important to keep Vicki ``unaware'' and suitably humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she gets out there and feels she's so successful she's
already where she needs to be, that will be her downfall,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We have her at a very important time of her
life. The talent is there, she's ready to train. If we get her
through the next few years and give her that solid base, she will
go!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vicki still has the pressures of school and soccer.
Coach Robinson has complained to Liz Noon about Vicki's absences,
saying it breeds resentment among girls who show up faithfully but
don't always get to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did kind of blow up with each other once,'' Robinson said,
``because I was fed up with her not being at practice, and I had
parents on my back.''
</P>
<P>
   They have since smoothed things over, although Saturday
rehearsals for ``Violet'' have forced Vicki to suspend soccer
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Noon, meanwhile, worries about the emotional wear and tear
of a performing career. This fall he vetoed Vicki's request to skip
eighth grade and go directly into the Academy's performance-focused
high school, the Conservatory. Maybe next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 13. She's my little girl,'' he said, as Vicki perched on
his knee with her arm around his shoulder. ``I'm worried about her
still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I worry about is, how is this affecting Andrea?
It used to be Andrea who had all the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea, herself a star soccer and tennis player, smiled wanly.
</P>
<P>
   Given Vicki's assorted talents, it isn't exactly ``Broadway or
bust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this voice or musical theater doesn't work out,'' said Liz
Noon, ``she could be a great engineer, she could be a doctor, she
could be anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``I would like to see her be able to use her
voice because I think that's her biggest talent. And she loves it,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Robinson understands how dreams of stardom can overshadow
the thrill of a well-placed soccer kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of dreams,'' he said, ``are great dreams to have.''

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 !!! 1/2 ``Antz''  Computer-generated imagery makes this bug cartoon
seem a fresh, exhilarating hoot. It reinvigorates the schleppy
nebbish persona of Woody Allen as a neurotic worker ant turned hero
when he falls for a princess, drolly voiced by Sharon Stone. But
mostly, it's the feeling of watching an old tradition scrubbed
clean, shiny with newness, that makes ``Antz'' such a high. (PG)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !! ``The Impostors''  &LR; Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt knock
thesmelves out as unemployed actors stowing away on a luxury cruise
liner in the '30s. Initially lively, this farce runs out of steam
fast, scuttling its hope to evoke ``Some Like It Hot'' and the Marx
Brothers' ``Monkey Business.'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FR)!! 1/2 ``What Dreams May Come''  &LR; This film sets a grand new
visual standard for afterlife movies with its heaven seemingly
designed by Monet and Van Gogh and its hell dreamed up by
Hieronymous Bosch. Try as they will, though, Robin Williams and
Annabella Sciora, as a couple trying to reunite after death, can't
provide an emotional dimension equal to the stunning visuals.
(PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !!! ``Lolita''  &LR; While director Adrian Lyne adds too much
literary atmosphere, and not enough humor, this engaging adaptation
of Nabokov's classic has moments of great power. Jeremy Irons is
outstanding as a tragic Humbert Humbert, awash in his tormented
romantic feelings for the young nymphet. (Matthew Gilbert)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !!! ``Six-String Samurai''  &LR; Terminally hip little
post-apocalyptic send-up of martial arts movies, vintage rock and
the mythification of pop culture artifacts. Jeffrey Falcon looks
like Buddy Holly, acts like Clint Eastwood and is right on the
laconic money as he trudges across a wasteland to Lost Vegas to vie
for Elvis Presely's crown. (PG-13)

FREER GALLERY MARKS 75TH ANNIVERSARY

   WASHINGTON _ A railroad man's job loss 120 years ago proved to
be a gain for the nation because it resulted in the unique
collection of Oriental and American art housed at the Smithsonian
Institution's Freer Gallery in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The 75th anniversary of the gallery opening in 1923 will be
observed Oct. 11 by a special exhibition of 100 new works acquired
for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   They include examples of sculpture, painting, ceramics,
calligraphy and metalware produced over a period of 4,000 years
throughout a wide area of Asia. Many are associated with royalty,
such as the Emperor Shah Jahan, builder of the Taj Mahal in India.
They will be exhibited through next April 11.
</P>
<P>
   The new works are significant additions to the collection
originally deeded to the nation in 1906 by Charles Lang Freer, who
made his fortune as a manufacturer of rail cars.
</P>
<P>
   When Freer lost his job in an 1878 Indiana rail merger, he
pooled his money with a friend and started a rail car building
enterprise in Michigan that made him rich. Retiring at the age of
45, he traveled throughout the world collecting art.
</P>
<P>
   Freer offered his collection of about 9,000 works to the
Smithsonian in 1904, but the institution's Board of Regents
hesitated to accept it because of conditions attached. They were
finally persuaded by President Theodore Roosevelt who met with them
and, pounding the arm of his chair, told them to accept the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Freer's bequest included money to house the collection in a new
building next to the Smithsonian's ``castle'' on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery's holdings now total 28,000 objects. The original
collection included art from the Near and Far East and a
distinguished group of works by American artists, notably James
McNeill Whistler, who was a friend of Freer's. One of the most
unusual is Whistler's ``Peacock Room,'' reassembled in the museum.
Of great importance to Biblical scholars are the museum's
5th-century Christian manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   The Freer Gallery and the adjoining 10-year-old Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery, devoted to Asian art, are located on Jefferson
Drive at 12th St. S.W. in Washington. They are open free to the
public every day but Dec. 25.

WE WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT TOMORROW WE WILL BE KILLED WITH OUR
FAMILIES 
Stories from Rwanda 
By Philip Gourevitch. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 355 pp. $25. 
 
 
WAR CRIMES 
Brutality, Genocide, Terror, and the Struggle for Justice
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Aryeh Neier. Times Books. &QL; 
286 pp. Illustrated. $25. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a scene in John Hersey's classic, ``Hiroshima,'' where
dazed and traumatized people are wandering away from the ruined
city. They cannot comprehend or articulate what has happened to
them, and when an aid worker asks one man where he is from, he
points to the ruined city and says vaguely, ``There.'' Asked where
he is going, he points the other way and says, ``There.''
</P>
<P>
   Something of that vacant feeling, that sense of overwhelmed
emptiness, may affect readers of Philip Gourevitch's extraordinary
book about the Rwanda genocide of spring 1994. It is absolutely
revealing in its detailed accounting of the horror _ the social and
political background, who did what to whom, the aftermath _ yet as
with all such events, the horror is outside the pale of
comprehension or articulation, in the darkness beyond the communal
campfires.
</P>
<P>
   Gourevitch, a staff writer for the New Yorker, was not in Rwanda
in the hundred days of April-July 1994, when at least 800,000
people were shot, bludgeoned, or hacked to death. He first went
there a year later. But his research, visits to killing sites, and
interviews with survivors and perpetrators yield something close to
an eyewitness account.
</P>
<P>
   In Rwanda, as in Yugoslavia, we imagine the genocide to be a
tribal affair: Hutus killing Tutsis out of ancient animosity. But
those are not distinct tribes, only artificial social and racial
groupings encouraged by the Belgian colonizers. Originally the
Tutsis were herdsmen, while the Hutus were farmers, with lower
status. In recent times the two groups freely intermarried and in
many cases are impossible to tell apart. Yet the status
distinctions remained, and the departing Belgians in 1960 left the
Tutsi elite in charge. A Hutu-led coup soon followed, after which
those Tutsis who did not go into exile became an uneasy minority
treated with suspicion _ and occasional pogroms. ``Killing Tutsis
was a political tradition in postcolonial Rwanda,'' Gourevitch
writes; ``it brought people together.''
</P>
<P>
   General Juvenal Habyarimana, a pogrom leader under his
predecessor, took power in 1973, vowing peace and harmony. His
wife, a Lady Macbeth named Agathe Kanzinga, came to be seen as a
power behind the throne. Around her a Hutu clique arose that fanned
an ideology called Hutu Power. Hutu Power regarded Hutus and Tutsis
roughly as National Socialism regarded Aryans and Jews: The latter
must be eliminated if the former is to survive. By spring 1994 the
hatemongers of Hutu Power had drummed into the people the idea, as
one put it in a speech two years earlier, ``We the people are
obliged to take responsibility ourselves and wipe out this scum.''
When Habyarimana was killed in a plane crash on April 6, 1994
(possibly by his own party), the orders were given, and the
slaughter began.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the massacre are horrifying and by now familiar:
Most of it was carried out by machete, at crossroads, in homes, and
in churches or hospitals where Tutsis had fled for safety. Fields
and streams and wells were filled with bodies. It was like the
scenes of Jonestown magnified more than a thousandfold. As shocking
as the deeds are the range and numbers of people who participated:
People killed their in-laws, doctors killed their patients, church
leaders killed parishioners. The killers included mayors,
schoolteachers, policemen. It seems a psychosis overcame the
people.
</P>
<P>
   There was a carefully prepared universal draft. Gourevitch
writes, ``Rwanda's Hutu Power leaders understood this perfectly.
... The people were the weapon, and that meant everybody: the
entire Hutu population had to kill the entire Tutsi population.
...If everybody is implicated, then implication becomes
meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   How could this have happened? Rwanda was by no means the poorest
of African countries; it had many educated and accomplished people.
Gourevitch hints at an answer that may make us feel better about
our fragmented, atomized society: a pervasive conformity at the
roots of Rwandan culture, which is necessary for survival, and
often admirable, but chilling when turned to diabolical ends. If a
neighbor is threatened and cries for help, one Rwandan explains to
Gourevitch, ``There is responsibility. I cry, you cry. You cry, I
cry. ... We all come running, and the one who stays quiet, that one
that stays home, must explain. Is he in league with the criminals?
... This is community.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing was more or less ended only when the Tutsi-led
Rwanda Patriotic Front army rolled across the country and drove the
Hutu Power into camps in neighboring Zaire and Tanzania. When in
1996 those camps were forcibly closed, 600,000 Hutus returned home
with the promise that there would be no full-scale retribution.
Some Hutu Power leaders were tried and punished, and others
remained in exile, but many smaller-scale killers returned to their
home communities to face the stares of their victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   How is such a return possible? How can any sort of social
cohesion develop after such events? The new government passed a law
that provided for lesser sentences, even forgiveness, for
lower-level perpetrators who confessed _ much like South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The new government took the
position that reeducation of the followers was possible. ``You
don't necessarily just go for everyone you might think you should
go for,'' said Paul Kagame, one of the new leaders. ``Maybe you
create an atmosphere where things are stabilized first, then you go
for those you must go for. Others you can even ignore for the sake
of gradually leading a kind of peaceful coexistence. ... And I
think some people can even benefit from being forgiven, being given
another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This idea is appealing and also unsettling; we are seeing it, or
have seen it, in many places in the world. Not only in South
Africa, where thugs and killers under the apartheid regime have
received amnesty if they came forward and confessed before the
commission, but also in Israel, Northern Ireland, and Argentina. In
all these places, people have taken the bitter medicine of sitting
down and trying to find a way to live with, or at least tolerate
the existence of, those whom they knew had committed or given
support to outrages.
</P>
<P>
   Aryeh Neiser's wide-ranging and cogent book, ``War Crimes,''
reviews all these historical cases, as well as the denazification
program in occupied Germany, and finds that in every case there
were compromises, that perfect justice, as we might envision it in
ordinary criminal cases, is almost never possible. In Germany, many
low-level bureaucrats and officials under the Nazi regime,
including many judges, were eventually given a clean slate and took
up their places in building the ``German Miracle,'' which was
needed to resist Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   Neier, formerly executive director of Human Rights Watch, is
restless over too-easy forgiveness, and argues strongly for
creation of an international court of justice. He believes the plan
for such a body, under the United Nations, will be realized by the
end of the century if the great powers support it. But he is under
no illusions that in the case of crimes on a vast scale, such as
those in Bosnia, Argentina, or Rwanda, many of those who helped
implement the evils would be prosecuted. He writes, ``the
overwhelming majority of those who conspired to commit crimes
against humanity (by definition, crimes on a great scale) or
knowingly aided in their commission cannot be prosecuted. ... the
fact that others who abetted the commission of great crimes will go
free makes them innocent only in the formal sense that they have
not been preven guilty in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   For the latter, the obloquy of their neighbors may be enough
retribution for both sides, as long as the survivors are given the
truth, consolation, and concrete help. ``Let's say we have a
hundred thousand young people who have lost their families and have
no hope, no future,'' says one Rwandan leader. ``In a country like
this if you tell them, `Go and kill your neighbor because he killed
your father and seven brothers and sister,' they'll take the
machete and do it. ... It will require a lot to make sure that
these people can come back to society and look at the future and
say, `Yes, let's try.'''
</P>
<P>
   But no government policy, no measure of either punishment or
forgiveness, could readily heal the spirit of those who witnessed
the butchery of their families. When he experienced the truth of
the Rwandan genocide, saw the stacks of bodies left in the
Nyarabuye church as a reminder, like Auschwitz, of the genocide,
Philip Gourevitch was reminded of Conrad's character Marlow at the
end of ``Heart of Darkness,'' back home in Europe being nursed by
his aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not my strength that needed nursing,'' Marlow says,
``It was my imagination that wanted soothing.''

AMAZING `ANTZ' DOESN'T BOTHER APPEALING TO KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many of the journalistic fall film previews, you could find
someone from DreamWorks saying something like this about ``Antz'':
``It's not a cute cartoon. It's an action-adventure movie.''
Translation: ``Everyone expects a cute cartoon, so we'd better do
some spin-doctoring before we take a bath at the box office.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks has reason to worry. ``Antz'' succeeds more for what
its makers want it to do than for what its audience might want it
to do. There's something admirable about that these days, when most
movies play to the lowest common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   And it still delivers, in many ways. It looks stunning. Strike
that _ it looks amazing. The all-insect cast has a level of
expressiveness that it seems to have learned from E.T., the master
at such things, and the backgrounds are so richly detailed that the
movie should win an Oscar nomination for production design, if
that's possible with an animated movie. Teens and adults will also
get off on the film's grown-up jokes and sly film references.
</P>
<P>
   What the movie has to offer younger children _ who will make up
a sizable portion of the audience _ is another matter. Expressive
as these critters are, they're not really all that cute, because
they look like ... well, ants, and sort of science-fiction ants at
that. The movie eschews original songs in favor of oldies and
standards, and except for the show-closing (and inevitable) ``High
Hopes,'' they sound like they'd appeal to Woody Allen (who voices
Z, the film's hero) more than they would to preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   There's more action than slapstick, and although the battle
scenes are almost as impressive as the ones in Disney's ``Mulan,''
there isn't enough cuteness or humor to balance them out. They're
also relatively gruesome _ with Allen in the lead role, sensitive
types might think they're watching ``Saving Private Wry Ant.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the movie's
individual-against-the-state-and-against-conformity plot. How long
has it been since you saw a family film that felt like a
collaboration between George Orwell and Ayn Rand? Not that Z is a
Randian man _ or ant _ of action. For one thing, he speaks in
Allen's neurotic New York whine; for another, the first time we
meet him, he's talking to his analyst _ a nice in-joke for all the
adults in the audience, as well as the 4-year-olds who like to
double up ``The Lion King'' with ``Annie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Z isn't a take-charge guy so much as he is a guy who lets events
sweep him along. He drones on disenchantedly about his life as a
worker, but does little to change his lot until bored Princess Bala
(Sharon Stone) goes slumming with the lower ants and hits on Z
because he's the only guy not following the crowd. Z falls for her
instantly, and his crush begins a journey that leads to him being
an inadvertent war hero and a reluctant outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Because DreamWorks honcho Jeffrey Katzenberg was able to round
up the actors who directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson wanted,
the movie feels if it were cast first, then scripted. The cast is
so star-heavy, ``Antz'' feels like the ``We Are the World'' of
animation. Not only does Allen play a lucky neurotic and Stone play
a vampish princess, but Sylvester Stallone (who nearly steals the
film) portrays a buff soldier ant (who, true to Stallone form,
takes a beating) and Gene Hackman plays a power-mad general.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Christopher Walken, as the evil sidekick who talks
... in a series of ... eccentric ... pauses, and Jennifer Lopez as
a worker ant with a great ovipositor. Only Dan Aykroyd and Jane
Curtin, as preppy bees, seem to be playing characters rather than
playing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's pro-individualism theme is a bit ironic, coming from
a company whose motto might be ``What would Disney do?'' (Come to
think of it, there's some messianic subtext going on here, too.)
Well, Disney wouldn't toy this much with a tried-and-true formula,
and you have to give DreamWorks some credit for taking risks.
Disney would have more cute characters, Disney would have more
songs, Disney would have more comic relief, Disney would cut back
on the language, some of which is surprisingly strong. Disney would
probably make more money. But Disney would also try to satisfy
everybody, and DreamWorks _ and directors Darnell and Johnson _
deserve some congratulations for not compromising their vision.

SPRUNG FROM THE MIX OF MONEY AND MADNESS

MY FIRST COUSIN ONCE REMOVED 
Money, Madness, and the Family of Robert Lowel 
By Sarah Payne Stuart 
HarperCollins, 244 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Closed societies are catnip to most of us _ locker rooms,
convents, those poky spaces off the Oval Office _ and if cold roast
Boston has any fascination for you, Sarah Payne Stuart is a
clear-eyed and totally unapologetic guide. None of this ``I'd be a
better person if I wasn't to the manner born.''
</P>
<P>
   While she came from old money on both sides of her family, she
was always a poor relation when it came to her bank account.
Crumbs, but very nice crumbs, sometimes came her way. One crumb
should have been John Singleton Copley's portrait of an
18th-century Sarah that had passed, Sarah to Sarah, for
generations. But the husband of the last Sarah in possession
thought young Sarah didn't have the proper wall to hang it on _ as
if Concord, where she lives, was beyond the pale _ and gave it to a
museum. For the greater good, he said. For his own greater glory,
she suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart doesn't resent not being rich, only wishes she hadn't
been quite so poor so long. She has many interesting things to say
about money. Without it, you can't hope to be a snob. Money can
bring happiness, but meanness about money brings only misery.
There's ``no moral basis to New England penury,'' Stuart says.
``Money spent is love bestowed.''
</P>
<P>
   But this penny-bright memoir is not just about money. There was
one dark cloud over the family: Madness to old money was true
allied. The clan's most noted madman was the poet Robert Lowell, he
of the memoir's title, ``My First Cousin Once Removed.'' (For those
of us not schooled in genealogy, the book would have benefited from
a family tree; and the tangle of names makes it easier to refer to
the author as Sarah.) Lowell's own first cousin was the author's
mother; she too went mad, becoming for a time severely depressed,
as did two of her three sons in their teenage years.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah's mother was old money on both sides. Looting British
ships had made Israel Thorndike New England's first millionaire.
The Winslows, who arrived on the Mayflower, had to play catch-up,
but when their ship came in, they could afford to be careful about
whom they would know and whom they would marry. So by habit, they
tended not to hear when Sarah's father murmured that his family
name ``would open any door in the South.'' His family was, if
anything, more snobbish than the Boston crowd, his mother referring
to ``tacky'' people as ``tacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in Boston was comfy, predictable. It did not occur to
people to be bored: Moping was discouraged and plugging along was
the best thing. ``Shy means thinking about yourself'' was the way
one family admonished sensitive children, Sarah writes. The boys
followed their fathers to Harvard and the girls went off to
boarding schools from which they didn't necessarily graduate (if
the commencement date got in the way of family plans). It only
seemed that cousins always married cousins, or that ``adventurers''
snapped up the rest. So it is not (probably) the small gene pool
that caused madness. There were lots of depressed Thorndikes, but
Sarah's mother thought her Winslows weren't crazy: ``They just have
a tremendous attraction to crazy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was craziness always caused by mothers not bringing up their
children themselves. The generations before Sarah had little
choice, tradition leaving the daily care of babies to the servants,
and most children survived, even thrived. Surely, no blame should
be attached to Sarah's mother, whose hospitalization for depression
removed her from her young children. Yet in the 1960s, when Sarah's
two brothers were themselves in and out of mental hospitals, manic
depression was not thought of as hereditary, Sarah writes. ``Every
week my parents would drive into McLean's to learn what they had
done wrong for fifty dollars an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone who claims Robert Lowell's poetry is a closed book
to her, Sarah has done a fine job searching his poems for clues.
Some of the funniest parts of this funny book concern the family's
incomprehension about ``Bobby,'' as he was called at home. He
always came back for Thanksgiving. No one liked his first wife, the
novelist Jean Stafford, who was thought to be a ``whiner.'' The
second, the critic Elizabeth Hardwick, was Southern enough to
please, and a lady. (To the complaint that Hardwick didn't
understand Boston, Sarah retorts: She did, she just didn't like
it.) As for the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, there was total
disdain. ``Why doesn't Bobby write about the sea? It's so pretty,''
said his aunt Sarah. They were great pals but, in the end, she cut
him out of her will.
</P>
<P>
   The way Lowell saw his inheritance, negative emotions were to be
conquered, not expressed. He ratted on Boston in ``Life Studies,''
and the family was generally unforgiving. Sarah's pages on ``For
the Union Dead,'' perhaps Lowell's most famous poem, are chilling
confirmation of the worst of Boston. It was Robert Gould Shaw's
abolitionist mother, not Robert, who wanted him to lead a regiment
of black soldiers in the Civil War. He did, and died, we can all
agree, for the greater good. But Lowell saw it as the zealot mother
sacrificing her son for her own ideals, the spirit that taketh
away.

   (NOTE: In this exclusive interview, former U.N. arms inspector
Scott Ritter tells Ha'aretz, the Israeli newspaper, that the U.N.
inspectors had broken Iraq's code for hiding missiles _ and then
inspections were stopped.)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scott Ritter knows Iraq pretty well by now. A veteran
arms inspector for the U.N. Special Commission charged with
tracking Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, Ritter, who
recently resigned his post, was intimately involved in the U.N.
effort to keep Saddam Hussein honest.
</P>
<P>
   Over an extended period, Ritter and other inspectors worked to
break the code Saddam was using to issue instructions involving the
movement of weapons Iraq wanted to keep hidden from inspectors.
Well into this year, the cat-and-mouse game being played in Iraq
made regular headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that the U.N. inspectors, with Israeli help,
eventually broke the Iraqi code and were on the verge of a major
breakthrough in uncovering concealed weaponry. Then this summer the
inspections were halted. That's when Ritter quit his job _ out of
pure frustration, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In this conversation with David Makovsky, correspondent for
Ha'aretz, Ritter reveals how weapons were being moved around in
Iraq and what role Israel played in helping the inspections team.
He also reveals his own personal disillusionment with the United
States for what he characterizes as its lack of support for the
inspections program.

<P>
   DAVID MAKOVSKY: How did Iraq conceal weapons from UNSCOM?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER: In April 1991, Saddam Hussein issued a
presidential directive ordering that Iraq lie to the Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency), (and that Iraq) would keep (its mass destruction)
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials that were kept were turned over under
instruction of the president to the Special Security Organization
(SSO) and Special Republican Guard (SRG). These are presidential
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is this special organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSO is one of the most secretive organizations in Iraq.
It probably numbers around 5,000 people. The SRG is the military
arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the frustration. It was not a single source of
information. We used everything that we had available to us. And
that's why what happened in July and August (when the U.S. halted
inspections) was so frustrating. Because now that we have
identified how they're doing it, and now that we get the kind of
information we need on the timely basis we need, we're inside their
decision-making cycle. We're reacting before Iraq can react.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You really could get the information before they move the
shell?
</P>
<P>
   A: Before they move the shell. And I got stuck. That's why I was
so mad. Because I finally came up with the solution. I broke the
code. We untied the Gordian knot. We figured it out. We had the
problem solved and now we just need to go do the job. It took us
three years, but we solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. didn't let us. Not only didn't they let us, they
won't let us _ because to go do it ratchets it up to the ultimate
level of confrontation. Because there's no way Iraq will allow us
to inspect the people who need to be inspected. We're talking about
the people closest to Saddam Hussein. We're talking about the
security forces, the personal security forces of Saddam; we're
talking about the family of Saddam. These are the people doing
concealment.
</P>
<P>
   It basically works like a mafia organization. When you organize
crime (or set up a) terrorist organization, you have cells. And in
order to become a cell leader, you have to be trusted by the
family, so you have to be very close to the family. So the people
being selected are direct blood relatives of Saddam. There are
primarily Tikritis (people from Saddam's hometown) or there are
alliances of marriage to other tribes, like the Alduries.
</P>
<P>
   People of this nature are also close to Saddam. Abed is the one
who says I can trust this man or I can't. Abott does the
interviews. That's all compartmentalized. (Even) if you get one
cell, you don't what the other guy is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the Special
Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These elite
organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam. Now they
don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you need a
truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and vehicle
resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to that
Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do something
for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you say how many times you were in Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was there a lot. From 1994 until 1998 I was there a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you comment on the FBI investigation into your links with
Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the most outrageous that I ever encountered with the
U.S. government. I was sent to the Special Commission by the U.S.
government to work for the executive chairman. Those are my orders.
So I did that. I was told that strength of the Special Commission
would be in its independence, that the Special Commission could not
be seen as a tool of any country and that I have to help make the
Special Commission independent. I did that. I succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, we needed some new methodologies that we weren't
getting from the United States, so we went to Israel. I went to the
executive chairman (Ekeus) and we raised the issue of approaching
Israel, and he approved.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that as an American citizen, I went to the U.S.
government and told them that I was doing this and they didn't stop
me. When the relationship really began in earnest starting in July
of '95, everything I did in Israel was approved by the executive
chairman. Everything we did was consistent with the mandate given
by the Security Council. And everything I did was made known to and
approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every step of the way?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every step of the way. Now they didn't agree with a lot of
what I did. They didn't agree at all. They didn't like the idea of
UNSCOM becoming this independent, nor UNSCOM having a capable
partner like Israel supporting us. They weren't happy with this at
all. They tried to stop it every step of the way. But I kept them
informed. I had their approval and everything was approved by the
executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it the CIA that instigated the FBI investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bottom line is that it was the CIA that raised the
concerns. They said that the relationship that Israel and Ritter
had could be an espionage relationship. Even though they knew all
the facts and they approved everything. They turned it over to the
FBI and the FBI ran with it and then it became sort of a
self-continuing effort. Every time I went to Israel, the pile got
thicker. Every time I did my job, the FBI just collected more data,
saying its espionage. It was terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the FBI investigation become known to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I knew in January, February 1997 that the U.S. had a concern
about the nature of the work and I worked very closely with the
government to try and talk about what their concern was. And it
came down to basically bureaucratic jealousy. You know, I have a
better relationship with the Israelis than they do. They are not in
control. They lost control.
</P>
<P>
   I'm an American. Israel can't have an intelligence relationship
with an American that is not controlled by the U.S. These are their
concerns. I said basically if that's it, then tough luck. Because,
you sent me here to work. You told me to be independent. I'm doing
what you told me to do, and I'm succeeding. So unless you give me a
direct order to stop, and always I'm an American, you give me a
direct order, you say stop, I will stop today. You ask me a
question, I will answer it. I'm not hiding anything from them. But
they never said stop.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you say about the Israeli officials you met?
</P>
<P>
   A: First is the professionalism. The people I dealt with were
dedicated, professional, smart. When you go down to Washington you
are overwhelmed with the 9 to 5 mentality. There wasn't this 9 to 5
mentality. This was national security. Plus they think out of the
box.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does that mean 'to think out of the box?'
</P>
<P>
   A: In America, you have rules. We're going to address this
problem. Let's read the rules here. They say we can think this, we
cannot do this. That's how we are going to solve this. That's how
we're going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are: `What's another way of looking at this? How
else can we do this? Let's think of alternatives here. Is there
another way we can solve this problem?' The Israelis were
innovative and courageous in terms of putting forward ideas. They
were not afraid to have an idea shot down. Again, professional. A
level of trust developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis looked at me and didn't see a United Nations
official, or an American. It's all professional. It's somebody whom
they can respect, whom can they can work with. That's what
impressed me about them. And the fact that they were always
sympathetic with the cause.
</P>
<P>
   I never once felt when I was over there that I was somehow
imposing on them or somehow inconveniencing them. When I was over
there, we were a team. We were all going for the same cause. We
were working really hard. They are good people.

And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you say how many times you were in Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was there a lot. From 1994 until 1998 I was there a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you comment on the FBI investigation into your links with
Israel?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the most outrageous that I ever encountered with the
U.S. government. I was sent to the Special Commission by the U.S.
government to work for the executive chairman. Those are my orders.
So I did that. I was told that strength of the Special Commission
would be in its independence, that the Special Commission could not
be seen as a tool of any country and that I have to help make the
Special Commission independent. I did that. I succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, we needed some new methodologies that we weren't
getting from the United States, so we went to Israel. I went to the
executive chairman (Ekeus) and we raised the issue of approaching
Israel, and he approved.
</P>
<P>
   I have to say that as an American citizen, I went to the U.S.
government and told them that I was doing this and they didn't stop
me. When the relationship really began in earnest starting in July
of '95, everything I did in Israel was approved by the executive
chairman. Everything we did was consistent with the mandate given
by the Security Council. And everything I did was made known to and
approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every step of the way?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every step of the way. Now they didn't agree with a lot of
what I did. They didn't agree at all. They didn't like the idea of
UNSCOM becoming this independent, nor UNSCOM having a capable
partner like Israel supporting us. They weren't happy with this at
all. They tried to stop it every step of the way. But I kept them
informed. I had their approval and everything was approved by the
executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it the CIA that instigated the FBI investigation?
</P>
<P>
   A: The bottom line is that it was the CIA that raised the
concerns. They said that the relationship that Israel and Ritter
had could be an espionage relationship. Even though they knew all
the facts and they approved everything. They turned it over to the
FBI and the FBI ran with it and then it became sort of a
self-continuing effort. Every time I went to Israel, the pile got
thicker. Every time I did my job, the FBI just collected more data,
saying its espionage. It was terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When did the FBI investigation become known to you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I knew in January, February 1997 that the U.S. had a concern
about the nature of the work and I worked very closely with the
government to try and talk about what their concern was. And it
came down to basically bureaucratic jealousy. You know, I have a
better relationship with the Israelis than they do. They are not in
control. They lost control.
</P>
<P>
   I'm an American. Israel can't have an intelligence relationship
with an American that is not controlled by the U.S. These are their
concerns. I said basically if that's it, then tough luck. Because,
you sent me here to work. You told me to be independent. I'm doing
what you told me to do, and I'm succeeding. So unless you give me a
direct order to stop, and always I'm an American, you give me a
direct order, you say stop, I will stop today. You ask me a
question, I will answer it. I'm not hiding anything from them. But
they never said stop.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you say about the Israeli officials you met?
</P>
<P>
   A: First is the professionalism. The people I dealt with were
dedicated, professional, smart. When you go down to Washington you
are overwhelmed with the 9 to 5 mentality. There wasn't this 9 to 5
mentality. This was national security. Plus they think out of the
box.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does that mean 'to think out of the box?'
</P>
<P>
   A: In America, you have rules. We're going to address this
problem. Let's read the rules here. They say we can think this, we
cannot do this. That's how we are going to solve this. That's how
we're going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are: `What's another way of looking at this? How
else can we do this? Let's think of alternatives here. Is there
another way we can solve this problem?' The Israelis were
innovative and courageous in terms of putting forward ideas. They
were not afraid to have an idea shot down. Again, professional. A
level of trust developed.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis looked at me and didn't see a United Nations
official, or an American. It's all professional. It's somebody whom
they can respect, whom can they can work with. That's what
impressed me about them. And the fact that they were always
sympathetic with the cause.
</P>
<P>
   I never once felt when I was over there that I was somehow
imposing on them or somehow inconveniencing them. When I was over
there, we were a team. We were all going for the same cause. We
were working really hard. They are good people.

   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Lost in Space''  &LR; _ The feature-length rehash of
the '60s TV show is little more than a rip-off of ``Swiss Family
Robinson'' in spacesuits. Nothing new here.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A Perfect Murder''  &LR; _ The retelling of Alfred Hitchcock's
``Dial M for Murder'' isn't bad for a while, but the filmmakers
miss a crucial plot point involving a key. The original Ray
Milland-Grace Kelly thriller, in spite of its obvious bow to 3-D
technology, was directed by the unquestioned master of the form. If
you don't believe me, rent both. It makes for an enlightening
double feature.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Mrs. Dalloway'' &LR;  _ Vanessa Redgrave, without doubt one of the
finest actresses of her generation, tries desperately to breathe
life into this moribund costume drama about an older woman reunited
with a lover she left decades earlier.

   The Artists Rights Foundation has filed a protest against a Utah
home-video retailer for excising the brief nude scene between
Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in the megahit, ``Titanic,''
according to the latest issue of Video Store magazine. Don
Biesinger of Sunrise Family Video in American Fork, Utah, has been
editing the scene ``for customers looking for a G-rated version of
the movie.'' He charges $5 more for the edited edition.

   ``Art is what it is,'' Foundation director Kathy Garmezy wrote.
``For better or worse. And a decent respect for the talent of

WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE PARIS ON VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Three Tenors did it again Aug. 18. If you escaped them on
PBS, you can watch Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, and Luciano
Pavarotti gather in front of the Eiffel Tower on home video any
time you want, or listen to some of the highlights and lowpoints of
the concert on an Atlantic Warner CD.
</P>
<P>
   The first Three Tenors concert at the Baths of Caracalla in Rome
in 1990 became the best-selling classical recording in history _ or
to use a language more appropriate to a marketing phenomenon, the
10 million-and-more copies the performance sold on CD and video set
the record ``of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The tenors had sung the concert for charity, Carreras's leukemia
foundation; in Rome there was was an audience of 8,000. Each of the
tenors accepted a ``token payment'' reported at $300,000 for the
recording. Fortunes were therefore made by others and not by the
singers, a mistake they were careful not to repeat in the second
concert in Los Angeles in 1994, when it was widely believed that
each of them was paid $1 million upfront.
</P>
<P>
   That event was watched on television by 1.3 billion people, and
a world tour followed; there were
</P>
<P>
   Three Tenors concerts in Tokyo, London, Vienna, Munich,
Goteborg, Dueseldorf, Vancouver, Toronto, Melbourne, Modena, Osaka,
Madrid, Mexico City, and East Rutherford. Zubin Mehta conducted the
first two concerts, James Levine all the others except Melbourne
(he couldn't fly because of a sinus infection. Nothing else stopped
him, even a prior commitment to conduct the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, which he canceled). Financial figures are hard to come
by, but Robert C. Marsh's new book about Levine, ``Dialogues and
Discoveries,'' quotes a New York Times estimate that the tenors
collectively earned $40 million in 1996. Their manager went on the
defensive; according to Marsh, he said, ``If Janet Jackson can sign
a deal for $80 million, the Three Tenors are totally, totally
underpaid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paris concert, ``a gift to the city,'' according to producer
Tibor Rudas, was heralded in superlatives. ``240 strings will be
plucked during the show,'' proclaimed the official press kit _ they
must have forgotten to count the harp. This was the third Three
Tenors event presented in connection with the World Cup finals
(``Jose Carreras supports Barcelona, Placido Domingo supports Real
Madrid, and Luciano Pavarotti supprts Juventus,'' says the press
kit). ``Hundreds of thousands'' of people crowded the Champ de
Mars, and the broadcast audience was estimated by the recording
company at 1 billion and by the CD booklet at twice that. A Web
site was established at www.3tenors98.com (although it wasn't
functioning last week).
</P>
<P>
   Paris was the first concert since Los Angeles to feature a
significant amount of fresh repertory. No one dreamed of tampering
with the successful basic formula _ each tenor sang two arias and
two lighter selections; the three joined up for a medley in each
half. Some pieces switched ownership; Carreras passed ``Granada''
to Pavarotti, and Domingo gave an aria from Verdi's ``Luisa
Miller'' to Pavarotti, who had the pleasure of singing his rival's
name in the opening line, ``Quando le sere al placido.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti tried on Andrea Bocelli's hit ``Caruso'' for size.
Domingo offered ``Memoires de Danton,'' a power ballad by his son,
Placido Domingo Jr. Carreras showed wisdom in not trying to compete
with his younger self, or with the memory of other celebrated
recorded voices, by choosing two arias even the most dedicated
operagoers are unlikely to know, ```Io conosco un giardino'' from
``Maristella'' by Giuseppe Pietri, a composer unfamiliar even to
the authors of reference books, and ``Intenditi con Dio'' from
``Fosca'' by Carlos Gomes.
</P>
<P>
   Solos in the more popular vein included a song by Grieg composed
in Danish as ``Jeg elsker dig,'' known in English as ``I Love
You,'' and sung by Carreras as ``T'estimo,'' ``Granada,'' and the
Neapolitan song ``Voce 'e Notte (Carreras). Domingo won what must
have been a contest to sing ``Amor ti vieta'' from Giordano's
``Fedora'' _ this aria, like ``O mio babbino caro'' fiercely fought
over by fading sopranos on gala occasions, sounds higher and harder
than it is. Pavarotti pulled himself together for another ``Nessun
dorma''; Levine looked happy and relieved, perhaps because Aretha
Franklin was nowhere in view, or earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Lalo Schifrin, medley-maker to the stars, stitched up two new
ones, a ``Medley of Romance'' (leading off with ``Sous le ciel de
Paris!'' _ and an unacknowledged bit of Bizet) and a ``Medley of
the World'' (which included the World Cup theme song, ``You'll
Never Walk Alone''). Schifrin's occasional attempt to stack up the
tenors together singing harmony was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The Orchestre de Paris offered Berlioz's ``Roman Carnival''
Overture and the ``Bacchanale'' from Saint-Saens's ``Samson et
Dalila,'' if anybody cared _ neither one appears on the CD, which
is also missing what struck this listener as the vocal highpoint of
the evening, Domingo's fervent performance of ``Rachel, quand du
Seigneur,'' from Halevy's ``La Juive.'' (The CD was compiled by
omitting one aria from each of the singers, so Carerras lost
``Fosca,'' and Pavarotti the ``Luisa Miller'' piece.) For the
purposes of the CD, encores like ``Because'' and ``O sole mio''
precede the ``Medley of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The video version promises interview and backstage material not
available to the worldwide television audience; presumably it
avoids the staggeringly inane PBS commentary that has become a
traditional part of the fun, like the interview segment of the Miss
America competition. Some of the raw material from the original TV
broadcast must have presented the editors with problems. The
Parisian setting is beautiful, and TV dramatized it impressively
with heliocopter shots, but the camera positions for the concert
were not advantageous; microphones blocked not only unflattering
views of the tenors' chins, but also most of their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Three Tenors concerts are not musical events in an ordinary
sense, and the artistic standards that each of the singers and the
conductor have brought to their other endeavors are more or less
irrelevant to this context. Still, it is saddening to see how
willing they have become to slip below those standards.
</P>
<P>
   This has nothing to do with the fact that all three of them are
headed at various rates of speed down the other side of the hill.
Pavarotti was 62 in July and closing in on his announced retirement
date in 2001. Nevertheless when he gets himself organized, he can
still outsing just about anyone but the ghost of Pava-rotti past.
It isn't easy for him, though, and that makes it hard going for
anyone who loved him in his prodigal prime: Today he makes you
worry on his behalf instead of suffusing you with sunshine. He was
probably the most gifted of the three, and he still sings the top
line.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo, officially 57, also has to work awfully hard these
days, but pumping iron this way is preferable to the way he
sometimes coasted through his vocal prime; he remains the most
serious and versatile artist of the three.
</P>
<P>
   Carreras, only 51, is another story. One admires the courage and
the sweetness of the man, but his voice was in trouble even before
his heroic battle against leukemia; today his willingness to
struggle against the odds compels admiration, and so does his sheer
will to perform, but his voice is shot.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't the vocal condition of the singers _ the
public could not care less _ but that they don't take the arias
seriously enough, and they take the pop music too seriously.
Operatic music is ripped from context and delivered through the
mikes like a rock anthem. The popular music is often unconvincing
in delivery, unidiomatic in rhythm, phrasing, and style _ this
isn't crossover at all, because they sing pop songs like rock
anthems too. Nothing is relaxed, nothing swings, nothing suggests
intimacy or genuine feeling, and everything comes out sounding the
same.
</P>
<P>
   After the New York concert it seemed that the tenors were not
demeaning themselves by singing popular music but demeaning popular
music by not treating it with respect and singing it well. Reading
off telepromters makes a poor substitute for real identification
with the material _ for this amount of money, the Three Tenors
ought to be better prepared. The first concert in Rome had the
virtue of apparent spontaneity; everyone in the Paris concert seems
grimly determined to have a good time, and therefore curiously
joyless.
</P>
<P>
   As the concert progress, it is wonderful to watch the shadows
gather around the Eiffel Tower, and then watch the lights banish
the shadow. Sadly, nothing is going to banish the shadows that are
gathering around the Three Tenors.

INSURANCE PROBE ALLEGES FRAUD BY RUSSIAN EMIGRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A well-known auto insurance fraud scheme that involves billing
insurers for accidents that never happened or were staged has
apparently been adopted by cadres of Russian emigres across the
nation, including a group that allegedly used a Framingham, Mass.
apartment as its fake address.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed by Trust Insurance Co. of Taunton, Mass., 11
Russian natives and a Brookline, Mass. insurance agent are accused
of participating in a conspiracy that allegedly resulted in the
submitting of more than $150,000 in questionable claims during the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The claims ranged from non-existent auto damage to unnecessary
medical treatment and equipment, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts case, insurance adjusters and official
investigators contend, mirrors a trend they have found on the rise
nationally: Rings of Russian associates submitting reams of
insurance claims for treatment of strains and sprains from minor or
phony auto accidents. Investigators say that if a collision did
occur, there were often no independent witnesses, leading insurers
to believe the accident was staged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding that the Russians have become particularly
aggressive in participating in fraudulent insurance schemes of one
sort or another,'' said Michael Diegel of the Coalition Against
Insurance Fraud, a Washingto lobbying and public information
organization composed of insurers and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   Filing of fraudulent or exaggerated claims and seeking
settlements from fake or staged autombile accidents is a
longstanding tradition encountered by the US insurance industry,
according to analysts, and Russians are certainly not the first to
take advantage of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say insurance companies also share a significant level
of blame for allowing fraud, which by national estimates makes up
11 percent of insurance claims, to permeate the system. Inundated
by claims, insurers have long been willing to get rid of cases by
settling them for reduced amounts, instead of going through the
long, arduous process of investigating them thoroughly and
contesting them through the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a built-in acceptance of fraud throughout the whole
industry and those willing to participate in the fraud _ lawyers,
physical therapists, and chiropractors _ know it and take advantage
of it,'' said one Massachusetts prosecutor, who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Loren Naiman, &UR;  &LR; head of the Los Angeles County district
attorney's auto insurance fraud division, said that his office has
cracked several rings dominated by Russian emigres, each involving
millions of dollars in phony claims.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing other investigators, Naiman said the emigre groups do
not appear to operate under a single boss. Instead, he said, they
are loose confederations of emigres from the same part of Russia
who are bound by language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian presence in the insurance fraud racket was initially
identified in the mid-1980s, when two brothers, emigres who had
become successful businessmen in Los Angeles, were indicted for
participating in a scheme that defrauded health insurance companies
of an estimated $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, who are now serving long prison terms, lured
patients into a vast network of clinics dotting Southern
California, putting them through high-tech tests they did not need
but charging insurance companies an average of $8,000 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers' attention to the problem of fraud by Russian-dominated
rings is reflected in recent articles by two insurance
publications. ``Russian Insurance Fraud Growing'' was the headline
last Monday in the trade publication National Underwriter following
a conference of insurance investigators. And an article in last
month's Claims magazine quoted insurance investigators as saying
that Russians have joined Nigerians, Vietnamese, and Hispanics in
operating fraud rings.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors and investigators in Massachusetts have not
charged any Russian emigres with involvement in such rings, they
said they have heard complaints from insurance companies recently
of an influx of suspicious billings from automobile accidents. They
include billings for stolen cars that were never recovered, and
thousands of dollars worth of treatment by physical therapists and
chiropractors, often themselves of Russian descent, for treatment
of strains and sprains.
</P>
<P>
   According to one official, the state is investigating the
activities of two Russian-born medical professionals who insurers
contend have submitted bills on dozens of suspicious claims.
</P>
<P>
   Local groups who provide support to the 40,000 Russians who have
immigrated in the past decade and are living in Greater Boston
contend that few if any of them are participating in fraudulent
activities. ``The people that I see day in and day out are
hard-working and responsible, and would never get involved in such
craziness,'' said Serge Bologov, &UR;  &LR; executive director of the Russian
Community Association of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   While stressing that only a handful get involved in such
criminal acts, Steve Yanofsky of Boston, who tutors Russian emigres
in health care administration, said that most members of the
community quickly realize they can pocket $7,000 to $10,000 easily
by filing questionable claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawyers and (physical) therapists advertise in their
papers and on television. People are not stupid. They know there
are professionals who will take advantage of the situation,'' said
Yanofsky, who immigrated from Russia in 1989. In addition, Russian
emigres, he reasoned, might be more inclined to participate in such
fraud since they grew up in the Soviet Union where ripping off the
system was not viewed in entirely negative terms.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit filed last month by Trust Insurance Co., a modest
two-bedroom apartment in a Framingham housing complex is described
as ``Ground Zero'' in the alleged scheme, which involved 11 Russian
immigrants and the Gene Dvorkin Insurance Agency of Brookline.
According to the suit filed in Bristol Superior Court, the
apartment is occupied by a 24-year-old woman and her mother, who
are not defendants in the suit. Only one of the 11 individuals
charged in the suit ever lived in the apartment for any length of
time. The other 10 all resided in Brooklyn or New York City when
the policies were written in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, soon after securing the policies many of
the individuals filed claims with Trust Insurance, reporting that
they had been involved in minor traffic accidents and seeking
payment for the damage to their cars as well as for their medical
bills. After paying about $100,000 of the bills, Trust commenced an
investigation and found that all but one of the accidents had taken
place in and around Brooklyn and that many of the bills that were
paid, as well as $100,000 in medical bills that were not, involved
questionable treatment.

   Dvorkin, a well-established insurance agent for the local
Russian community, denied that he had wilfully engaged in any fraud
or conspiracy with the 11 emigres. While acknowledging that the
policies may have been improperly issued by his agency because of
the fake addresses, he said he should not be blamed because the
alleged conspirators could have hidden their tracks by going
through any of the several individuals in his office able to write
insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have been victims here ourselves,'' Dvorkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said that Trust Insurance may have included him in the
lawsuit to get rid of him as an agent since his policies annually
wind up costing two or three times more in claims than they bring
in in premiums. Also, he said he has been leading a legal fight
against Trust Insurance for denying automatic safe-driving premium
reductions to recent immigrants, including Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Trust said its lawsuit grew solely out of its continued efforts
to ``vigorously'' fight fraudulent claims. ``Aggressive antifraud
actions ultimately benefit Trust, the entire insurance industry,
and, bottom line, the Massachusetts consumer,'' said Trust vice
senior president Paul F. Amoruso.

THE AGE, AND STATE, OF THE UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How old is the universe, and will it continue to expand or
eventually contract back in, like a bungee cord?
</P>
<P>
   A.M.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Give or take a few minutes, the universe is about 10 billion
years old, or 14 billion, or 18 billion, depending on who you talk
to. Harvard astrophysicist Robert Kirshner says we can calculate
its age by looking at bright objects in space, including galaxies
and supernovae.
</P>
<P>
   If we can figure out how far away they are, and how fast they're
moving, we can figure out how long they took to get to where they
are, when they started their journey, and how long things have been
travelling since the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   But we can't tell precisely how far away things are, because
we're not sure just how bright they're supposed to be. Kenneth
Brecher, professor of physics and astronomy at Boston University,
explains: ``If we know, for example, that a 100-watt light bulb
gives off a precise amount of light right at the bulb, we can tell
how far away from it we are by measuring how much light has been
lost by the time it hits us. But we don't know precisely how bright
galaxies and supernovae are supposed to be.'' As to whether
everything will keep spreading apart, many scientists think it
will. But some disagree. ``The data for the last 100 years suggest
a &UR;  &LR; (a universe) that will keep expanding,'' Brecher says, but some
think it will ultimately contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirshner &UR;  &LR; also believes that expansion will probably continue
indefinitely. To illustrate how the space between objects in space
is growing, he uses the analogy of a playground jungle gym:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as though everything is moving out from a single spot
in the center. Imagine a big jungle gym made of living, growing
bamboo. The space between every crossbar is getting bigger. Each
one is moving away from all the rest. If there were kids on it,
every kid would be getting farther away from all their neighbors.
That's what's happening to the galaxies.''

ROAD TO RETREMENT LOOKING GOLDEN, SO SPLURGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 42 years old and my wife is 38. We have been employed by
a large company for over 15 years, both love our jobs, and have no
interest in a change. We also believe in saving and keeping our
debt to a minimum. Over the years we have, to our surprise, by just
dragging along amassed a 401(k) account of over $500,000, and a
similar amount in stocks and mutual funds. Our cars are late-model
and we paid cash for them. We are living in what we consider ``our
last house'' and have a reasonable mortgage. Okay, so far, so good.
Our dilemma is this: When should we spend on personal luxury items?
We have been pretty good savers, and it pains us to part with any
of the stash we have built up. The treat in question is a $35,000
car that would be our third. In some aspects, we feel we deserve
it, but on the other hand it goes against our philosophy of having
what we need rather than what we want. The ball's in your court...
Should I take the $35,000 from my stockbroker and clean out the
garage, or should I wait until I'm 65 and have the treat then? Yes,
a great problem to have.
</P>
<P>
   S.L., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, let's start here: If you were to make no more
contributions to your 401(k) account or other investments, it would
grow to $8,954,302 by the time you're 65; if you were to withdraw
$35,000 and follow the same arithmetic, the number would be
$8,640,901.
</P>
<P>
   (These calculations presume average 10 percent annual returns on
your portfolio, and presume you use other funds to handle taxes
from taxable accounts.) I am not, of course, advocating that you
stop your admirable approach to savings, but simply pointing out
that you have a huge head start against retirement and can
certainly afford to give yourself a treat.
</P>
<P>
   I vote for buying the car, with one caveat. That is that you
treat this as a one-time aberration _ the only invasion of your
retirement savings which you will allow. That's not to say you
should avoid further luxuries until retirement, but that after
this, try to finance them through your current cash flows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 25 years old. I currently have some ``emergency''
savings, but have not begun investing for retirement. I'd like to
start now and take advantage of the many years I have before
retiring. I have been thinking about opening a Roth IRA, since I am
currently in the lowest tax bracket and might as well pay the taxes
now. I have $1,000 to begin with, an will be able to contribute
only $100 a month until I climb the ladder and get a higher- paying
job. Since this is not much money to invest, I'm looking at being
able to get into only one fund, which isn't a very diverse
portfolio. Any suggestions for someone just starting out?
</P>
<P>
   K.M., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The principal advice I have for a person your age is exactly
what you plan to do _ start out. Time is the most critical factor
in building a portfolio, and the earlier you get started, the less
difficult the task will be later on. If you simply look at a growth
projection of that $1,000 over the time until you reach 65, you'll
see what I mean. If we presume 10 percent average annual portfolio
growth, by the time you're 65, that $1,000 will have become
$28,102, and in the final year of the period, the internal growth
will be more than $2,550.
</P>
<P>
   As for the effect of additional contributions, if you simply
stuck with $100 monthly contributions, the portfolio projection
shows $368,272; if you were able to put in the maximum allowed,
which works out to $166 a month, the total would be $595,029.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you an example of how important it is to start out
early.
</P>
<P>
   Let's compare the building of that theoretical $595,029 nestegg
to the chore that would face a person who didn't start thinking
about retirement until age 40. With only 25 years to go until the
typical retirement age, that person would have to contribute $482 a
month to end up with the same sum.
</P>
<P>
   As for diversification, I think a lot of people worry too much
about it. Yes, when you've built a sizable portfolio, it's nice to
spread your money out among five or six funds which operate in
difference market sectors and have different objectives. But,
especially when you're starting out, it's also important to
remember that most mutual funds are diversified by nature, holding
portfolios that include hundreds of different securities. So
instead of worrying about diversification I suggest you just stick
to a single fund for the first five years or so. What you'll want
to begin with is a fund which will serve as your core holding once
the portfolio takes shape. Most people pick a good fund in what
used to be called the growth and income category, now usually
identified as a large-cap fund with a portfolio that represents a
blend of growth and value stocks. There are literally hundreds of
such funds to chose among. I think a good start is with a fund
which simply seeks to duplicate the results of the Standard and
Poor's 500 Index, which contains the nation's 500 largest
companies, weighted according to market capitalization. That last
means that you will hold a vastly greater position in the number
one issue, now Microsoft Corp., than in the stocks in the high 400s
of the index. Managing such a fund is more a science than an art,
so you can simply look for funds with the lowest expenses. Two
excellent funds in this category are Vanguard Index 500 and
Fidelity Spartan Market Index, and since they have identical
expense ratios, the choice could as wisely be made with a dart
board as any other method.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm a single 39-year-old who was down-sized back in 1995 from
a relatively low-paying clerical job where I made $30,000 a year.
For three years I worked as a temp in a variety of low-paying,
short-term jobs. Now I seem to be benefiting from the economic
recovery and have a full-time job with benefits, although I'm only
making $24,000 a year. My problem is what to do with a small amount
_ $2,000 _ that I have saved in my 401(k). For 2 1/2 years, my
former employer managed the account and the money was primarily
invested in mutual funds. However, they requested that I move it to
another institution. I am not able to roll it over into the plan of
my new employer for another 11 months, so I have rolled it over
into an account at my bank, where the service fees are almost more
than the paltry amount of interest it earns. Do you have any advice
about where I could roll this over for the next 11 months, obtain
reasonable returns, and not be eaten alive by service fees?
</P>
<P>
   J.M., Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm with you all the way _ and further. I'd not only move the
rollover IRA to a mutual fund company, but I'd also sever any other
relations _ checking account, savings accounts, safe deposit box,
and whatever else _ that you may have with the bank in question.
Any institution which levies service fees which approach the return
on a $2,000 IRA simply isn't worth your custom.
</P>
<P>
   There are many no load mutual fund companies which levy only
minimal fees _ typically about $10 a year _ to maintain an IRA
account. So even if you put the account in a money market account,
about 90 percent of its earnings would remain in the account.
</P>
<P>
   (But note that the IRA regulations allow you to pay the account
maintenance fees out of your own pocket, and it will not be
considered a contribution to an IRA; people whose goal to reach the
absolute maximum in allowed IRA contributions always pay these
charges rather than allowing the fee to be deducted from the IRA
balance.) There's one important thing to note here. You will be
allowed to roll this IRA account over into your new employer's
401(k) plan only if it was designated as a rollover IRA when you
moved it to the bank, and only if you have made no contributions to
it since you left your former employer. If you decide that you want
to save for retirement this year through IRA savings (thus
maintaining retirement savings even while waiting through the
months before you're eligible for the new 401(k) program, make sure
you do so with a separate IRA account, and that the new funds are
not mingled with the rollover IRA money.

HULKING MOTOR HOMES RAISE SAFETY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAY JOCHNOWITZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ William and Mary Alice Peak sank their life
savings into a $100,000 motor home with a dream of spending summers
at their lakeside camp in New York state, and winters driving
across the South.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Peaks, that dream became a white-knuckle nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Their motor home was an overweight behemoth, so overloaded that
its tires blew, its brakes burned, and its transmission smoked.
Fearful of losing control of the nearly 10-ton coach, Peak took the
overdrive switch off the dashboard and moved it to the steering
column so that he could keep both hands on the wheel as much as
possible. Mary Alice would follow in the car with their luggage to
keep the weight in the RV down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our second home,'' said Peak, 68, who says he doesn't
drive the vehicle anymore and can't sell it. ``There's no one in
the world that would buy it. I certainly wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   As snowbirds head south for the winter, America's highways are
loaded with these overweight _ and largely unregulated _ houses on
wheels. Some could be dangerous: too heavy for the chassis, axles
and tires on which they are riding, making them hard to steer and
prone to blowouts and mechanical failures, according to a report by
John Anderson, a disgruntled RV owner who has made a business of
traveling the country weighing RVs and holding seminars on weight
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee man weighed more than 6,000 RVs from 1993 to 1997,
and found that 64 percent were over their weight limits. Among the
large motor homes, 69 percent were overweight. Why? In some cases,
manufacturers overload the vehicles with options, in others, it's
the fault of buyers who add their own belongings, from rock
collections to pianos.
</P>
<P>
   While fatalities in RV accidents are low _ 216 people died in RV
crashes in 1997, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration _ the leading cause of crashes appears to be drivers
losing control of the vehicle, according to Dana Hogan, a spokesman
for State Farm Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   No special license is needed to operate most motor homes because
they fall under the 26,000-pound limit for a commercial driver's
license.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives don't dispute Anderson's figures nor
disagree that there is a weight problem, but they blame consumers
for overloading the vehicles with options and personal items. The
average couple, Anderson said, takes a ton of personal belongings
on board, while people using their RVs full-time store an average
3,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can overload a car, you can overload a pickup,'' said Phil
Ingrassia, a spokesman for the Recreational Vehicle Rental
Association, a trade group for firms that rent RVs.
</P>
<P>
   But experts also point to some manufacturers, who are feeding
consumers' insatiable appetite for fancy options. The trend with
motor homes is big and bigger, noted Jerry Mittman, sales manager
for RV and special vehicles for Ford Motor Corp. in Detroit. The
standard motor home width has gone from 96 inches to 102 inches,
and in recent years, more motor homes are featuring ``slideouts'' _
compartments that extend the floor space to as much as 12 feet that
can also add a half-ton to the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   And consumers are demanding more amenities, like hardwood
cabinets, stone countertops and ceramic floor tiles. The
manufacturers are installing these accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson got into the weight issue after he had problems with
his own 5th-wheeler _ an RV pulled by a pickup truck _ which had a
weight limit of 14,000 pounds. After 11 tire failures and $10,000
in improvements, he weighed it and found it was built 840 pounds
over weight.
</P>
<P>
   In Peak's case, the 37-foot Newmar Kountry Aire he bought from
Northway Travel Trailers in 1991 was just 50 pounds below its
weight limit with full water and propane tanks and a nearly full
tank of gas, according to an engineer's report commissioned by
Peak. That was before the driver even got in.
</P>
<P>
   Peak first took his complaint to an arbitrator, who in 1993
ruled that the manufacturer, the Newmar Corp., wasn't to blame. The
arbitrator, Paul Macey, said it was Peak's fault for choosing the
options that he did. But Peak said all he did was choose items from
the Newmar's standard list _ extras like the slideout and oak
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a New York Supreme Court jury agreed with Peak that
the vehicle was unusable. A trial is set for November to decide
actual damages, though the RV itself caught fire while parked in
Peak's driveway last month.
</P>
<P>
   Northway Travel Trailers owner Paul Parker declined comment on
the case. He bought the business after Peak made his purchase
there. Attorney David Pentkowski, representing the corporation that
owned the business when Peak bought his vehicle, did not return
calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Newmar, the manufacturer, won't discuss Peak's case, but will
say it disagrees with the weight Peak and a Connecticut testing
firm claimed on the vehicle. In a 1994 letter to the state attorney
general, the firm also asserted that even though the vehicle is
officially rated for 19,500 pounds, the limit is understated and
the RV could carry 20,000 to 23,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is so far no federal move to regulate the industry. Tim
Hurd, a spokesman for the federal safety agency, said there is no
clear evidence that RVs are defective on a wide scale, and the
government for now isleaving it to the industry to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has responded somewhat: the Recreational Vehicle
Industry Association, a trade group, came out in September 1996
with a recommendation that manufacturers post a more detailed
weight label on each vehicle. Adopted by most major RV
manufacturers, according to RVIA spokesman Alan Piercy, the label
shows the vehicle's net carrying capacity, how much water it can
carry and what it would weigh with the water tank full.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's weighing program suggests there has been a change,
too: While 78 percent of the 1993 models he weighed were
overweight, the figure dropped to 56 percent in 1997. Anderson
isn't sure of the cause, but he does credit the industry with
trying to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of models that pre-date the industry's 1996
labeling program _ an unknown number of overweight RVs that will
likely be on the road for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor, which builds chassis and sells them to RV
manufacturers, said the RV builders are becoming more careful about
using strong enough chassis to support the increased weight of the
vehicles. Ford now requires motor home manufacturers to undergo a
special training program before modifying the company's chassis,
and this year came out with a new line of stronger products.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Mittman said, some manufacturers tended to hold
their costs down by buying lighter, less expensive chassis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacturers have probably gotten more honest in terms of
buying the right chassis,'' he said. ``The customer should feel a
lot safer than they did four to five years ago.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWCASTLE, Wash. _ As a little girl _ not long ago _ Vicki Noon
used to clown around for home videos, pretending to be Ariel of
``The Little Mermaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ariel on her seaside rock, Vicki would climb atop her bunk
bed and sing achingly in her bright, powerful voice about being
``part of your world.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki is 13 now, and if she became part of our world any faster,
she'd risk getting the bends.
</P>
<P>
   After just a year or so of voice lessons, the Newcastle
eighth-grader has already landed three plum roles, including the
juvenile lead in Seattle's A Contemporary Theatre's fall production
of ``Violet.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, which runs Oct. 22 through Nov. 15, won the 1997 New
York Critics Circle Award for best musical.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Vicki won lead roles in two musicals at the Washington
Academy of Performing Arts. The fast-growing Redmond school was
co-founded by Deborah Hadley, former prima ballerina with Pacific
Northest Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, a last-minute cast change thrust Vicki into the
role of Dorothy in ``The Wizard of Oz,'' giving her less than five
days to learn a part that normally takes Academykarin: i left
Academy up all the way through because i think it's needed for
clarity--pat students a month or two to prepare. In late August, on
a less frantic note, she played the rags-to-riches heroine of
``Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki is still a little girl in lots of many ways _
freckle-faced, with a thatch of dark, chin-length hair, and glasses
she wears everywhere except onstage. At 5-foot-3, she packs 105
pounds of coiled energy into the compact body of an athlete _
hidden somewhere under her baggy overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she's a kid who has just discovered she's got talent
that could land her on top of the world. The joy of performing
makes her feel like she's already there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes me happy,'' Vicki said, face glowing. ``I love
it. I think it's so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, she faces tough career choices. On one hand, theater
pros say she has the raw, oversized talent to make it on Broadway.
Some compare her to the young Judy Garland, although there's no
trace of Garland's fragility in Vicki's bubbly personality and
clarion vocal style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime voice,'' said Jerry Tassin, one of
her Academy mentors. ``This girl has a set of pipes I have not
heard in years. It's a Broadway belt, is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Her singing coach, Ann Evans Zavada, said that in 10 years of
teaching, she has had only two other students of Vicki's caliber,
neither of whom has lived up to their early promise. One was
sidetracked by her social life. The other was a boy soprano who
sang with Seattle Opera until his voice changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Vicki has a clearer understanding of the professional
world and what she needs to do to be involved in it,'' Zavada said.
``And she wants to be involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Vicki also is a nearly straight-A student and
a star soccer player who, according to her coach, could make it to
the U.S. Women's Team if she weren't distracted by pipe dreams.
Last season she scored 23 of her team's 67 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit,'' said Norm Robinson, coach of her Gold
Select youth team in Renton. ``Her dribbling skills are incredible.
She has good ball control and she's fast. She has great moves.''
</P>
<P>
   But with theater work stealing time from soccer practice,
Robinson is pressing her to make a choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a little girl with a lot of talent who's getting pulled
in two different directions,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouoyant, twinkly-eyed and still innocent enough to be thrilled
by her good fortune, Vicki is frank about her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be on Broadway,'' she said with a happy giggle.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big leap for a girl who, three years ago, was too shy to
sing in a talent show on a vacation cruise. Instead, she joined a
lip-synch contest for adult women _ and won, putting body and soul
into a pantomime of Aretha Franklin's signature song, ``Respect.''
</P>
<P>
   After a year of song and dance training _ with many more to come
_ she has the erect, grounded posture of a gymnast and holds the
stage with quiet confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really nice to have around,'' said Kira Tassin, 14, who
appeared with her in ``Oz'' and ``Annie,'' ``because sometimes when
we have to run through something again, she makes a joke of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blowing off steam at an early rehearsal for ``Annie'' one day,
Vicki and another girl briefly hammed it up behind the director's
back during a boy's vocal solo.
</P>
<P>
   Threading through the darkened rows of seats, the two girls
shimmied in tandem _ arms outspread, shoulders gyrating in a broad,
chorus-girl sendup. Onstage, the cast cracked up.
</P>
<P>
   Director Kelly Willis whirled around _ long, red hair whipping.
She laughed, then admonished ``Vicki, sit down!''
</P>
<P>
   But it's all business now for Vicki, who's in rehearsal for
ACT's production of ``Violet.'' The show features two veterans of
last fall's New York premiere _ Lauren Ward, who originated the
adult lead role of Violet, and director Susan H. Schulman.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1964, it tells of a young mountain woman who sets out by
bus for Tulsa in hopes of finding a television evangelist who can
heal her disfigured face. Joined by two unlikely traveling
companions, Violet finally comes to understand her own strength and
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   In flashbacks, Vicki plays the young Violet, who is maimed when
her father accidentally hits her in the face with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only in about five scenes,'' said Vicki, who crammed for
her audition during a half-hour with Willis, using the
International Phonetic Alphabet to master a passable Southern
accent. She also twanged her way through the song, ``Delta Dawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ACT casting director Margaret Layne said Vicki seems to produce
her powerful vocals without effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense she's pushing to get the volume she does,''
Layne said. ``There's no straining. It's as natural as breathing.
She has a big, bright, unmannered voice that you can't listen to
without smiling.''
</P>
<P>
   She also projects uncanny self-confidence for such a rank
beginner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicki does one of the most poised auditions that I've ever
seen anyone do,'' Layne said. ``She's very relaxed. I think a lot
of that has to do with the support she gets from her family. They
do a lot to help her keep things in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki and her sister, Andrea, 17, spend time with both parents,
who divorced last year after 18 years of marriage but remain
friendly. Mom Liz Noon, 36, certifies Boeing airplane systems for
the Federal Aviation Administration. Dad Tim Noon, 42, is a Boeing
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki and Andrea, who wants to be a pediatrician, say they're
very close, though they occasionally squabble over little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we'll both just crack up,'' Andrea said. ``Our fights
last for about two minutes, then we'll laugh for five.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea said most of her friends don't mind Vicki tagging along
because she's ``amusing.'' But some are annoyed by her tendency to
hog the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Willis and Tassin, who teach dance and musical
theater at the Academy, had to convince Vicki she had a voice worth
developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to sing in front of people at first,'' Vicki
said. ``I know that I have a good voice, but I don't want to flaunt
it in front of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now she says, ``I'm glad I can't see the faces of the
people (in the audience). I think it would scare me if they weren't
liking it or were bored or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki's first big stage role was in the Academy's summer
production of ``The Wizard of Oz.'' It was a nerve-racking affair
that propelled her from the Munchkin chorus line to the role of
Dorothy in distressingly short order.
</P>
<P>
   At dress rehearsal, four days after she got the part, she still
hadn't learned all the songs. The next night, when the curtain
rose, she had it down cold.
</P>
<P>
   Her heroic performance knocked the socks off co-star Greg
Palmer, an independent TV film producer and former KING/5 reporter,
who played the Wizard. He saw her as ``an incredibly hard-working
tot with a singing voice that sounds like she's a 35-year-old
pro.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has, as far as I can tell, perfect pitch and easily
filled a thousand-seat hall, with or without sound amplification,''
Palmer said. ``She has what could be just a stunning career ahead
of her. I just think there's no limit to how far she can go.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Oz,'' Vicki's life assumed a whirlwind quality. She and
Andrea were vacationing with their dad in North Carolina this past
summer when ACT called Vicki back for a second audition for
``Violet,'' this time before the director and musical staff.
</P>
<P>
   As one of six finalists, she had no guarantees of anything
except a disrupted vacation and an extra $400 in travel expenses.
In the end, her father drove her to the airport from the beach
house near Cape Hatteras and put her on a puddle-jumper to
Jacksonville, N.C. Traveling solo, she changed planes in
Charlottesville, Va.; Washington, D.C., and Phoenix before arriving
back in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Layne said Vicki managed to project the right combination of
resilience and toughness for the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``And of course,'' Layne said, ``she sings like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Zavada said Vicki has an ``excellent transition'' between the
upper and lower ranges _ a seamlessness that some women spend years
trying to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Vicki can span at least three octaves _ less than
Mariah Carey's four, but twice as much as the average person. Her
sound comes from the shape of her face.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really wide across the cheeks,'' Zavada said. ``The
shape of the (vocal) cords is really the same on everybody. It's
really the resonating chambers that change the timbre and quality
of the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of coaching, Vicki has less vocal tension
and better breath control, which should see her through eight
performances a week in ``Violet.'' But she still has years of
training and hard work ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't encourage her to cruise,'' said Zavada. She tells
Vicki, ``Sure, this is fine, but what's it going to be like when
you're 15, or 17? You have to keep working.''
</P>
<P>
   Tassin, artistic co-director of the Washington Academy, said
it's important to keep Vicki ``unaware'' and suitably humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she gets out there and feels she's so successful she's
already where she needs to be, that will be her downfall,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We have her at a very important time of her
life. The talent is there, she's ready to train. If we get her
through the next few years and give her that solid base, she will
go!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vicki still has the pressures of school and soccer.
Coach Robinson has complained to Liz Noon about Vicki's absences,
saying it breeds resentment among girls who show up faithfully but
don't always get to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did kind of blow up with each other once,'' Robinson said,
``because I was fed up with her not being at practice, and I had
parents on my back.''
</P>
<P>
   They have since smoothed things over, although Saturday
rehearsals for ``Violet'' have forced Vicki to suspend soccer
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Noon, meanwhile, worries about the emotional wear and tear
of a performing career. This fall he vetoed Vicki's request to skip
eighth grade and go directly into the Academy's performance-focused
high school, the Conservatory. Maybe next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 13. She's my little girl,'' he said, as Vicki perched on
his knee with her arm around his shoulder. ``I'm worried about her
still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I worry about is, how is this affecting Andrea?
It used to be Andrea who had all the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea, herself a star soccer and tennis player, smiled wanly.
</P>
<P>
   Given Vicki's assorted talents, it isn't exactly ``Broadway or
bust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this voice or musical theater doesn't work out,'' said Liz
Noon, ``she could be a great engineer, she could be a doctor, she
could be anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added, ``I would like to see her be able to use her
voice because I think that's her biggest talent. And she loves it,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Robinson understands how dreams of stardom can overshadow
the thrill of a well-placed soccer kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of dreams,'' he said, ``are great dreams to have.''

   JUDICIARY-SCHIPPERS _ Few counties are as important to the
Democratic National Committee as Cook County. The Illinois county
surrounding the city of Chicago was where the famed Mayor Richard
J. Daley ran his beloved Democratic Machine for the better part of
this century. David Schippers is part of that fabric. The South
Side Irish lawyer is as Democratic as they get. His first cousin is
the chairman of the Democratic Party of Cook County and he has been
a loyal party supporter. And that is what makes Schippers such an
interesting profile. The man who made his name taking down
Chicago's Mafia is now heading up the special congressional
Republican task force to determine wwhether there is grounds for
the president to be impeached. We profile Schippers and Democratic

   AUSTIN PRISON GANG SERIES

<P>
   TEXAS-PRISONGANGS _ At a time when the gangs are being blamed

   STREET-GANGS _ In what authorities warn is a growing menace,
prison gangs driven by racial and geographic animosities are coming
of age in Austin and most other major Texas cities. In the past few
years, some prison gangs have begun recruiting members of youth
street gangs as soldiers in a growing crime network seeking to gain
control of Texas' illegal drug markets. (Ward, Austin

   The New York Times News Service plans the following
 &UR; ScienceTimes &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, Oct. 6:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TILMAN-ECOLOGY (St. Paul, Minn.) _ A Scientist at Work
feature: G. David Tilman, an ecologist at the University of
Minnesota, has discovered that the more species there are in an
ecosystem (up to a point), the more productive, resilient and
stable it will be. This is a question of some importance for
conservation policy, given a running political debate over whether
it is important to preserve as many species as possible. But the
Tilman experiments may have an even more basic value to the young
science of ecology. He is bringing controlled experimentation to
the relatively young science through his work on a 9-square-mile
tract of prairie-savanna ecosystem. By William K. Stevens. (2200
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HAND-TRANSPLANT (Undated) _ The hand and forearm transplant
performed on an Australian man in France nearly two weeks ago ranks
among the most extraordinary cases in the annals of surgery, one
full of sudden plot twists, colorful characters and international
controversy. The hospital did not say that two days before the
13{-hour operation, the head of the surgical team learned from the
patient that he had a criminal record. An Australian newspaper
later reported that the patient was due in court to face seven
fraud charges. And far from losing his right hand in a logging
accident, as initial reports had it, Australian newspapers said he
lost it using a circular saw in a New Zealand jail. By Lawrence K.
Altman. (1900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DEEP-SPACE-1 (Washington) _ The United States is about to
send an experimental probe into space to test some of the favorite
concepts of science fiction. The robot craft will be driven by an
advanced ion propulsion engine, will navigate through space on its
own and will occasionally call home to let people know how it is
doing. Called Deep Space 1, is one of the first missions designed
to send a spacecraft away from the Earth with technology testing,
and not science, as the main objective. By Warren E. Leary. (1650
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CAMBRIDGE-GENE (Cambridge, England) _ Ever since the
structure of DNA was discovered here in 1953, Cambridge has been a
leading world center for molecular biology. And with the help of a
recent bonanza from a long dead American pharmacist, Cambridge
scientists have become leading players in the effort to decipher
the human genome at the Sanger Center. By Nicholas Wade. (1750
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RADIUM (Undated) _ This year is the 100th anniversary of the
Nobel-prize-winning experiments by Marie and Pierre Curie into the
origins of radioactivity, and their discovery of the radioactive
elements polonium and radium. But, like other discoveries, related
hazards were not discovered for several years _ and some tragedies
followed, including those involving the painters of
glow-in-the-dark watches. By Denise Grady. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-LAZARUS (Undated) _ Many people with AIDS who once were
near death but now are thriving with new medicines are are now
gripped by depression, acute anxiety _ especially over financial
issues _ and other, unexpected emotional problems, clinicians and
therapists said. Some patients have ended long-term romantic
relationships and others have become suicidal, an odd response to
being given a reprieve from death. Authorities are calling it the
Lazarus Syndrome. By David France. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Looking back at the first
Personal Computing column, it is clear 16 years later that buying a
computer is still a process of trying to understand the value of
imponderables like DVD, PCI, USB and a 100 megahertz bus. Once
consumers sift through all the jargon, the bottom line is that
Windows 98 will not run properly with less than 32 megabytes of
memory, and any serious user will install twice that much _ or 500
times the memory of the most powerful machines described in that
first Personal Computers column. By Rob Fixmer. (1350 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Shorts on science: Dinosaurs probably
didn't really bump heads; it would have been suicidal. (525 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ Science questions answered: On the making of
butterflies' energy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEALTH PAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ This decade has seen a steady decline
in the proportion of Americans who regularly eat breakfast, long
considered ``the most important meal of the day.'' Countless
studies in recent decades have documented the value of breakfast to
a child's ability to learn, think quickly, pay attention and get
along well with others, including a far-reaching recent one. By
Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   POSTPARTUM-SEX-HEALTH (Undated) _ Doctors routinely advise women
to refrain from sexual activity for several weeks following
childbirth, and for most women postpartum pain and exhaustion are
incentives enough to comply. But for those who do not follow
doctors' orders, the consequences can be serious and, in rare
cases, even fatal, according to a recent study. By Susan Gilbert.

<HEADLINE>
FOR THE `LAST TIME,' SOME OF SEINFELD'S BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Print is not the best medium for Jerry Seinfeld's humor. You
lose the inflections, the way he jumps from a snap to a whine, the
way he swishes a punch line around in his mouth as if at some
comedic wine-tasting.
</P>
<P>
   It's with this disclaimer that we offer what we consider to be
some of the best lines from ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time,''
the new CD of the HBO show of Seinfeld's Broadway stand-up act. The
material isn't frighteningly original _ Shouldn't Seinfeld be above
airport jokes by now? _ but he always gives it a fresh, Seinfeldian
spin.
</P>
<P>
   ON COMMUNICATION: ``The thing that amuses me the most about
phone machines is how often we call people now, trying to get the
machine. That's what's happened now with the machine. The person
picks up and you're saying, `Uh ... oh ... I didn't think you would
be there. I just wanted to leave a message saying, `Sorry I missed
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   ON PLASTIC SURGERY: ``Friend of mine is going in for a nose job.
... Rhinoplasty, that's what they call it. ... RHINO. Is that
necessary? Person obviously is aware there's a problem. ... Do we
really need to compare them to a rhinoceros?''
</P>
<P>
   ON WOMEN: ``I know I will never understand women. I will never
understand how you can take boiling hot wax, pour it onto your
upper thigh, rip the hair out by the root _ and still be afraid of
a spider.''
</P>
<P>
   ON MEN: ``Women want to know what men are thinking. ... I will
tell you. Nothing. (Heavy applause) We're not thinking anything.
We're just walkin' around, lookin' around. This is the only natural
inclination of man.''
</P>
<P>
   ON McDONALD'S: ``Why is McDonald's still counting? How insecure
is this company? ... What is their ultimate goal _ to have cows
surrendering voluntarily? Showing up at the door, `We'd like to
turn ourselves in, we see the sign, we realize we have very little
chance out there. We'd like to be a Happy Meal, if that's at all
possible.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ON SPORTS: ``There are many things we could point to as proof
that the human being is not smart; the helmet is my personal
favorite. ... Why did we invent the helmet? Well, because we were
participating in many activities that were cracking our heads. We
looked at the situation; we chose not to avoid these activities,
but to just to make little plastic hats, so that we could continue
our head-cracking lifestyles.''
</P>
<P>
   ON CLOTHING: ``I brought this guy in a suede jacket, got spots
on it because I wore it in the rain. He says, `There's nothing we
can do. Water ruins leather.' Now _ aren't cows outdoors a lot of
the time? When it rains, do the cows go up to the farmhouse, `Hey,
hey, let us in, we're all wearing leather out here! Hey, open up,
man, I'm suede!'''

CELEBRATE 2000 CLOSER TO HOME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When last we visited, we were discussing around-the-world
flights on the Concorde, trekking to the Great Pyramids and other
extravagant plans to celebrate the dawning of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Better hurry, too: Some events and tours are filling fast.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't have to cross an ocean or spend a fortune to
welcome the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   We could simply form a circle.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe ``simply'' isn't an appropriate word. The ``Prelude
to the Millennium'' promises to culminate in the largest human
circle ever, an anticipated gathering of 1 million ``Earth
Spiritualists'' in the California desert on sacred ground blessed
by Tibetan monks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special gifts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to promoters, participants will spread the contents of
``Prelude to the Millennium'' pouches on the ground, thus healing
the Earth and themselves. They will chant about their desires for
the future and, as a bonus, enjoy free concerts and workshops.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, even if you can't attend, you can purchase _ hmmm, are
you surprised that everything isn't free? _ pouches over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This gathering, scheduled Dec. 30, 1999, through Jan. 1, 2000 on
a site still undetermined, is among hundreds of millennium-related
events detailed on a fascinating Web site:
http://www.everything2000.com.
</P>
<P>
   Not into rituals aimed at pagans, Wiccans, shamans and
``free-thinkers''? Perhaps instead you'd like to drum in the
millennium. A celebration headquartered in Taos, N.M., aims to
coordinate individuals drumming all over the nation _ and the world
_ as ``an affirmation of their collective vision for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road in Albuquerque, a three-day Rock the Millennium
music concert vows to present ``seven to 12 of the biggest names in
classic rock today.'' Invited performers, according to sponsors,
include the Rolling Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Van Halen, Grand Funk
Railroad, Santana, ZZ Top and _ classic rock? _ Willie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   No word yet on whether Willie or any of the others have accepted
the invitation. But just reading promotions for some events is
enough to create a party atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Huge bash &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in southern California, Party 2000 is projected as ``the
biggest concert and party ever held on Planet Earth.'' It will
feature, we are told, ``the top big-name bands,'' ``the most
awesome stage, field and special effects lighting system ever
designed,'' ``the world's largest fireworks display'' and ``the
world's largest carnival.'' Oh, and I almost forgot, ``the world's
largest barbecue cookout.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to be confused with ``one of the largest and longest
fireworks and laser displays the country has ever seen'' planned in
conjunction with an ``audio-visual extravaganza hosted by some of
the top names in the entertainment industry'' at the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Given the hype, I can only assume that some boxing promoters are
moonlighting with the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   What could possibly top California's plans? New Yorkers aim to
try with Celebration 2000, billed as ``the definitive
turn-of-the-century party.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Big Apple, Times Square _ traditional home of the
nation's biggest New Year's Eve bash _ will start its celebration
at 7 a.m., coinciding with the arrival of the year 2000 in the
South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's capital will begin partying even earlier. Special
events are scheduled all year, and New Year's Eve on the Mall will
include a fireworks display and major entertainers _ assuming all
aren't busy in California or New Mexico. According to one report,
President Clinton has asked director Steven Spielberg and
musician/record producer Quincy Jones to coordinate the event.
</P>
<P>
   Other huge parties are planned for Chicago, Miami, Boston and
almost every other U.S. city. Cleveland touts the appearance of
``24 of the largest names in rock.'' Sioux Falls, S.D., is already
promoting ``the biggest party in the Great Plains.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect hundreds of in-state celebrations, too; already announced
is a $30 million grand exposition from Nov. 26, 1999, to Jan. 2,
2000, at Dallas' Fair Park.
</P>
<P>
   Where winter weather permits _ Death Valley, for instance _
national parks also are expected to draw crowds eager to usher in
the millennium's first light over a wide-open landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on going to Walt Disney World, though. Every room in
all 16 hotels at that Orlando-area resort has been reserved for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late to book a hotel in other parts of the country.
Yes, a hotel, not just a room. Several properties _ including the
Warwick in Houston _ are entertaining offers to reserve the entire
facility. For those on a budget, countless others will rent you a
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Ritz-Carlton's ``Ultimate Experience'' is reserved for one
couple only at each of its hotels and resorts in the United States
and worldwide. The package includes accommodations in the resort's
premier suite, with private dining room; an 18-karat gold Bvlgari
Chrono watch for men and an 18-karat gold Bvlgari Quadroto watch
with a classic Tubogas bracelet for women; use of a Jaguar
automobile (chauffeur-driven if you prefer) for the weekend; a
magnum of Taittinger champagne and two Baccarat flutes in a
custom-designed gift box; and ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, you get the idea. The cost: $100,000 for a minimum of
three nights. No drumming, chanting or forming circles required.
</P>
<P>
   Our reports the past two weeks on travel-related millennium
plans barely scratch the surface. For those eager to read more,
here is a sampling of Web sites worth perusing. Most provide links

HELP, HOPE AND GETTING PEOPLE OFF WELFARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Public welfare is such an emotionally charged issue
that the Texas Department of Human Services devotes a large chunk
of its Internet web site to debunking widespread welfare ``myths.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor people have big families because welfare rewards them for
having babies,'' is but one of many popular notions that, according
to DHS, is untrue.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the agency reports, the average welfare family has
only two children. And, for the record, the typical monthly cash
assistance for those two children and their mother is $188, one of
the lowest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in food stamps, and the family's benefits increase by $313
a month, which is still hardly a princely sum.
</P>
<P>
   But government handouts to poor people will always be
controversial, mainly because many hard-working citizens who pay
their own way _ and more taxes than they believe they should _ are
resentful of people who get a ``free ride.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will always have elected officials and political
candidates eager to reinforce one welfare myth or another.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, for example, how adamant Gov. George W. Bush was a few
years ago about penalizing welfare moms for having additional
children?
</P>
<P>
   See the ``big-family'' myth above.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature didn't give Bush the family cap that he
demanded. But, aided by the governor's leadership, lawmakers in
1995 enacted some far-reaching welfare reforms aimed at getting
people off the dole and into jobs. The next year, Congress followed
up with even more comprehensive welfare changes with the same goal.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the changes limit the amount of time a
person can receive welfare benefits and require able-bodied
recipients to look for jobs or enroll in education or training
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the changes were significant improvements. But more
needs to be done to ensure that the people who are leaving the
welfare rolls have an opportunity to be trained for _ and receive _
the type of jobs that actually can change their lives. Many of them
will have to settle for minimum wages, but reform will require more
than increasing Texas' supply of burger flippers.
</P>
<P>
   Government can offer incentives, but private employers committed
to hiring former welfare recipients, rather than merely complaining
about government handouts, will be ultimately responsible for
making the changes work.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 people have left the welfare rolls in Texas
during the past four years. Most of those are children, but many
moms are now working instead of drawing welfare checks.
</P>
<P>
   The state's strong economy has helped. But a more significant
test of welfare reform will occur if the economy cools, and jobs
become harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, has picked up the welfare reform banner again
in his re-election campaign. Last week, he began airing a new
television commercial touting his efforts to give Texans a
``temporary hand up, not a handout.'' And he proposed a mixed bag
of further changes in the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Two proposals are particularly positive.
</P>
<P>
   One would allow families at risk of falling back into welfare a
transition period during which they could temporarily continue to
receive benefits while the caregiver begins working.
</P>
<P>
   Another would increase child-care funds for low-income families
by $100 million to help meet a shortfall in providing child care
for the working poor. A welfare mom _ most adult welfare recipients
are single women _ has trouble working or attending classes if she
can't find someone to care for her children. Most welfare mothers
can't afford conventional day care and, despite the``big-family''
myth, don't always have a friend or relative to help out.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Bush's other proposals, however, may actually hurt
children. One would cut off a family's entire benefit check if the
parent didn't seek a job or enroll in a training program. Another
would impose a similar sanction if a mother refuses to cooperate
with the state in establishing paternity and collecting child
support from a noncustodial father.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the state withholds only the parent's portion of the
check, less than half of the benefit, in either of those cases. The
tougher sanctions are designed to encourage parents to be
responsible and do the right thing, but why should the children
suffer if the parents don't cooperate?
</P>
<P>
   Still another Bush proposal may have only a limited effect on
the welfare system, but it certainly will perpetuate another of
those myths the state's welfare workers keep trying to refute.
</P>
<P>
   This is a proposed ``one strike and you're out law,'' which
would permanently disqualify a person for welfare assistance after
being caught only one time for trying to cheat the system.
</P>
<P>
   Battling welfare ``cheats'' has a lot of popular appeal, and the
state should fight welfare fraud at every opportunity. But,
according to the Department of Human Services, this is not nearly

GARDENERS WANT MORE FROM AZALEA BLOOMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Azaleas give us cause to celebrate each spring. Yet as the
flowers fade, many moan that the party's just over too soon.
</P>
<P>
   For years, gardeners who want more in the way of azalea blooms
have gotten help from `Fashion' and `Red Ruffles', varieties that
flower in fall as well as in spring.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, more help has arrived with a promising new group of
the popular shrubs _ the Encore azaleas. For the most part, the
Encore varieties look like other azaleas we've used for years in
our gardens. There are eight varieties grouped in the ``Autumn''
series available in the Houston area this fall. These Encore
azaleas are within a 2- to 5-foot height range, have mounding,
spreading or upright growth habits and are evergreen. The Encores,
too, have the same cultural needs we give our old reliables.
</P>
<P>
   But the Encores are repeat bloomers. The difference: They flower
on new wood, not old wood as our traditional azaleas. This doesn't
mean an Encore is going to be dressed in full regalia 12 months of
the year. Not even the most avid azalea fan would want this much of
a good thing. What it does mean is that spring brings a flush of
flowers, followed by a period of new growth. The blooms return in
mid- to late-summer and continue through fall. The flowers stop
during cold weather, but in early to mid-spring, another year of
flowering cycle begins.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of colors is excellent _ from pink to orange-red to
purple.
</P>
<P>
   During the past year and a half, six Encore varieties in the
Autumn series have been tested in Houston-area gardens. (Two more
varieties have recently been added to the Autumn lineup.) The
general consensus is that these flowering shrubs are worth a try.
Mercer Arboretum and Botanic Gardens in Houston reports those
tested there have performed well.
</P>
<P>
   Arboretum experts suggest using Encores as highlights in the
garden, as the colors do make the plants special. Those gardeners
who use large azaleas such as the `Formosas' as a hedge are advised
to not replant with Encores as these, at least at this stage of
testing, do not grow as tall. Reported mature height of the largest
Encore variety is about 5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Those six varieties have done well in our garden, too, and
perhaps deserve an extra check given the wretched climate we've
faced in '98. Extra water, of course, was needed to see them
through record drought and heat. Our Encores receive typical azalea
treatment: filtered sun or bright shade, and a well-draining,
acidic soil that is moist, but not soggy.
</P>
<P>
   The multiseason Encore azaleas are the product of the
hybridizing efforts of Robert E. Lee of Independence, La., whose
interest in azaleas developed as a high school employee at a
nursery. That interest grew as he studied and crossed azaleas with
varying bloom times. Following college, Lee grew and sold azaleas
through his own wholesale nursery.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-summer 1982, while visiting a fellow member of the Azalea
Society of America, Lee spotted a flat of rooted cuttings of
``Rhododendron oldhamii.'' Cuttings in bloom. After observing the
growth and bud development of this species, he began to cross it
with other azaleas with fall-blooming tendencies. His years of work
paid off and in 1992, Lee struck an agreement with Flowerwood
Nursery, a wholesale operation in Loxley, Ala., to continue his
breeding program while selecting the best varieties for the
gardening public. Encore azaleas were commercially introduced in
the Southeast a year ago. This fall, the Autumn series makes its
debut in the Houston area.
</P>
<P>
   Additional varieties may join the Encore lineup in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Encore varieties in the Autumn series come in eight
beautiful colors:
</P>
<P>
   `Autumn Embers', a deep orange-red that's so rich in color it's
irresistible to a gardener who typically shies way from orange
flowers. The growth habit is low, spreading and dense. The 2 1/2-
to 3-inch, semi-double flowers begin to open in September and the
plants will continue to flower through fall, rest in winter and
begin again in spring. Approximate size at maturity is 3 feet by 4
feet. Think of `Autumn Embers' as the Halloween azalea.
</P>
<P>
   `Autumn Rouge': These began to flower in late July and August in
our garden. The 2-inch, semidouble, pinkish-red blooms will also
flower in fall. Mid-spring promises a good showing, too.
Approximate mature size is 5 feet by 4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   `Autumn Royalty': This azalea began flowering in our garden in
August and is in bloom now. The 3 1/2-inch rich purple blooms are
beautiful against large green leaves on an upright, globose shrub.
Flowering continues until frost and begins again in mid-spring.
Mature height and width is about 5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   `Autumn Amethyst': The 2-inch, single, soft-purple blooms on
this 4-foot by 4-foot plant are iridescent. The elongated foliage
is pointed and has a rough texture. Flowering begins in late July
or August and becomes heavier in fall. Dense and spreading,
`Amethyst' blooms again in spring.
</P>
<P>
   `Autumn Coral': This is another variety that begins to flower in
July or August, continues through fall and repeats in spring. The
3-inch single blooms are a salmon-pink with fuchsia flecking. The
shrub has a mounding growth habit and matures to about 3 feet in
height and 4 feet in width.
</P>
<P>
   `Autumn Cheer': The smallest of the six tested in our garden,
this compact plant only reaches a couple of feet in height and 3
feet in width. The rose-pink single flowers are a charming 1 {
inches across.
</P>
<P>
   The two recent additions to the Autumn series of Encore azaleas
are:
</P>
<P>
   `Autumn Bravo': This upright azalea is approximately 4 feet in
width and height at maturity and produces 2-inch, semidouble,
bright red blooms.
</P>
<P>
   `Autumn Monarch': A larger shrub at 5 feet in height and width,
`Monarch' comes with 3-inch, semidouble, coral blooms with reddish
flecking and ruffled edges.
</P>
<P>
   Fall is an excellent time to plant azaleas here. The keys to
success in growing and enjoying the Encores are the right location
_ and good soil preparation. Plant the shrubs in bright shade,
filtered sunlight or where they will receive afternoon shade. Do
not plant in low areas. Raise the bed if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Work some compost into the soil. Dig a hole twice as wide as it
is deep. Remove the azalea from the container, and loosen the root
ball. Place the plant in the hole, and make sure the root ball is
above the soil level. Push soil back into the hole, gently tamp to
remove any air pockets. Water well and mulch with pine needles or
pine bark mulch.
</P>
<P>
   Do not let the shrub dry out, especially while it is
establishing a root system.
</P>
<P>
   When to prune Encore azaleas? Although these azaleas are repeat
bloomers, the best time to prune is immediately after the spring
flowering period. This will encourage new growth and maximum bud
set. &QL;

DAFFODIL BULBS DON'T NEED REFRIGERATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do daffodils require refrigeration as do tulips? Do they
naturalize here?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, there is no need to refrigerate. Yes, several varieties
of daffodils naturalize here. These bulbs are among the best for
our Gulf Coast gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Buy early- to late-blooming daffodil varieties for extended
spring blooms. Plant daffodils in sun or semishade around
Thanksgiving in well-draining, organic soil with 2 inches of soil
above the bulb shoulder. Use bone meal or superphosphate if
squirrels dig your bulbs when planting.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulb and Plant Mart (see Garden Calendar) offers many
daffodil varieties for garden and container culture. Nurseries,
too, carry numerous selections.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I kill Bermuda grass or keep it from taking over my
St. Augustine? I've been pulling some of it, but it is hard to get
all of the roots, and this is time consuming.
</P>
<P>
   I have three gardenias growing in half-whiskey barrels. The
majority of the time they do great and have really bloomed. But
occasionally the leaves turn brown around the edges or the foliage
turns yellow. I water every other day and sometimes every day. And
I use a soil acidifier. Do I need to worry?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid the only treatments other than physically removing
the Bermuda is to spot treat it with a product that contains
glyphosphate. Roundup or Finale would do the trick, but of course,
these would kill any St. Augustine they touch, too, so you will
have dead zones until the St. Augustine _ or the Bermuda _ regrows.
If possible, try to just hit the Bermuda runners before they make
contact with your St. Augustine. If you use such as a herbicide, do
so before the St. Augustine goes dormant or that dead zone will be
obvious quite a bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   I would not worry about the gardenias. Browned leaf margins is a
sign of environmental change such as wet-dry extremes. You can
prevent most of this with consistent watering and apparently you
are, since the problem pops up only occasionally. It has been
difficult to maintain consistent soil moisture during the excessive
heat and dry periods.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow leaves are a symptom of too much water, but again, if
this is a once-in-awhile thing, don't worry. It could be, too, that
the occasional leaf that yellows, then drops, is simply the plant's
means of shedding old foliage. Hibiscus do this.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow leaves with green veins are a sign of iron deficiency,
but since you're acidifying the soil, it doesn't sound as if this
is your problem.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Virginia buttonweed is the most obnoxious lawn weed, unfazed
by weed-and-feed fertilizers as well as broadleaf herbicides.
Uprooting the weed is not practical except in small areas of the
lawn. Do you have any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   Following the rule that phosphorus is beneficial for flowering,
I have applied solutions of a 12-55-6 on potted plants and
seedlings. I have spaded 12-24-12 granular fertilizer into
vegetable plots. After several years of those applications the
potted plants declined, and the plots no longer supported anything,
including weeds. A soil analysis at Texas A&AMP;M told me that I had
excessive phosphorus as this does not leach away as nitrogen and
potassium do, and that the built-up phosphorus hindered roots from
absorbing trace minerals. I also learned it may take three years to
restore balance. Your readers should be warned.
</P>
<P>
   I have a rotary composter and use its product as mulch and to
spade in as a soil amendment. As a result, tilth is good. Finding a
dozen or so year-old strawberry plants wiped out at the end of
August, I wonder if the weed killers persist, making this compost
toxic to some plants.
</P>
<P>
   A: Virginia buttonweed is a warm-season, fleshy-leafed perennial
that has small white flowers and green seedpods that resemble green
beads. This weed likes moisture. Your best weapon is healthy St.
Augustine. You can encourage good health with proper fertilization,
watering and mowing. Don't overwater. Water deeply when you do to
encourage turfgrass roots to grow deeper in the soil, away from the
often-hot, quick-drying surface. Fertilize your lawn in the spring
once it has greened and is beginning to grow. If you use a mulching
mower in summer, you will leave enough nutrients on the turf to
replenish the soil. Fertilize the lawn again in fall. Mowing height
for St. Augustine is 2{ to 3 inches. If you mow too closely, you
open up areas to weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Pull what you can of the weed, roots and all, when you walk out
to get the mail. Little by little you can eliminate it. The
herbicide Image is said to be somewhat effective in controlling
Virginia buttonweed.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for your comments about overuse of phosphorus. We have
mentioned such buildup before in this column.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say whether herbicide residuals killed your
strawberries. We avoid adding treated grass clippings or plant
materials to our compost pile because degradability and toxicity
varies considerably among chemicals. If your compost did not harm
other plants, I would tend to think your strawberries died from
other causes. Strawberries need excellent drainage and a sandy,
acidic soil that has good air space to encourage root health. They
like a soil that has been amended with compost. But strawberries
can succumb to soil-borne diseases. And it can be a chore to keep
them going during the hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I could use some information on the desert rose.
</P>
<P>
   A: Desert rose, ``Adenium obesum,'' is a sun-loving succulent
with pink, crimson or white flowers and prominently veined glossy
foliage with downy undersides. The thick, bulbous stem contains a
poisonous milky sap. It is not cold-tolerant, so you will need to
provide winter protection.
</P>
<P>
   Give the plant a half day or more of sun. Water during the
growing season, but make sure the soil drains well. Keep the soil
on the dry side in late fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   Desert rose likes a loose soil. Any good potting soil is fine
for grafted types. Use a cactus and succulent potting soil for
ungrafted types. Apply a cactus fertilizer every three weeks or so
during the growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Prune the plant if it becomes leggy. The milky juice is
poisonous, so wear gloves while pruning.
</P>

 USERS OF THE POPULAR iMAC COPE WITH SOME GLITCHES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The computing world is finding out the hard way
that Apple Computer Inc.'s iMac may be popular but not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems with the aquamarine computer is its
lack of a floppy disk drive. Apple has tried to quell critics by
promoting a third-party device that was engineered specifically for
the iMac: the SuperDisk made by Imation. But there are fundamental
problems with that drive: It will not easily install programs from
floppy disks, and it will not install disk-based programs that are
copy protected. Apple and Imation blame each other for the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The disk drive is just out on the market, so users of the iMac
may not yet be aware of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut Aug. 15, the iMac has become the
second-best-selling consumer computer in the United States. PC Data
Inc., a Reston, Va.-based market analysis firm, reports that the
futuristic machine accounted for 7.1 percent of retail computer
sales in August, lagging only behind Hewlett-Packard's 6330 desktop
line.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers have criticized the iMac for its lack of a
traditional floppy-disk drive and standard connections for
printers, scanners and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In trying to come out with cutting-edge technology, Apple has
ignored the real-world needs of their existing customers,'' said
Tom Rhinelander, an analyst with Forrester Research, a technology
research firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's that typical Apple way,
which has been Apple arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   The iMac connects to other devices via a plug called a universal
serial bus, or USB. The USB is impressive. Developed by Intel, the
USB creates a high-speed connection at least 10 times faster than
the traditional printer port on older Macs. The USB device also
allows a user to chain together more than 120 devices on one port.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are only a handful of iMac-compatible USB devices
on the market, in part because computer owners already have
traditionally configured printers and other peripherals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most iMac buyers already own older Macintoshes,'' Rhinelander
said. ``And they already have printers and scanners and such that
use the older connections.''
</P>
<P>
   The iMac does feature a CD-ROM drive. Most popular Mac software
programs are now published on CDs. But CDs are a permanent one-time
record media and can't be used to transfer data. Most common
software packages are now published on CDs. Specialized software
and older versions of popular programs are still published on
floppies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floppy disk is still the overwhelming choice to transfer
data, especially in the consumer market,'' said Jason Thunstrom, a
spokesman for Imation, an Oakdale, Minn., manufacturer of data
storage devices. ``Last year, 4 billion disks were bought around
the world. That should tell you something.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a floppy has been a ``big issue with users,'' said
Ric Ford, who publishes MacInTouch (www.macintouch.com), an iMac
user Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said some iMac owners had been taking radical steps to
solve the problem: Cracking open the iMac's translucent shell and
soldering in an older Macintosh floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think that would void the warranty,'' Ford said. ``So I
don't recommend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple has said it did not include a disk drive on the iMac
because _ in the age of CDs and Internet software _ the technology
is outdated.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has publicized strategies for iMac users to get around
this problem: mainly attaching files to e-mail or connecting an
iMac to a network.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino, Calif., computer maker has also been touting a
new iMac-specific USB floppy drive released earlier this month by
Imation. The SuperDisk is being promoted as the solution to the
iMac floppy quandary. And, in fact, it does copy files to and from
an iMac's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the SuperDisk, at $150, contains a major flaw: Imation
confirms that it won't easily install floppy disk programs into an
iMac. More disturbing to Mac software publishers, the SuperDisk
cannot install copy protected floppy disk programs. Copy protection
_ which keeps users from making bootleg reproductions of programs _
is the lifeblood of smaller software publishers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Imation, the problem stems from the Apple operating
system, which doesn't properly recognize the Imation drive or the
current copy protection codes. ``There's nothing on our end to
fix,'' Thunstrom said. ``The problem lies in the software that
Apple makes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thunstrom said the iMac won't send the command to automatically
spit out disks when installing software published on more than one
floppy. Multiple disk software is the norm in the industry.
Thunstrom said users must copy each disk onto the iMac's hard
drive, and then run the installation program from there. Disk-based
programs that contain the copy protection, Thunstrom said, simply
won't run.
</P>
<P>
   However, to get to this point, a consumer would have to first
try to install the disk-based program, figure out the problem, then
call Imation's help line, 800-888-2700. There is no documentation
included with the drive, or on Imation's Web site
(www.imation.com), which discusses the glitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been starting to get calls about it,'' said an Imation
technician. ``And we're getting more and more calls the longer the
drive's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Copy protection software developers say Apple has been slow to
respond to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to get (Apple's) attention,'' said Allen
Cronce, president of PACE Anti-Piracy, a leading floppy disk copy
protection software publisher based in San Jose. ``We eventually
had to go to Apple's headquarters ... but by that time, it was too
late,'' Cronce said. ``They were ready to roll with what they
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Shebanek, the USB product marketing manager at Apple, said
the problem lies in the software that Imation shipped with the
SuperDisk.
</P>
<P>
   Shebanek said Imation only worked with Apple on making a disk
drive that would copy files, not install programs from them. That
decision, he said, stemmed from Imation's desire to get the device
out as soon as possible after the iMac appeared.
</P>
<P>
   USB problems have also cropped up in the printer arena. Apple
has had to issue a software update to handle USB glitches affecting
printers, especially those advertised as being iMac-compatible from
Hewlett-Packard and Epson. Epson, in turn, has had to publish fixes
to its iMac printer software.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac's USB problems, Ford said, will eventually fade. ``The
companies that want to capture the emerging iMac market will start
publishing on CDs. It's not hard to do, and it's almost as
economical as floppies.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, added Ford, ``there is going to have to be some pain,
I guess.''

`PFEIFFER' FAILS AT POLITICAL FARCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER 
Starring: Chi McBride, Danncq Florek, Christine Estabrook, Max
Baker 
On: UPN 
Time: Monday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last season, the controversial new TV series was ``Nothing
Sacred,'' a classy drama that put the church up against '90s
realities. The tempest was predictable, with right-wing and
religious associations appalled at the show's blasphemy, etc.,
etc., etc. But the negative press stoked awareness and curiosity
about an intelligent, worthy show.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the squeaky wheel should not get the grease.
This year, the uproar isover a sitcom called ``The Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer,'' a silly half-hour of sloppy political
incorrectness and slapstick that doesn't deserve an iota of extra
attention. Set in Abe Lincoln's White House, it's a racuous show
that prides itself on holding nothing sacred, from Mary Todd
Lincoln's sexual needs to the power imbalance of Civil War-era
slavery. While it's mesmerizingly bizarre for about one nanosecond
_ a period farce about Abe Lincoln? What kind of meds were the
creators not taking when they came up with this? _ the toe-cheese
and sex jokes are repetitive and moronic. How many times can we
laugh because everyone thinks Mrs. Lincoln is fat and ugly? For
comparing ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' to the movies of Monty Python,
executive producer Mort Nathan deserves to be clopped between a
pair of coconuts.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy is based on the show's attempts to make comedy
in a slavery setting, just as ``Hogan's Heroes'' whooped it up in
Nazi Germany (during a much less sensitized era). Desmond is a
black English nobleman who finds himself penniless and stuck in
America after cheating at a card game. He's Lincoln's butler, and
not his ``slave,'' but he is unable to leave the States. As on the
1979-86 series ``Benson,'' Desmond is the servant but he is clearly
the sanest person in the house, and he even has his own helper, a
runty Marty Feldman look-alike named Nibblet. His last name, by the
way, is pronounced Puh-fifer, without the silent P.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot episode sent to critics, which UPN is withholding
after protests from African-American groups, contains a few
specific racial gags. When faced with a drunken General Grant,
Desmond says: ``With you at the helm, I better brush up on my
cotton-picking skills.'' And when Desmond is caught outside Mrs.
Lincoln's room, he covers himself by pretending to be a slave: ``I
just be loving my massa so, I just be standin' here in case she be
needin' something.'' The episode that served as the premiere has
Lincoln deep into telegraph sex with a mysterious woman. This
obvious situation yields at least one racial joke, as Lincoln, his
hands burned, asks Desmond to send a telegraph message. ``Sure,
make the black guy tap,'' he replies.
</P>
<P>
   Racially insensitive? Maybe. Humorous or eye-opening? No, not at
all. And in general, the show's primary targets are politics and
sex, and not race. Tonight's telegraph-sex plot is the occasion for
predictable jokes about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. ``You're
acting no better than a horny hillbilly from Arkansas,'' Desmond
says to Lincoln. At another point he says, ``Mr. President, you
don't have to explain. This isn't the grand jury.'' That's about as
shrewd as the political satire gets. Meanwhile, a sexually
frustrated Mrs. Lincoln exclaims, ``The Civil War! The Civil War!
What about my needs? When do I get the attention of the executive
branch?'' Get the picture?
</P>
<P>
   The cast gives it a lot of gusto, particulary Christine
Estabrook's first lady. The first time she laughs like Tiny Tim
when she's sexually excited, she makes it work, and in the episode
that isn't airing tonight, she does a brave imitation of Marilyn
Monroe singing ``Happy Birthday'' to the president. But the bold
material is simply not sharp enough to qualify as solid satire or
burlesque, and the actors end up looking stranded. The show may be
in-your-puh-face, but it sure isn't puh-funny.

HARVARD, MIT WHIZ KIDS MAY BE THE KEY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin (Harvard 1960) needs the
latest on the global financial crisis, he turns to his deputy,
Lawrence H. Summers (Harvard PhD 1982 and a former Harvard faculty
member). When Summers needs help, he turns to his deputy, David A.
Lipton (Harvard PhD 1981).
</P>
<P>
   If these officials wonder what the critics are saying, they need
look no further than their fellow alumni or former colleagues
Rudiger Dornbusch, Paul Krugman (both MIT), or Jeffrey Sachs
(Harvard).
</P>
<P>
   By now, hundreds of millions of people have been swept into the
financial maelstrom roiling the planet. But no more than a few
dozen are at the center of the effort to figure out what to do, and
an inordinate number of them live, teach, or were trained in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's as it should be, because to a remarkable degree
these are the men responsible for the optimistic economic outlook
that has dominated most of this decade _ the philosophy that sound
money and open markets can usher developing countries into the
global fold and kindle a golden era of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the philosopy has become so closely associated with this
group that it is called the ``Washington consensus'' or the
``Massachusetts Avenue consensus,'' a bow both to the street that
links Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and to a similarly named street in Washington whose
think tanks have served as homes away from home to generations of
Boston economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large extent, Cambridge was the birthplace of the
Washington consensus,'' said J. Bradford DeLong, a deputy assistant
Treasury secretary in the mid-1990s who teaches economic history at
the University of California at Berkeley. ``That's why there are so
many people there who are mystified and trying to work out what's
gone wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   And something has gone terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For after a decade of lifting nations and opening societies, the
consensus now seems to be driving a number of developing countries
into recession and turmoil, and nudging the world toward the
financial abyss.
</P>
<P>
   Such an abrupt reversal of fortune is making this a cruel season
for the Cambridge crowd. Its members have become targets of harsh
criticism and unflattering comparisons, especially with ``the best
and the brightest'' who led the nation into Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people up in Boston have egg on their face,'' said Paul
Davidson, a University of Tennessee economist. ``They should have
known this was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the ``best-and-brightest'' comparison is probably
unfair, and many in the Cambridge crowd did know _ and warn _ of
what could go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that there's a fundamental flaw'' with the
Massachusetts Avenue consensus, said Robert M. Solow, the MIT
economist and Nobel laureate who served as one of President
Kennedy's economic advisers in the 1960s and who has trained or
worked with almost everyone in the current generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that life, especially financial life, gets ahead of
what you've worked out, or think you've worked out. The
international financial system just got away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to conceive of how tiny _ how nearly claustrophobic _
is the circle that crafted the Massachusetts Avenue consensus and
is now expected to repair its tattered tenets.
</P>
<P>
   While finance officials and central bankers from scores of
countries converged on Washington this weekend for a string of
high-level meetings, while most of the pronouncements were being
made by senior officials like Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, almost all the heavy policy work was being done by
a group just below the top ranks that is largely populated by
Harvard- and MIT-trained economists.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by now the Cambridge crowd controls the second tier at
all three institutions most directly responsible for coping with
the crisis: the US Treasury, the International Monetary Fund, and
the World Bank. Besides Summers at Treasury, there is former MIT
professor Stanley Fischer at the IMF, and MIT-trained Joseph
Stiglitz at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to track job switches among group members can be
dizzying. Stiglitz, for example, assumed his current position as
the World Bank's chief economist when Summers vacated the post.
Summers got the World Bank job when Fischer left it.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to trace the group's professional and social ties can be
even more confusing. At one time or another, Fischer and Dornbusch,
both of whom are in their 50s, taught almost all the rest of the
group, most of whom are in their 40s. Fischer and Summers
coauthored a series of academic papers and shared a summer house on
Martha's Vineyard. Summers, Sachs, and Lipton were graduate
students together, and Summers hired Lipton at Treasury after
Lipton had worked for Sachs at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the connections straight is tougher still when one
realizes that the group's field of operation extends well beyond
Boston and Washington. Group members have advised scores of
countries across Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe about how
to fix their economies.
</P>
<P>
   But notwithstanding the job changes, professional pairing, and
globe-girdling travel, the Cambridge crowd shares a similar
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys _ and they are all guys _ come at the task of being
an economist with a willingness to talk about policy, and to frame
their theories to influence it,'' said David C. Colander, a
Middlebury College historian. ``Within the world of policy, they
form a very tight oligopoly at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To see how influential the consensus and the Cambridge
economists were requires an understanding of a critical change that
has occurred over the last two decades, one that has been so
thorough that _ until the current crisis _ it seemed as if this was
the way things have always been: Much of the world's population can
now put its money where it wants to put it.
</P>
<P>
   People can exchange their currencies for foreign currencies.
They can generally deposit funds outside their home countries. And
they can invest both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   All of this strikes Americans as commonplace because they have
always been able to move their money, and because most assumed that
such movement is a key part of the market system.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision in the early 1990s by many nations, especially
developing ones, to permit free movement of money and to open their
currency and financial markets to the world represented a dramatic
break with the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody said they had to do that,'' said Yale economist James
Tobin, a Nobel laureate and a longtime critic of open financial
markets. ``Capital controls are perfectly legitimate'' under
international rules, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that Tobin and an older generation of economists
object to free movement of money is that they believed financial
markets were more prone to destabilizing booms and busts than
conventional markets for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   But starting in the early 1970s, a new generation began arguing
that domestic financial markets were much more stable than
previously thought, and by decade's end key members of the
Cambridge crowd were applying the new arguments internationally. At
crucial moments over the last 20 years, the Cambridge economists
have written papers, devised models, or offered opinions that fed
the open-market drive, contributions that at least some members of
the group say they regret in light of today's global upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, for example, Krugman wrote an influential
paper that was widely interpreted as showing that financial markets
only punish countries that get their economic fundamentals wrong
by, for instance, running big government budget deficits. And the
MIT economist repeatedly dismissed the idea that markets can be
swept by self-fulfilling panics that punish even nations doing
everything right.
</P>
<P>
   But a self-fulfilling panic appears to be precisely what has now
descended on large parts of the world. ``I was wrong,'' the
normally unyielding Krugman told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the global crisis has worsened in recent months, a new edge,
a certain nastiness, has crept into relations among the Cambridge
economists, one that some think signals the beginning of the end of
the group's influence.
</P>
<P>
   Although he professes sympathy for Summers and Lipton, Krugman
has declared that Treasury/IMF rescue plans for Russia and
Indonesia, which the two men helped designed, are failures, and has
said that it is time to try something new.
</P>
<P>
   Although he insists he has no personal animus, Sachs has
launched withering attacks on the IMF, including work by Fischer,
charging that the agency has behaved ``rudely, abruptly, and
arrogantly'' and sought ``to do things to poor countries that we
would never do to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But before counting the Cambridge crowd out, said intellectual
historian Colander, it is important to remember that these are
among the few people who grasp how the global economy works _ and
that the process of conjuring theories, trying them out, and making
repairs is how international economic policy has always been made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last set of arguments they were making seem to have been
the wrong ones,'' said Colander. ``So they are all staking out new
positions to see who can be right next time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how they work,'' he said.

ART FOR WHOSE SAKE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A legal battle between Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and a
Lawrence, Mass.-based charitable trust seems, on the surface, the
kind of argument that flares up in preschool between two children
who want to play with the same ball.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of who controls a Monet masterpiece and 16
other paintings _ bequeathed in 1911 by the Rev. William E. Wolcott
of Lawrence to the trust but long displayed at the MFA _ raises
very adult, complex issues about the role of art in society, about
class and privilege, and about how to respect the deceased's wishes
while confronting a century of change.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees of the White Fund want to sell the paintings _ Monet's
``Field of Poppies near Giverny'' and two Pissarros, among them _
to pay for a wide array of arts projects in Lawrence, a move they
say is needed to fulfill Wolcott's last wishes. The works are
estimated to be worth between $5.7 million and $7.6 million _
enough to vastly expand the arts programs in struggling Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   The museum _ which has had posession of the painting for 86
years _ counters that if the paintings are sold, they will leave
Massachusetts and may end up in private collections never to be
exhibited again.
</P>
<P>
   Percolating up through the court filings and legal arguments are
the questions of which brings more value to the individual _ a
world-renowned museum or a community arts center? An Impressionist
masterpiece or being given the opportunity to paint?
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Lawrence, echoing the will of Wolcott, believe it
is the latter. The city, they say, gets little benefit from having
great paintings hanging in a museum 40 miles away. ``I don't think
there is a child in Lawrence who is familiar with the paintings,''
says the Rev. Juan P. Romero, who today preaches from the pulpit
that once belonged to Wolcott.
</P>
<P>
   Defining the true purpose of art is ``infinitely subjective in
nature,'' says James Mundy, director of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art
Center at Vassar College in New York. ``It is very difficult to
anticipate how art will affect an individual. Sometimes it happens
in completely serendipitous ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is standing in your line of sight when you are at a moment
open to enlightenment or intellectual breakthrough. It could be a
Monet on loan to the MFA, or it could be something local.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Rogers, the director of the MFA, says that the museum
serves ``an extraordinary community purpose that a small museum in
Lawrence simply cannot. The displays we do are so great _ how can I
put it? _ that they serve the whole of New England, including the
people of Lawrence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is one of the world's greatest encyclopedic art
museums. You weigh that with a community arts center, and I don't
know how you can do that ... They are very different. I do believe
that great museums with really great masterpieces offer
extraordinary opportunities for firsthand encounters with great
art. And great art has the capacity to refresh people spiritually,
physically and mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Hyde, a professor of art and politics at Kenyon College in
Ohio, says the dispute ``reproduces two traditions in the American
sense of the purposes of art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, there is the late 19th-century idea that fine
art produces fine manners, and that if we wish to have a durable
civilization we should imitate the European nations whose citizens
were governable ... precisely because their senses were gratified
by art. Rev. Wolcott, who gave the paintings under dispute to the
White Fund in Lawrence, belongs fully to this tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side, we have those whose hope it is to have the
past regularly judged by the needs of the present, and to have art
so judged as well. ... If a city like Lawrence had $6 million which
someone had given them to support the arts, certainly they would
not go out and buy a Monet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Lawrence's proposals) sound like fine ways to use the
money ... (It is) still part of the tradition in America that arts
are supposed to be used for something, like teaching manners,
rather than being valuable in their own right. It is the way in
which art is pitched: People become more creative if they are
trained in arts, whether they end up writing software or designing
automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   That paintings have created such a struggle does not surprise
Vassar's Mundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art can stimulate in so many different ways and illicit such
strong feelings,'' he says. ``It transcends itself in these ways
and brings out fascinating aspects of human character, or
institutional character and comportment. It is wonderful that
inanimate objects can spur you to all kinds of things. But I'd hate
to see a court fight over what is best for Lawrence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether what the trustees are doing is in the spirit of the
bequest is something the MFA should not play a role in. It seems to
me that is between the trustees and the people of Lawrence.'' The
MFA, for its part, says it is only trying to uphold the wishes of
Rev. Wolcott.
</P>
<P>
   Wolcott _ in an act that was as impressive for its magnanimity
as for its foresight and sensibility _ explicitly detailed in his
1907 handwritten will what he wanted to happen to the 17 paintings
he had inherited two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He said the paintings should go to the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston if _ and only if _ there was no ``public art gallery housed
in a fire-proof building'' in Lawrence, suitable to display the
works. When Wolcott died, there was no such gallery in Lawrence
and, in 1913, the paintings went to the MFA.
</P>
<P>
   But his will made clear that, even if the paintings hung in
Boston, ``ownership and control of the pictures shall be vested
permanently and inalienably in ... (White Fund Trustees) and their
successors.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ``My purpose in making this bequest is to create
and gratify a public taste for fine art, particularly among the
people of ... Lawrence. And I give to the said trustees of the
White Fund full and absolute authority in any contingency not fully
provided for ... to take such action as they judge best fitted to
serve the purpose described.''
</P>
<P>
   The MFA believes language in the will makes it impossible for
the paintings to be sold; the trustees say a sale must be
considered because having the paintings hang in Boston does little
to instill an appreciation of fine art in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, the three White trustees ``revisited
whether we are are doing our duty `to create and gratify a public
taste for fine art,''' says Thomas Caffrey, an attorney and current
chairman of the trustees.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, a move to sell the paintings met with a public
outcry. Indeed, there are some who still get great pride from the
knowledge that a mill town that has been in decline for much of the
20th century would ``own'' such things of value and beauty.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the trustees established a nine-person task
force, chaired by former attorney general James Shannon, to
determine what to do with the paintings. Their report recommends
selling the collection and using the windfall to establish within
the White Fund a separate trust known as the Wolcott Fund of the
Arts. Through grants, the fund would ``encourage the creation and
presentation of excellent art and art education in Lawrence.'' Part
of the money would be used to bolster struggling arts organizations
in Lawrence. And lastly, an arts resource center would be created
at the Lawrence Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   The MFA, according to Caffrey, is not receptive to this idea.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the MFA would like to buy the paintings? On April 30,
before seeking court permission to sell the paintings, White Fund
attorney Richard Renehan sent a letter to the MFA asking museum
officials if they were interested in purchasing any of the
paintings and at what price? The letter asked for a response within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's response came on May 13, when the MFA filed papers
in Suffolk Superior Court asking a judge to not only block the sale
of the paintings but to find that circumstances do not exist for
``possession of the Wolcott collection to be transferred from the
MFA to any other person or location.''
</P>
<P>
   The response took some by surprise and, to some observers,
reflected haughty disdain for the working people of Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not have to be a class issue, or a contentious issue
between the world renowned home of arts in Boston vs. a blue-collar
city, but some of that has crept into the discussion because of the
attitude the museum has taken,'' says Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Patricia McGovern, the former candidate for governor who
grew up in Lawrence, ``There are style differnces that are very
profound between the cities of Massachusetts like Lawrence and
folks from the cultural world of Boston. There are class
misunderstandings, but there are differences on both sides that
should be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people should get together and work through this so
the paintings could stay in Massachusetts and something wonderful
can happen for Lawrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, the Kenyon College art professor who specializes in the
funding of art, says that issues of class are very much at work in
this dispute. ``Museums like the MFA were created in the late 19th
century as part of the self-fashioning of a confident upper class.
I don't know how best to describe in terms of class `the people of
the city of Lawrence' as Wolcott calls them, except to say this is
not a city with the kind of extra cash that builds museums.''
</P>
<P>
   The MFA may have been founded by Boston Brahmins, but its
mission, says Rogers, has always been to educate. He notes that the
MFA has had programs with Lawrence schools since the 1980s. Last
year, some 700 Lawrence students visited the MFA. And he rejects
the portrait of the museum as an institution run by a silver spoon
set trying to hang on to a valuable Monet because it is, well ... a
valuable Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the church where Wolcott once preached has, for the
last 20 years, been the Iglesia de Dios de Lawrence. While the
church _ and the city _ has changed considerably since Wolcott's
death, the current pastor of the church, Romero, says the White
Fund Trustees are doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best service the paintings can do for the children of
Lawrence is not the present situation,'' says Romero. ``If the
museum wanted to search for what was in the heart of Rev. Wolcott,
they would do otherwise.''

UNDERAGE DRINKING A MAJOR CONCERN, STUDY FINDS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The public is so concerned about the social
consequences of teenage drinking that an overwhelming number would
support tougher restrictions on alcohol and higher alcohol taxes,
according to a new national survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, commissioned by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation,
found that 96 percent of the public is troubled by underage
consumption of alcohol. Concern is so great that large numbers of
respondents favor a wide range of get-tough policies, including
curbs on public drinking, strict controls on alcohol sales, and
higher alcohol taxes for prevention and treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-two percent would support raising alcohol taxes by 5
cents per drink, if the funds were used to pay for programs that
prevent minors from drinking and to increase alcohol treatment
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The report, being released today, indicates that most US adults
favor bans on televised liquor ads, billboard ads for alcohol, home
delivery of alcohol, and a zero-tolerance policy for underage
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Americans are not interested in returning to the days
of Prohibition, but this survey demonstrates that the American
public is concerned and wants to see policies put in place that
will help prevent our teenagers from drinking,'' said Nancy
Kaufman, vice president of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, a Massachusetts Democrat
and proponent of stronger alcohol controls since 1990, was
encouraged by the survey results.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings demonstrate broad-based support. Ordinary
Americans recognize that alcohol is now the number one killer of
people in this country under the age of 24,'' said Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has proposed limits on alcohol advertising, health
warnings on alcohol ads, the elimination of the tax deduction for
alcohol ads and promotions, and a ban on alcohol company compaigns
on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can ever get this legislation before the Congress as a
whole, we have always felt we would do very, very well,'' Kennedy
said. ``But the alcohol lobby has been able to stifle the ability
of us to ever get it to the House floor where people would have to
make a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, the support for stiffer policies
crossed political party, gender, and age lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Results show little distinction among those identified as
Democrat vs. Republican or liberal vs. conservative in their
support for tighter controls on alcohol sales and promotion,'' said
the report. ``Overall, Republicans were as likely to agree with
statements suggesting more social controls on alcohol sales and
youth access as were Democrats, and conservatives were as
supportive of stronger regulation as liberals.''
</P>
<P>
   Women, however, were even more supportive of stricter controls
on alcohol sales and promotion than men. Younger people, between
the ages of 18 and 24, were the least supportive of restrictive
alcohol policies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of the respondents said they had experience with
problem drinking because someone close to them or a family member
had a drinking problem in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found the most support for policies that would
restrict public drinking on city streets, parks, college campuses,
and at concerts and beaches, as well as require training for
servers and bar owners.
</P>
<P>
   The least support came for bans on happy hours, state control of
liquor sales, and beer keg sales.
</P>
<P>
   The report found the public receptive to policies making it more
difficult for teenagers to have access to alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is based on the responses of 7,021 people over seven
months in 1997. The sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage
points. It was conducted by Mathematica Policy Research Inc. under
the direction of the Alcohol Epidemiology program at the University
of Minnesota.

SO FAR, TELECOM ACT HAS ONLY HELPED A FEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, Calif. _ More than two years after deregulation, the
$200 billion telecommunications industry hasn't produced the riches
of services and price reductions it had promised for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say the pace of deregulation has been slower
than anticipated, in part because the regional Bells and other
carriers have not yet been allowed into the lucrative $80 billion
long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   In California, consumer groups and the state Public Utilities
Commission say competition has been stifled because Pacific Bell
has made it difficult for competitors to access its phone network
and customers. Pacific Bell still has a virtual monopoly on the
residential phone market.
</P>
<P>
   But deregulation has not bypassed all customers. The federal
Telecommunications Act of 1996, which in theory allows the
communications companies to get into one another's businesses over
time, unleashed a flood of technological advancements.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tobkin, of Bain &AMP; Co.'s telecommunications and technology
practice in San Francisco, said wealthy, technically-savvy
consumers are reaping the benefits of a deregulated marketplace
with services such as cable modems, digital television and
dedicated lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next five years, a lot's going to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Tobkin noted that consumers who don't need a lot of
technology in their lives _ or can't afford it _ won't see choices
and lower prices anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the average person with a phone on the kitchen wall,
things aren't going to change a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Covad Communications Group Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based
service provider formed after the telecom act was passed, is one
company that is not offering services to residential customers
because company officials say it is not profitable.
</P>
<P>
   What Covad and other new carriers concentrate on is selling
high-speed digital modem lines to small- and medium-sized
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no regional Bell operating company has been allowed to
offer long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80 communications executives met here last week at the 21st
Century Telecoms Company Global Executive Symposium. Those
attending the conference said that even though the Bells can't yet
offer long-distance service, they need not fret about competition
from other carriers. The regional Bells still control the lion's
share of local phone markets nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to dislodge the big players,'' said Robin
Gaster, head researcher for the Economist Intelligence Unit, which
hosted the conference with Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting. ``They're
big. They're tough. They have a lot of money and even more
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Hirschhorn, strategy director for Orange PLC, a global
satellite technology company in London, said new communications
providers should try to pay more attention to the consumer market
and the small office/home office, or SOHO, segment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people doing job-sharing, working out of
their homes,'' he said. ``There's an enormous demand to satisfy
that market.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschhorn said this market needs wireless and computer-service
providers in particular.

   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' or ``l'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-TILMAN-ECOLOGY (St. Paul, Minn.) _ A Scientist at Work
feature: G. David Tilman, an ecologist at the University of
Minnesota, has discovered that the more species there are in an
ecosystem (up to a point), the more productive, resilient and
stable it will be. This is a question of some importance for
conservation policy, given a running political debate over whether
it is important to preserve as many species as possible. But the
Tilman experiments may have an even more basic value to the young
science of ecology. He is bringing controlled experimentation to
the relatively young science through his work on a 9-square-mile
tract of prairie-savanna ecosystem. By William K. Stevens. (2200
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HAND-TRANSPLANT (Undated) _ The hand and forearm transplant
performed on an Australian man in France nearly two weeks ago ranks
among the most extraordinary cases in the annals of surgery, one
full of sudden plot twists, colorful characters and international
controversy. The hospital did not say that two days before the
13{-hour operation, the head of the surgical team learned from the
patient that he had a criminal record. An Australian newspaper
later reported that the patient was due in court to face seven
fraud charges. And far from losing his right hand in a logging
accident, as initial reports had it, Australian newspapers said he
lost it using a circular saw in a New Zealand jail. By Lawrence K.
Altman. (1900 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DEEP-SPACE-1 (Washington) _ The United States is about to
send an experimental probe into space to test some of the favorite
concepts of science fiction. The robot craft will be driven by an
advanced ion propulsion engine, will navigate through space on its
own and will occasionally call home to let people know how it is
doing. Called Deep Space 1, is one of the first missions designed
to send a spacecraft away from the Earth with technology testing,
and not science, as the main objective. By Warren E. Leary. (1650
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CAMBRIDGE-GENE (Cambridge, England) _ Ever since the
structure of DNA was discovered here in 1953, Cambridge has been a
leading world center for molecular biology. And with the help of a
recent bonanza from a long dead American pharmacist, Cambridge
scientists have become leading players in the effort to decipher
the human genome at the Sanger Center. By Nicholas Wade. (1750
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-RADIUM (Undated) _ This year is the 100th anniversary of the
Nobel-prize-winning experiments by Marie and Pierre Curie into the
origins of radioactivity, and their discovery of the radioactive
elements polonium and radium. But, like other discoveries, related
hazards were not discovered for several years _ and some tragedies
followed, including those involving the painters of
glow-in-the-dark watches. By Denise Grady. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-LAZARUS (Undated) _ Many people with AIDS who once were
near death but now are thriving with new medicines are are now
gripped by depression, acute anxiety _ especially over financial
issues _ and other, unexpected emotional problems, clinicians and
therapists said. Some patients have ended long-term romantic
relationships and others have become suicidal, an odd response to
being given a reprieve from death. Authorities are calling it the
Lazarus Syndrome. By David France. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Looking back at the first
Personal Computing column, it is clear 16 years later that buying a
computer is still a process of trying to understand the value of
imponderables like DVD, PCI, USB and a 100 megahertz bus. Once
consumers sift through all the jargon, the bottom line is that
Windows 98 will not run properly with less than 32 megabytes of
memory, and any serious user will install twice that much _ or 500
times the memory of the most powerful machines described in that
first Personal Computers column. By Rob Fixmer. (1350 words)

   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ This decade has seen a steady decline
in the proportion of Americans who regularly eat breakfast, long
considered ``the most important meal of the day.'' Countless
studies in recent decades have documented the value of breakfast to
a child's ability to learn, think quickly, pay attention and get
along well with others, including a far-reaching recent one. By
Jane E. Brody. (``l'' code)
</P>
<P>
   POSTPARTUM-SEX-HEALTH (Undated) _ Doctors routinely advise women
to refrain from sexual activity for several weeks following
childbirth, and for most women postpartum pain and exhaustion are
incentives enough to comply. But for those who do not follow
doctors' orders, the consequences can be serious and, in rare
cases, even fatal, according to a recent study. By Susan Gilbert.

CAUTION CAN PREVENT VIRUS WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HOYE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Has your computer felt well lately?
</P>
<P>
   Had a touch of the flu? Maybe a . . . virus?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we can joke all we want about computers and viruses. But
it's serious business, as proven by a recent survey conducted on
behalf of several major corporations, including Intel, Microsoft,
Price Waterhouse and Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Computer Virus Prevalence Survey, which was based on
interviews with about 300 technology professionals who oversee more
than 750,000 PCs and servers across the country, concluded that
computer virus infection rates are increasing.
</P>
<P>
   This despite the widespread availability of anti-virus software
and the fact that most new computers come loaded with anti-virus
software.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 survey found more than 86.5 ``virus encounters'' per
1,000 machines per year, which is an increase from last year's
finding of 62.5 encounters per 1,000 machines per year.
</P>
<P>
   The most prevalent viruses were of the ``macro'' variety, and
included WM/Concept, WM/CAP, WM/Wazzu, WM/Npad and XM/Laroux. Macro
viruses usually are written in Word Basic, and hide within
documents such as Microsoft Word files.
</P>
<P>
   The WM/Concept virus, alone, accounted for nearly four
infections per 1,000 computers per month, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Why are virus infection rates increasing? The survey blames a
number of factors, including inadequate policies in offices around
the country to guide workers in their daily use of computers and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   What's all this mean to the average computer user? Take
precautions, but don't panic.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you have a decent anti-virus program loaded and
running in the background on your machine. Opinions vary on which
is best. Top sellers include Norton's, Dr. Solomon's, F-Prot and
McAfee. There are others as well, including some cheap and/or free
solutions available online.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise caution. Be wary of downloading files or programs from
independent computer bulletin boards or no-name Web sites. Scan
floppies for viruses before using them. Configure your e-mail
program to put any incoming attached files where you can see them
(like on your desktop) and make sure you scan them for viruses
before opening them.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, this isn't anything to panic over. People get run
over by cars every day, but that doesn't stop anyone from crossing
the street. They've just learned to look both ways before stepping
foot off the sidewalk!
</P>
<P>
   If you want to read more about viruses, there are many Web sites
available, including ciac.llnl.gov/ or www.symantec.com/avcenter/. &QL;

New Mac OS to debut

Voyeur search update
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I wrote about a couple search sites that allow
visitors to watch what others are searching for.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I've received many e-mails about problems people are
having trying to connect with the sites.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   The first site is webcrawler &QL; 
.com/SearchTicker.html. As I said in the column, there is no
``www'' at the beginning. But people had trouble with the URL
because they did not use an upper case ``S'' and ``T'' in the term
``SearchTicker.'' That makes all the difference in the world. If
you use a lower case ``s'' and ``t,'' you will get an error message
telling you the page no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the second site was our fault. Somehow, we
managed to erase an all-important ``k'' in the URL. The proper Web
address is: www.mckinley.com/. Once there, look on the right side
of the screen for the search voyeur icon and link. That will take
you where you want to go. &QL;

BEING PARTISAN IN SUN CITY IS NO PICNIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The property owners association at Sun City West has a
hard and fast rule forbidding any political party or candidate from
using its recreation facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Association facility space WILL NOT be made available for rent
or use,'' the policy reads, ``by members of the Association for
partisan political purposes or activities (partisan is defined as
having a firm adherence to a party, faction, cause or person).''
</P>
<P>
   This particular restriction has been on the books for as long as
anyone can remember and is strictly enforced against all political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Except Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize when I moved here that people had such a
funny idea of democracy,'' said Bill Goldfarb. ``Now, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Goldfarb wanted to stage what he calls an
``old-fashioned Democratic Party picnic'' in Sun City West's
Beardsley Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to invite candidates from Paul Johnson (who's
running for governor) on down the line, including my sister-in-law
(Bunny Goldfarb), who's running for the state House,'' Goldfarb
said. ``We got turned down.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldfarb received a letter from the recreation manager stating,
``We are prohibited by our bylaws of the Sun City West Recreation
Center to allow meetings, picnics, events, etc., which address
anything of a political nature. Therefore, your request is
denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules are rules, Goldfarb figured.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't give it much thought until he received the October
newsletter of the property owners association, which announced on
the front cover, ``Governor Hull Comes to SCW.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Hull, a Republican, has been invited to speak
at the local rec center.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the center's manager determined that Hull's
appearance, less than a month before the election, could be
construed as being of ``a political nature'' and canceled the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, however, he was overruled by the governing
board.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Carole Hubbs explained it this way: ``Our
governor is our governor and that's not partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as the governor is Republican, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Hull is supposed to speak at Sun City West on Thursday. The
local Democratic Club has said it will picket the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked the registration rolls,'' Goldfarb told me,
``and all of the members of the board are Republicans. Is that how
it works? Is anything OK if you happen to be the party in charge?''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, yes.
</P>
<P>
   This not only explains why intelligent people can get away with
calling Jane Hull's appearance ``nonpartisan,'' but also why
President Bill Clinton will be impeached. It's not about rules;
it's about who enforces them. Or doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   At Sun City West, Hull will be introduced by Republican state
Sen. Ed Cirillo. The board also has agreed to allow Secretary of
State Betsey Bayless, another Republican running for office, to
speak at the rec center. Nothing partisan about that, organizers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week I spoke with Jerry Medford, a member of the
recreation board who also happens to be a Republican precinct
committeeman and president of the Sun City West Republican Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's not bringing out any brochures or raising any
funds, so I tend to lean that it's not partisan.'' he said. ``In my
opinion, it's showing respect for the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Medford knows how politics works. He's seen it firsthand, having
worked for a time as a Secret Service agent for President Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   I asked if he believed a politician like Hull would make a
speech within a month of an election that had nothing to do with
getting votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have a point there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so, one party gets to make speeches while the other can't
hand out hot dogs and beans. &UR; In case you didn't already know,
politics is no picnic. &QL;

BEING PARTISAN IN SUN CITY IS NO PICNIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The property owners association at Sun City West has a
hard and fast rule forbidding any political party or candidate from
using its recreation facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Association facility space WILL NOT be made available for rent
or use,'' the policy reads, ``by members of the Association for
partisan political purposes or activities (partisan is defined as
having a firm adherence to a party, faction, cause or person).''
</P>
<P>
   This particular restriction has been on the books for as long as
anyone can remember and is strictly enforced against all political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Except Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize when I moved here that people had such a
funny idea of democracy,'' said Bill Goldfarb. ``Now, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months back, Goldfarb wanted to stage what he calls an
``old-fashioned Democratic Party picnic'' in Sun City West's
Beardsley Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to invite candidates from Paul Johnson (who's
running for governor) on down the line, including my sister-in-law
(Bunny Goldfarb), who's running for the state House,'' Goldfarb
said. ``We got turned down.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldfarb received a letter from the recreation manager stating,
``We are prohibited by our bylaws of the Sun City West Recreation
Center to allow meetings, picnics, events, etc., which address
anything of a political nature. Therefore, your request is
denied.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules are rules, Goldfarb figured.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't give it much thought until he received the October
newsletter of the property owners association, which announced on
the front cover, ``Governor Hull Comes to SCW.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Hull, a Republican, has been invited to speak
at the local rec center.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the center's manager determined that Hull's
appearance, less than a month before the election, could be
construed as being of ``a political nature'' and canceled the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, however, he was overruled by the governing
board.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Carole Hubbs explained it this way: ``Our
governor is our governor and that's not partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as the governor is Republican, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Hull is supposed to speak at Sun City West on Thursday. The
local Democratic Club has said it will picket the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've checked the registration rolls,'' Goldfarb told me,
``and all of the members of the board are Republicans. Is that how
it works? Is anything OK if you happen to be the party in charge?''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, yes.
</P>
<P>
   This not only explains why intelligent people can get away with
calling Jane Hull's appearance ``nonpartisan,'' but also why
President Bill Clinton will be impeached. It's not about rules;
it's about who enforces them. Or doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   At Sun City West, Hull will be introduced by Republican state
Sen. Ed Cirillo. The board also has agreed to allow Secretary of
State Betsey Bayless, another Republican running for office, to
speak at the rec center. Nothing partisan about that, organizers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week I spoke with Jerry Medford, a member of the
recreation board who also happens to be a Republican precinct
committeeman and president of the Sun City West Republican Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's not bringing out any brochures or raising any
funds, so I tend to lean that it's not partisan.'' he said. ``In my
opinion, it's showing respect for the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Medford knows how politics works. He's seen it firsthand, having
worked for a time as a Secret Service agent for President Johnson.
</P>

</P>

   ``You may have a point there,'' he said.
</P>

hand out hot dogs and beans. &UR; In case you didn't already know,
politics is no picnic. &QL;

   ``It was so weird. It was really weird. Like really weird.'' _
Monica Lewinsky's vivid description to Linda Tripp of an encounter
with ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   This is ridiculous. They're ridiculous. We're ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Why was I so fascinated by the excerpts of conversations between
confidante Linda Tripp and blabbermouth Monica Lewinsky as they
scrolled across the newswire Friday? Why was I eagerly sifting
through the garbage of these transcripts and then sending choice
snippets to colleagues and friends?
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Just because you wear a red sweater does not mean you
have to wear red lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: I understand that.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: OK. I'm just trying to ...
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: I wouldn't ever wear red lipstick to see him.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Good.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't exactly Nixon and Haldeman discussing hush money and
cover-ups, now is it?
</P>
<P>
   Let's put this in another context. If you were sitting in a
restaurant and Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky were at the next
table, having these exact conversations, you'd be rolling your eyes
and yelping: ``CHECK!''
</P>
<P>
   Picture it now. Two unpleasant people, dominating and dragging
down the room. Tripp, sucking on a Marlboro Light and making a
circular hand-motion to the waiter, indicating she'd like another
vodka tonic for herself and a cosmopolitan for her friend;
Lewinsky, seething quietly because they were supposed to share the
creme brulee as a split dessert, but Linda totally monopolized the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   And they're yapping. Loudly discussing Monica's older, married
boyfriend, the one she calls ``the creep,'' among other nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   They're obsessed. Pathetic. Annoying. Obnoxious. Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: And then I'm gonna wear the navy dress I wore to the
radio address that still has the (REDACTED) on it for Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Well, how _ you're what, you're gonna get it cleaned?
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Oh, God.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: Well, I mean, like I haven't worn it for a year, you
know?
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: It's about time. Out with the old, you know?
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: Oh, that's too bad.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: I know ...
</P>
<P>
   TRIPP: See, I think I would suggest another outfit for the radio
address that makes you _ I mean, for the radio address _ for the
Thanksgiving that makes you look so beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   LEWINSKY: Well, that dress _ I don't care about pretty; I care
about thin. That's all I care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check PLEASE!'' I feel as if the entire country should be
calling for the check right now, trying to escape as quickly as
possible from the hellish feeding trough known as Washington, D.C.,
where they continue to work themselves into a dither over this
stupid affair. Enough!
</P>
<P>
   The legality of the conversations surreptitiously recorded by
Tripp still hasn't been established, but the ``public's right to
know'' has once again prompted the release of reams of supposed
evidence in Kenneth Starr's shameful investigation of the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, expect the Clinton camp to emerge as the
beneficiaries as the strategy backfires. Once again, expect an odd
groundswell of sympathy and support for the president and
especially the first lady in the wake of this release. Tripp's
plotting and Lewinsky's whining does nothing to enhance the
argument of those who favor impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that prospect seems increasingly ludicrous. What, the
country should be put on hold while government leaders hold
hearings in which they'll rehash the minute details of stained
dresses, cigars and sexual quirks _ and now these chirpy
conversations about lipstick and ``beard burn''?
</P>
<P>
   All those in favor of this entire mess going away forever, say
``Aye.''
</P>
<P>
   All those opposed, drive to the nearest food pantry,
unemployment office and/or under-equipped public school and explain
to the people there why this Starr investigation is so important.

ALONE WITH `ALONE,' OR WHAT `IS' IS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (Eds: Words in bold should be set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It depends on how you define  &UR; alone &LR; ,'' President Clinton told
the grand jury. At another point, he said, ``It depends on what the
meaning of the word  &UR; is &LR;  is.''
</P>
<P>
   Some readers and viewers, including Democratic congressional
leaders, found this ``legalistic parsing'' off-putting. To construe
words and tenses so narrowly, they felt, was trickily misleading,
deliberately deceptive or even perjurious. Those of us in the
language dodge, on the other hand, were delighted to see someone
demonstrating the glories of terminological exactitude.
</P>
<P>
   To millions of schoolchildren, the word  &UR; tense &LR;  meant only how
you felt before a pop quiz. Now its grammatical sense comes into
its newsworthy own with what  &UR; is &LR;  is.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had (past tense) a sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, the president replied under oath and later to
interviewers ``there's no sexual relationship,'' with that elided
`` &UR; s &LR; ''capable of being construed as  &UR; is &LR;  or  &UR; was &LR; . Unless asked
afterward, ``Was there ever'' (past tense) or ``Has there been''
(past perfect), he could say that he was telling the literal truth
_ that no relationship was taking place at that moment.
</P>
<P>
   The present third-person singular of the verb ``to be'' comes
from the Latin  &UR; esse &LR; , as in Bishop George Berkeley's  &UR; esse est
percipi &LR; , ``to be is to be perceived.'' It's a short jump from
 &UR; esse &LR;  to  &UR; is &LR; . Clinton's formulation of ``what  &UR; is &LR;  is'' lends
itself to metaphysical discussions about being and essence, and
will surely be the title of tracts about virtual reality in the age
of image.
</P>
<P>
   Since so much depends on how we define  &UR; alone &LR; , let's take a
crack at it. The word is an odd combination of  &UR; all &LR;  and  &UR; one &LR; ; to
say ``all alone'' is to be redundant. The original meaning is
``wholly one'' _ that is, ``unaccompanied; absolutely by oneself''
_ as in Shakespeare's ``Julius Caesar'' when Brutus says, ``Good
countrymen, let me depart alone.''
</P>
<P>
   A seeming oxymoron is  &UR; alone together &LR; , which is what was asked
of Clinton. In the Paula Jones deposition, he said he did not
remember being alone with Ms Lewinsky; in his grand-jury testimony,
he admitted nine occasions when they were together unobserved by
others.
</P>
<P>
   His secretary, Betty Currie, gave the meaning a stretch when she
said, ``the president, for all intents and purposes, is never
alone. ... There's always somebody around him.'' In current usage
 &UR; alone with &LR;  means ``unobserved by a third party.''
</P>
<P>
   Euphemism entered the testimony at least twice, once
deceptively, once in a kindly way. In answering a question about
what a prosecutor called ``phone sex,'' Clinton admitted to
``inappropriate sexual  &UR; banter &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The etymology of  &UR; banter &LR;  is a mystery. Jonathan Swift, in the
introduction to his ``Tale of a Tub,'' wrote in 1710 that this bit
of slang ``was first borrowed from the bullies in White Friars,
then fell among the footmen, and at last retired to the pedants.''
Originally used to mean ``raillery, ridicule,'' it softened in time
to a sense of ``good-humored teasing'' or ``joking dialogue, merry
jesting.'' It never had, and does not now have, a connotation of
sex talk.
</P>
<P>
   The gentling quality of euphemism came in reference to Ms
Lewinsky's report of Clinton's denial of an affair with another
White House aide. The president was quoted as referring to the
other woman as  &UR; small-breasted &LR; . A generation ago, the lack of an
impressive bosom was often derided as  &UR; flat-chested &LR; ; the current
use, as indicated in the testimony, is both more anatomically
accurate and less cruel and pejorative.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sensitivity to the nuance of language was exhibited in
his answer to questions about an episode at a White House gate in
which a Secret Service officer revealed to Ms Lewinsky that another
woman was in the Oval Office with the president. A prosecutor
asked, ``Weren't you  &UR; irate &LR; ?'' The president responded, ``What I
remember was being  &UR; upset &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Irate &LR;  is rooted in the Latin  &UR; irasci &LR; , ``to be angry,'' which
also spawned  &UR; ire &LR;  and  &UR; irascible &LR; . At the low end of  &UR; irate &LR; 's
meaning is ``wrathful'' and at the high end is ``incensed,'' one
stop short of ``enraged.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who knew his reaction had already been the subject
of testimony by his aides, did not want to admit to anger that
could be interpreted as leading to a threat to fire an agent. Hence
his admission only to being  &UR; upset &LR; , from the Middle English
 &UR; upsetten &LR; , which originally meant ``toppled, overturned,'' but
which in this modern extension of the metaphor means ``disturbed,''
more worried or annoyed than angered or  &UR; irate &LR; . A person who is
irate strikes fear into others; one who is  &UR; upset &LR;  evokes sympathy
from them.
</P>
<P>
   The president used a similar term to accuse his accusers of
``trying to  &UR; set me up &LR;  and trick me.'' A prosecutor countered by
asking if he thought he had the right to commit perjury ``because
you think the case was a political case or a  &UR; setup &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The slang term had its origin in 1880 regarding free drinks, and
later as the ice-and-soda fixings needing only a shot of booze to
turn into a highball.
</P>
<P>
   The entrapment sense (made famous by the Washington Mayor Marion
Barry's cry, ``the bitch set me up!'' which soon appeared on
T-shirts in the nation's capital) appears closely associated with
boxing. In 1926,  &UR; setups &LR;  were defined in Herst's International as
``has-beens or never-wases who get paid to stand up just long
enough to be knocked out.''
</P>
<P>
   A further development of the idea _ to make an opponent
vulnerable to a knockout blow _ was expressed by the former
heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey in 1950: ``If you can land
solidly with a straight left or with a left hook, you'll generally
knock your opponent off balance, at least, and `set him up' for a
potshot with your right.''
</P>
<P>
   The extended metaphor of this fighting image, now meaning ``to
entrap or ensnare,'' was the sense used by both witness and
prosecutor in the historic Clinton testimony.

   &UR; Butterflies' Energy  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. With its small body mass, how does a monarch butterfly obtain
enough energy to migrate 1,800 miles?
</P>
<P>
   A. The energy is gathered from nectar, and the butterflies that
make the trip, those born in the early fall, are able to convert
nectar into fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those born in September know to tank up on nectar,'' said Dr.
David Marriott, founder of the Monarch Program, a nonprofit
research and education organization based in Encinitas, Calif.
``Their abdomens get really large.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other generations, these monarchs, he explained, have
a little area of fatty tissue where the sugar of the nectar is
converted into fat. They can live off this cushion in winter and
need only water to rehydrate their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Monarchs born in September or late August live seven or eight
months, sometimes nine, Marriott said. Their children,
grandchildren and great-grandchildren live just a month. ``By the
time you get to the great-great-grandchildren it puts us back to
September again,'' Marriott continued.
</P>
<P>
   The butterflies also feed while migrating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's migrating population will be as much as 50 percent
smaller than last year's, Marriott said, but last year saw more
monarchs than ever before recorded. Their current ranks have been
reduced by disease. Information for the public on observing the
migration is available from the Monarch Program at (760) 944-7113.

MILITARY UNREADY, CLINTON TO BLAME  
 (THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE OCT. 5 ARIZONA REPUBLIC)

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - As the massacre of ethnic Albanians continues in
Kosovo, as blood and glass are cleaned from the streets of the West
Bank city of Hebron, as Iraq stands resolute against U.N. weapons
inspectors, the U.S. military is in its worst shape in decades.
</P>
<P>
   How else do you explain Gen. Thomas Schwartz, the new head of
the U.S. Army Forces Command, telling the Senate Armed Services
subcommittee on readiness that the military's readiness to wage war
has slipped badly under tight budgets and ``the train wreck is
imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   And, that testimony was followed by a presentation from Col. Jim
Green, director of assignments at the personnel center at Randolph
Air Force Base near San Antonio, who told senators, ``I'd say we're
going to a situation that is four times worse than we've ever seen
in the history of our modern Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Air Force expects to lose 1,951 pilots by 2002,
reducing its strength to about 11,000 pilots. More than a third of
those leaving will be fighter pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Now the president himself is suggesting budget increases to
address aging weapons and to improve the living conditions for U.S.
troops.
</P>
<P>
   So, pardon us if we ask, how did we get into this mess in the
first place?
</P>
<P>
   Who was minding the store as our military preparedness was being
carted out the back door?
</P>
<P>
   To whom do we look for responsibility for this crisis?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the commander in chief _ the very same fellow who is
taking bows for our robust economy?
</P>
<P>
   We don't mind the bows, even though the Clinton administration
neglects to mention Congress and the Federal Reserve Board _ and
the American worker _ when taking credit for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   What we do mind, and, indeed, what should disturb most
Americans, is that Bill Clinton owes us all one more apology for
what he has done to the national defense. &QL;

AMAZING `ANTZ' DOESN'T BOTHER APPEALING TO KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many of the journalistic fall film previews, you could find
someone from DreamWorks saying something like this about ``Antz'':
``It's not a cute cartoon. It's an action-adventure movie.''
Translation: ``Everyone expects a cute cartoon, so we'd better do
some spin-doctoring before we take a bath at the box office.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks has reason to worry. ``Antz'' succeeds more for what
its makers want it to do than for what its audience might want it
to do. There's something admirable about that these days, when most
movies play to the lowest common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   And it still delivers, in many ways. It looks stunning. Strike
that _ it looks amazing. The all-insect cast has a level of
expressiveness that it seems to have learned from E.T., the master
at such things, and the backgrounds are so richly detailed that the
movie should win an Oscar nomination for production design, if
that's possible with an animated movie. Teens and adults will also
get off on the film's grown-up jokes and sly film references.
</P>
<P>
   What the movie has to offer younger children _ who will make up
a sizable portion of the audience _ is another matter. Expressive
as these critters are, they're not really all that cute, because
they look like ... well, ants, and sort of science-fiction ants at
that. The movie eschews original songs in favor of oldies and
standards, and except for the show-closing (and inevitable) ``High
Hopes,'' they sound like they'd appeal to Woody Allen (who voices
Z, the film's hero) more than they would to preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   There's more action than slapstick, and although the battle
scenes are almost as impressive as the ones in Disney's ``Mulan,''
there isn't enough cuteness or humor to balance them out. They're
also relatively gruesome _ with Allen in the lead role, sensitive
types might think they're watching ``Saving Private Wry Ant.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the movie's
individual-against-the-state-and-against-conformity plot. How long
has it been since you saw a family film that felt like a
collaboration between George Orwell and Ayn Rand? Not that Z is a
Randian man _ or ant _ of action. For one thing, he speaks in
Allen's neurotic New York whine; for another, the first time we
meet him, he's talking to his analyst _ a nice in-joke for all the
adults in the audience, as well as the 4-year-olds who like to
double up ``The Lion King'' with ``Annie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Z isn't a take-charge guy so much as he is a guy who lets events
sweep him along. He drones on disenchantedly about his life as a
worker, but does little to change his lot until bored Princess Bala
(Sharon Stone) goes slumming with the lower ants and hits on Z
because he's the only guy not following the crowd. Z falls for her
instantly, and his crush begins a journey that leads to him being
an inadvertent war hero and a reluctant outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   Because DreamWorks honcho Jeffrey Katzenberg was able to round
up the actors who directors Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson wanted,
the movie feels if it were cast first, then scripted. The cast is
so star-heavy, ``Antz'' feels like the ``We Are the World'' of
animation. Not only does Allen play a lucky neurotic and Stone play
a vampish princess, but Sylvester Stallone (who nearly steals the
film) portrays a buff soldier ant (who, true to Stallone form,
takes a beating) and Gene Hackman plays a power-mad general.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Christopher Walken, as the evil sidekick who talks
... in a series of ... eccentric ... pauses, and Jennifer Lopez as
a worker ant with a great ovipositor. Only Dan Aykroyd and Jane
Curtin, as preppy bees, seem to be playing characters rather than
playing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's pro-individualism theme is a bit ironic, coming from
a company whose motto might be ``What would Disney do?'' (Come to
think of it, there's some messianic subtext going on here, too.)
Well, Disney wouldn't toy this much with a tried-and-true formula,
and you have to give DreamWorks some credit for taking risks.
Disney would have more cute characters, Disney would have more
songs, Disney would have more comic relief, Disney would cut back
on the language, some of which is surprisingly strong. Disney would
probably make more money. But Disney would also try to satisfy
everybody, and DreamWorks _ and directors Darnell and Johnson _
deserve some congratulations for not compromising their vision.

ROBIN WILLIAMS' JOURNEY FROM HEAVEN TO HELL LACKS ORIGINALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being in heaven alone, without the one you love _ that would be
hell, wouldn't it? It's a great idea for a movie, and ``What Dreams
May Come'' uses this thought as its story. Director Vincent Ward, a
New Zealander with a silvery visual aptitude, has made this theme
his own province in previous work _ he seems to seek it out.
</P>
<P>
   In his film ``Map of the Human Heart,'' he featured a
protagonist who had a taste of heaven and had it snatched it away.
That also happens to Chris (Robin Williams), who meets the woman he
falls in love with while sailing alone _ and his heaven on earth
begins immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After losing their two children in a car accident, Chris and his
wife (Annabella Sciorra) slump into lives of quiet misery. Then
Chris dies while helping at the site of a car crash. (It's the best
scene in ``Dreams''; Ward's ability for shifting mood swiftly
serves him well here.)
</P>
<P>
   Working with a group of technical wizards, Ward has found a way
to create a screen tableau that looks like an Impressionist
painting that hasn't quite dried. It's a visualization of an
incomplete heaven _ Chris' wife was a painter, and he's plopped
down into a realization of one of her paintings.
</P>
<P>
   But before long, ``What Dreams May Come'' settles into an almost
morbid sentimentality. A blurry presence trying to help Chris
reconcile himself to the idea of being dead turns out to be Albert
(Cuba Gooding Jr.), his medical school mentor. (Although at first,
Gooding sounds so much like Michael Jackson that you think his idea
of heaven may be an episode of ``Pop-Up Video.'')
</P>
<P>
   The first section of the movie drips Nutrasweet from time to
time, but you have no preparation for the gooeyness that rolls out
in waves after that. With bodies floating and gamboling as huge,
light-splashed stairs and arches loom in the distance, heaven looks
like the McDonald's at the Mall of America.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris' wife kills herself, he discovers that she's going to
hell _ not just because she's a suicide, but because hell is the
place for people who haven't forgiven themselves, which, of course,
explains why heaven turns out to be so empty.
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Albert, along with a guide (Max von Sydow), make the
journey to reclaim Chris' wife from hell. They pass through horrid
spots that make the voyage a religious version of a mixed metaphor:
They sail over a river full of lost souls, themselves rendered in
black and white, that seems like the River Styx as re-created for
an Obsession ad.
</P>
<P>
   Their boat is appropriately named Cerberus, and you can't help
wondering whether Chris knows of von Sydow's having played Death in
Bergman movies.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's such a need for comparisons because ``Dreams''
seems so second-hand, despite fitful moments of originality. Those
brief, unique moments _ be it a damp, painted Dreamland, or Chris'
last view of his kids driving away, both shimmery and sad, or an
expanse of land that turns out to be made out of faces (purgatory)
_ make the prevailing lumpiness all the more frustrating. Ward's
talents don't include consistency, which is his biggest problem in
``Dreams,'' an inoffensive, suburban turn on ``Paradise Lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matheson, from whose novel the movie comes, has also
written about loss and the journey back to acceptance with more a
bent toward science fiction than we see here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreams'' is supposed to be about resilience, but there are so
many crinkly faces smiling through the tears that it feels
unremitting in its winsomeness. Williams plays it mostly straight
here. He's a nice guy, too nice to be so driven. Everyone in the
movie is very nice, so it robs the actors of weight.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dreams,'' heaven drifts slowly _ very slowly _ into the
Talking Heads definition, a place where nothing ever happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come'' is rated PG-13 for adult language and
scenes of violence and death.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Dinosaurs: No Butting &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The notion that dome-headed dinosaurs butted heads in some sort
of violent social ritual has been around since the 1950s, when a
paleontologist noticed a passing resemblance between the dinosaurs'
thick skulls and those of a modern-day head-banger, the bighorn
sheep.
</P>
<P>
   But new analysis of fossil remains of the beasts, collectively
known as pachycephalosaurs (pronounced pak-ee-SEFF-uh-low-sores),
shows that head-butting of the kind popularized in lay books on
dinosaurs would probably have been suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, say the researchers, from the University of
California at Berkeley and the Milwaukee Public Museum, the skull
of a pachycephalosaur lacks something that bighorn sheep have:
air-filled chambers to help cushion a blow. Worse yet, the
dinosaur's skull has a honeycomb of vascular canals that would
concentrate any force on the creature's golf-ball sized brain.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that pachycephalosaurs may have gently
nudged heads in a kind of love tap. But a more violent tete-a-tete
would have been a bone-headed thing for a dome-headed dinosaur to
do.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Telltale Footprints  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They may not have been butting heads, but dinosaurs were
trudging across the North Slope of Alaska about 100 million years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A team of faculty and students from the University of Alaska has
uncovered tracks of five kinds of dinosaurs in the foothills of the
Brooks Range. The footprints are at least 25 million years older
than any other fossil beds farther north, and are strong evidence
of dinosaur migration from Asia to North America.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Georges Aftermath &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges may not have caused as much devastation to New
Orleans and other Gulf cities as expected, but it practically wiped
out the Chandeleur Islands, low barrier islands that are major
wintering grounds for redhead ducks, researchers with the United
States Geological Survey said.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial photographs taken of the Chandeleurs last week, several
days after the storm, show much of the land under water, with
vegetation swept away and dunes destroyed. A lighthouse that had
been standing on land is now 400 yards from the nearest dry patch
of earth.
</P>
<P>
   The islands, about 30 miles south of Biloxi, Miss., are a winter
home to about 20,000 redhead ducks, who find shelter in beds of
shoalgrass. The researchers believe that many of the beds are now
buried, but will conduct more surveys soon.

   &UR; Anti-Freeze for Tobacco &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists in England have isolated a protein that acts as a
kind of anti-freeze in carrots and have used it to alter a variety
of tobacco genetically to make it more resistant to cold.
</P>
<P>
   The protein is believed to function by interacting with the
surface of small ice crystals, preventing them from growing so
large that they destroy the plant. Similar anti-freeze proteins
have been identified in fish. But the researchers, writing in the
journal Nature, note that attempts to splice fish proteins into
tobacco have not been successful.

PERSONAL HEALTH: CHILDREN WHO SKIP BREAKFAST PAY A HIGH PRICE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's that no-time-in-the-morning time of year again. The kids
are back in school, parents are back to work and breakfast in many
households has become a catch-as-catch-can affair, if it is eaten
at all. This decade has seen a steady decline in the proportion of
Americans who regularly eat breakfast, long considered ``the most
important meal of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Though you may not think so as you hit the snooze alarm to catch
a few more winks of morning sleep, it would pay to get up 15
minutes earlier to make time for a nutritious breakfast. A sweet
roll or bagel and coffee from a nearby deli is not an adequate
breakfast. Nor is a so-called breakfast bar or Pop Tart or bag of
chips munched on the way to school. These may temporarily suppress
hunger pangs, but they will do little to enhance brain function and
mood, not to mention nutritional status and overall health.
</P>
<P>
   Given what most Americans call breakfast, a fast-food sandwich
is actually an improvement even though it is likely to be much
higher in fat, salt and calories than, say, cereal with fruit and
low-fat or skim milk.
</P>
<P>
   Countless studies in recent decades have documented the value of
eating breakfast to a child's ability to learn, think quickly, pay
attention and get along well with others. In a report last month in
the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Dr. J. Michael
Murphy of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and his
co-authors assessed the effects of eating school breakfast on the
academic and emotional functioning of more than 100 children in
inner-city elementary schools in Baltimore and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   When school breakfast was made available to all children
regardless of family income, the number of youngsters who ate it
doubled, giving the researchers an opportunity to measure the
results before and after. They found that those who often ate
school breakfast got higher grades in math and were less likely to
be described as depressed, anxious or hyperactive by parents or
teachers. In addition to improving in these psychological
dimensions, those youngsters who started eating breakfast under the
universal feeding program improved their math grades, school
attendance and punctuality.
</P>
<P>
   Children who regularly eat breakfast think faster and clearer,
solve problems more easily and are less likely to be fidgety and
irritable early in the day. Recent studies show that children who
skip breakfast are not as adept at selecting the information they
need to solve problems. Ability to recall and use new information,
verbal fluency and attentiveness are hurt by hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies showed similar effects of skipping breakfast
among teen-agers and adults. Over all, breakfast skippers were less
productive and handled tasks less efficiently than those who ate
breakfast. Among both young and elderly adults, skipping breakfast
impaired memory and mental performance.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a scientist to realize that it is hard to
concentrate on mental challenges and to maintain a pleasant,
patient demeanor when your growling stomach signals a fall in blood
glucose that follows an overnight fast or the consumption of only a
sweet food or coffee or both. The brain runs on glucose, and when
the supply runs low, it is forced to depend on stored fat, a less
efficient source of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Performance questions aside, the goal of many breakfast skippers
is to save on calories. However, calories consumed early in the day
are least likely to put on pounds, and skipping any meal simply
increases the temptation to eat a high-calorie snack or overeat at
the next meal. In fact, the leanest people tend to be those who eat
three or more meals a day.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of nutrients. Breakfast may be the only
time during the day when a child or adult consumes fruit juice and
milk, making this meal an important source of vitamins C and D and
calcium. Studies of teen-agers have shown that those who skip
breakfast have an intake of calcium and vitamin C that is 40
percent lower and an iron intake that is 10 percent lower than
those who eat breakfast. These nutrients are most critical during
the years of growth and development. Further, given the demands of
modern lives, breakfast may be the only meal teen-agers regularly
eat at home and the only one over which parents might have some
say.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, breakfast should supply one-quarter to one-third of the
day's protein plus fiber-rich complex carbohydrates and a small
amount of fat. The breakfasts served in school generally strive to
meet most, if not all, these nutrient needs. Simple homemade meals
that fulfill these criteria include a whole-grain cereal (cold or
hot) with fruit and low-fat or skim milk; low-fat or nonfat yogurt
with fruit and whole-wheat bread with jam or margarine; a shake
made with yogurt, fruit and skim milk plus whole-wheat toast, or a
turkey, cheese or peanut butter sandwich on whole-grain bread with
fruit juice and milk.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should provide a good example by eating breakfast
themselves. Children are most likely to eat breakfast if someone
eats with them. If that is not possible, at least try to sit with
children while they eat.
</P>
<P>
   In families where mornings are already overly loaded with
demands, it helps to set up breakfast the night before. When my
sons were young and I had to get out early, I often made them
sandwiches for breakfast or set up pita pizzas they could pop into
the toaster oven in the morning. If the boys were running late,
they could eat these foods on the way to school.
</P>
<P>
   But on most days, breakfast was eaten at home. Sometimes I
cooked French toast or pancakes in advance to be heated in the
morning and topped with sliced bananas or berries and yogurt.
Another make-ahead favorite was ``Eggs Jane'' _ poached egg white
and turkey on a whole-wheat pita topped with a slice of cheese,
ready to heat in the toaster oven in the morning. Although hot
cereal doesn't lend itself to advance preparation, it takes only
two minutes (and no pots to wash) to cook quick oats with skim milk
and raisins in the microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, school-age children can serve themselves ready-to-eat
breakfast cereal. But it is up to parents to assure that the
selection of cereals in the house is nutritious. The best cereals
are well-stocked with nutrients and fiber and not overly rich in
sugars or fats. Don't be misled by claims that a serving supplies
100 percent of lots of vitamins and minerals, since there is no
need for anyone to consume the day's nutrient needs at breakfast.
Look instead for whole grain cereals with no more than 6 grams of
sugar per serving. Among good choices that young taste buds are
likely to enjoy are Wheaties, Cheerios, Wheat Chex and Raisin Bran,
perhaps with a sweeter cereal like Life or granola as a garnish.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who can't bear to eat first thing in the morning,
try a glass of juice and piece of bread before leaving home with a
portable breakfast (like a container of yogurt or sandwich) to eat
later when hunger strikes, often just before the school or work day
starts.

RARE RISK FROM SEX AFTER CHILDBIRTH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN GILBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors routinely advise women to refrain from sexual activity
for several weeks after childbirth, and for most women postpartum
pain and exhaustion are incentives enough to comply. But for those
who do not follow doctors' orders, the consequences can be serious
and, in rare cases, even fatal.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of The Postgraduate Medical Journal, a
publication of the British Medical Association, doctors describe
two young women who died while having intercourse within eight days
of giving birth. Both had had normal vaginal deliveries and died of
air embolisms, air bubbles in the major arteries to the heart and
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Death during intercourse is rare and occurs mainly in
middle-aged men with heart disease, said Dr. Philip Batman, the
lead author, who is a pathologist at Bradford Hospitals National
Health Service Trust in Bradford, England. What led him to
investigate such deaths in pregnant women and new mothers, he said,
``was the coincidence of seeing two women in the same small town in
Yorkshire die of embolisms during intercourse in the last three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said women were more vulnerable to air embolisms soon after
childbirth than at other times, because air forced into the uterus
during sex can enter the bloodstream through blood vessels that
were torn during delivery. Earlier research found that pregnant
women are also at increased risk because air can become trapped
between the sac containing the fetus and the uterus wall, then
escape through blood vessels on the surface of the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing the records of more than 20 million pregnant women
from 1967 to 1993, Batman and colleagues found that 18 had died
from air embolisms during pregnancy or soon after childbirth. At
least four of these women died while having sex, though Batman said
they could not determine the exact number. One of the four had
taken amphetamines, which could have contributed to her death, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are no statistics on maternal deaths during sex in
the United States, there are a handful of recent reports in the
medical literature, all involving pregnant women. But since the
risk is extremely slim, most doctors sanction intercourse during
pregnancy, said Dr. Sharon Phelan, a spokeswoman for the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and an associate
professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Alabama
School of Medicine in Birmingham. ``The only time a doctor might
tell a woman not to have intercourse is if she's had a number of
preterm births,'' she said, explaining that intercourse can touch
off contractions and then premature labor.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors used to recommend that women avoid sex for six weeks
after childbirth, but the rules have been relaxed in recent years
with the realization that six weeks is an arbitrary time frame and
that many women probably disregard the advice anyway, said Dr.
Joshua Copel, chief of the high-risk obstetrics group at the Yale
School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Literature from the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists states that women can usually have sexual intercourse
``in about three or four weeks,'' or when they feel comfortable, a
sign that the uterus has healed. Obstetricians say that it also
takes about this long for incisions outside the vagina or from a
Caesarean section to heal.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest risks of having sex too soon are not fatal
complications but tears in the incisions or infections in the
uterus caused by bacteria on the sperm, doctors say.

   &UR; Pinpointing Lymph Nodes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A new procedure may allow surgeons to reduce the number of lymph
nodes removed in breast cancer surgery, sparing women some pain and
possible complications.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors routinely remove the lymph nodes around the armpit in
case breast cancer has spread to them. Removing the nodes may
improve the patient's chances of survival. The presence of cancer
there also tells doctors how aggressively to use cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In a study reported in the current New England Journal of
Medicine, doctors from the University of Vermont injected
radioactive material around the tumor and then removed only the
nodes that eventually absorbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quick and easy to precisely locate the node before ever
making an incision. That's the key advantage,'' said Dr. David
Krag, who helped develop the technique.
</P>
<P>
   Krag trained 11 other surgeons to use the method. They reported
the results of testing on 443 patients.

 &HT;    BLACK, HISPANIC LEADERS BLAST SOCIAL SECURITY PRIVATIZATION
STUDY
 &HT;    650&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Black and Hispanic leaders Monday criticized a
study that claimed minorities would fare better under a privatized
retirement system than under the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Julian Bond, chairman of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and Raul
Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, were the
latest in a rising chorus that has criticized claims by the
conservative Heritage Foundation that blacks and Hispanics would do
better if they were able to invest their retirement payments in
personally managed accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bond noted that many of the individuals and groups advocating
privatization are the same ones that originally opposed Social
Security, civil rights legislation, and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's evident that many ... of the people arguing for
privatization are the same people who have been arguing against
protections for racial minorities,'' Bond said. ``We naturally view
them with suspicion and are not surprised when our suspicions are
borne out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzaguirre said La Raza has not taken a position on the issue of
privatization, but is concerned that the Heritage study may have
overestimated the ability of the Hispanic community _ which is the
lowest-paid and least-educated minority group _ to benefit from
individually managed investments.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage officials defended their study, issued last January,
which suggested that because blacks have a shorter life expectancy
than whites, they pay proportionately higher Social Security taxes
and receive fewer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Although it noted that Hispanics receive a higher rate of return
than whites, it argued that because Hispanics are relatively
younger than the rest of the population, they would bear a higher
taxation rate in the future to keep Social Security solvent.
</P>
<P>
   William Beach, director of the Heritage Foundation's Center for
Data Analysis and co-author of the study, said he was ``personally
offended'' by Bond's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I marched in the civil rights movement behind Julian Bond. I
marched against the Vietnam War right behind Julian Bond,'' Beach
said, adding that he and other Heritage officials had ``a lot of
support for what he did in his youth. I'm outraged by his comments,
but that's politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond and Yzaguirre spoke at a news conference hosted by the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research center
that issued a detailed report criticizing the methodology and
conclusions in the Heritage study.
</P>
<P>
   Kilolo Kijakazi, (CQ) who wrote the Center's report, argued that
the Heritage study was seriously flawed because it overestimated
the payroll taxes paid by blacks and underestimated their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from an earlier analysis by the Office of the Social
Security Actuary, Kijakazi said the Heritage study assumed that a
20-year-old black male would pay retirement taxes for 45 years,
while the Social Security administration assumed he would pay an
average of 39.1 years. Meanwhile, Heritage assumed that upon
retiring he would live to receive benefits for 2.2 years compared
to the 8.1 years predicted by the Social Security administration.
</P>
<P>
   Kijakazi also argued that the Heritage study did not account for
the cost of covering current retirees _ whose benefits are paid by
current workers _ while switching to a system in which today's
workers invest for their own future retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The Heritage study also omitted the administrative costs of
managing individual retirement accounts, she said, noting a study
by Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution which concluded that up
to 20 percent of personal investments would be lost in
administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real winners would be the investment firms that stand to
gain billions'' of dollars from private investments, Kijakazi said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Beach said after the news conference that his plan would promote
wealth within the black and Hispanic communities, which are now
prevented from accumulating wealth because of the high rate of
payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The center's report is the latest is a flurry of position papers
in which advocates and critics of privatizing the nation's
retirement system have predicted its effect on the working poor,
who are disproportionately black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Cato Institute _ a libertarian research center
that has been leading the effort to shift from Social Security to
personal retirement accounts _ issued a report declaring the poor
could build greater savings and enjoy larger retirement benefits
through individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, the American Association of Retired Persons'
Public Policy Institute issued a report criticizing the Heritage
report for ignoring the risks and administrative cost of private
investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how low-income workers _ primarily minorities _
would fare under a privatized system versus the current system is
one of the fundamental issues facing policy makers and lawmakers
who are attempting to reform the program now in order to avert a
major disruption in retirement security three decades from now.
</P>
<P>
   The latest prediction by the Social Security trustees is that if
no changes are made, the system would be unable to fully pay
benefits by 2032 as the ranks of retirees, swelled by the Baby Boom
generation, virtually doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a general consensus that the rich would do
better under a system of private personal accounts, there is
widespread disagreement over whether the poor would fare likewise.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address last January, President
Clinton called for a year-long study of the Social Security program
to be capped this December by a White House conference that would
lead to legislative recommendations for Congress. However, with the
president embroiled in possible impeachment proceedings, lawmakers
of both parties have questioned whether that schedule will be met.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development Monday, Sen. Rod Grams, R-Minn.,
announced he would introduce a bill this week to allow workers to
shift 10 percent of their 12.4 percent payroll tax _ including the
amount contributed by employers _ to a private retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Several other bills have been introduced that would shift a
portion of the payroll tax to private accounts. None are scheduled
to be considered before Congress adjourns this month.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ William and Mary Alice Peak sank their life
savings into a $100,000 motor home with a dream of spending summers
at their lakeside camp in New York state, and winters driving
across the South.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Peaks, that dream became a white-knuckle nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Their motor home was an overweight behemoth, so overloaded that
its tires blew, its brakes burned, and its transmission smoked.
Fearful of losing control of the nearly 10-ton coach, Peak took the
overdrive switch off the dashboard and moved it to the steering
column so that he could keep both hands on the wheel as much as
possible. Mary Alice would follow in the car with their luggage to
keep the weight in the RV down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our second home,'' said Peak, 68, who says he doesn't
drive the vehicle anymore and can't sell it. ``There's no one in
the world that would buy it. I certainly wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   As snowbirds head south for the winter, America's highways are
loaded with these overweight _ and largely unregulated _ houses on
wheels. Some could be dangerous: too heavy for the chassis, axles
and tires on which they are riding, making them hard to steer and
prone to blowouts and mechanical failures, according to a report by
John Anderson, a disgruntled RV owner who has made a business of
traveling the country weighing RVs and holding seminars on weight
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who lives near Greeneville, Tenn., weighed more than
6,000 RVs from 1993 to 1997, and found that 64 percent were over
their weight limits. Among the large motor homes, 69 percent were
overweight. Why? In some cases, manufacturers overload the vehicles
with options, in others, it's the fault of buyers who add their own
belongings, from rock collections to pianos.
</P>
<P>
   While fatalities in RV accidents are low _ 216 people died in RV
crashes in 1997, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration _ the leading cause of crashes appears to be drivers
losing control of the vehicle, according to Dana Hogan, a spokesman
for State Farm Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   No special license is needed to operate most motor homes because
they fall under the 26,000-pound limit for a commercial driver's
license.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives don't dispute Anderson's figures nor
disagree that there is a weight problem, but they blame consumers
for overloading the vehicles with options and personal items. The
average couple, Anderson said, takes a ton of personal belongings
on board, while people using their RVs full-time store an average
3,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can overload a car, you can overload a pickup,'' said Phil
Ingrassia, a spokesman for the Recreational Vehicle Rental
Association, a trade group for firms that rent RVs.
</P>
<P>
   But experts also point to some manufacturers, who are feeding
consumers' insatiable appetite for fancy options. The trend with
motor homes is big and bigger, noted Jerry Mittman, sales manager
for RV and special vehicles for Ford Motor Corp. in Detroit. The
standard motor home width has gone from 96 inches to 102 inches,
and in recent years, more motor homes are featuring ``slideouts'' _
compartments that extend the floor space to as much as 12 feet that
can also add a half-ton to the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   And consumers are demanding more amenities, like hardwood
cabinets, stone countertops and ceramic floor tiles. The
manufacturers are installing these accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson got into the weight issue after he had problems with
his own 5th-wheeler _ an RV pulled by a pickup truck _ which had a
weight limit of 14,000 pounds. After 11 tire failures and $10,000
in improvements, he weighed it and found it was built 840 pounds
over weight.
</P>
<P>
   In Peak's case, the 37-foot Newmar Kountry Aire he bought from
Northway Travel Trailers in 1991 was just 50 pounds below its
weight limit with full water and propane tanks and a nearly full
tank of gas, according to an engineer's report commissioned by
Peak. That was before the driver even got in.
</P>
<P>
   Peak first took his complaint to an arbitrator, who in 1993
ruled that the manufacturer, the Newmar Corp., wasn't to blame. The
arbitrator, Paul Macey, said it was Peak's fault for choosing the
options that he did. But Peak said all he did was choose items from
the Newmar's standard list _ extras like the slideout and oak
cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a New York Supreme Court jury agreed with Peak that
the vehicle was unusable. A trial is set for November to decide
actual damages, though the RV itself caught fire while parked in
Peak's driveway last month.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parker, owner of Northway Travel Trailers in the Albany
suburb of Clifton Park, declined to comment on the case. He bought
the business after Peak made his purchase there. Attorney David
Pentkowski, representing the corporation that owned the business
when Peak bought his vehicle, did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Newmar, the manufacturer, won't discuss Peak's case, but will
say it disagrees with the weight Peak and a Connecticut testing
firm claimed on the vehicle. In a 1994 letter to the state attorney
general, the firm also asserted that even though the vehicle is
officially rated for 19,500 pounds, the limit is understated and
the RV could carry 20,000 to 23,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is so far no federal move to regulate the industry. Tim
Hurd, a spokesman for the federal safety agency, said there is no
clear evidence that RVs are defective on a wide scale, and the
government for now is leaving it to the industry to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has responded somewhat: the Recreational Vehicle
Industry Association, a trade group, came out in September 1996
with a recommendation that manufacturers post a more detailed
weight label on each vehicle. Adopted by most major RV
manufacturers, according to RVIA spokesman Alan Piercy, the label
shows the vehicle's net carrying capacity, how much water it can
carry and what it would weigh with the water tank full.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's weighing program suggests there has been a change,
too: While 78 percent of the 1993 models he weighed were
overweight, the figure dropped to 56 percent in 1997. Anderson
isn't sure of the cause, but he does credit the industry with
trying to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of models that pre-date the industry's 1996
labeling program _ an unknown number of overweight RVs that will
likely be on the road for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor, which builds chassis and sells them to RV
manufacturers, said the RV builders are becoming more careful about
using strong enough chassis to support the increased weight of the
vehicles. Ford now requires motor home manufacturers to undergo a
special training program before modifying the company's chassis,
and this year came out with a new line of stronger products.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Mittman said, some manufacturers tended to hold
their costs down by buying lighter, less expensive chassis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manufacturers have probably gotten more honest in terms of
buying the right chassis,'' he said. ``The customer should feel a
lot safer than they did four to five years ago.''

   &UR; Layover at Narita  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I will be traveling to India this fall. Our
flights in each direction include layovers in Japan at Narita
Airport (one is 4:30 p.m. to 8 a.m., the other is 8 a.m. to 5
p.m.). Since the airport is not that close to Tokyo, can you
suggest hotels or attractions near Narita?
</P>
<P>
   A. The premier attraction in Narita is the Naritasan Shinshoji
Temple. Founded in 940 by Archbishop Kancho, it is the cathedral of
the Shingon sect of Buddhism. The temple is dedicated to Fudo Myoo,
the god of fire, and it attracts millions of followers each year.
Five structures on the site have been designated important national
cultural assets, with the three-storied pagoda the most dominant.
Visitors do not enter the pagoda but view it from a wooden platform
surrounding it. There is no charge, and the hours are 8 a.m. to 4
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   From the Nikko and ANA Hotels, mentioned below, the temple is
about a 10-minute taxi ride, costing about $22, calculated at 136
yen to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   If you take Japan Railways from the airport to the Narita
station, it's $1.40 to $1.70, depending on the terminal you start
at; from the station to the temple is about a 15-minute walk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just east of the temple lies the 41-acre Naritasan Park, where
you'll find a restful haven amid cherry, plum and maple trees;
maple trees are at their peak in November. In the park you'll find
the Naritasan Calligraphy Museum, which displays outstanding
examples of traditional calligraphy. It is closed Monday and
admission is $3.70, $2.20 for children.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Narita can get a free welcome kit that includes a
guide to landmarks, a map and a welcome card valid for discounts of
5 percent to 20 percent at 30 shops and tourist sites. Three places
at which the kit is available are the airport information center
(the first floor of Terminal 2), the Narita City Tourist
Information Center at the Japan Railways station and in front of
the Naritasan Shinshoji Temple.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a regular-fare ticket on Japan Airlines and the
flight schedule requires you to stay overnight, the airline's
policy is to pay for lodging. The airline is affiliated with Nikko
and will probably put you up at a Nikko hotel. If, however, you
have a special fare or group ticket, you do not qualify for free
accommodations. Two hotels you might consider, with rates given for
double occupancy, are these:
</P>
<P>
   The Nikko, which is about half a mile from the airport and costs
$126 not including breakfast, tax or service charge, or $162
including breakfast and service charge. Information: (800)
645-5687.
</P>
<P>
   The ANA, which is two miles from the airport and charges $156
without breakfast or service. Information: (800) 262-4683.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Learning Stick Shift &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Because it is very difficult to get a rental car with an
automatic transmission in Europe (recently in Italy the
``guaranteed'' automatic was not there when needed), I've decided
to meet the mountain. Do any driving schools in Manhattan offer
courses in manual-shift driving? Laurel Gonsalves, New York, N.Y.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Stick-shift cars are, of course, the exception on this side
of the Atlantic. And in the 60 hours of training for people seeking
licenses as driving instructors for noncommercial vehicles in New
York State no mention is made of stick-shift cars, according to the
Department of Motor Vehicles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the schools that provide a car and teach stick-shift
driving in Manhattan are these:
</P>
<P>
   Grand Prix Driving School, 797 Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y.
10021; (212) 752-0100. Rate: $60 for one and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
   Yorkville Driving School, 207 East 84th St., New York, N.Y.
10028; (212) 744-0500. Rate: $120 for three hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both schools practice on hills so that drivers can learn to
coordinate the gas, clutch and brake and thus prevent cars from
rolling backward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wherever you go, it's a good idea to ask how long the instructor
has been using a stick shift and how long he or she has been
teaching it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George Denning, a safety consultant who is licensed by New York
State as an examiner who evaluates commercial drivers, said you
might want to join the instructor for a ride to see if the car
moves smoothly under his or her control or whether it jerks forward
or stalls out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Apple, a spokesman for the State Department of Motor
Vehicles, said the state suggested that students ask the instructor
to show an operator's license and an instructor's certificate. The
name of the school on the certificate must be the same as that of
the school you are attending. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you have a complaint or inquiry, write to the New York State
Department of Motor Vehicles, Driving School Unit, 224 South Pearl
St., Albany, N.Y. 12202-1809.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tapestry and Kitchenware &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have any information on tours of the Gobelins tapestry
factory in Paris? Also, do you have information about a large
culinary equipment store or stores in Paris that have cooking
equipment not generally found in the United States? _ Mary V.
Harcar, Washington &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are indeed tours for visitors at La Manufacture des
Gobelins, which was founded as a dye works in the mid-15th century
by Jean Gobelin. The factory is at 42 Avenue des Gobelins;
telephone (33-1) 44.08.52.00.
</P>
<P>
   Guided tours in French only are given on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday at 2 and 2:45 p.m. Visitors have access to three workshops
where they can watch artisans weaving the tapestries by hand.
Guided tours in English are available, but require, helas, groups
of at least 25 people. To make arrangements, call La Caisse
Nationale des Monuments et des Cites, at (33-1) 44.61.21.69. All
tours are $8. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for culinary equipment, at least three major stores _ all in
the first arrondissement in central Paris _ cater to professionals
as well as to the general public:
</P>
<P>
   La Bovida, 36 Rue Montmartre; telephone (33-1) 42.36.09.99, fax
(33-1) 42.33.05.72.
</P>
<P>
   De Hillerin, 18 Rue Coquillere, is known as the place frequented
by three-star chefs: (33-1) 42.36.53.13, fax (33-1) 42.36.54.80. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   La Corpo, 19 Rue Montmartre, specializes in items for butchers;
(33-1) 40.34.50.55, fax (33-1) 40.39.04.33. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All are open daily except Sunday. The wares may range from
truffle cutters to crepieres (crepe makers) to molds for pates en
croute to copper pots and pans to kitchen knives of all sizes. &QL;

 CLUTTER INTO CASH  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this
week's LifeBeat lifestyle package.)

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative

<TEXT>
<P>
   Drive down most residential streets on a Saturday morning and
you're likely to see perfectly ordinary people hawking lava lamps,
end tables, bicycles and books.
</P>
<P>
   Done well, a garage sale can rack up $500 to $1,300 in profits
over a weekend and just about anything can sell, says Peggy
Hitchcock of Lantana, Fla., author of ``The Garage Sale Handbook''
(Pilot Books, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman who held a garage sale in her upscale neighborhood
advertised a blue toilet,'' says Hitchcock. ``People came just to
see that blue toilet and someone bought it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Much more than the unusual changes hands at garage sales,
though, says Hitchcock. ``Approach having a garage sale like you
would any other business transaction and you will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The secrets to a profitable garage sale are simple, but
critical, says Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   First have enough merchandise to offer; at least 100 items are
needed to make a sale worthwhile, as about half of them will only
be worth $1 or less. If you don't have enough items on your own,
talk to friends and neighbors to see if they will donate things or
at least give them to you on consignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take some time cleaning items up and you'll easily double your
sales,'' says Hitchcock. ``No one wants to buy a mixer with pancake
batter on the side no matter how well it's priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Says 30-year veteran garage-saler, Yvonne Ray of Santa Ana,
Calif.: ``If I walk up to a garage sale and there's clothes laying
all over the ground, mud caked on the bicycles and dust on the
dishes, I just leave. Things need to be neat and clean.'' At her
most recent sale she earned over $700, not including the sale of a
car.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being clean, things should be well displayed. ``No one
wants to stoop down and rifle through boxes of junk,'' says
Hitchcock. ``Borrow card tables so that you can get things up off
the ground, or get sturdy boxes from the grocery store, which can
be taped together to create disposable tables. Don't dump clothes
in a box. Rig up a clothesline. The idea is to make things easy to
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Also provide shoppers with a way to test mechanical merchandise,
says Richard Harris, co-owner of Harris &AMP; Small Antiques in Mission
Viejo, Calif., who has gone garage-saling just about every weekend
for the last 20 years. He also recently held a garage sale where he
sold all but two items and made $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run an extension cord out to the driveway so that people can
test things like radios and kitchen appliances, or provide
batteries,'' he says. ``Just telling people something works isn't
very effective, because they will tend to doubt you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most challenging aspects of setting up a garage sale
is pricing the items. Although some people skip this step, most
experts advise against it. ``Many shoppers won't ask how much
something is,'' says Hitchcock. ``They'll just assume it's too
expensive and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray agrees. ``I won't buy anything unless it's marked, because I
don't like the fact that people could decide how much I should pay
by the car I'm driving or what I'm wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   When pricing items, remember your customers are thrifty souls in
search of the ultimate deal. ``The whole purpose of going to garage
sales is to find really great deals, and it can be addicting,''
says Ray. ``This past summer I wanted an iced tea maker, but I
didn't want to pay full price, so I looked at garage sales and
found one for $5.00, but I didn't stop there. I found two more at
other garages sales for the same price and ending up buying them
all and giving two away.''
</P>
<P>
   When pricing merchandise, Hitchcock suggests employing the 20
percent rule. ``If you bought an item like an electric knife for
$15 and it's brand new and never been used, then 20 percent of $15
is $3, she says. ``If it's still in the cellophane, you may be able
to go to $5, and if it's used, but still clean and in good shape,
then it will probably sell for $2. If you're not sure on some
items, look up what they would cost new in a catalogue.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20 percent rule doesn't work for all items, including
clothing, which should be priced very low, often for 50 cents to $1
or $2 a piece.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, too, that garage-salers like to bargain. ``If you want
$5 for something, ask $7,'' says Harris. ``Virtually no one will
want to give you what you ask, because they want to believe that
they're getting a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   When you price items, also think about how far you're willing to
go down in price, says Hitchcock. ``If someone says something isn't
worth $2 and they offer 25 cents, decide if you'll accept that,''
she says. ``Sometimes I suggest telling customers to come back
later and if the item is still there, you'll sell it to them for
the reduced price.''
</P>
<P>
   For a more expensive item, offer to take the person's number and
call if it doesn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   In order to attract a crowd to your sale, it's a good idea to
advertise in the local newspaper, says Hitchcock. When you
advertise, highlight items that people might find of interest such
as children's toys, baby items, kitchen appliances, furniture and
unusual, hard-to-find things. You can also advertise for free at
grocery stores. When possible, instead f using index cards, make
your own flier announcing the sale. If you must use cards, opt for
neon colored ones rather than white.
</P>
<P>
   Good signs placed within a mile radius of your home can also
make or break a garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better the sign, the easier it is to find the sale and the
more intrigued your customers will be,'' says Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Take some time making the signs, because they will serve as the
first impression you give potential customers. A brightly colored,
easy-to-read sign made on poster board with black magic marker is
much more impressive than a scribbled scrap of cardboard or a paper
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Rise early the day of the sale because serious garage-salers
will be out as soon as it's light, and the first two hours is when
you'll make most of your money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you say 8 a.m., people will pound on your door at 6,''
warns Harris. Also make sure there are at least two of you working,
so that one person can answer questions while the other collects
money. And have a lot of change on hand, because most people will
have $20 bills.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Kids and sex? You've got to be kidding, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong! It takes a lot of years to develop a healthy attitude
about sex as well as a healthy sexual life. This process starts at
birth, so right from the beginning you need to help your child
build good feelings about the enjoyment he can get from his body.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we're not talking about sexual intercourse here. You
need a mature body (and, one hopes, a mature mind) to participate
in intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   But sexuality includes much more than just the sex act. It is
built upon all the kisses and caresses, sensuality and
satisfaction, and attachment and affection that you and your child
experience in your relationship with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see what's going on in your child's sexual development as
he matures, age by age.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Birth to 1 1/2 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Babies link pleasure with physical attention. All of the
sensitive physical attention you give to your little one (feeding
her, holding her, stroking her skin, washing her) helps her to
develop good feelings about her body and teaches her to associate
these good feelings with someone she loves.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that most of a baby's happiness and desire centers on
sucking, whether she is breast-fed or bottle-fed with formula.
(Many women report enjoyable sensual feelings when they
breast-feed. These feelings are completely normal and attest to the
fact that mothers and their children are connected through
pleasure.)
</P>
<P>
   Not all babies have an easy beginning. So don't be worried if
your little one is colicky and it takes some time for her
gastrointestinal system to settle down. As soon as she gets
comfortable, her pleasant feelings will grow and she'll begin to
make all of the right connections.
</P>
<P>
   And fathers, don't forget that by holding, caressing and
diapering your child you are strengthening her bond to you, as well
as your bond to her.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1 1/2 to 3 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now he can use his hands to explore his own body and _ if he's
not given limits _ other people's bodies as well. Bottoms become
particularly fascinating to a toddler because toilet training is a
developmental goal and bottoms receive a lot of family attention.
</P>
<P>
   Kids this age are interested in all kinds of bodily functions.
Their explorations are a normal expression of their increased
intellectual curiosity and greater physical capabilities. So this
is the time to let your child know that he's in control of his body
and that it's OK to explore it.
</P>
<P>
   But you also need to begin to discuss some appropriate limits.
(``We call them private parts because we show and touch them only
when we're in private.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's important, also, to be matter-of- fact about the bodily
sensations you observe your toddler enjoying. (``I know it feels
good, but you can't touch yourself at the dinner table. That is
something you can do when you're alone.'')
</P>
<P>
   Too shocked or severe a reaction (``Stop it right now!'')
interferes with your toddler's ability to feel good about his body
and makes sexuality ``bad'' and guilt-ridden. On the other hand,
too indulgent a response or no response at all doesn't help your
child learn acceptable and civilized behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3 to 6 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By now, your child has a fairly good idea about the anatomical
distinction between girls' and boys' bodies. Children from 3 to 6
years old often try to supplement their knowledge with mutual sex
play, so keep your eye on kids who disappear into a bathroom or
closet together on play-dates since they may be playing doctor.
</P>
<P>
   While this play is normal, children are frequently interested in
inserting a pencil or crayon into a vagina or rectum and can hurt
each other with their prying and poking.
</P>
<P>
   It's rarely the case that this kind of sex play is fully
consensual. Rather, one bolder, more curious or more aggressive
child often initiates the activity and/or dominates the other child
_ a potentially anxiety-producing scenario. If you catch your kids
``in the act,'' set a firm but matter-of-fact limit (``You can
pretend to be a doctor, but actually touching each others' private
parts is not allowed'').
</P>
<P>
   Preschoolers also become aware now that there is a certain kind
of relationship between their parents from which they are excluded,
and they are very curious about what this relationship entails.
Most children will raise questions on their own, but if your child
hasn't begun asking by age 7, a book can help you jump-start a
conversation. Try ``How Babies Are Made'' by Andrew Andry and
Steven Schepp (Little, Brown, 1984).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6 to 10 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is the age of pals and best friends, a stage that serves as
a precursor to the more intimate puppylove relationships of the
preteen years and to the passions of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes girls seem to become more ``girly'' and boys more
``boyish'' at this stage, as each gender begins to learn more about
social expectations and to adopt social roles.
</P>
<P>
   Identification with family members becomes more important, and
girls and boys this age are likely to show increased interest in
your work, your life when you were a child, and your family's
history. This helps them to develop a firmer sense of their own
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Because some anxieties are already beginning to build around
sexuality, sexual topics may inspire a lot of silliness, innuendo,
or even vulgarity from children this age. This can be unpleasant,
but it's pretty normal. Some 8- to 10-year-old girls pointedly
reject boys (``We hate boys'') and vice versa (``Girls are
stupid''), but other boys and girls seem to be comfortable with
opposite-sex friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Now is a good time to expand your discussion of sexual basics
with your child because he's likely to have been exposed through
friends and the media to information be doesn't understand.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We've all seen the studies on the number of murders a child will
see on television before he turns 18. We've heard how today's kids
are out of shape because they spend too much time on the couch. And
_ most telling _ we've seen the effects of too much television
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   One mom calls it ``the zombie stare'' _ the look that comes over
her 7-year-old when he watches Saturday-morning cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, too, that TV, just like chocolate (thank heavens!),
isn't all bad. As with most things, moderation is the key. In fact,
if we use it wisely, television can open up exciting new worlds for
our kids.
</P>
<P>
   How? Marguerite Kelly, mother of four grown children and
coauthor of ``The Mother's Almanac'' (Doubleday, 1975), has some
helpful words on this subject that concerns many parents.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We hear so much about how TV is bad for kids. What's the best
thing about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Television can inspire. It can make a kid curious. It can
also be a great bonding time for parents and kids. But parents have
to make sure that happens. Watch with your kids. In a subtle way,
you can use a show as a springboard for family discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much TV should children watch?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think five to seven hours per week is plenty for kids under
7. For older kids, eight to 10 hours seems about right. Have your
kids look through the television schedule and mark their shows for
the week. It certainly helps build their negotiation skills!
</P>
<P>
   Q: How important is it for parents to set a good example when it
comes to TV viewing?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's very important. Kids pay much more attention to what we
do than to what we say. Make sure your kids see you doing lots of
enjoyable things other than watching TV _ reading books, enjoying
hobbies, even just getting out of the house for a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My child is afraid of some of the things on the 6 o'clock
news. Frankly, so am I! How do I handle this?
</P>
<P>
   A: More and more parents are not allowing their 6-, 7- and
8-year-olds to watch television news, and I think that's wise. The
murder rate in this country is way down, but you wouldn't know it
from watching the news. If you feel your kids are mature enough,
watch it with them and emphasize that murders, etc. are shown
because they're unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the ``arsenic hour'' o when everyone is tired and
cranky and parents are trying to get dinner on the table?
</P>
<P>
   A: Beware of prime-time shows that are shown during the dinner
hour as reruns. For example, ``Seinfeld'' is a terrific show, but
obviously it's not appropriate for young children. The problem is,
it appears all over the country now in dinner-hour reruns. As
always, you have to monitor what your kids are watching.
</P>
<P>
   As an alternative, borrow videos from the library _ ``Willy
Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,'' ``Harriet the Spy,'' ``Beauty
and the Beast'' _ and watch one for 20 or 30 minutes each night.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can we make our kids more critical viewers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Laugh at TV! Make fun of it. Make your child feel like he's
in on the joke when you explain how dumb some shows are. Parents
don't realize how much influence they have with their children.
Make your child feel accepted on your intellectual level when
you're discussing the merits of a show. Ask her opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your strongest piece of advice to parents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Never have a television in a child's bedroom. This tears the
fabric of the family, because it puts parents and children on a
different track. And it separates the family. Everyone goes into
their cells after feeding hour!
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's a good way to turn TV viewing into an ongoing family
experience?
</P>
<P>
   A: Have a weekly ``Family Hang-Out Night.'' Parents can
designate one night each week when the family sits down to watch a
show that everyone's agreed on. Watch the same show each week. Make
popcorn or a snack the kids can prepare on their own or with your
help. Don't answer the phone. Afterwards, families can read
together or play a game or take a walk. Everyone will look forward
to the ritual and the shared time together.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best way to judge a TV show?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the characters on the show came to your front door, would
you let them in? If not, change the channel!

</P>
<P>
   THE RATINGS:
</P>
<P>
   Confused about the ``Educational/Informational'' rating on kids'
TV shows? You're not alone. Here are a few tips to help make sense
of it all.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably noticed a small ``E/I'' symbol in your TV
listing and at the beginning of some of your kids' favorite shows.
According to the FCC, network broadcasters must now provide _ and
use this symbol to identify _ at least three hours per week of
programming that ``educates and informs'' children under age 16.
Cable services are not included.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's move is good news, says Alice Cahn, director of
children's programming for PBS. But parents still need to be
watchful, she adds. ``It's like when my nephew comes to my house
and I ask him to wash his hands before dinner and he comes to the
table with only the ``front'' of his hands washed. Then he says
'But I only use the front of my hands when I eat!'''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to broadcasters' compliance with the FCC's ruling,
``There's the spirit of the law and then there's the letter of the
law,'' says Cahn. ``We need to hold all broadcasters to a higher
standard of product safety, just as we would for toy safety or
anything else that affects our children's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   So looking for the E/I symbol is a good beginning. But don't
stop there. Here are some other suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the E/I symbol as a starting point in helping your child
choose appropriate shows. ``Then check out the show for yourself,''
says Cahn. ``Say to yourself, 'Here's my library of shows. Now I'm
going to pick three.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for shows that make learning fun. ``Every good teacher
you ever had proved that good education is entertaining,'' says
Cahn. ``The same holds true for TV It shouldn't have to be boring
to be informative.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Use TV as a springboard. ``After a kid watches a show on PBS,
for example, he should have a great idea for an activity to do.
That's what TV should offer kids. They should want to turn off the
TV and go *do* something!'' _ Kathy Sena

London 
 By JACOB WEISBERG 
 c.1998 Slate 
<TEXT>
 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Since plans for Britain's Millennium Dome began to take shape
last year, condemnation has poured in from all sides. Left-wing
critics are appalled at the waste of $1.3 billion that could have
gone toward housing and the National Health Service. Conservatives
object to the Blair government's attempt to present England as a
modern, multicultural nation instead of a tradition-bound,
Christian one. With the help of constant attacks from all sides,
the dome's approval rating fell to 8 percent in one recent
poll--lower than Monica's, Ken's, or even Linda's. The only people
in London who don't heap scorn on it are those who complain they're
too tired of the topic to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   On the chance that something so despised might deserve
defending, I put on a hard hat and rubber boots and went to look at
the construction site in Greenwich, just outside London, this week.
(Sept. 21) (Because the world's clocks are fixed to Greenwich Mean
Time, this is the spot where the millennium can be argued to
officially debut.)
</P>
<P>
   As I half suspected, the dome is better than advertised. As a
building, it is stunning. As the site of the main international
event of the Year 2000, it may or may not succeed. But the dome has
at least a chance to follow in the path of its illustrious English
ancestors, the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1851 and the Festival
of Britain of 1951. Those events, too, were derided in advance as
wasteful and stupid. But they are remembered now as monumental
expressions of British identity and historical moment.
</P>
<P>
   As a feat of architecture, engineering, and urban renewal, the
dome is already close to being a success. John Major's Tory
government first conceived of the project, and Labor was officially
opposed before it took power, so until 1997, no one knew what would
happen. Once Tony Blair decided to make the dome a kind of
signature for ``New Labor,'' there were just three years to plan
and build one of the largest structures on earth--on a contaminated
gasworks site. Before construction could begin, the ground below
literally had to be washed to remove cyanide and arsenic. Engineers
then went about raising a room of nearly a million square feet.
This is a structure so huge that, according to Anthony Day, the
retired architect who gave me a tour, weather systems would form
inside if not for the high-tech fiberglass and Teflon double skin.
Day suggests that winter visitors will want to bring overcoats and
brandy flasks, because the building is simply too big to heat
(though I suspect the Brits like it that way).
</P>
<P>
   Even if the exhibition fails to draw the hoped-for 15 million
visitors, it will be responsible for turning hundreds of acres of
industrial wasteland into a lovely spot on the Thames linked to the
rest of the metropolis by the Underground.
</P>
<P>
   This follows the urban planning ideas of Britain's most famous
architect, Richard Rogers, who is responsible for the dome. Rogers
believes that London, like many of the world's great cities, is
being undone by traffic and unplanned sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   He argues in a recent book, ``Cities for a Small Planet''
(Westview Press, 1998), that the way to rescue London is to reduce
car traffic; develop new neighborhoods for mixed use; and convert
the city's greatest natural asset, the Thames riverbank, into
public space. If successful, the dome will make the case for
pursuing Rogers' grander vision--turning the Thames Embankment, now
a highway along the river, into a grand park.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rogers' best-known building, the Pompidou Center in Paris,
the dome is drawn in brilliant color, which jumps out against the
London drab like a brightly frosted cake. The Italian-born
architect's other hallmark, of which the Lloyd's of London
headquarters is the leading example, is for a building to show how
it works, exposing its elevators, ventilation pipes, and structural
girders.
</P>
<P>
   You can see, at a glance from the outside, how the dome stands
up. Its huge tent is sustained by brilliant yellow tent poles,
nearly 300 feet high and stitched together with steel cables. From
the overlooking hill of the Greenwich Royal Observatory, the
structure looks like a whimsical sea monster that crawled out of
the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   The chief fault of Rogers' other buildings is that they don't
age well--many of the better known ones have an early '80s, ``new
wave'' look. But the dome has the advantage of being temporary. The
millennium exhibition will last a year, and though the structure
may be converted to another use, it's only supposed to last 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   The tent is beautiful empty--David Hockney, the painter, was
recently quoted proposing that it be left that way. And members of
the planning committee may privately share that wish. Almost every
decision about how to fill the space has aroused controversy. The
most ridiculed proposal is ``Body,'' a gargantuan naked human
people can walk through, observing the operation of the internal
organs as in a Rogers building. Leaving Dome Person unsexed on the
exterior seems overly prudish. But the alternative of
Brobdingnagian genitalia and python-size pubic hairs could be hard
to stomach, even after the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge may be the least futuristic part of the
exhibition--the ``National Identity'' section, for which the
committee has yet to announce any kind of plan. In deciding what to
put here, Britain will be describing itself to the world.
</P>
<P>
   In previous great exhibitions, this was a less complicated
issue. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in 1851, Britain
was an imperial power with a unitary culture. A great exhibition
was a chance to dazzle with what it could make and build, beginning
with the glass and iron Crystal Palace itself, a marvel of early
Victorian engineering. The 1951 Festival of Britain (organized by
the grandfather of the Labor minister now in charge of the
Millennium Dome) still represented a culturally homogenous,
industrial country. It displayed thousands of British-made things,
heralding the emergence from wartime rationing into postwar
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Britain is increasingly an immigrant nation with an
emerging postindustrial economy. It depends far more on the export
of services and its culture than it does on its goods. The Blair
government has invested its prestige in the dome because it sees it
as an opportunity to convey this new social and economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, the Cabinet member in charge of the millennium
project, was lampooned for traveling to Disney World in search of
ideas. But an excess of popular appeal is less likely than an
overinfusion of centrist political ideology. Blair loves to say
that he sees Britain as a dynamic, forward-looking and
multicultural society. Laborites talk unblushingly about
``re-branding'' the country. To New Labor, the dome is a great
marketing opportunity. Which makes it, in a way, an authentic
expression of the spirit of the age.

METEOR STORM MAY INTERRUPT CELL PHONES, OTHER COMMUNICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A spectacular meteor storm will ignite the
heavens in mid-November, possibly disrupting satellites and
threatening services such as cellular phones, television broadcasts
and data communications.
</P>
<P>
   The last great meteor barrage was in 1966, when space satellites
were far less common and far less essential to everyday life. Back
then, thousands of meteors per minute shot across the North
American sky.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the skies are jammed with satellites that aid in weather
forecasting, relay data communications and TV signals, and enable
military surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the meteors are smaller than grains of sand, they
travel tremendously fast _ more than 40 miles per second,
equivalent to a 10-second flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles.
As a result, they could knock out or disrupt some satellites'
delicate electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meteoroid storm will be the largest such threat ever
experienced by our critical orbiting satellite constellations,''
William H. Ailor, director of the Center for Orbital and Reentry
Debris Studies at the Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., told
the House Science Committee on May 21.
</P>
<P>
   The 1966 storm appeared over continental North America, but this
year's main aerial assault will be visible from Japan, China, the
Philippines and other parts of east Asia, and possibly Hawaii. The
meteors are debris from the comet Tempel-Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
Calif., hope to study the shower from aircraft flying out of Japan,
said Peter Jenniskens, the principal investigator at Ames. They
hope to broadcast live images of the shower over the World Wide
Web.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Leonid'' meteor shower is so named because the meteors
appear to emanate from the direction of the constellation Leo.
Actually, the shower is a cloud of rocky particles orbiting the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Earth crosses the cloud's path every Nov. 17 and 18. At that
time, amateur astronomers enjoy seeing the Leonids zip across the
sky, sometimes several per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Every 30-plus years, our planet crosses a particularly dense
part of the Leonid cloud. So the shower becomes a storm, with up to
40 meteors per second and sometimes 50,000 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Although very tiny, the particles move so fast that the friction
with Earth's atmosphere will cause them to burn and glow. Visible
from hundreds of miles away, they will look like fireworks in the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   NASA plans to turn the Hubble Space Telescope away from the
storm so meteors that hit the giant orbital telescope will miss its
delicate mirror, NASA spokesman Don Savage said.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA is taking (the shower) seriously,'' Savage said. ``We
have been assessing what we need to do to ensure our satellites in
Earth orbit are going to be operated in a safe manner during this
meteor shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Other satellites might be temporarily re-oriented so that they
present the smallest target.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned, and we have been in meetings and making
plans concerning the Leonid shower,'' said U.S. Army Maj. Mike
Birmingham, a spokesman for the U.S. Space Command, which monitors
American military and spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an immense wave of radiation from a neutron star
washed over Earth, causing at least two scientific satellites to
shut down to protect their electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers said the star, in a constellation about 20,000
light-years away, had unleashed enough energy to power civilization
for a billion-billion years. But by the time the radiation found
its way across the cosmos and through the atmosphere, it was no
stronger than a typical dental X-ray, scientists said.

DEFYING TREND, HAWAII SUFFERS TOURIST SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Oct. 11)  
(JT) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most of the United States appears headed for a second
consecutive year with a record number of tourists in 1998 _ or was
before the recent stock market gyrations raised questions about
rosy tourism projections for this fall _ Hawaii's tourist industry
continues to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The islands' overall visitor count of 3,974,530 through July,
the latest month for which figures are available, is off almost 1
percent over the same period last year, and with the traditional
tourism slowdown this month, there is little prospect that the
islands will come close to the record of almost 7 million visitors
in 1990. Meanwhile, the hotel occupancy rate in August dropped to
75.8 percent statewide, a 3.6 percent decline from August 1997,
while Waikiki hotel occupancy fell 3.82 percent in the same period,
to 78.9. This on-again, off-again slump, during a time when tourism
has been flourishing on the mainland, has renewed questions of
whether Hawaii is mired in a prolonged though temporary downturn or
whether its problems are systemic. What makes the soul-searching so
important is that the $11 billion in tourism revenues account for
one-quarter of Hawaii's tax revenues, as well as one-third of the
jobs in a no-growth state that is struggling with above-average
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's tourism woes began in earnest with the Gulf War in
1991. While that scare cut international air travel drastically,
diminishing numbers of passengers on U.S. airlines by 44 percent on
trans-Atlantic routes and 20 percent on Pacific routes, according
to the Air Transport Association, it had a longer-lasting impact on
Hawaii. Those islands lost about 850,000 visitors from 1991 through
1993, mainly because they were so heavily dependent on Japanese
tourists, who tend to be cautious travelers, according to Japanese
tour operators.
</P>
<P>
   When tourists finally began venturing back in 1994, many
complained that hotels were expensive and rundown, and that
Honolulu lacked amusement parks and similar attractions. At the
same time environmentalists faulted the state for not doing more to
promote nature and environmental tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's high prices put it at a competitive disadvantage with
ocean cruises and mainland vacation sites. The American Automobile
Association recently listed Hawaii as the most expensive place to
vacation in America _ the $383-a-day average for meals and lodging
was $53 a day more than in the runner-up, New York City. That may
help explain why Hawaii, at one time almost every American's dream
vacation destination, finished behind Florida and California in
recent Travel Industry Association surveys of the favorite summer
and winter destinations for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   While all this was going on, the decades-long honeymoon between
Hawaii and its once-lucrative Asian market was battered by the
Asian economic flu that has weakened Japanese and Korean currencies
in the past year, effectively pushing up the price of everything on
the islands for many Asian visitors. As a result, tourism from Asia
is down 8.5 percent through July, and a number of airlines have
canceled flights from Asia to Hawaii and put smaller planes on
their remaining Hawaiian routes.
</P>
<P>
   This year occupancy in the beachfront hotels of Waikiki plunged
to its lowest May occupancy since 1982 _ to 70.8 percent from 76.9
percent a year earlier, according to PKF-Hawaii, a consulting firm,
and from January through August occupancy at those hotels was down
4.2 percent. Also in August, a strong month for visitors, Oahu
occupancy plummeted four percentage points to 77.4, Oahu's lowest
August rate since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   One result, which is now contributing to the problem, is that
few hotels, especially the hotels on Waikiki beach, have been
refurbished or renovated, according to Ernest A. Watari, chief
executive officer of PKF-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging problems, optimists point to Hawaii's many
pluses. Once the Asian crisis passes, they say, Japanese and
Koreans will return in big numbers. Meanwhile, in hopes of
attracting many of the 2.6 million Chinese tourists who went abroad
last year, the Hawaii Convention and Visitors Bureau opened a sales
office in Shanghai last April. And Honolulu's $350 million
convention center, which opened in mid-June, has already booked 60
conventions over the next few years that are expected to account
for almost 600,000 room nights and add $1.6 billion to the state's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tour operators, including Globus, Cosmos, Tauck,
Collette, Pleasant Holidays, Perillo and Gogo Worldwide, currently
have special rates to Hawaii, while Liberty Travel and some other
big travel agencies offer package deals featuring room and car
upgrades. In addition, such hotel chains as Castle, Sheraton, Aston
and Outrigger also have special rates through this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the number of Asian visitors dwindles, visitors from the
mainland are increasing _ up 4.8 percent through this July to 1.78
million. Christopher Kam, a researcher with the Hawaii Visitors and
Convention Bureau, said the major factor appears to have been ``the
overall strength of the U.S. economy.'' Which explains why
Hawaiians are keeping their fingers crossed and their eyes on Wall
Street and the national economic indicators.

   &UR; Las Vegas Headliners: Monet and Van Gogh &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In most Las Vegas casinos, the only truly valuable artwork is a
royal flush. But on Thursday the 3,000-room Bellagio hotel and
casino will open with, among other attractions, a fine-arts gallery
containing original works by Monet, Van Gogh, Renoir, Cezanne and
Gauguin.
</P>
<P>
   The resort, built by the owners of the nearby Mirage and named
after the village on Lake Como, has its own 10-acre lake with more
than 1,000 fountains whose jets will dance to Copland, Sondheim and
Italian folk songs. A botanical garden will contain seasonal
displays, and along the edge of the lake will be a re-creation of a
Tuscan village with red-tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   It might be enough to make you think you were in the lake
country _ except for the 36-story tower that contains Bellagio's
guest rooms. Most rooms will have European-style furnishings, and
baths with Italian marble and separate tub and shower. Most notable
among the restaurants will be Le Cirque, a branch of Le Cirque
2000, and Circo, both run by the Maccioni family, serving French
and northern Italian cuisine respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve restaurants offer a range of specialties from seafood to
Asian cuisine. This being Las Vegas, there will be a buffet, too.
The headline show is a Cirque du Soleil performance called ``O,''
with swimmers, divers and acrobats.
</P>
<P>
   The casino, with its canopies and wrought-iron trim, is meant to
evoke the patio of a villa overlooking a lake (the one with the
lounge singers and hundreds of slot machines).
</P>
<P>
   Bellagio is at 3600 Las Vegas Blvd. S., across Flamingo Road and
two millenniums from Caesars Palace. Rates will range from $159 to
$499 a night, although they may be lower or higher depending on
demand. Call (888) 987-6667, fax (702) 693-8546. On the Web, it's
www.bellagiolasvegas.com.

<P>
   &UR; A Cathay Pacific Deal For Fall Travel to Asia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   With Asian economies struggling, Cathay Pacific is offering a
break on a single-rate pass for travel to Hong Kong and 17 other
cities in Asia. The All Asia Pass includes a round-trip economy
seat from either Los Angeles or New York to Hong Kong and a month
of unlimited economy-class travel to the other cities in Asia. The
standard rate is $999, but adults over 55, full-time students under
27 and anyone who has registered on the airline's Web site will pay
$100 less.
</P>
<P>
   The pass is valid for travel through Dec. 15 on itineraries
chosen at the time of purchase. Tickets must be bought 30 days
before departure, but for $100 you can buy them as little as five
days ahead. All American taxes and fees are included, but most
airport taxes outside the United States are not. Frequent-flier
mileage cannot be earned on the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Travel is available from Hong Kong to these cities: Jakarta,
Denpasar (Bali) and Surabaya in Indonesia; Tokyo, Fukuoka, Nagoya,
Osaka and Sapporo in Japan; Kuala Lumpur and Penang in Malaysia;
Manila and Cebu in the Philippines; Singapore; Seoul, South Korea;
Colombo, Sri Lanka; Taipei, Taiwan; and Bangkok, Thailand. These
cities were available last year, but this year Cathay Pacific has
added some options. Now destinations in Australia, China, New
Zealand, India, South Africa, Vietnam, Thailand and Turkey may be
included for $200 to $500 extra. The pass may be extended from the
basic 30-day period to 45 days for an additional $100. Upgrades to
first or business class on the trans-Pacific flight are also
available.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay Pacific offers two nonstop flights a day to Hong Kong
from Los Angeles, and daily direct service from New York, through

SNARING THE ELUSIVE VAT REFUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Oct. 11)  
(JT) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Getting refunds on the value added tax, or VAT, in Europe is
getting harder. It's not knottier mathematics. That's the same old
challenge to those of us who hated eighth-grade arithmetic. But new
problems are being created by the softening of borders within the
European Union. It's more difficult for travelers to do the
paperwork for tax refunds on major items being taken home because
the tax chits are supposed to be validated at the last stop in the
Union, no matter where the purchases were made.
</P>
<P>
   To review basics: European value-added taxes range from 6.5
percent in Switzerland to 25 percent in Denmark and Sweden. For a
VAT refund, most countries require the foreign visitor to spend a
minimum amount in one store, usually on one visit and sometimes on
one purchase. Some rough sample minimums are $340 in Switzerland,
$210 in France, $180 in Italy and $50 in Britain. Ireland has no
minimum. Ask the store what the minimum is.
</P>
<P>
   And refunds always seem to be less than you expect. Here's why:
The tax is not broken out but integrated into a price. For example,
a Paris scarf with a price tag of $300 was originally about $248;
adding the French VAT of 20.6 percent brings it to $300. Refunding
the VAT will thus yield only $51.30, or 17.1 percent of the marked
price. If a refund company is used, it takes a bite averaging 3
percent of the price of the item. For the $300 scarf, this would
mean a net refund of $42.30, about 14.1 percent. The sales clerk
will fill in this amount on the tax receipt. Then, at the airport,
if the traveler wants a refund in dollars instead of in francs or
instead of a credit to a charge card, the exchange company will
charge a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the new problems. The 15 members of the European Union have
had a rule since Jan. 1, 1993, that VAT receipts may be validated
and refunds obtained only at the last stop in the Union, whether at
an airport, a road customs stop or on the railroad border check.
This rule is now being enforced in many places. In a simple
scenario, a traveler who has visited Spain, Portugal and France and
is now flying back to the United States from Germany presents the
refund slips from everywhere for validation at German customs. The
officer stamps the receipts and the traveler turns them in at a
refund booth, or uses an attached envelope to mail them. Or they
can be mailed from home.
</P>
<P>
   An increasingly likely scenario was experienced by Robert Smith
of Baltimore. Leaving Spain with some silver pieces on his way to
London and home, he asked the Spanish customs agent to stamp his
slip for a refund of $75. Smith was told he could get his refund
only at his departure point from the European Union. When Smith
protested that he would have only two hours to connect in London,
the guard waved him out of the line. As it later turned out, Smith
missed his London connection, and stayed there overnight. So he got
his receipts stamped but would otherwise probably have been out of
luck.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Global Refund, formerly known as Europe
Tax-Free Shopping, is the major third-party agent for refunds. It
says 125,000 retailers in 22 countries are linked to Global Refund;
labels on their windows say ``Tax Free for Tourists.'' When a
refund is processed, Global Refund keeps an average of 3 percent of
the retail price of the item _ about 10 to 20 percent of the
refund. At 400 airport kiosks, often shared with a currency
exchange company, it accepts the stamped receipts, which it calls
cheques. It gives an immediate cash refund in local currency, or in
the currencies used for the purchases. Or it can apply a credit to
a charge card _ American Express, Diners Club, JCB,
Eurocard-Mastercard-Access or Visa. This will emerge in two or
three billing cycles as a credit in dollars. If a dollar refund is
sought on the spot, the fee from the exchange company is deducted
from the refund.
</P>
<P>
   Global Refund, a division of the Cendent Company with
headquarters in Stamford, Conn., estimates that Americans lose $50
million a year in unclaimed refunds. Julia Ryan, the American
marketing director for Global Refund, said that problems like the
one in Madrid led her company to negotiate with customs officials
at airports in the European Union to make it easier to get
validations at interim stops. One result, she says, is an unwritten
two-hour rule: The customs official may validate the receipt if the
tickets show that the connection time at the last stop in the Union
is no more than two hours _ the usual minimum connection time
airlines book internationally. ``The final decision to stamp is up
to the local customs authority,'' Ms. Ryan says.
</P>
<P>
   In most such cases, the customs officer will want to see the
items, which means they should be packed in the top of any suitcase
being checked through, or the parcel should not be so well wrapped
that scissors and knives are needed to open it. If time is ample,
and the customs official cooperative, the goods can be inspected,
the VAT form stamped and the luggage checked through to the United
States. Allowing enough time to be pleasant is probably a help with
customs agents, Ms. Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of wrinkles. For example, in Germany, Italy and
France, customs officials will stamp the form for checked items
only, not for those being carried aboard the plane; passengers must
get this validation at the last stop in the Union.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is particularly difficult if passengers are
connecting to a nonstop flight to the United States at Charles de
Gaulle Airport near Paris. All of the customs desks are at the
check-in area, outside the security barrier. If a VAT stamp is
needed, it will thus take extra time. To avoid this snarl, Ms. Ryan
said, her company is encouraging customs officials in other places
to provide validations to passengers going through Paris on their
way home. The stamped receipts are then taken to an area labeled
``Detaxe'' for the refund inside the security barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Where travelers are passing through an airport for the last leg
home, checked luggage is already in the custody of the airline and
cannot be inspected. But the need for local customs officers to
verify that the objects are leaving the European Union is satisfied
by the air tickets and stubs of luggage checks.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, outside the European Union, is the source of many
failed refund requests, Ms. Ryan said. The Swiss customs officers
will stamp receipts only for purchases made in Switzerland,
conversely, these receipts cannot be stamped in a Union country.
Ms. Ryan said her company's offices in Switzerland got a high
percentage of unvalidated receipts from United States residents.
Leaving Switzerland by train, where there may be no customs check,
is part of the problem. In this case, the receipt, plus a copy of a
train ticket, may be mailed to the company for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead is the euro currency to be used by 11 countries in the
European Union. Global Refund is getting set to give euro refunds,
too _ providing a more widely usable currency without exchange
fees. Global Refund is at 707 Summer St., Stamford, Conn. 06901;
(800) 566-9828 or www.globalrefund.com.

SCIENCE FICTION COMES TO LIFE ON NASA SPACECRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(mk) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Combining technology with fantasy, the United
States is about to send an experimental probe into space to test
some of the favorite concepts of science fiction. The robot craft
not only will be driven by an advanced ion propulsion engine, it
will also take care of itself, navigating through space on its own
and occasionally calling home to let people on Earth know how it is
doing.
</P>
<P>
   The spacecraft, called Deep Space 1, is to be a testbed for new
technologies that may be incorporated into the next generation of
probes sent to explore the solar system and beyond in the next
century. Engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration say the mission, which could be launched as early as
Oct. 15., is one of the first designed to send a spacecraft away
from the Earth with technology-testing, and not science, as the
main objective.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wesley Huntress, NASA's associate administrator for space
science, said Deep Space 1 was part of a new program to examine and
validate unusual technologies that could be used to produce more
efficient, cheaper scientific spacecraft. Those planning science
missions are sometimes reluctant to risk trying promising, but
untested, new technologies or approaches, he said.
</P>
<P>
   High-risk, but relatively low-cost, missions like Deep Space 1
should give planners more confidence in trying some of these new
ideas in their projects, Huntress said. Appropriately, this
harbinger of the future space program comes on the heels of NASA's
40th anniversary, which was celebrated last week.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Space 1, a 1,000-pound craft crammed with miniature
instruments and devices, is to test 12 innovative technologies in
its first few months in space. Among the technologies aboard are an
autonomous navigation system, a miniature integrated camera and
imaging spectrometer, an integrated ion and electron spectrometer,
advanced software with artificial intelligence that lets the
spacecraft help run its own mission as situations change, and a
variety of new, low-power electronics.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, Deep Space 1's primary mission will culminate
in July when the craft makes a very close flyby of a small asteroid
called 1992 KD. Afterward, if the spacecraft is healthy and NASA
chooses to extend the mission, the probe will fly on to visit a
dying comet known as Wilson-Harrington in January 2001. After that
encounter, the craft could visit the comet Borrelly, one of the
most active to regularly visit the inner solar system, in September
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is expected to cost $152 million, including $42
million for the conventional rocket used to fire the spacecraft
away from Earth, project officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the attention being paid to Deep Space 1 is focusing
on its solar-electric propulsion system, a variation on the concept
of ion drive that has been a mainstay of science fiction for
decades. While ion propulsion units have been tested in space
before, and small ion engines have recently been used to stabilize
communications satellites in high Earth orbits, the new mission
will mark the first time that this type of engine will be used as
the primary drive system for a spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first heard of ion propulsion in 1968 during a Star Trek
episode,'' said Dr. Marc Rayman of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
in Pasadena, Calif., the chief mission engineer for Deep Space 1.
An ion engine uses fuel 10 times more efficiently than conventional
rockets, he said, but it produces an almost imperceptible amount of
thrust. This type of engine works by letting it fire continuously
for months or years, gradually adding momentum to a spacecraft in
the vacuum of space, instead of burning all of its fuel in a few
minutes at high thrust, as conventional rockets do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ion propulsion is acceleration with patience,'' Rayman said.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Space 1 will be sent on its way from Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
boosted by a three-stage Delta rocket. Between two and four weeks
after launching, engineers will begin testing the ion drive,
running it for a 10-day period that will be interrupted every other
day for navigation tests. After the shakedown period and a couple
of weeks to evaluate the results, the engine will be switched on
for long-term thrusting that may continue for several months.
</P>
<P>
   John Stocky, manager of propulsion technology at the Pasadena
laboratory, which is managed by the California Institute of
Technology, said the craft would have 186 pounds of xenon gas
aboard to fuel the engine, ample supplies for the primary and
extended missions. The xenon, a heavy, inert gas, will not be
burned like conventional rocket fuel, but charged electrically to
create high-speed particles that leave the engine so fast that they
produce thrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to turn into fact today what was science fiction
yesterday,'' Stocky said.
</P>
<P>
   When the ion engine is running, he said, xenon is injected into
a chamber and bombarded with high-speed, negatively charged
electrons produced by heating a barium-calcium-aluminate material
carried in tanks near the engine. These electrons, guided by
magnetic rings around the chamber, hit the xenon atoms, knocking
away one of the 54 electrons orbiting each atom's nucleus. The
resulting atoms, with a net positive charge, are known as an ions.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the chamber, which opens into space, are two metal
grids made of molybdenum grids that are charged positively and
negatively, respectively. The charges in the grids create an
electrostatic pull on the xenon ions, accelerating them out of the
engine and into space at more than 62,000 miles per hour, producing
3,000 tiny beams of thrust.
</P>
<P>
   Stocky said it was important to keep the engine chamber and the
rest of the spacecraft electrically neutral by keeping the ions
moving away. If a charge builds up in the spacecraft from the
escaping plume, ions leaving the chamber might come back and negate
any thrust. So an electrode at the rear of the engine shoots
electrons into the glowing blue ion stream leaving the grids,
replacing missing electrons and neutralizing the electrical charge
of the escaping xenon.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The engine on Deep Space 1 should produce about one-250th of a
pound of thrust, Stocky said, comparable to the force exerted by a
single sheet of typing paper resting on the palm of a person's
hand. But this steady thrust increases the speed of the spacecraft
by about 30 feet per second each day, enough to increase Deep Space
1's speed over the life of the primary mission by 8,000 mph,
engineers said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the ion engine will be turned off and the spacecraft
will coast, engineers said. The spacecraft will stop the engine
once a week to take its bearings and send routine signals to Earth,
they said, and it also will remain off for periods of months in an
extended mission when extra energy is not needed as it shapes its
orbit around the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   To provide the electrical power to run the engine, Deep Space 1
will use a new type of solar power array never before flown in
space that concentrates and focuses sunlight onto 3,600
electricity-producing solar cells. The craft will have a pair of
solar wings that expand to 38.6 feet across when fully extended and
these arrays will produce 15 to 20 percent more power than similar
devices the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Atop the solar cells sit 720 cylindrical lenses made of
silicone. The lenses, which look like glass cylinders cut down the
middle, gather incoming sunlight on the rounded outer surfaces and
focus it down to the solar cells below the flat sides of the
half-cylinders. Development of the arrays is co-sponsored by the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Previous unmanned space missions have required ground
controllers to constantly monitor conditions on the spacecraft and
provide navigational information to keep them on course. Rayman
said Deep Space 1 would require fewer than a dozen controllers on
Earth, instead of the hundreds needed for some previous missions,
because it would keep track of itself.
</P>
<P>
   About once a week, the spacecraft will take pictures of stars
with asteroids in the background and use this information to
navigate itself, including having the ability to adjust its course
and decide how close it will come to the asteroid and comets it
targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using stars and asteroids as reference points, the spacecraft
takes pictures of the sky and infers where it is and where it wants
to go,'' Rayman said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of constantly sending information on its condition to
Earth, the craft will occasionally send special signal tones that
signify different states of well-being. The tones range from
``everything is operating acceptably'' to ``there is a problem that
may require help if it worsens'' to ``need urgent assistance from
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   All the technologies of Deep Space 1 combine to point to an
entirely new way of designing and operating robotic scientific
missions away from Earth, Rayman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having one's car find its own way from Los Angeles
to Washington, D.C., and park itself within one foot of its
destination, all the while getting 300 miles to the gallon of
fuel,'' he said. ``This has the potential to change everything.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Despite evidence to the contrary, London fashion isn't
all about fun and games. There are also some real, wearable clothes
coming from designers here.
</P>
<P>
   Take Hussein Chalayan, a Turkish Cypriot who is known for making
political statements with his clothing, like putting models into
chadors, pinning their arms to their sides or sealing their lips
with photographers' gel to represent the repression of women.
</P>
<P>
   For his spring 1999 show, he chose to deal with humanity's
interaction with nature. He called his show ``Geotropics,'' though
how the clothes fitted the theme was not always obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The setting on the night of Sept. 28 was stylized, with a choir
called the Joyful Company of Singers clad in white jump suits like
the coveralls worn by technicians cleaning up toxic waste. As the
choir sang, chanted, mumbled and keened a cappella, Chalayan
presented a collection of spare, modern clothes that just about any
woman would feel comfortable in.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly shift dresses and suits, the styles went a degree or two
beyond minimalism. A collarless jacket might have a stiff square of
fabric forming an angular upright collar behind the neck. Another
might have a double arc forming an asymmetrical lapel.
</P>
<P>
   A slit or sheer strip might slice down one side of a dress.
Subtly decorative touches included white top stitching on blue,
wavy gray lines on black, origami folds or flat pleats on sheer
white organza.
</P>
<P>
   Of actual colors there were almost none save for a faded denim
blue and the palest mint green.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few eccentric touches, like what looked like
upside-down camisoles attached to and hanging down from knit
dresses, or geometrical plastic headgear on silk dresses that were
half striped and half solid gray.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was a chair worn as a jacket with the arms as
sleeves, the back as a collar and the seat as the back.
</P>
<P>
   But those aberrations aside, Chalayan offered an intelligent way
for women to dress as the millennium approaches. Although the
clothes looked nothing like Courreges' space-age uniforms of the
1960s, they could well be considered a vision of the future for the
'90s generation. A bit more feminine, yet equally sleek and pure.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable British house of Burberry has been reinvented
under the leadership of Rose Marie Bravo, the American retailer who
was formerly the president of Saks Fifth Avenue and before that the
chairman of I. Magnin.
</P>
<P>
   The hip young collection shown in the company's Haymarket
headquarters was designed by Roberto Menichetti, an Italian who
grew up in his family's fabric mills and who once worked for Jil
Sander.
</P>
<P>
   Menichetti's main achievement was to take Burberry classics like
the trench coat, the safari jacket and, of course, the signature
plaid and give them a new twist.
</P>
<P>
   The trench coat has not only lost extraneous epaulets, tabs,
pockets and buttons, but also sometimes turns up as a narrow double
dress with a hidden closure.
</P>
<P>
   The plaid, instead of being reserved for linings and such,
becomes an ankle-length dress worn under a shorter gauze dress.
</P>
<P>
   The kilt, without pleats, is streamlined, and the blazer is cut
as small and close to the body as a sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The leather motorcycle jacket, in Menichetti's hands, loses its
hard edge, rendered the color of caramel and treated until it is
just as smooth and silky.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the collection, linens that have been woven on
antique looms are given an interesting texture, and canvas is
softened with a coating of voile.
</P>
<P>
   Colors are mainly neutrals, with a hint of the blue and lavender
of a sunset sky and with the addition of a yellow adapted from a
pair of the duke of Windsor's trousers and eminently more suitable
to women's wear.
</P>
<P>
   With this collection, Burberry becomes a fashion name to reckon
with.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Williamson, just two years in business, has already
established himself as a designer of choice for young women who
want to look feminine and pretty yet sexy in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers _ hand-painted, embroidered or beaded _ decorate silks
and even a strapless paper dress. Williamson showed capri pants
worn with sequined tube tops or satin Chinese jackets. Asymmetrical
hemlines are sometimes sliced up to the waist on one side and
allowed to fall to below the knee or to the floor on the other.
These clothes are definitely for someone who likes to show lots of
leg and lots of skin.
</P>
<P>
   White is the basic color, with exuberant flashes of pink,
orange, fuchsia and royal blue. Williamson isn't blazing any new
fashion trails, but he is carving out a place for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Groves, who will probably always be known as the designer
who stuffed a model's bodice with flies, is still trying hard to be
noticed.
</P>
<P>
   His show opened with a laser beam igniting a line of fire down
the sand-covered runway, followed by two models wearing false
faces.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, a man wearing a tiny hat perched on the side
of his head would appear, but essentially there was precious little
that was new.
</P>
<P>
   Groves blatantly adapted the ideas of other designers, showing
versions of Alexander McQueen's frock coats over bare skin and even
McQueen's buttocks-revealing pants. Groves draped a jacket with
multi-strand chains, echoing a motif of Chalayan's 1997 show. And
the wide-leg pants with a skirt back were just too gimicky.
</P>
<P>
   But this is only Groves' third show, and he may yet develop a
style of his own.
</P>
<P>
   This London season offered the fashion flock a mixture of
madness and sanity, originality and banality, but it's the
excitement of shows like Chalayan's and, earlier, McQueen's, and
the hope of discovering a new talent comparable to theirs, that
will no doubt keep the fashion faithful returning.

FOR TOTE BAGS, A SLIM FIT  
(JT)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To complement this fall's easy, unstructured
clothing, tote bags should be sleek and slim. With flat heels all
the rage, there is no need to carry extra shoes; there should be
room just for papers and reading material _ that's the ideal,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A new collection of bags by Lambertson/Truex is setting the
style for the modern skinny tote. Its collection at Bergdorf
Goodman is in black leather or calf hair and in leopard-patterned
calf hair ($400 to $465). Bergdorf's also has Fendi's nylon jersey
tote ($350).
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York has flat totes in black or brown leather by
Dries Van Noten ($525 and $550) and in its private label collection
($295). In Henri Bendel's own collection there is a
crocodile-embossed leather tote ($248). The store also has a
leather tote by Furla ($328) and microfiber bags by Isabelle Fiore
($178) and Kazuyo Nakano ($228).
</P>
<P>
   Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's flat leather totes in two sizes ($455 and
$510) are at Neiman Marcus.

 &HT;    BOOK IS PREQUEL AND SEQUEL TO CASABLANCA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories for
release Wednesday, Oct. 7.

   WASHINGTON _ ``The Lisbon plane soared away from the dense,
swirling fog of Casablanca, up and into the night. ...''
</P>
<P>
   And so begins what author Michael Walsh jokingly calls his
``literary suicide mission'' _ a novel that surrounds the events of
the1942 classic film, ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   The book entitled ``As Times Goes By'' (Warner Books, $25) is
both a sequel and a prequel to the film _ telling the story of what
happened both after and before the fateful three days when Rick and
Ilsa are so dramatically reunited and so sadly parted on the edge
of World War II. It will be published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who was music critic for Time Magazine from 1981 through
1997, knows he now faces tough critics among the millions of movie
buffs who know by heart the film starring Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows `Casablanca.' Everybody loves `Casablanca,'''
said Walsh. So withering comparative reviews ``are a chance you
take when you get involved in a project like this. I expect my
former colleagues to be fair and accurate. You obviously take a
chance with a shared cultural myth like this. I hope the book
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, who teaches journalism at Boston University, was
recruited to write the novel by Maureen Egen, the president of
Warner Books, which owns the rights to the film characters and to
any subsequent film to be made from ``As Time Goes By.'' Walsh said
Egen saw something in his earlier novel, ``Exchange Alley,'' that
``made her think I could do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his book is destined to be a movie that will
inspire even more comparisons, the author said ``that's not my
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much harder row to hoe to make a movie 55 years later''
with the original characters still so set in the audience's mind,
said Walsh, 49, in a telephone interview. ``I had the easier job.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the lingering intrigue of ``Casablanca'' involves the
film's unanswered questions: What are the ties between Rick, the
tough saloon keeper, and Sam, his enigmatic piano player? Does Ilsa
love Victor Laszlo, her husband and a Czech patriot dedicated to
freeing his homeland from Nazi occupation? And, of course, do Rick
and Ilsa ever see each other again after the plane disappears into
the foggy night, leaving Rick on the runway in Casablanca?
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Walsh has decided that Rick is a wanted, former
gangster from East Harlem whose real name is Yitzik Baline. The
East Harlem background explains why Sam, his best friend, is a
black man and the gangster past suggests why Rick can't return to
New York. Bogart played a lot of gangsters in other movies, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   And Laszlo's mission must be the assassination of Nazi Reinhard
Hydrich in Prague, the most significant act of the Czech resistance
during World War II. And who better than a streetwise gangster to
help plan a major ``hit?'' So naturally all the film's major
characters must be reunited in this dramatic conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   After being approached to write the book, Walsh said his initial
reaction was: ``What do I have to bring to the party?''
</P>
<P>
   He began to spin out ideas from the period and setting _ World
War II, Europe, New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have an `Oh-my-God' reaction. I had a `Can I do
this?' reaction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a `Casablanca' cultist,'' he said. So he rented
the movie and decided there was enough material pointing in both
directions to do the book.
</P>
<P>
   Having the main characters already established made the writing
harder, he said. ``When you invent your own characters, ... you
have an initial rapport whith them. Taking other characters,
especially from a movie where their physical appearace was
determined by actors rather than imagined by the author, was a real
challenge. You're not only taking Rick and Ilsa but also Bogart and
Bergman and incorporating them into characters on the page.''
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay for ``Casablanca'' was a collaborative effort of
seven writers and was based on a 1940 play entitled ``Everybody
Comes to Rick's.'' Walsh resurrected one character, an American
named Lois Meridith, who was in the play but not the movie.
</P>
<P>
   However, the book is clearly evocative of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he hopes ``Casablanca'' fans ``will feel that I have
honored the integrity of the movie, taken care of the characters
while they were in my possession'' and that reading the book makes
them want to watch the movie yet again.

A GLOW IN THE DARK, AND A LESSON IN SCIENTIFIC PERIL
</HEADLINE>
 (The Science Times)  
 (fb) 
By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year is the 100th anniversary of the Nobel-prize-winning
experiments by Marie and Pierre Curie into the origins of
radioactivity, and their discovery of the radioactive elements
polonium and radium. Marie Curie herself coined the term
``radioactivity,'' and a century ago, the word conveyed promise and
evoked excitement. As the spontaneous release of energy from
certain substances, radioactivity was regarded as a newly
identified force of nature, something that would surely lead to
insights into the structure of matter, and to practical
applications in medicine and science.
</P>
<P>
   But as they would with other 20th century marvels, scientists
soon realized that they might have unleashed a menace. They began
to suspect that radiation might be a threat to health. Another
decade went by, though, before those concerns were taken seriously.
Marie Curie tended to deny the perils of radiation, despite being
deeply troubled by the deaths in the 1920's of colleagues and
radiation workers from leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Curie's decades of exposure left her chronically ill and nearly
blind from cataracts, and ultimately caused her death at 67, in
1934, from either severe anemia or leukemia. But she never fully
acknowledged that her work had ruined her health.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Irene Joliot-Curie, and son-in-law, Frederic
Joliot-Curie _ also Nobel Prize winners _ continued her work with
radioactive material. Eventually, both also died of diseases
induced by radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But by all accounts Marie Curie was so intent on her research
that even if she had known the risks there is no reason to believe
she would have done anything differently _ or that she necessarily
should have, given her achievements.
</P>
<P>
   When Marie and Pierre Curie began to experiment with radiation,
advances in physics had just begun to capture the public
imagination. X-rays, discovered by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895, were
being used to diagnose broken bones and help surgeons find bullets,
and X-ray pictures of the human body had fascinated newspaper
readers.
</P>
<P>
   The Curies set out to study radioactivity in 1898, two years
after Henri Becquerel discovered the phenomenon when he noticed
that crystals of uranium salt could fog a photographic plate.
Initially, the Curies studied emissions from various minerals and
by the end of the year had made discoveries that would lead to a
Nobel Prize they shared with Becquerel in 1903, and another awarded
to Marie alone in 1911. (Because the Nobel is not awarded
posthumously, Pierre Curie, who died in an accident in 1906, was
not cited.)
</P>
<P>
   Their first accomplishment was to show that radioactivity was a
property of atoms themselves. Scientifically, that was the most
important of their findings, because it helped other researchers
refine their understanding of atomic structure.
</P>
<P>
   The second, more famous discovery, was the discovery of polonium
and radium. Radium was the most radioactive substance the Curies
had encountered. Its radioactivity is due to the large size of the
atom, which makes the nucleus unstable and prone to decay, usually
to radon and then lead, by emitting particles and energy as it
seeks a more stable configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Radium does not exist free in nature; rather, like uranium, it
is melded into the mineral pitchblende. To study radium, the Curies
spent countless hours bathed in a radioactive miasma, stirring vats
of pitchblende in order to extract infinitesimal amounts of radium.
Marie Curie struggled to purify it for medical uses, including
early radiation treatment for tumors.
</P>
<P>
   But radium's bluish glow caught people's fancy, and companies in
the United States began mining it and selling it as a novelty: for
glow-in-the-dark light pulls, for instance, and bogus cure-all
patent medicines that actually killed people.
</P>
<P>
   Wristwatches with radium-painted luminous dials became a fad
almost overnight. The first large factory to produce the glowing
watches, the Radium Luminous Materials Corp., was opened in 1917,
in Orange, N.J. Soon, other companies opened plants in Connecticut
and Illinois. Several million radium watches and clocks and
instrument dials were made through World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The glowing numerals had to be hand-painted onto the watch
dials, a delicate task deemed women's work. Claudia Clark, a
professor of history at Central Michigan University who wrote
``Radium Girls'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1997), said
the dial painters worked in ``studios,'' where they mixed their own
paint from a powdered base. The workers, some as young as 15,
painted about 250 dials a day for a cent and a half apiece, five
and a half days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, some of the young women became horribly ill
from their exposure to radium, and some died. They have become a
notorious chapter in the history of occupational disease.
</P>
<P>
   Clark estimates that 4,000 women were dial painters.
</P>
<P>
   Until sometime in the 1920's, the women were encouraged to use a
technique called ``lip-pointing,'' which meant using their lips and
tongues to shape their paintbrushes to a fine tip. Not only were
their mouths and teeth bathed in radium all day, but the women
probably swallowed and inhaled it as well, and they often went home
so coated with radioactive paint dust that they glowed in the dark.
Unaware of any risk, some painted their lips, teeth, eyelids,
fingernails and the buttons on their clothes with the luminous
solution. According to Clark, factory owners actually told the
women that radium was good for them, and would make their cheeks
glow.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more knowledgeable employees in other parts of the
plant were beginning to use protective gear and shields when
working with radium. And in 1921, while the dial-painting studios
were in full swing, Marie Curie visited America and was presented
with one gram of radium _ which was enclosed in a 110-pound, lead
lined casket.
</P>
<P>
   The dial-painters' first health problems turned up in the
1920's, when some of the women began suffering from fatigue, anemia
and trouble with their teeth. When dentists tried to extract the
bad teeth, they were horrified to find jawbones so diseased that
chunks of bone came out as well. The extraction sites did not heal,
and infections set in.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the women's bodies were actually radioactive,
because radium had been absorbed by their bones. Government
researchers studied live and dead dial painters and used the data
to calculate safe exposure levels for future generations of workers
handling radioactive materials.
</P>
<P>
   By 1923, five young women from the Orange plant had died from a
condition that came to be called ``radium jaw.'' The same thing had
begun happening to dial painters in Connecticut and Illinois. As
more time passed, some of the women developed bone cancers.
</P>
<P>
   What makes radium so dangerous is that it forms chemical bonds
in the same way as calcium, and the body can mistake it for calcium
and absorb it in the bones. Then, it can bombard cells with
radiation at close range, which may cause bone tumors or
bone-marrow damage that can give rise to anemia or leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though they put a stop to lip-pointing, the radium companies
initially tried to deny any connection between radium and illness.
Legal battles dragged on. Some women received settlements, but
others never did.
</P>
<P>
   One radium girl who died was Margaret Looney, who died in 1929,
at 24, after seven years of work at the Luminous Processes Plant in
Ottawa, Ill. Her sister Jean Schott, who still lives in Ottawa, was
only 6 when Looney died, but she remembers her mother rising at 5
every morning and walking a mile to the cemetery to visit the
grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every family has sadness and grief,'' Schott said. ``Nobody
gets by without it. But Margaret's death was unnecessary.'' The
family sought compensation, but never received any.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 years after Looney's death, her family allowed
researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, which maintains the
dial painters' medical records, to exhume her body for study.
Looney's bones, Schott said, were found to be highly radioactive.
</P>
<P>
   A series of free lectures and films titled ``Marie Curie and the
Centenary of the Discovery of Radioactivity'' will be offered Oct.
8 and 9 at the New York Academy of Medicine, and Oct. 10 at the New
York Academy of Sciences. From October through December, a free
exhibition on Marie and Pierre Curie will be on display in the

MISS AMERICA: IT HELPS TO BE AN EVANGELICAL 
</HEADLINE>

WHITE in Kansas City at (800) 444-0267 or (816) 822-8448, or fax

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    A couple Saturdays ago, my husband and I played a board game
with the television on in the background. As it happened, the Miss
America pageant aired that night. Usually, I don't watch the show
-- placing beauty pageants on a scale somewhere between inane and
degrading.
 &HT;    This year, however, I got hooked. The event opened with the
young women introducing themselves along with their states and
colleges -- a surprising number saying they attended Christian
colleges or Bible schools.
 &HT;    For most of the audience, the names of these rather obscure
institutions probably passed unnoticed. But as Miss Virginia,
Nicole Johnson, proudly proclaimed her affiliation with Regent
University -- television evangelist Pat Robertson's graduate school
-- I confidently predicted, ``She's going to win.''
 &HT;    Two hours later, she was crowned Miss America.
 &HT;    The following Monday, Robertson and his co-host, Terry Meeuwsen,
a former Miss America herself, exulted in Johnson's victory. ``Hey,
you know, Terry,'' commented Pat, ``you see so many Miss Americas
who are Christians and many times, spirit-filled Christians ...
It's almost like an unfair advantage, you think?''
 &HT;    Although I doubt there's a religious test for becoming Miss
America, there is no doubt Robertson's observation was correct.
Over the pageant's history -- and especially in recent years --
Miss America often has been a conservative Christian.
 &HT;    On one level, the trend toward evangelical Miss Americas is not
surprising. After all, beauty pageants -- even those conducted
under the pretense of scholarship -- have fallen into disrepute
with many feminist and post-feminist young women. Besides being a
relic of an age where women were valued for looks rather than
achievement, beauty pageants have turned into a multi-million
dollar industry churning out contestants like assembly line
products.
 &HT;    Who would want to submit herself to years of beauty pageants?
 &HT;    For women who aspire to modelling or other media the answer is
obvious: pageants provide training. But Christian women? The answer
is equally obvious. Of all American women, conservative Christians
are least influenced by feminism and most reluctant to embrace
feminist criticism of traditional femininity -- including critiques
of beauty pageants.
 &HT;    As a result, women from prestige colleges and universities --
where feminist or post-feminist cultures have greater sway -- are
less likely to enter pageants. Women from Christian colleges and
conservative churches -- where feminism is often viewed as inimical
to faith -- seem more likely to enter a pageant, thus forming a
self-selected Christian pool of candidates.
 &HT;    Although evangelicals might attribute Miss America's success to
God, a more mundane dynamic is evident: young Christian women, with
their pre-feminist traditionalism, probably constitute the largest
group (other than models) of beauty contestants. It's no miracle.
It's numbers.
 &HT;    On a different level, however, an evangelical Miss America
should be surprising. After all, conservative Christians believe in
a Bible whose admonitions seem critical of beauty pageants -- such
as ``women should dress themselves modestly and decently in
suitable clothing, not with their hair braided, or with gold,
pearls, or expensive clothes, but with good works, as is proper for
women who profess reverence for God.''
 &HT;    The New Testament praises women (and men, too) for their
internal condition -- ``clothe yourselves with compassion,
kindness, humility, meekness and patience'' -- condemning showy
appearance. The Bible teaches beauty flows from the heart and is
not readily visible to the world.
 &HT;    For generations, conservative Christians took this seriously --
and literally. In evangelical churches, women dressed modestly,
wore little or no make-up, and arranged hair with a minimum of
fuss. Simple dress expressed biblical faithfulness.
 &HT;    If not exactly the devil's work, beauty pageants were worldly.
No good Christian girl would ever display her body -- especially in
a swimsuit -- to be judged. Good works were her attire; God her
judge.
 &HT;    Strangely enough, this view of femininity backs up into feminist
theory. Both Christian tradition and feminism argue that a woman's
value is not determined by her appearance. Rather, a woman's
internal disposition -- intelligence, compassion and values -- and
external accomplishments -- service, charity and achievement --
demonstrate her worth. Looks do not matter; full personhood does.
 &HT;    When feminism, however, came to the same conclusion as biblical
teaching regarding women's worth, conservative Christians rejected
their own message. Instead of maintaining a biblical view of
appearance, one oddly coherent with contemporary feminism, they
embraced America's beauty culture. No longer protesting pageants as
worldly, they paraded down Atlantic City's runway -- praising
Christian girls who won earthly crowns instead of striving for
heavenly ones.
 &HT;    Sorry, Pat and Terry. Nicole Johnson's victory is neither a
miracle nor a victory for Christian values. Claiming Miss America
as your own only proves how far from your own Bible you've strayed
-- and how worldly in your quest for power and prestige you've
become.

THREAT OF CANCER DOESN'T SHAKE THE BOND BETWEEN 2-YEAR-OLD TWINS

   PLEASANT VALLEY, Mo. _ Kaitlin has the doll. Kelsey wants the
doll.
</P>
<P>
   They fight. That's what 2-year-olds do.
</P>
<P>
   But along comes a bully _ leukemia. That's when these twin
sisters grasp hands and hold on tight.
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlin is the one with the disease. Kelsey has stuck by her
side for a year of treatment, and anybody who tries to break up
this alliance is looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlin screams a fit if she has to see the doctor or go to the
hospital without her sister. Kelsey doesn't even ask; she just
jumps in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick,'' Kaitlin says from under a floppy hat that covers
her bald head.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey nods and puts her arm around her sister. ``She's sick.''
</P>
<P>
   It's crazy to think the girls know what's going on, say their
parents, Elizabeth and Dale Mundell of Pleasant Valley.
</P>
<P>
   They are toddlers _ the target demographic of Rugrats and
Barney. But Kaitlin and Kelsey seem to be fighting for a life's
worth of fun and memories due them as twin sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow...they know that something is wrong and they need to
stick together,'' Elizabeth Mundell said.
</P>
<P>
   The family learned recently that a bone marrow transplant from a
donor in the Netherlands had fallen through. A transplant from a
donor's umbilical cord could give Kaitlin a longer survival time,
but finding a match has been difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The twins are not identical; Kelsey is not a match.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the treatments and the search for a donor continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaitlin is fine with all this as long as Kelsey is with her,''
Elizabeth Mundell said. ``And Kelsey doesn't seem to mind spending
long days at the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Kaitlin gets weekly chemotherapy at Children's Mercy
Hospital in Kansas City, Kelsey watches from the corner. Sometimes,
Kelsey squeezes past a nurse to give Kaitlin a toy. She takes her
sister juice.
</P>
<P>
   The Mundells were puzzled at first by such camaraderie from
children too young to say the word or know its meaning. But now the
parents cherish the bond and the comfort it brings both girls.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a crazy notion, said Jerry Wyckoff, a child
psychologist. He doesn't know the Mundell family but says twins can
be so close that they pick up on each other's emotions, including
stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sisters are getting comfort from each other,'' Wyckoff
said. ``This may not be provable, and these girls certainly can't
articulate it, but something is going on here, and things like that
can occur with twins.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Mundell learned early not to get in the way. He once left
Kelsey at home when he drove Kaitlin to Children's Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we crossed the river, Kaitlin knew where we were headed,
and she threw such a screaming fit I nearly went back home and got
Kelsey.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only time Kelsey hasn't been with her sister was a
night in July when doctors thought Kaitlin would die of a staph
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see my sissy,'' Kelsey told her mother as family
gathered at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Mundell didn't know whether that was a good idea.
Doctors had pumped so much fluid into Kaitlin to fight the
infection that she was nearly unrecognizable because of swelling.
</P>
<P>
   But her mother took Kelsey into the room in the intensive care
unit. Kaitlin lay still in a drug-induced coma.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey looked down at her awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my sissy?'' she finally asked her mother.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Elizabeth Mundell sat in her living room
and talked of her family's troubles. She noticed Kelsey standing
within a nose of the television screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelsey!'' she demanded quickly. ``Back away from the TV _
now!''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer, she explained. Radiation from television screens has
been suspected of causing cancer in children.
</P>
<P>
   Leukemia invaded the Mundell family about a year ago, when
Kaitlin kept falling down at a wedding. And she dragged a leg as
she walked.
</P>
<P>
   The early diagnosis was an inner-ear infection. When medication
failed to help, another doctor examined Kaitlin.
</P>
<P>
   By this time her eyes were bulging from their sockets.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor suspected cancerous tumors behind the eyes. The
family soon made a trip to Children's Mercy, where a doctor ordered
X-rays to confirm the tumors.
</P>
<P>
   No tumors were found. But other tests indicated abnormal blood
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlin had acute lymphocytic leukemia, a doctor told her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The news threw the Mundell household into a tailspin. Elizabeth
Mundell had just opened her own insurance business. Her husband ran
a car-repair business.
</P>
<P>
   The Mundells have four other children from previous marriages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit and became a regular Mr. Mom,'' Dale Mundell said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlin soon began chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common of childhood
cancers. Cancerous blood cells accumulate in the bone marrow and
spread to the liver, the spleen, the kidneys and the central
nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Prognosis is typically good. Ninety-eight percent of children
with the disease attain remission in four to six weeks of
treatment, and 80 percent are cured.
</P>
<P>
   But chemotherapy did not put Kaitlin into remission. The failure
put her into the ``high-risk category.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors decided to pursue a bone marrow transplant. Trips to
Children's Mercy for chemotherapy became more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital staff grew to know Kelsey as well as they knew Kaitlin.
Visits to the hospital can last up to six hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here has pretty much become their life,'' Dale Mundell
said. ``And the people who work here are almost family now.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day the girls wheeled in aboard a double stroller
pushed by their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Kelsey. Hi, Kaitlin,'' a nurse greeted them. ``You girls
look so pretty today.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``sticker lady,'' a volunteer who hands out stickers, also
called them by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelsey didn't like me at first,'' said Abbas Emami, Kaitlin's
doctor. ``She does now, but I think at first she thought I was the
reason her sister was sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Each hospital visit begins when a nurse weighs and measures
Kaitlin.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey steps up next, and the nurse gladly does the same for
her.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the sisters are on the floor, playing with blocks and
flipping through books.
</P>
<P>
   As they waited for the chemotherapy, Dale Mundell said that
Kaitlin and Kelsey would still have to make regular trips to the
hospital even if a bone marrow transplant brought Kaitlin into
remission.
</P>
<P>
   A stranger overhearing the conversation might have thought both
girls had the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Kaitlin and Kelsey would probably agree.

EMPLOYERS LEARN IMPORTANCE TO RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS, PRACTICES TO
STAFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: On Sunday and Monday, members of the Jewish faith
celebrate Rosh Hashanah; on the 29th and 30th they observe Yom
Kippur. Some may be absent from the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Christians are accustomed to having their important religious
days recognized as secular American holidays. Time off is usually a
matter of routine. But members of other faiths often have to do a
lot of explaining to their bosses. Sometimes, they have to use
personal or vacation days.
</P>
<P>
   As America's workforce grows increasingly diverse, employers are
learning why it's wise to understand different religious holidays
and practices _ and not penalize workers for observing them.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, discrimination on the basis of religion is a
violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. For another, it
makes good business sense in a tight labor market to retain good
workers who might leave if meshing their work and religious lives
becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Council on Islamic-American Relations, for
example, has gone to bat for several Muslim workers around the
country. Some were women whose bosses saw their hijabs, the
traditional head scarves, and sputtered things like, ``Unless you
take that stupid thing off, you have to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   After the council's intervention (and much corporate
telephoning), the employers allowed the workers to stay and wear
their hijabs, although at least one restaurant company decreed the
scarf must be in the company's colors.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter whether workers are Jewish, Muslim,
Seventh-Day Adventist or an adherent of any other faith. All must
be able to apply for and keep their jobs without fear of career
reprisals because of religious observation. Smart employers know
that diverse employees forge a stronger link to their increasingly
diverse customer base.

ALASKA PROVES TO BE A GOLD MINE EVEN AT THE TIME OF DEPARTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska _ Probably they were fine people, those folks
just arriving with their rod cases, their duffels and their noisy
enthusiasm. Under other circumstances we might even have liked
them.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few minutes they would be climbing aboard the
floatplanes for their flight out to the lodge. Their pleasure still
was ahead, while ours was finished.
</P>
<P>
   So we eyed them sidelong, with furtive envy.
</P>
<P>
   The taxi came and we made our goodbyes, then wedged ourselves in
with our gear and two huge Styrofoam cartons of frozen salmon
fillets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll still be like a rock when you get home tomorrow,''
Duke Bertke said, and sent us off with a wave.
</P>
<P>
   It was just before noon, and ours was a late evening flight. We
had nearly eight hours to kill.
</P>
<P>
   First we stopped past the airport to drop off our luggage and
our fish. The Anchorage air terminal must be one of very few in the
United States whose amenities for travelers include a walk-in
freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Then another cab delivered us downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Often, at the end of something good, there's only anticlimax and
impatience to be away. But this day was different.
</P>
<P>
   The far northern summer may be short, but the long daylight and
abundant rains produce not only radishes the size of turnips,
5-pound tomatoes and cabbages bigger than bushels. There's also an
exuberance of blooming. At every hand was the riot of flowers for
which Alaska is famous.
</P>
<P>
   And even on a Sunday, Anchorage was a lively place.
</P>
<P>
   We followed the twang of a country song to a big tent on a
pretty square. The music was by a couple in their 70s who'd driven
up from Texas in a camper to visit their Air Force son and his
family, then decided to stay and play a while.
</P>
<P>
   The affair under the tent was a benefit for the Foster
Grandparents program _ a salmon bake, what else? And that accounted
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly the whole afternoon we spent at the handsome Anchorage
Museum of History and Art, whose extensive collection would put to
shame civic museums in many far larger places. Works by travelers,
adventurers and native artists bring alive the Alaskan experience
from the days of early exploration to the present.
</P>
<P>
   There was just time then for supper, in a nice little cafe that
doubled as a book shop, before heading back to the airport to claim
our bags from storage and our fish from the freezer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid we're overbooked on this flight,'' said the woman
at the airline counter. ``So we're asking for volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the offer?'' asked my daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two round-trip tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To anywhere?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere in the continental U.S. If you're interested, tell
the agent at the gate.''
</P>
<P>
   So we walked back to the gate area, where the real poker game
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``When's the next flight?'' my daughter asked the gate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hours,'' he told her. ``It makes a stop in Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four of us. We might be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free round-trip ticket,'' said the agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady out front said two tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right. Two tickets then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere in the U.S., right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not Alaska,'' said the agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us it was anywhere in the continental U.S., and
Alaska's on the continent. In that case...''
</P>
<P>
   My daughter should have been a professional gambler.
</P>
<P>
   The agent looked down at his passenger list, then out at the
gate area crowded with more people than would fit on the plane.
Four of us together wouldn't solve his problem, but we would be a
good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' he said, in a weak voice. ``We'll throw in
Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   So as I write these notes we are sitting here in the Anchorage
airport with eight round-trip tickets among us, waiting for a plane
that will deliver us home only a couple of hours later than the
flight we were supposed to be on.
</P>
<P>
   And it's perfectly understood, without anyone even having to say
it, that we'll be using some of those gift tickets to come back.

CLIFF DWELLERS BATTLE INSURANCE COMPANIES OVER LOSS OF HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFICA, Calif. _ Nine families on Esplanade Drive thought they
had bought themselves secure serenity. They enjoyed a panoramic
view of the Pacific Ocean and the sea song of waves crashing
against the cliff below their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, they say, the federal government had insured them
against loss if the relentless ocean wore away the cliff and
toppled their houses. After all, the Federal Insurance
Administration's brochure said their policies covered ``losses
resulting from erosion caused by waves or currents of water
activity exceeding anticipated cyclical levels of erosion
accompanied by a severe storm, flash flood, abnormal tidal surge,
or the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the El Nino phenomenon, the unusual warming of waters
in the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   And there went the flood insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Three insurance companies _ State Farm, Bankers Trust and
Allstate _ are refusing to pay the residents' claims, arguing that
the cliff was eroding before last winter's fierce storms. The news
has come as a stomach-turning shock to the residents who lived on
Esplanade. Three have hired lawyers and are ready to sue. Others
have enlisted the city of Pacifica, which has lodged an appeal with
the Federal Insurance Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd have to find some place through the winter, but
I thought I'd be able to get my life settled before this,'' said
Jane Tollini, whose home at 556 Esplanade Drive finally pitched
over the cliff on May 6. ``I had no idea I'd be stuck all through
the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   No spot on the California coast was more photographed or written
about during El Nino's stormy climax than Esplanade Drive, where
homes toppled into the ocean or teetered between land and thin air
as distressed homeowners watched.
</P>
<P>
   The wave action in February and March, coupled with high tides,
was so violent that it tore away about 40 feet of the cliff on
which the Esplanade Drive homes were perched, as much as had been
eroded in the previous 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three of the five remaining homes are red-tagged and
uninhabitable; the other two don't look like long-term investments.
Most of the west side of Esplanade Drive has reverted to the sand
dune it was in 1948, when the modest two- and three-bedroom homes
were built.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say the claims are invalid for a variety of reasons:
the cliff had been gradually eroding for years, five of the
residents bought their insurance in the middle of the storms _ when
damage was clearly foreseeable _ and no water actually entered
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Tollini, for instance, purchased a $250,000 flood insurance
policy on Feb. 11 from State Farm for $345. It took effect on March
13. She went about her job as keeper of the penguin exhibit at San
Francisco Zoo feeling protected from financial loss if not from the
elements, and moved into her best friend's house when hers was
uninhabitable.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough to see her house fall over the cliff in May,
but in July she got a worse shock. Her claim had been disallowed
because her loss ``was not caused by flood'' and also because the
forces that wrecked it were already in progress when the policy
kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   She said State Farm heavily advertised its flood insurance
during the storms and presumably knew what it was insuring when it
sold her the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we found out that high wave action was included in the
policy, all of us on the block jumped on it,'' she said. The
$250,000 policy limit ``seemed fair,'' although she figures her
house was worth more. ``I'm not looking to get rich on this,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   And she dismissed the insurer's contention that erosion was well
under way before El Nino struck. When she moved into her Esplanade
Drive home six years ago, ``it had 34 feet of fenced back yard and
8 to 12 feet beyond the fence, and for years I watched that very
large back yard stay right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Municipal officials in Pacifica, which is south of San
Francisco, agree. In appealing the coverage denial decision to the
Federal Insurance Administration _ a branch of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency _ Pacifica was relying on a report
prepared by geologist Kenneth R. Lajoie of the U.S. Geological
Survey, who has studied the coast for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main causes of the severe cliff erosion along Esplanade
Drive ... were near-record precipitation, heavy surf and
exceptionally high tides,'' Lajoie wrote. ``The rain saturated the
ground, weakening the poorly (hardened) sediment exposed on the
cliff face.''
</P>
<P>
   Lajoie's report is evidence that the insurance carriers'
conclusion was wrong, said retired attorney Beverly Axelrod, who
lost her home of 14 years when the saturated cliff gave way beneath
it. But ``if we can't convince them through that report, then it'll
be litigation or politics, I guess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the residents of Esplanade Drive, Axelrod
purchased flood insurance five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The final resolution of the Esplanade Drive homeowners' claims
may turn on the definition of the word ``flood.'' It has never been
precisely defined by the courts, according to attorneys for both
the insurers and the homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``People understand that when the water gets in your house,
that's a flood,'' said Clarke Holland, the San Francisco lawyer
hired by State Farm in the Esplanade Drive case. ``The more
difficult problem arises when no water gets in your house. Do you
have coverage?''
</P>
<P>
   Holland said that the decision to deny coverage was in fact made
by the government's managers of the National Flood Insurance
Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Routine claims don't go to them, but on claims like Esplanade,
which are clearly out of the norm, State Farm goes to NFIP,''
Holland said. ``It was their decision not to pay those claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Late-purchased policies like Tollini's raise another potentially
disqualifying issue; that is, that coverage is denied because
damage occurred before the policy's effective date.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to her carrier, Tollini's lawyer, Richard Eric Roby,
notes that the policy's coverage is ``limited exclusively to
buildings and personal property'' _ that is, the house itself and
what was in it.
</P>
<P>
   It does not cover the land under her house. In fact, he noted,
her house was still standing until May 6 _ months after the onset
of the violent wave action that ultimately did it in.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA has agreed to spend $13 million for infrastructure repair
and public assistance for El Nino-caused damage, including $1.5
million for a rock seawall at the base of the cliff below Esplanade
Drive.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA may eventually contribute more; Pacifica last month applied
for a grant to prevent disastrous storm erosion in the future. FEMA
will occasionally grant funds to permanently fix problems the
government knows will inevitably recur. The classic example is the
removal of entire towns from the Mississippi River flood plain
following the epic flood of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   If the application is approved, Esplanade Drive residents who
lost their homes would be paid $140 per square foot _ about 50
cents on the dollar value of their homes _ and their lots would
become open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would turn it into parkland,'' Pacifica Code Enforcement
Officer Sarah Albee said. ``It's a last resort for these people.''

SCANDAL DOMINATES NEWS, BUT BUSINESS OF GOVERNING THE NATION
CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Capitol Hill the other day, Attorney General
Janet Reno spoke about parental kidnappings and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan talked about turmoil in the financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Neither mentioned the words ``Monica Lewinsky,'' ``President
Clinton'' or ``impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate talked about Russian missiles falling into the hands
of terrorists. The House debated how much to spend on child
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Washington may be fixated on sex and scandal, but it still has a
government to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of work going on around here, but the perception
out there is we're all kind of standing around here chatting about
you-know-who,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, a Republican from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Some are, but that's their lot in life right now. The House
Judiciary Committee, which unloaded yet another raft of sex and
scandal documents Friday about the president's affair with the
former White House intern, will begin deliberations Monday about
whether he should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Republican and Democratic members of the committee have been
shuffling in and out of news conferences at which they accuse the
other side of being more partisan. But nearly everybody else on
Capitol Hill was concerned with more mundane matters last week,
such as tax cuts, alcohol abuse on college campuses and the
military's state of readiness, or lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our forces are showing increasing signs of serious wear,''
Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``Anecdotal and now measurable
evidence indicates that our current readiness is fraying and that
the long-term health of the total force is in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, just down the hall from the military brass, the
Senate Environment and Public Works Committee was talking about the
protection of migratory birds.
</P>
<P>
   Life and death decisions share time in Congress with the tiny
details. The secretaries of state and defense late one afternoon
privately briefed senators for two hours about air strikes against
Yugoslavia. Earlier that day some of the same senators spent 5 1//2
hours debating whether the government should build a 30-mile gravel
road to connect a remote Alaska village with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, led by Alaska's two GOP senators, want to build
the road. The Democrats, backed by the environmental lobby, oppose
construction in a federally mandated wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the Democratic leadership willing to risk the lives of
Alaska's Aleut people under the guise of protecting the
environment?'' asked Rep. Don Young, an Alaska Republican.
</P>
<P>
   It was refreshing to hear more traditional partisan attacks
after so much debate that has centered on the president's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Senate lawn, for instance, Sen. Edward Kennedy, a
Massachusetts Democrat, scolded the Republicans at a news
conference one morning for supporting managed-care legislation that
doesn't cover public employees, such as police officers, teachers
and nurses. Unlike his own bill, Kennedy said, the Republican
measure ``does to little to protect patients and too much to
protect the profits of HMOs and other insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Flynn, a police officer from Lowell, Mass. and a supporter
of Kennedy's bill, said: ``People think that Congress is bogged
down with the president and the Lewinsky scandal. As you can see
here today, there are a host of other issues Congress should deal
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn knows about getting your point lost amid the muck. As
national vice president of the International Brotherhood of Police
Officers, he got caught in the path of the Monica Express in August
when he was in Washington to promote the fifth anniversary of the
``Brady bill,'' which restricts handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a Rose Garden ceremony with the president. They were
upstaged by speculation that Clinton was wearing a tie that had
been given to him by Lewinsky and that he was sending her some sort
of message before her grand jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Pres Hamilton of Thousand Oaks, Calif., who was visiting the
Capitol with his wife last week, said they were glad to see that
Congress had other things to do besides focus on the president's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people stop and think for a moment,'' he said, ``God
knows this country can't come to a screeching stop over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, whose last day as Clinton's spokesman was Friday,
struck the same note in a briefing last month. ``The federal
government is a large organization that continues to run
irrespective of Monica,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with a steady diet of scandal news, which has now blossomed
into a story about the possible impeachment of the president, it's
little wonder that many people don't see what else is going on.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bipartisan higher education bill 96-0 last
week, the product of 18 months of negotiations. On the other hand,
the GOP caucus split on some key funding issues, so it is less
likely Congress will be sending appropriation bills to Clinton any
time soon. The bills are necessary to fund the government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John LaFalce of New York, the senior Democrat on the House
Banking and Financial Services Committee, said Congress had many
issues before it, ``ten times more important'' than the president's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of the global economy being one of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan addressed that very point when he appeared before
LaFalce's committee last week. Greenspan defended his agency's role
in the rescue of a huge private investment fund that had lost many
billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substantial damage could have been inflicted in many market
participants,'' Greenspan said, ``including some not directly
involved with the firm, and could have potentially impaired the
economies of many nations, including our own.''
</P>
<P>
   His testimony was long, detailed and tough for the uninitiated
to wade through. A lot of the speeches on Capitol Hill are like
that.
</P>
<P>
   But as one tourist eagerly remarked after he emerged from the
Senate visitors' gallery, where he had listened to the debate on
the defense authorization bill: ``I could spend a couple of hours
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   And not hear a single word to make him blush.

WRITER CHAIM POTOK STRUGGLES TO RECONCILE RELIGION, MODERN WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Confrontation has shaped writer Chaim
Potok's world. When, as a 16-year-old Orthodox Jew, Potok
discovered secular fiction, the intellectual collision changed him
irrevocably. When as a young man he spent 16 months on the
battlefields in Korea, the culture shock rattled everything he
thought he knew.
</P>
<P>
   Clash of cultures fills the 69-year-old author's numerous
novels, including ``The Chosen,'' ``The Promise'' and ``My Name Is
Asher Lev.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Potok inaugurated the Jewish Studies Program at Texas
Christian University with a speech on the campus last week, he felt
right at home. After all, he has been exploring the clash of
traditions, cultures and ideas for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The university is conducting a search for a scholar to teach
Judaic studies. TCU's decision to fund a chair in Jewish studies
``seemed an anomaly at first,'' Potok told his audience. ``But in
fact, it's what I've been writing about my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 36, Potok won acclaim for his first novel, ``The
Chosen,'' the story of an unlikely friendship between two Jewish
boys. Danny Saunders is a sheltered but brilliant fundamentalist
Jew destined to inherit his father's position as rabbi but secretly
enthralled by the ideas of Sigmund Freud. Reuven Malter, the
story's narrator, watches his friend struggle to reconcile his
duties to community and family on the one hand and his fascination
with secular thought on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Name Is Asher Lev,'' a boy discovers his genius for
painting and fights to remain a part of his fundamentalist Jewish
community while pursuing a career that is decidedly antithetical to
religious Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat like Potok's experience.
</P>
<P>
   All modern novels are somewhat autobiographical, Potok said, his
included.
</P>
<P>
   Potok's parents immigrated to the United States from Poland in
the early '20s and settled in the Bronx. Hasidic Jews (part of an
Eastern European movement that stresses religious fervor), they
expected their son to become a Talmudic scholar.
</P>
<P>
   But at 16, Potok experienced his first culture confrontation.
His sheltered world collided with something intrinsically different
when he checked out of the library Evelyn Waugh's 1945 ``Brideshead
Revisited,'' and discovered modern secular literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``What literature did was it introduced me to worlds I could
have never imagined, and these worlds constituted alternative ways
of constructing the human experience,'' Potok said the day before
his lecture. ``And the more I read, the more I began to ask myself
about the validity of my own way. That's the beginning of the
remaking of the map inside your head.''
</P>
<P>
   These confrontations that Potok speaks of are, he says, a
relatively new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred years ago, you grew up, you lived, you died
inside your own world,'' he explained. People didn't travel, few
read, they weren't exposed to new ideas or different cultures. ``In
the world today, especially in Western culture, you grow up in one
framework and very early on you encounter another one. You're
always being challenged by alternative ways of thinking about the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   These collisions can create tension and wreak havoc in lives,
but they also can give birth to extraordinary new ways of viewing
the world: George Gershwin's encounter with jazz and blues gave us
American popular music; Pablo Picasso's discovery of African art
led him to cubism.
</P>
<P>
   Potok's own case exemplifies the personal pain inherent in these
clashes.
</P>
<P>
   Writing was not a career that religious Jews pursued, and
Potok's father was not pleased. ``As far as my father was
concerned, he certainly did not want me to be a writer,'' the
author said. ``Because the kind of serious writing done today comes
to us from the secular-humanist, modernist culture in which we
live. It looks at the world with a somewhat jaundiced eye, at best,
and a really angry eye at worst. Its tone is ironic, its attitude
is at the very least objective, and its way of looking at the world
is considerably less than sacred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, none of this works in a religious world where things are
taken for granted as being sacred,'' he said. ``And my father, who
was pretty knowledgeable, understood this.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Danny Saunders and Asher Lev, Potok strained to reconcile
his fascination with the modern world and his religion. He
ultimately left the Hasidic movement and joined conservative
Judaism. An ordained rabbi, he received a doctorate in philosophy
from the University of Pennsylvania, where he now teaches.
</P>
<P>
   For Potok, writing has been a way of organizing the chaotic
world around him, working through that ever-changing map in his
brain. With each book, the protagonists are older and ``the
problems get more and more difficult to resolve,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his most recently published work, ``Zebra,'' is a collection
of quietly affecting short stories _ with modern, secular settings
_ aimed at a middle-school audience. Each story focuses on a
``crucial moment of crossing in the life of a young person,'' noted
Potok, who says he's not exactly sure why he wrote ``Zebra'' and is
uncertain where the next inspiration will come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' he said. ``I have no idea where the train is
headed.''

COMPUTER ADVICE REMAINS CONSTANT: LEARN THE LANGUAGE, BUY ENOUGH
MEMORY

   (The Science Times)  
 (Eds: This is the final Personal Computers column in Science Times.
Starting on Oct. 15, the Circuits section, on Thursdays, will
introduce a column by Peter H. Lewis, who will write about new
products and other computer industry developments of interest to
consumers.)

   In June 1982, the IBM personal computer, only a few months on
the market, offered a maximum of 256 kilobytes of memory, a choice
of one or two floppy disk drives and an optional color monitor.
Fully configured, it cost close to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers took the standard features _ a single floppy, a
green-and-white monitor and 64 kilobytes of memory _ which kept the
price under $4,000. A hard drive was not an option, but the entire
operating system, which IBM had purchased from a 32-person company
called Microsoft, fit easily on one 128-K floppy disk with room to
spare.
</P>
<P>
   That PC was not a technological marvel even by the standards of
its day, but it carried the three-letter monogram of the
International Business Machines Corp., which elevated the
perception of the personal computer to the level of a serious
business tool in board rooms around the world.
</P>
<P>
   While the corporate world focused on the IBM PC, another market
for the computer was being built around sales to a growing number
of consumers who wanted computers in their homes for work and play.
</P>
<P>
   That trend was reflected in a new column called Personal
Computing, which made its debut in Science Times on June 22, 1982.
Aimed not at business users of the new IBM but at what it described
as the ``home computer market,'' the column's first headline
offered, ``How Much Memory to Buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The memory range available in the home computer market now
goes all the way from 8 to 128K,'' the columnist, Erik
Sandberg-Diment, wrote. The computers from which to choose in this
range, he said, were ``the Apple II+ (selling for under $2,000),
the Commodore 64 ($595), Radio Shack's TRS-80, Model II ($5,048) or
the Osborne ($1,795).''
</P>
<P>
   One measure of how much about personal computers has changed in
the last 16 years is the fact that of the computer manufacturers
represented in his list, only Apple is still an industry leader.
But as Sandberg-Diment wrote his first column, the seeds of far
more significant changes had been sown that would eventually blur
the line between business and home computers, making the PC truly
personal. Among the most important developments were these:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Texas, the concept for a computer that used the same
hardware and operating system as the IBM personal computer _ but
that would sell for about half the price _ was sketched on a paper
napkin as three Texas Instruments engineers had lunch. That sketch
was realized in the first IBM ``clone,'' a computer that looked
like a portable sewing machine and went by the name Compaq but ran
any program made for the IBM. The Compaq eventually surpassed IBM's
share of the market and became the world's largest manufacturer of
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In California, Steven Jobs, chief executive of Apple Computer,
was rushing to adopt two revolutionary concepts he had come across
in a recent visit to the Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center _
a pointing device called a mouse and an operating system built
around a ``graphical user interface.'' Both technologies became the
foundation of a new relationship between people and machines with
the introduction of the Macintosh, in January 1984.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Washington State, William Gates and Paul Allen, owners of
the company that one year earlier had licensed a second-hand
operating system to IBM, were planning new features for MS-DOS and
new programs to run on it. Their efforts eventually gave Microsoft
_ and, significantly, not IBM _ the power to dictate the direction
of the world's fastest-growing industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Throughout the United States, a decentralized network designed
to enable academic and military researchers to share ideas and text
was rapidly connecting more and more campuses and laboratories. It
used the technology that evolved into the Internet and transformed
the personal computer into a window on a vast new frontier,
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all that was about to change about the personal
computer, Sandberg-Diment's first column offered consumers a couple
of remarkably prescient observations that are as valid today as
they were in the summer of '82.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding the concepts involved,'' he wrote of the
personal computer, ``should be among the very first chores anyone
attempting to buy one masters. But it isn't easy, and it requires a
certain amount of concentration and a willingness to forgive
jargon.''
</P>
<P>
   A few paragraphs later, he noted that ``once you get started you
will always yearn for as much memory as you can possibly have, and
there will always be models with more memory than you've got
because bigger and more sophisticated programs requiring ever
larger quantities of memory are always on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, buying a computer is still a process of trying to
understand the value of imponderables like DVD, PCI, USB and a 100
megahertz bus. Once we have sifted through all the jargon, the
bottom line is that Windows 98 will not run properly with less than
32 megabytes of memory, and any serious user will install twice
that much _ or 500 times the memory of the most powerful machines
described in that first Personal Computers column.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, users could still use just a little more. After all,
the machines people buy today can handle up to 384 megabytes of
memory, which is 1,500 times the maximum of the original IBM
personal computer. The current standard size of the hard drive on a
new computer is about 6 gigabytes, almost 47,000 times the size of
its original floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in some ways, what has changed most about the personal
computer is the number of people who use one. In 1982, computers
had found their way into fewer than 2 percent of all households in
the United States. Today, more than 40 percent of all homes have at
least one computer, and by some estimates two or more computers are
at work in almost 12 percent of households.
</P>
<P>
   And those are just the machines that we think of as computers _
contraptions that have display screens and keyboards and disk
drives and modems. In truth, the computer is invisibly ubiquitous;
its processing power controls hundreds of gadgets in our lives,
from our cars to our telephones and stereos. In fact, as dozens of
new computer-powered devices are unveiled, it is becoming almost
impossible to distinguish what is a computer from what is not.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, England _ This ancient university town, with its
winding streets and medieval grandeur, has contrived to earn its
place on maps of the contemporary world, too. Ever since the
structure of DNA was discovered here in 1953, Cambridge has been a
leading world center for molecular biology. And with the help of a
recent bonanza from a long dead American pharmacist, Cambridge
scientists have become leading players in the effort to decipher
the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   At least one-third, and maybe half, of the 3 billion DNA units
in the genetic programming of human cells are to be deciphered at
the Sanger Centre in the nearby village of Hinxton.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanger Centre has produced more human DNA sequence than any
of the seven American universities supported by the National
Institutes of Health as part of its human genome project. The
center's director, John E. Sulston, a biologist with a gentle voice
and a heavy thatch of white hair, is unusual for a scientific
administrator in that he still spends much of his time working in
the laboratory. He is best known for having traced the exact
lineage in which the single egg cell of the roundworm
Caenorhabditis elegans gives rise to the 959 cells of the adult, a
feat which took nearly 10 years of patient microscope work.
</P>
<P>
   Sulston and his principal financial backer, the Wellcome Trust
of London, wield a certain influence in the human genome program
run by the National Institutes of Health, with which they are
allied in an international consortium. In May, when the NIH seemed
inclined for a few days to let a new commercial venture take over
human DNA sequencing, Sulston and Michael Morgan, the Wellcome
Trust's program officer, declared that the human genome had to be
in the public domain and that if the NIH dropped out they would
sequence it all themselves. The NIH quickly regained its nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Money and tradition are two pillars of the Sanger Centre's
prominence. The money comes from the Wellcome Trust, a long dormant
London philanthropy founded by an American pharmacist, Henry S.
Wellcome, who moved to Britain in 1880.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoined by Wellcome's will never to sell any part of its major
asset, the pharmaceutical company Burroughs-Wellcome, the trust was
for years unable to translate its growing wealth into real income.
The trustees recently sidestepped this restriction at a time when
the company had struck gold with AZT, the anti-AIDS drug, and other
medicines. Sale of the company furnished the trust with an
endowment currently worth $17 billion, making it the world's
largest medical research philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The Wellcome Trust has spent $120 million to build a Genome
Campus at Hinxton, and has committed $350 million more to the
Sanger Centre for sequencing the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The center's interest in sequencing the human genome can be
traced, in a long but unbroken thread, to the discovery of DNA,
deoxyribonucleic acid, by James Watson and Francis Crick. At the
Cambridge Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Crick, with his
colleague Sydney Brenner, turned to determining how the genetic
message is encoded in DNA. With that task complete, the two men
decided the brain was the next biological problem worthy of their
attention, and Brenner resolved to crack the nervous system of the
microscopic roundworm, C. elegans.
</P>
<P>
   That enterprise did not work out. The wiring diagram of the
little creature's nervous system turned out to have 5,000
connections, far too many for its behavior to be computed, as
Brenner had hoped. But the cadre of students, many of them
American, whom Brenner recruited to work on the worm, began to
transform C. elegans into a powerful pilot project for
understanding for the first time how an animal is put together at
the level of its genes.
</P>
<P>
   A major step toward this goal was taken by Sulston one of
Brenner's English students. After drawing his famous lineage map of
how C. elegans is constructed from an egg, Sulston decided to
determine the position of the worms' genes on their chromosomes, a
task known as mapping. The map that he and others devised soon
pointed to the concept of sequencing the worm's DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The method for sequencing, or determining the order of the
chemical units in DNA, was devised by another Cambridge scientist,
Fred Sanger, after whom the Sanger Centre is named. The DNA
sequencing method won him his second Nobel Prize in 1980. (The
first was for sequencing proteins). But Sanger's DNA method was
manual, and its speed was such that it would have taken 1,500
scientists working for a century to decipher the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   When machines for sequencing DNA became available, based on an
elegant adaptation of the Sanger method, Sulston and his colleague
Alan Coulson believed it might be possible to sequence the full
genome of the worm. With 100 million base pairs of DNA, its genome
is a 30th of the size of the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Sulston and Coulson started the worm sequencing project in 1990
in collaboration with Robert H. Waterston, another of Brenner's
worm students who is now director of the Genome Sequencing Center
at Washington University, St. Louis. It was only after the worm
genome project proved manageable that they and other biologists
gained the confidence to propose sequencing the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who study the worm have a strong ethos of sharing
their techniques and data, an attitude that Sulston and Coulson did
much to foster through their development of the worm's genetic map.
They and Waterston have tried hard to inject the same community
attitude into study of the human genome, though it is a field
turbulent with larger egos and the brusque manners of those who see
fortunes to be made.
</P>
<P>
   The Sulston-Waterston alliance has quietly generated the bulk of
all DNA sequenced to date, being the most productive sequencers of
both worm and human DNA. But the two centers' steady progress on
the human genome was suddenly put at risk in May when a commercial
rival jumped into the genome race, contending it would complete the
job in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The rival was a company formed by the instrument maker
Perkin-Elmer and J. Craig Venter, the pioneer of sequencing of
bacterial genomes. If their effort, now named Celera, were to
finish first, the public programs paid for by the Wellcome Trust
and the National Institutes of Health might seem wasted effort.
</P>
<P>
   Sulston said he firmly believes that Celera will not produce a
DNA sequence of the completeness and accuracy that scientists need.
``The truth of the matter is that the Perkin-Elmer enterprise needs
to make a profit, the public needs a structure that will serve
biomedical research for the rest of time,'' he said. ``So my main
reaction is to make sure that whatever happens in that company
doesn't derail that objective. Humanity will be the poorer if it
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwing down the gauntlet to Venter, Sulston and Waterston said
in the current issue of Science that their rival's strategy for
sequencing the human genome was likely to prove ``woefully
inadequate'' because of its probable inability to distinguish
between the many regions of similar DNA sequence. On the other hand
new advances have ``removed doubts about the feasibility'' of their
own approach, they said.

CAMBRIDGE: they said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The human genome may be crammed with golden opportunities for
pharmaceutical companies, but Sulston said he believes that to be
really useful the gold must be put in the public domain, not
hoarded, so that scientists everywhere can work on it. The Sanger
Centre's expertise lies in sequencing the DNA, he said, and
progress will be quicker if others interpret it. In contrast,
American companies like Incyte and Human Genome Sciences contend
that they have sequenced thousands of human genes but intend to
exploit them in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of placing the human genome sequence in the public
domain is shared by the Wellcome Trust, which has also said it will
challenge any patent claims based solely on DNA sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanger Center and its partners at St. Louis are still
working hard on the worm's genomic sequence, which they have said
will be complete by the end of the year. The milestone achievement
will mark the first animal genome to be sequenced. So far only much
smaller genomes have been sequenced, belonging to single-celled
organisms like bacteria and yeast.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not sure the worm genome will be ready so soon.
Venter recently predicted that it would not be finished this decade
if held to the standard of closing every gap in the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if all the gaps in the worm DNA could be closed this year,
Sulston replied mildly, ``One can't say, it's never been done
before.'' But later, back in his laboratory, he displayed a
fast-shrinking list of gaps that had dwindled to fewer than 50.
</P>
<P>
   Sulston has a staunch backer in Morgan, the program director at
the Wellcome Trust who conceived the Genome Campus as the home for
the Sanger Centre and other genome-based institutions. Morgan also
funds the Sanger Centre to sequence the genomes of pathogenic
bacteria, a field pioneered by Venter's Institute of Genomic
Research.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanger Centre recently beat the institute in sequencing the
complex genome of the microbe that causes tuberculosis, though none
of its scientists are so brash as to crow about being first.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, however, noted that the method on which Celera is
relying to sequence the human genome, known as shotgun sequencing,
is one that Venter's institute has not yet made to work with the
tuberculosis microbe, even though the organism's genome is minute
compared with that of humans.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened in 1992, the Sanger Centre has fully sequenced
116 million bases of DNA, belonging to the genomes of humans,
worms, yeast, fruit flies, mice, the fugu fish and sundry bacteria.
But Morgan and Sulston intend to move on to other things
eventually, such as the vast task of interpreting what the
sequences mean. ``The Sanger Centre has got to evolve,'' Morgan
said. ``It can't become a fossilized sequencing center. It must
enter the post-genomic era.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   John Lesnick spent much of the time from Thanksgiving 1995 to
Valentine's Day 1996 lying flat on his bony back at Roosevelt
Hospital in New York, confronting a royal flush of AIDS ailments _
lymphoma, mycobacterium avium complex, microsporidiosis and
esophageal thrush. He had few visitors, his closest friends were
already gone and zero T-cells.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor suggested stopping all medication to let nature take
its course. It seemed that his time to die had arrived. ``At one
point, I had dragged myself to a scale outside my room, and it said
100 pounds,'' recalled Lesnick, a printmaker by training. ``And
that's when I sort of said, `Well, this is it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lesnick, 45, is living one of the success stories of
protease inhibitors, the powerful anti-HIV compounds introduced in
1996. He is swimming again, doing volunteer work and making
longer-term plans for the first time since he learned he had HIV,
which causes AIDS, in 1985. The death pall has blown away.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising, then, that Lesnick finds himself under more
psychological stress now than ever, an emotional whipsaw that he is
addressing with a counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface it's wonderful to walk down the street, see
myself in a store window and think, God that's me,'' he said. ``But
there's an awful lot below that surface. All my friends are dead. I
haven't worked since 1992. I haven't had sex in six years. How do
you begin being a human being again?''
</P>
<P>
   Lesnick's doctor said the reaction is common. ``Now that John is
feeling better, he has realized that AIDS has destroyed his life,''
said Dr. Howard Grossman, a New York AIDS specialist. ``All of my
patients who have spent as much time struggling to survive as he
has are now allowing themselves to be a little angry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lesnick's new future, while stretching further toward the
horizon than he had ever expected, remains uncertain. He is not
cured. He is simply healthier because of his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't trust what's happening to him,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   In half the people taking protease inhibitors, the drugs have
pushed HIV levels below science's ability to detect them and caused
the body's disease-fighting T-cells to rebound. As a result, AIDS
death figures have dropped by half, and the constellation of
opportunistic infections like the ones Lesnick was battling just
three years ago have tumbled by 60 percent, according to a study by
the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their renewed health, many people with AIDS have been
gripped by depression, acute anxiety _ especially over financial
issues _ and other, unexpected emotional problems, clinicians and
therapists said. Some patients have ended long-term romantic
relationships and others have become suicidal, an odd response to
being given a reprieve from death.
</P>
<P>
   This unique affliction has been called the Lazarus Syndrome
after the biblical figure whom Christ raised from the dead, said
Dr. Robert Remien, a clinical psychologist and researcher at the
HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies at the New York
State Psychiatric Institute. Though no statistics are available,
Dr. Judith Rabkin, a professor of clinical psychology at Columbia
University, estimated that tens of thousands of AIDS patients may
suffer from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be more stressful than illness itself,'' Remien said.
``When you suddenly find yourself facing a much longer-term future,
people are left with this feeling of, `What do I do now? This isn't
what I was planning. I have to worry about retirement benefits? I
may have to go back to work? I may have to pay off those credit
cards?' That is tremendously traumatic and disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grueling regimen of pills many AIDS patients contend
with daily, Lazarus Syndrome is not thought to be caused by the
medications per se, although the rigid medication schedule and side
effects can contribute, said Benjamin Lipton, director of clinical
services at Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the Lazarus Syndrome is unique to AIDS, with no easy
parallel to other illnesses. Perhaps the closest comparison is to
the trauma suffered by people freed from German concentration
camps, said Dr. Linda Moneyham, a researcher at the University of
South Carolina who is studying the phenomenon. Like many people
with AIDS who got very sick, Holocaust survivors watched their
families and friends die, and fully expected to follow, but instead
were suddenly freed to a precarious and lonely world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all boils down to uncertainty,'' Moneyham said. ``Sometimes
even though the known is bad, at least you know what it is and you
know what to do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who develop clinical depression, doctors are careful
in prescribing antidepressants, because some interact with certain
AIDS medicines. To address the other issues, AID Atlanta, that
city's oldest AIDS service agency, last year designed a program to
help clients cope with their emotions. The counseling program,
called Reconstruction, leads patients through topics like ``Hype
vs. Hope,'' and ``Wake Up and Smell The T-Cells'' in an effort to
ease what Mark King, the program coordinator, called a return to
the rat race.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction, which is offered in 10 other cities, including
Kansas City, Mo., and Jersey City, N.J., is sponsored by a grant
from Hoffman-LaRoche, one of several pharmaceutical companies that
make protease inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began to see more depression among these clients now than
when they thought they were going to die,'' King said. ``They had
spent years tying up loose ends, making that trip around the world
they always dreamed of, planning a funeral. And in a perverse way
the rug was pulled out from under them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Workshop leaders around the country are noticing commonalities.
One surprise, King said, was a huge break-up rate among people
whose health had rallied. ``They come to the realization, sitting
at the breakfast table one morning, that `if I'm going to live
another 20 years, it's not going to be with you,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely the thought that struck Bruce Brothers, now
39, who is HIV positive and had lived for nine years with a man who
also is HIV positive. ``When we got diagnosed, that was the moment
I knew we would die together,'' he said. ``We had rings that were
inscribed, `Forever Bruce,' and `Forever Dan.'''
</P>
<P>
   But when protease inhibitors brought them both back to life,
Brothers said, ``We both came to realizations together that in
health, this was not the relationship for us.'' The two formally
separated late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Lesnick, the New York printmaker, now weighs 145 pounds, which
he called ``my ideal size.'' Although he has not responded ideally
to protease inhibitors, they have nonetheless reduced his viral
load from a high of 280,000 to 9,000 per cubic milliliter of blood,
while his T-cells have shot up from zero to near 65, still well
below a normal count of more than 600. He is feeling much better.
He has the strength now to volunteer regularly for three local AIDS
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning I stand up and get out of bed and I'm
thrilled,'' Lesnick said. ``But life is never back to normal.''

   The hand and forearm transplant performed on an Australian man
in France nearly two weeks ago ranks among the most extraordinary
cases in the annals of surgery, one full of sudden plot twists,
colorful characters and international controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 1/2-hour operation was years in the planning, and the
man, Clint Hallam, was chosen for it in October 1997, according to
interviews with members of the international team of doctors who
carried it out on Sept. 23. Hallam, the French hospital initially
announced, was ``a businessman living in Perth, Western Australia''
who had impressed his doctors with ``his personality, courage and
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallam had been a patient of a major member of the team, Dr.
Earl Owen, a microsurgeon in Sydney, Australia, for more than two
years and had undergone extensive psychological evaluation in
Australia and in France.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital did not say that two days before the operation,
the head of the surgical team, Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard, learned
from the patient that he had a criminal record. The West
Australian, a newspaper in Perth, later reported that Hallam was
due in court there in January to face seven fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   And far from losing his right hand in a logging accident, as
initial reports had it, Australian newspapers said he lost it using
a circular saw in a New Zealand jail.
</P>
<P>
   But the operation proceeded because ``this man desperately
wanted the graft,'' Dubernard said. ``As a doctor, I take care of
everybody and did not change anything'' in his treatment, said
Dubernard, who is not only a transplant surgeon but also a member
of the French parliament and a deputy mayor of Lyons. ``It is a
pity that the Australian newspapers revealed that he had been to
jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Hallam was reported recovering well at Edouard Herriot
Hospital in Lyons, and there was no sign that his body was
rejecting the grafted hand and forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surprised he's doing so well and that so far there are
no problems,'' Dr. Xavier Martin, a member of the team, said from
his office at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam's doctors are confident that even if he experiences a
rejection reaction, drugs developed in recent years will enable him
to become the first successful hand transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quite confident that this man's rejection, which is
probably inevitable, can be controlled,'' said Owen, who helped
pick the team.
</P>
<P>
   At scientific meetings in recent years, doctors have debated the
benefits and risks of hand transplants, but controversy over such
surgery has heated up since Hallam's operation.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say anti-rejection therapy has improved to the point
where hand transplants could be successful, improving the lives of
many patients. Plus, they could open the way to transplanting other
tissues. Dubernard, the head of the transplant team in Lyons, said
about 10 other teams in France, Germany, Sweden, Louisville, Ky.,
and elsewhere were poised to do hand transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the American Society for Surgery of the Hand
joined the critics, saying the risk-to-benefit ratio for
experimental hand transplants ``has yet to be convincingly
established,'' particularly because the procedure is not lifesaving
and anti-rejection therapy could lead to serious infections and
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The society urged that doctors not try another hand transplant
until the success of Hallam's case could be determined and further
experimental work was performed on animals.
</P>
<P>
   The French team intends to evaluate the technique in two or
three more patients to determine whether it should embark on a
clinical trial of about 50 hand transplants in hospitals in several
countries, Dubernard said.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics faulted the idea of assembling a team from
Australia, England and Italy to do the operation in Lyons, then
allowing it to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   Owen defended the procedure and the way it was carried out. He
said he and Hallam left Australia because organs and tissues could
not be donated there without explicit permission in writing. But in
France, he said, such permission is presumed unless family members
object.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in France is a donor,'' said Owen who has worked in
Lyons with Dubernard on joint projects each year since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with its population of 58 million people, France offered
better odds of a match in terms of size and color of the new hand
and the donor's sex than Australia, with its population of 18.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Hallam nearly did not get a new hand and forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Owen consulted experts in several countries, and chose an
international team. It assembled in Lyons in early September.
Although several team members had worked with each other in the
past, the eight surgeons had not worked together as a team until
they practiced performing the operation in a laboratory in Lyons in
the days before Hallam's operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not privileged to tell you what we did because it would
upset people,'' said Owen, who continued, ``Any form of animal
experimentation upsets people when they hear about it, and then
anti-vivisectionists come out against you.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days passed without a suitable donor, Owen said, ``we
decided that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to put the operation off two months and come
back for another 10 days at the end of November,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors began returning home. Suddenly, at about 1 a.m., the
Lyons team was notified about a brain-dead individual.
</P>
<P>
   But Dubernard was in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hari Kapila, a hand surgeon from Sydney, had flown to Paris
and was awaiting Owen, who had gone to Switzerland. The two doctors
planned to catch the same flight for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marco Lanzetta, a hand surgeon at Monza Hospital in Milan,
had driven back to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nadey Hakim, the head of transplantation surgery at St.
Mary's Hospital in London, had returned to England and was in the
operating room performing the first of two kidney transplants he
would complete by dawn. He left immediately for Lyons and arrived
in time to take part in Hallam's operation, which began about 10
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Chirac, the wife of the French president, arrived for
a long-scheduled visit that morning and she watched the operation
for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But just as they were congratulating themselves on their
surgical success came the news reports about their patient.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like Dubernard, Owen was chagrined about his patient's
background. ``We were completely duped for two years,'' he said,
adding that the patient had been in jail at least twice. ``He is a
consummate rogue, '' Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hallam was accepted as a transplant patient, he went
through psychological testing in Australia. Presumably, the testing
focused less on Hallam's working life than on traits that would
determine whether he could live happily with another person's arm.
Just after Hallam arrived at his hotel in Lyons, and before he went
to the hospital, Dr. Gabriel Burloux, a psychiatrist who is a
leading French expert on body imaging and author of textbooks on
the subject, interviewed him, Dubernard said.
</P>
<P>
   Burloux ``gave us the clean bill of health that this was a very
suitable man with a very strong constitution and very solid in his
resolve,'' Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when Dubernard talked to him later that Hallam
filled some of the gaps in his background.
</P>
<P>
   The team is not worried that Hallam will disappear into any kind
of criminal underworld. ``He will not be able to get his
immunosuppressants, and he knows it,'' Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, most transplant doctors share the team's view that
a patient's criminal record should not determine eligibility for
surgery. For example, the ethics committee of the United Network
for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit organization that coordinates the
U.S. national organ allocation program, has concluded that an
individual's status as a prisoner should not preclude consideration
for a transplant. The recommendation is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors strive to relieve suffering, they are as
vulnerable as anyone to disappointments, rivalries, bruised egos
and other human frailties.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors at the University of Louisville had
expected to be the first to achieve success in transplanting a
hand. Their team announced last summer that they planned a similar
procedure later this year. Doctors in Louisville were particularly
surprised by the announcement from France because Hallam had
applied to them too for a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. John Barker, who heads the Louisville team's research
program, also said his team had never heard of the group that
performed Hallam's transplant. He said members had not spoken up at
meetings devoted to hand transplants.
</P>
<P>
   That was because ``it is better to do something than say that
you are going to do something,'' Dubernard said.
</P>
<P>
   And while Owen expressed great respect for the Louisville team,
he added that if Barker had not heard of him, ``he has probably
read only American textbooks.'' He added, ``Have you heard the term
sour grapes?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in any race with Louisville,'' he said. ``They may
well be in a race with us, but they will never catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen said he had been reimplanting severed fingers and limbs
since 1970 and teaching courses in microsurgery around the world
since 1967. ``You name the country, I have been there,'' Owen said,
and ``mostly, I have been able to teach well enough for them to
take over themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be unknown in America,'' Owen said, ``but the rest of
the world recognizes who the pioneer of microsurgery is.'' He said
American hand surgeons ``were five years behind us in Sydney
putting on fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our microsurgery center in Sydney is justifiably famous,''
Owen said.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Hallam's transplant, Herriot Hospital
experienced a huge power failure during the night, backup
generators failed and 10 patients died within the next two days.
French officials are now investigating the episode.
</P>
<P>
   Hallam slept through the power failure and his care was not
affected, Dubernard said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and nurses work in teams in the same hospital every day,
and in doing so they work like athletes on sports teams. Success in
outcomes can hinge on how well doctors and nurses learn the nuances
of each other's habits and techniques in the operating room and
during the recovery phase.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the reasons why an operation is rarely performed
by assembling a team from different continents. No one knows what
might have happened if a medical emergency sent Hallam back to the
operating room when the principal surgeons were dispersed over the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, even critics say that does not mean the hand
transplant is not going to work.

 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ The first weekend of the spring 1999 showings in
Milan was like the opening act in a rock concert, with lesser
lights warming up the audience for the stars who will perform
later. With the exception of Romeo Gigli and Lawrence Steele, who
showed their signature lines, it was mainly designers' secondary
collections that set the stage for what will follow.
</P>
<P>
   These secondary or diffusion lines are often in the same mood as
a designer's main collection, offering a hint of what's to come
without giving away the plot. Usually, they're aimed at a younger
customer and take a more casual approach.
</P>
<P>
   And young was the attitude of the Miu Miu show, which Miuccia
Prada presented on Saturday. Ms. Prada's models were made up and
styled to look as if they had barely entered adolescence, and they
wore clothes inspired by sports, the military and country dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The sporty clothes _ poplin or neoprene shirts or jackets worn
with short shorts or Bermudas _ were often shown with multipocketed
vests worn in back on webbing belts that tied around the waist or
hips, the way the sleeves of a sweater would be tied around the
waist.
</P>
<P>
   Miu Miu was not all about function, though. There were
fringe-trimmed pants and skirts, and ruffles at the hems of wide
skirts with unpressed pleats. These were shown with peasant blouses
or strapless bandeaux tied with drawstrings, perfect for urban
line-dancers, especially when they were worn with multicolored
snakeskin cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   Khaki and olive drab had a pseudomilitary air, feminized by
being fashioned into styles like U-neck dresses with high
waistlines, worn open over shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was a clever blend of the masculine and the
feminine, the functional and the frilly. They were clothes for fun
times, and so were many of the other collections shown in Milan so
far, which were not aimed at the career woman in her 9-to-5 mode.
</P>
<P>
   You're hardly likely to see any of the D&AMP;G skin-tight dresses
over visible bras in a business office, but they'd fit right into
the club scene. Mainly in shiny black stretch satin or cire or
printed with large purple onions or red peppers or tomatoes, the
dresses often sported separate belts with outside pockets. Skinny
pants came with their own pockets, lots of them, though putting
anything thicker than a credit card into one of them would make an
unsightly bulge.
</P>
<P>
   No woman who wears a design by Domenico Dolce and Stefano
Gabbana wants bulges in the wrong place, especially if she's
swathed in gold leather or metallic stripes of red, blue, black and
gold that look like Christmas wrapping. There's nothing subdued
about D&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   Or for that matter, about Blumarine by Anna Molinari. Her sexy
creatures may wear baby blue or powder pink, but it's likely to be
in shiny satin with slits on both sides, or a see-through sweater
that's trimmed in fur, or a dress that's cut like a nightgown and
bordered in lace. Even Blumarine's rose-print patterns and floral
embroideries are anything but naive, cut into body-conscious shapes
and combined with black tulle.
</P>
<P>
   Donatella Versace, in the Versus collection, which she showed
Sunday night in an abandoned warehouse far from downtown Milan, put
two supermodels on the runway, a rare sight this season. But then,
her name is Versace, which has its own star power.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the models _ Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell _ strutted in
tops that were slit down the sternum and skirts that were slit to
the thigh. They and the other models wore colors like aqua, orange,
pink, peach and brown in clothes that hugged the body or slipped
provocatively off a shoulder. Skirts were either as short as a
skirt could possibly be or long and lean, slit to reveal the legs.
Even the boots revealed the legs, being backless with just a ladder
of straps up the calf.
</P>
<P>
   Glitter was kept to a minimum in the show, with just suggestions
of shine, as on the last dress in the Versus collection. At first
sight it made Ms. Moss look downright matronly, all black and long
with a high neck and long sleeves. But when she turned, her back
was bare to the waist. That's more like it, Ms. Versace. Women
don't look to you for sober clothing.
</P>
<P>
   When women want styles that are feminine yet up-to-the-minute
chic, they've been going to Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti, though
for spring the designer mixed her message a bit. There were simple
little shift dresses, neat pants, a front-zipped black leather
jacket, and skimpy shirts worn partly open over hip-slung skirts.
There were shirts and skirts in men's shirting stripes for a hint
of the androgynous, but then the scene shifted to Thomas Hardy
country with long, loose dresses and full skirts over petticoats.
</P>
<P>
   The country-maid dresses and skirts were pretty as a picture in
white with pin-tucking and pleats or in black with quiltlike
trapunto stitching and a frill of white pleats peeking out from
under the hem. But anyone young enough to wear them probably wants
to look older.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Steele, one of the original Americans in Milan, has a
much more sophisticated customer in mind, one who likes to show off
her body in bare tops and ultrashort skirts, and in halter-neck
dresses wrapped and tied with thongs. And Steele thinks she should
feel free enough to wear knits and bias-cut skirts that are as
sheer as gauze.
</P>
<P>
   The best of his clothes took flight. Feathers wafted softly
around bodices or sleeves. And chiffon was cut into layers that
fluttered like feathers and seemed so light that you feared a
sudden breeze would whip them off the models' backs.
</P>
<P>
   Romeo Gigli has gone back to his romantic roots, after last
season's unsuccessful foray into hard-edged chic. Using
gossamer-weight organza, crinkled silks and sheer laces, often with
metallic finishes that gave them a modern edge, he showed loose
shirts and tunics, slender long skirts and calf-length pants in
colors ranging from the palest yellows and beiges to murky blues,
wines and greens.
</P>
<P>
   Delicate embroideries or cutwork decorated some of the jackets,
capelike coats and enveloping shawls. Echoing a trend seen in
London last week, Gigli finished some skirts with rows of
asymmetric lace ruffles.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Gigli's laces were in metallic silver or gold. Most of
his dresses had high waistlines and bare necklines that dipped off
the shoulder and were held up by skinny straps. The show ended with
two all-over beaded dresses, one silver and one gold, with hems
that had been cut into fringelike slivers. The collection was
filled with beauty but tended to be repetitive and went on too
long.

<P>
   Congress is playing ``chicken'' with the president and the
American public. The federal government is now running on borrowed
time. The federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. There would have
been a massive shutdown of federal agencies on Oct. 1, except that
Congress voted for a ``continuing resolution'' that supplies
emergency funding until Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the president submits his budget requests to
Congress in January and February. Congress has until mid-September
to consider, fashion and pass the necessary appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   But this Congress is playing special-interest politics with
appropriations bills. As of Oct. 2, only four of 13 appropriations
bills had been passed. And at least three of the bills yet to be
voted into law have been threatened with a presidential veto
because of the anti-environmental riders attached to them.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Congress must pass all the appropriations bills, but
unless the most egregious of the included riders are removed, the
public can expect another government shutdown like the one in 1995
_ with the closure of national parks, national monuments, public
buildings like the Smithsonian and the Library of Congress and the
federal agencies that monitor the federal lands across this nation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, instead of dealing with the issues, Congress can pass
another continuing resolution so that the federal government
doesn't shut down on Oct. 10. More borrowed time. More political
shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Friday that the GOP leadership in Congress
realizes it might lose in its collision course with the president
and the American people. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, indicated that he is willing to strip off
some of the anti-environmental riders he wrote that impact his
state.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, echoed Stevens, but
predicted that next year the GOP presence in Congress would be even
stronger and Republicans will get what they want then. Presumably,
the public can expect to see a greater emphasis on raping and
scraping the public lands after this election.
</P>
<P>
   But will the GOP leadership swerve enough to avoid a collision
in this session? A number of powerful special-interest groups have
forked over huge donations to see their wishes put into law: the
fishing industry, oil and gas industry, timber and mining companies
and agricultural interests. Approximately 50 anti-environmental
riders remain attached to various appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the arrogance factor: On July 24, Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., wrote a letter to Secretary of the Interior
Bruce Babbitt threatening to defund Babbitt's office, the office of
the Department of the Interior's solicitor, the department's public
relations offices and its congressional relations offices.
Livingston, chairman f the House Appropriations Committee, didn't
like what Babbitt had said to the press about his committee's
antics.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston received more than $100,000 in political campaign
contributions from oil and gas, construction and agricultural
industries in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   And on the Senate side of the aisle, the Department of
Transportation appropriations bill contains a provision that would
allow helicopters unrestricted access to national wilderness areas,
national parks and national wildlife refuges in Alaska. Helicopters
are now only allowed in Alaska conservation areas for emergency
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, Babbitt and Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman
sent a letter to Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the
Subcommittee on Transportation in the Senate Committee on
Appropriations, condemning the helicopter section of the bill and
promising a recommendation for a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt and Glickman wrote, in part: ``This provision would
change fundamentally the Alaska experience and undermine wildlife
protections and visitor enjoyment in our `last frontier.' It
clearly hurts Alaska, but also sets a dangerous precedent for
wilderness, park and refuge lands throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the ``whopp, whopp, whopp'' of copter blades somewhere
just above your head as you try to enjoy the deep and beautiful
silence of the great wilderness areas. In cold, dense air the sound
of helicopter blades carries a long way.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the blades can have a serious impact on wildlife _
disturbing nesting seabird and scattering caribou herds during
winter when they need to conserve their energy.
</P>
<P>
   And who would use helicopters overflights or dropoffs?
Extractive industries searching for geological formations that
promise oil, gas or coal might be interested in using helicopters;
wealthy hunters or hikers who want to be dropped off at key
locations; and those intrepid sightseers who want to view the
Denali National Park or the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge
from the comfort of a seat in a helicopter, then drop down to put
their feet on the ground for a moment and finally whopp, whopp
away. And, of course, poachers would find helicopter entry and exit
a quick and useful tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Congress isn't satisfied to merely violate the deep silences of
the wilderness areas and thereby diminish the experience _ the
Omnibus National Parks and Public Lands Act (HR 4570) contains a
provision to sell off the people's park lands.
</P>
<P>
   Section 411 of the omnibus bill authorizes the secretary of the
Interior to sell, lease, or issue use-permits for parcels of land
or structures within the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National
Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   Section 604 authorizes the sale of wilderness land with the
Cumberland Island National Seashore. The bill also would also allow
vehicles to drive through this designated wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, GOP leaders in the Senate pulled the Interior
appropriations bill off the floor after lengthy debate because they
didn't want Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Max Baucus, D-Mont., to be successful in adding an amendment
that would remove a number of anti-environmental riders.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is talk in the Senate of rolling the Interior bill in
with several other appropriations measures to create a gigantic
funding bill that President Clinton could not veto without serious
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   And the political games continue.

EXTREMELY TUCCI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Stanley Tucci says he was born a ``very physical
person,'' which explains a lot of the squirming and fidgeting he
has been doing while sitting in this restaurant corner booth at the
Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci has been more or less a prisoner here for three hours now,
conducting interviews to promote his new movie, ``The Impostors,''
an old-fashioned farce that celebrates the physical comedy of
people like Buster Keaton, Laurel and Hardy, and the Marx Brothers.
Three hours of sitting is three hours too long for Tucci, who would
like nothing more right now than to run around the block a couple
of times to clear the cobwebs from his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always like this,'' Tucci explains, slumping in the
corner. ``When I'm writing, it's hard for me just to sit there and
concentrate because I like to do things. I exercise as much as
possible, work around the house, do landscaping stuff, whatever. I
think it goes back to the way I was trained as an actor, with dance
and movement. So to just sit at a desk and write ... after about an
hour, I go a little crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tucci had to go a little crazy _ in more ways than one _ to
make ``The Impostors.'' Like ``Big Night,'' the much-loved 1996
indie hit about two brothers trying to make a success of their
gourmet Italian restaurant, Tucci wrote, directed and produced
``The Impostors.'' (``Yup, crazy,'' he says as a method of
explanation.)
</P>
<P>
   He also stars in the film along with Oliver Platt and a host of
Sundance favorites, including Steve Buscemi, Lili Taylor, Campbell
Scott and Hope Davis. The movie was four years in the making,
longer if you consider that Tucci and Platt originally created
their characters years ago when they put on a play together at
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the idea about these guys who were unemployed actors
who do everything but work,'' the 38-year-old Tucci says. ``Since
they can't get a job, they have to go out on the street and act
because they're desperate to hone their craft. They have to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucci knows the feeling. It's one reason he made ``The
Impostors,'' which celebrates the joy of acting, in much the same
way ``Big Night'' proclaimed the wonders of pasta, marinara sauce
and a good bottle of wine. The movie is a farce, a rarity in the
film world, even though there are now more studios and more movies
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone kept telling us you can't make a farce, that no one
will fund it because no one makes these movies anymore,'' says Beth
Alexander, Tucci's producing partner. ``To us, that was reason
enough to try it. Why should we all be making the same kinds of
movies?''
</P>
<P>
   Tucci admits that he has set himself up for a fall, that
sustaining the energy of a farce over a couple of hours is the most
difficult challenge for a filmmaker to tackle. But then, to Tucci,
trying to beat the odds was part of the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can be so expressive physically, but it's not something
you see much in movies,'' Tucci says. ``And I think it's enjoyable
for people to watch because it hits you on a gut level, no matter
who you are or how you perceive the world. When someone is doing
something physically, you're almost more attentive. Sometimes words
get in the way. People talk too much, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Tucci can be guilty of that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Says Hope Davis: ``He never stops tossing ideas at you, which is
one of the things I love about him. Often we would finish a scene,
and he'd be yelling, `Keep rolling,' and he'd just be shouting out
all kinds of ideas. `Try this! Try this!' And I'd be wondering how
we could use any of what we were shooting because Stanley would be
laughing so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   A different side of Tucci will be seen next month in HBO's
highly anticipated biography of gossip columnist Walter Winchell.
Adapted from Neal Gabler's celebrated book, ``Winchell'' will take
an unsparing look at the man who wielded incredible power from his
syndicated newspaper column for some two decades. Tucci worked on
the project for 10 weeks this past spring and calls it one of the
most difficult roles he has played as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winchell was an incredibly complex guy who changed the world,
maybe not for the better,'' Tucci says. ``He was a very insecure, a
workaholic and probably a manic-depressive. And through his column,
he became one of the most powerful men in the world, more powerful
than the people he made and destroyed. What's weird is that today
nobody knows who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucci, who is married and lives in Westchester County, N.Y.,
with his wife and two stepchildren, still has moments when he's
incredulous that people know who he is. Before ``Big Night,'' Tucci
had appeared in some 25 movies and more than 100 television
episodes, but nobody, including casting agents, could remember his
name. In fact, he couldn't find any work at all (``couldn't get
arrested'' is how Tucci puts it) until a high-profile turn on the
short-lived ABC legal drama ``Murder One'' put him in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Big Night'' continued his winning streak, and
Tucci seems quite determined to make sure the leading roles keep
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I formed a production company is that I
don't trust anybody to employ me,'' Tucci says. ``I used to get
pretty upset when I'd look around and see all the leading men in
movies looking exactly the same. Now, I've got a little bit of
leeway. I'm seeing some things coming my way, and if they don't, I
can always write something for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``Winchell,'' Tucci can be seen as a
home-security salesman who stages burglaries to boost sales in the
dark comedy ``The Alarmist'' (opening Oct. 16) and as Puck in
Michael Hoffman's big-screen version of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream.'' Tucci dyed his thinning hair blond for the latter project,
in which he co-stars with Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer and
Calista Flockhart. The film is due out next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci is also working on a script based on ``Joe Gould's
Secret,'' a famous profile written by legendary New Yorker writer
Joseph Mitchell. The movie, which may begin filming as early as
January, focuses on Mitchell's relationship with Gould, a 1940s
bohemian. Tucci is going back and forth about whether he wants to
play Mitchell. (``Call it 50-50,'' he says.)
</P>
<P>
   While it's not the big movie that Tucci hopes someday to direct,
it's a project that's close to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too much work otherwise,'' Tucci says. ``That's why I
could never be a director for hire. I could never devote the amount
of time to something that wasn't my own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically,'' Tucci continues, ``I've got about a dozen
projects going at once right now, and that's the way I like it. It
takes a long time for something to reach fruition and achieve the
depth and resonance that it should have. I've spent a long time on
this Joe Mitchell thing to get it right, and I did the same thing
with `The Impostors.' I've got to live with something in order to
get it right.''

 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Hollywood seems to be taking note of the fact that the century
is racing to its conclusion. And just like the Victorians at the
end of the 19th century, with their seances and their interest in
the occult, movie makers are preoccupied with some very strange
stuff.
 &HT;    Witness the current and future spate of movies dealing with
death, dying, angels, the afterlife, heaven and hell.
 &HT;    Just out is Robin Williams in ``What Dreams May Come,'' a
romantic drama complete with special effects, set in the afterlife.
Williams literally goes through hell to be reunited with his former
wife and soulmate (Annabella Sciorra).
 &HT;    He's in heaven after dying in a car crash. His wife, however, is
down below _ after killing herself from grief at losing her husband
and family. Robin makes the journey from paradise to the underworld
to rescue his true love.
 &HT;    In November, Brad Pitt plays the Grim Reaper himself in the very
offbeat ``Meet Joe Black,'' inspired by the l934 Frederic March
classic ``Death Takes a Holiday.'' Death assumes the face of the
recently killed Pitt, who while vacationing from his gruesome
duties falls madly in love with businessman Anthony Hopkins'
daughter (Claire Forlani) and discovers there's more to life than
death.
 &HT;    ``There was much talk of death on the set and how we would like
to die,'' recalls Hopkins, who last worked with Pitt in the movie
``Legends of the Fall.''
 &HT;    Pitt may seem rather unlikely casting for a fellow usually
depicted in a hooded robe carrying a scythe, but Hollywood seems to
have a penchant for turning death into a pretty face. Remember
Robert Redford as the unwelcome visitor to a very old lady played
by Gladys Cooper in an early episode of ``The Twilight Zone''?.
 &HT;    Director Martin Brest says they chose Pitt to avoid being
gruesome and heavy handed about the topic. ``I thought Brad had
that slightly otherworldly presence we needed,'' he told
Entertainment Weekly.
 &HT;    Nicole Kidman also takes a foray into the realm of the
supernatural, teaming up with Sandra Bullock in ``Practical
Magic,'' a spiritual tale about two women who happen to be New
England witches. The film, which opens Oct. 9, is based on Alice
Hoffman's novel.
 &HT;    Also upcoming (Nov. 6) is ``Jack Frost,'' with Michael Keaton as
a musician who dies in a Christmas car crash and comes back to life
... as a snowman. ``He's a funny, hip guy,'' says Keaton, ``who's
been transferred to a new body and finds cool things to do with
it.'' (That's cool as in snow, presumably). Keaton stepped into
this role after George Clooney, who took over from Keaton as
Batman, dropped out.
 &HT;    Earlier this year Nicholas Cage stepped out of the afterlife in
``City of Angels,'' as the angelic being who falls in love with
surgeon Meg Ryan and decides he wants to enjoy earthly joys with
her. He makes it back in the land of living _ just as Meg
unfortunately exits. The weepy romance was quite a hit among teens.
 &HT;    Woody Allen, for whom a preoccupation with dying is nothing new,
this past year gave us ``Deconstructing Harry,'' which included his
rather hilarious descent by elevator into hell, accompanied by Old
Nick himself, played by Billy Crystal.
 &HT;    Of course, Hollywood long ago learned that movies about dying
can be very profitable. Films like ``Ordinary People'' (1980),
``Terms of Endearment'' (1983) and ``Philadelphia'' (1993) all told
stories in which key characters died.
 &HT;    In the same vein, Meryl Streep plays a mother dying of cancer in
``One True Thing,'' based on Anna Quindlan's l995 novel. The
performance will certainly earn Streep another Oscar nomination for
best actress.
 &HT;    In the tearjerker ``Stepmom'' (opening in December), Susan
Sarandon is a wife and mother who discovers she's dying and
reluctantly coaches her ex's new wife Julia Roberts to step into
her shoes.
 &HT;    And in ``The Theory of Flight'' (opening, believe it or not, on
Christmas Day) Helena Bonham Carter is dying of a neurological
disease and must use a wheelchair. She wants to lose her virginity
before she dies _ and asks Kenneth Branagh to help her achieve her
goal. (This is the couple's first on screen pairing since their
offscreen romance went public.)
 &HT;    In ``Patch Adams,'' Robin Williams is back as a doctor who tries
to treat his terminally ill patients with humor, ``looking at death
lightheartedly,'' as the actor puts it. In l999 Williams will show
up in ``Jakob The Liar,'' this time a cheery story about death and
the Warsaw ghetto. ``Yeah--that was a nice double bill,'' he muses,
``to go from 'Dreams' to 'Jakob the Liar.'''
 &HT;    How are we expected to take all this dwelling on the dark side
without running from the theater in panic? Meryl Streep for one
thinks the answer is perfectly natural. ``We need to feel something
when we go to movies,'' she says. ``We need to cry ... It's OK.''
 &HT;    She cites ``Titanic'' as the ideal death movie. ``Leonardo
DiCaprio goes down in the depths and the kids cry and they put down
their money to go again and again.''

MERCY POINT A HOSPITAL IN OUTER SPACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Mercy Point is not your ordinary medical
facility. Besides being set in the 23rd century, this outer-space
hospital on the edge of the explored galaxy treats humans and
aliens alike, which provides opportunity for some creative medical
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It's no ``ER,'' but, put it this way: ``Mercy Point'' is not
nearly as bad as former UPN bomb ``Homeboys in Outer Space.''
</P>
<P>
   Combining the two diverse premises results in a sometimes
entertaining, sometimes ridiculous drama that may remain in orbit
for a while if it earns the proper street credibility with the
science-fiction set.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Grote Maxwell (Joe Morton) leads the team. He is not the
highest-ranking doctor, but he is the glue that holds the group
together.
</P>
<P>
   There is some personal drama within the show. Two half-sisters _
Dr. Dru Breslauer (Alexandra Wilson) and Dr. Haylen Breslauer
(Maria Del Mar) are having a wicked case of sibling rivalry. Dr.
Caleb ``C.J.'' Jurado (Brian McNamara) is the resident hunk and
former flame of Dru's. He is now involved with the hospital's
military liaison.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the eclectic bunch includes Dr. Batung, a stuffy and
impatient alien visiting surgeon who is a ``Shenn.'' And, ANI
(Julia Pennington), is the beautiful Android Nursing Interface who
is a cyborg and has the bluest eyes in the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rema Cook (Gay Thomas) is a well-respected psychosurgeon
from Earth, and Dr. Harris DeMilla (Joe Spano) is the chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the size of the cast, the show is easy to follow and the
special effects are well done. The acting is fine, but the stories
are a bit hokey. For instance, in the first episode, a baby is
saved in a big, glowing artifical womb and people are dropping dead
from a computer virus.
</P>
<P>
   THE SHOW: ``Mercy Point.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT: A futuristic medical drama set in a state-of-the-art
medical center in space.
</P>
<P>
   THE STARS: Joe Morton, Maria Del Mar, Alexandra Wilson, Brian
McNamara, Julia Pennington, Gay Thomas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ It is a warm, luminous day, and the prairies
and woodlands of the Cedar Creek Natural History Area, 30 miles
north of the Twin Cities, are buzzing with life. Crickets chirp.
Bees and butterflies float from bloom to bloom amid scores of
species of grassland plants carpeting the flatlands that run
between groves of trees presided over by stately bur oaks two
centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-square-mile tract, some of it undisturbed since before
Europeans arrived in these parts, and some of it in various stages
of recovery from decades of farming, is a fragment of the mosaic of
tallgrass prairie and oak savanna that once covered great stretches
of the country's midsection. But this swatch of the mosaic is
special, as G. David Tilman, an ecologist at the University of
Minnesota, is about to demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   Tilman points to a brilliant green square on the ground that is
thick with short, curly grass, much thicker and greener than the
vegetation on neighboring plots. Intuition might suggest that the
thick green plot represents the healthier chunk of the ecosystem.
Not so, as Tilman has shown in one of scores of revealing and
ambitious experiments _ the combination of their large scale and
long duration may be unique _ for which he has become known.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he added varying amounts of nitrogen, a powerful
fertilizer, to different plots to determine the nutrient's effect
on the ecosystem's functioning. It is a question of some import,
since human activities like farming and the burning of fossil fuels
are dumping nitrogen wholesale into the biosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pearls of ecological evidence that have so far emerged
from the Tilman experiments are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ As nitrogen rises, the number of plant species declines; the
thick green grass, a species called quack grass, which happens to
proliferate wildly in high-nitrogen soil, has crowded out other
species in its plot.
</P>
<P>
   _ As the number of species declines, so does the total
production of biomass, the amount of plant material as measured by
dry weight.
</P>
<P>
   _ The decline in diversity of species also makes the impact of
drought on the ecosystem much worse; the more species there are,
Tilman says, the more chance there is that some will be
drought-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   _ If enough nitrogen is added, it pushes the ecosystem into
increasingly chaotic oscillations culminating in a crash of plant
populations.
</P>
<P>
   _ When these high-nitrogen plants crash, die and decompose, more
nitrate leaks into the soil and then into ground water and surface
runoff, possibly impairing water quality and promoting harmful
blooms of algae.
</P>
<P>
   The main message sent by these results, Tilman says, is that the
more species there are in an ecosystem (up to a point), the more
productive, resilient and stable it will be. This is a question of
some importance for conservation policy, given a running political
debate over whether it is important to preserve as many species as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the Tilman experiments may have an even more basic value to
the young science of ecology. Controlled experimentation _ in which
the experimenter essentially attempts to hold all variables
constant except the one whose effect is being tested _ is routine
in many sciences, but until relatively recently it had not been
widely employed by ecologists. Even now most such ecological
experiments are small and short. Tilman thinks big and long-term:
His manipulations of the prairie-savanna ecosystem have involved
some 140 experiments over the last 17 years, with scores to
hundreds of plots in each experiment and many of the investigations
lasting for years. About 35 are now in progress.
</P>
<P>
   What Tilman often does, said Stuart Pimm, an ecologist at the
University of Tennessee, is take a snippet of an idea that may have
been around for a while and subject it to ``an incredibly
well-replicated and thought-out experiment, and you say, `Yeah,
that's it, he's nailed that one down.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it very compelling, very exciting,'' Pimm said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kareiva, an ecologist at the University of Washington, in
Seattle, said many scientists would not even attempt Tilman's work.
``They say it can't work, it's too complicated, or there are too
many confounding factors in the experiment,'' Kareiva said.
</P>
<P>
   But Tilman is an ebullient optimist _ words pour from him in a
torrent of enthusiasm _ and Kareiva says it is this optimism that
drives the ambitious experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Tilman's goal is to help make ecology a rigorous
mathematics-based discipline like, say, physics. He wants to reduce
the principles of ecosystem function to mathematical equations that
scientists can use to predict how nature will behave under varying
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Success in this effort would be a boon to ecology, where efforts
to conserve and restore natural landscapes are often based more on
educated guesswork than on firmly delineated and codified
scientific principles.
</P>
<P>
   Many other ecologists doubt that the complexities of ecology can
ever be reduced to a few general principles. Tilman believes they
can, and his method, a classic one in the hard sciences, is to
formulate a theory (expressed graphically in this case), reduce it
to equations, then test it on the ground at Cedar Creek. Usually,
he says, the theory turns out to be partly right and partly wrong.
So then it is is time to reformulate the theory. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Many associates praise Tilman's willingness to experiment and to
risk being wrong so boldly. ``Dave does not lack for guts in terms
of putting his money where his mouth is,'' said Mark Schwartz, a
former Tilman student who is now an ecologist at the University of
California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Tilman himself sees the question of sometimes being wrong a
little differently. For him, the part of the theory that turns out
to be wrong opens the way to further understanding. ``Where things
fall apart,'' he says, ``is where I get excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilman, 49, started out to be a physicist. But in his
undergraduate years at the University of Michigan in the late
1960s, he came to believe that the biggest and most interesting
questions in physics had already been answered.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? He had always had a love of biology and of the
natural world. As one of four children growing up in a beach home
near St. Joseph, Mich., he went to sleep to the sound of Lake
Michigan lapping the shoreline. In Little League, where he was not
a bad player, his teammates called him the Professor; he was often
less interested in the game than in the flowers and bugs in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   So it was natural that his search for an alternative to physics
should lead him to biology, and in turn to ecology, a science, he
says, that ``reminded me of what it must have felt like to have
been Newton or others back in the early days of physics.'' In
ecology, big questions still remained unanswered; masses of
information from the field awaited rigorous analysis and a
theoretical framework to explain it. And there was the added bonus
of ecology's role in helping preserve the environment.
</P>
<P>
   For his doctoral thesis at Michigan, he plunged immediately into
the world of experimental ecology. Intrigued and disturbed by the
growth of algae in Lake Michigan, he studied the response of scores
of the lake's different algal species to their two main nutrients,
phosphate and silicate. He tested each species in the laboratory
and found that each required a different ratio of the two
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning that the ratio of the nutrients in the lake varied
enormously, he figured that the number of algal species the lake
could support was likewise enormous, since each could find the
ratio it needed at a different point in the water. He reduced this
concept to predictive equations, and it was soon being used by
federal water quality regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, at the age of 26, he arrived at the University of
Minnesota with his wife, Cathie (they now have four children, aged
9 to 21). Within a week of taking up his position as an assistant
professor, he was walking around the grasslands of Cedar Creek, and
soon concluded that the prairie was even better than a lake for
investigating the relationship between nutrient amounts and species
diversity: ``Soil sits there year after year,'' he says, ``and you
can measure exactly what a plant is experiencing.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, his experiments focussed on the basic mechanics,
as it were, of ecosystem functioning. His underlying assumption was
(and is) that the structure of ecosystems is controlled by two
major processes: interaction between consumers and the resources
they consume (plants and nutrients, for instance, or predators and
prey) and the recycling of nutrients (as in decomposition of dead
material). And so Tilman and his fellow experimenters set to work,
dividing expanses of ground into control and experimental plots,
blocking them off from each other when necessary, and then
manipulating variables like species composition, nutrients and soil
fungi.
</P>
<P>
   The main focus of the experiments has been on what controls
diversity of species and how diversity affects the functioning of
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   The largest, most rigorously controlled test, now under way, is
called BioCon. It involves 340 experimental plots on 20 acres of
Cedar Creek land. In 1993 the experimenters employed road scrapers,
plows and disks to scrub the plots (they had once been farmland)
clean of weeds and invasive species. Then they seeded the plots
with native prairie plants, varying the number of species from 1 to
32 per plot and choosing the species in each plot at random.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to follow all the plots for several years and record
the abundance of each species through time. ``These experiments are
slow,'' Tilman says. ``It's five or so years before you trust many
of the results.'' That is, until the components settle into some
sort of long-term equilibrium, they may send false signals about
how the ecosystem works.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are also investigating a number of ecosystem
dynamics. Does diversity make a difference in plants'
susceptibility to disease, for instance? There is reason, Tilman
says, to believe that low diversity increases vulnerability. The
idea is that the lower the diversity, the more abundant are the
plants of any one species, and the closer they are together,
allowing disease _ in this case, fungal diseases _ to spread from
one plant to another.
</P>
<P>
   At one plot, a doctoral candidate, Charles Mitchell, was picking
through a thick stand of little bluestem grass, estimating the
percentage of leaves and leaf area covered by the telltale
brown-rust spots of fungal disease. He had already looked at
thousands of plants and was entering the data as he collected it on
the keyboard of a hand-held computer. (Twenty years ago, notes
Tilman, the lack of computer capacity would have made it impossible
to analyze the mass of data he and his students are collecting.)
</P>
<P>
   A few yards away, perhaps a dozen people weeded plots to keep
the experiments from being clouded by invasive plants. And in one
spot, whooshing, computer-controlled jets of air loaded with carbon
dioxide continually adjusted the amount of the gas flooding an
experimental plot to keep it at about double the pre-industrial
concentration. Here, the idea is to manipulate both carbon dioxide
and nitrogen, two chemicals with which humans are flooding the
biosphere, to determine their combined effects on plant diversity.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more variables being looked at as well, and the
lush, unruly, highly complex mixture of plants that make up the
prairie at Cedar Creek vividly raises the question of whether it is
really possible, out in nature, to control everything that needs to
be controlled in a valid way.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz notes, for instance, that weeding the plots changes the
amount of biomass in them, and this, he says, introduces an
experimental weakness. Other scientists say that hidden variables,
unrecognized and unaccounted for by the experimenter, may produce
misleading results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't control everything,'' Schwartz says. Moreover,
he is one of those who questions whether it is possible to boil
ecosystem behavior down to a few relatively simple mathematical
equations. The attempt to do so, he said, is ``good for ecology,
but I also think it's realistic to think it may be more complicated
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pimm, the Tennessee ecologist, for one, believes it is better to
try ``than just to throw your hands up and say it's impossible.''
And in fact, he said, ``David has shown that a lot of the things we
thought were impossible can be reduced to patterns.''

`WASHINGTON'S OTHER SCANDAL': MONEY, NOT SEX 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Moyers and ``Frontline'' return Tuesday night to what they
call ``Washington's Other Scandal.'' You remember: That's the one
about campaign financing, when the president entertained rich
contributors instead of interns. This report focuses on how the
1996 Clinton campaigners sold ``access'' to those who could afford
it.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on Dick Morris, the president's favorite political
strategist turned television thinker, the program tells of the
urgency in the Clinton camp to raise money for a big drive as the
1996 elections approached. In search of ways to get around
restrictions on contributions directly to candidates, the
Clintonians went after ``soft money'' from fat cats, purportedly
for ``issue ads'' unrelated to the campaign. That turned out, as
they say, to be a distinction without a difference.
</P>
<P>
   In a portent of rationalizations to come, White House advisers
like Harold Ickes assured Clinton that the strategy met the
language of the law if not its spirit. Pressed by Moyers, ever the
theology student, on the morality of the operation, Ickes assures
him that moral calculations did not cause any loss of sleep around
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding moral guide was that the other side would be
doing much the same thing. As for those stern Republican Party
moralizers, who are occupied these days with issuing commandments
for presidential behavior, they have shown little interest in
campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   Videos of gatherings for especially generous donors, presided
over by the president, show Clinton expressing his appreciation,
though no neckties seem to have been involved. (In the months
leading to the 1996 campaign, by ``Frontline's'' account, 532 White
House guests came up with $26.4 million, about $50,000 per cup of
coffee.) ``There is no cap on how much a wealthy individual can
give,'' Moyers emphasizes. ``The lid is off.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the president has laid claim to identifying with
people who have ``the short end of the stick,'' Moyers asks Ickes
in a rhetorical flourish how many constituents at that end ever got
invitations to coffee. Since some things are prohibited even at the
White House, no money changed hands on the premises. But that
appears to have been a minor formality.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the attention Tuesday night is given to the
Clinton success story, Moyers makes plain that campaign finagling
is a bipartisan activity. The program looks into how businessmen in
quest of government favors became major benefactors of Republican
candidates while concealing where the money was coming from. Moyers
calls the collaboration between Democrats and Republicans in
protecting the true sources of their bounties ``a mutual protection
racket.''
</P>
<P>
   With attention focused elsewhere these days, ``Washington's
Other Scandal'' reminds us that it is still money more than the
other thing that makes politics go round.

<P>
   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; More Makeup at Barneys &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Manheimer, vice president of cosmetics and fragrance for
Barneys New York, noted that when sales per square foot are
compared for various types of merchandise, cosmetics generally
outperform everything else. It is the same for many department
stores, which in the last year have been increasing the space
devoted to beauty. Construction begins this month on a new
apothecary area on the first floor of Barneys Madison Avenue store
and is expected to be completed by Nov. 8, just in time for the
lucrative holiday shopping season. There will no longer be an
entrance through the store into Bulgari next door.
</P>
<P>
   The new area will have an expanded range of bath and beauty
products and will allow Barneys to increase its representation of
cosmetics lines. A few blocks away, Henri Bendel last year
aggressively expanded its cosmetics offerings, replacing
ready-to-wear space with cosmetics shops like MAC, and Macys has
unveiled a sparkling new cosmetics and fragrance area on its first
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys will add a Philosophy shop, and makeup from Fresh, Body
and Soul, Cargo and Le Clerc, among other lines. Kiehl's and
Francois Nars are the store's best-selling cosmetics lines, and the
expansion will allow Barneys to double its Nars space, Ms.
Manheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys approaches beauty a little differently from its
competitors. The no-spritzing policy will still be in effect, and
the store employs its own beauty sales personnel. Other shops like
Macy's and Bendel's rely on the cosmetics companies to supply
salespeople. And Barneys' aversion to color extends from its
ready-to-wear offerings to cosmetics. The new counters will still
be stocked full of natural-toned hues, although there will be some
concessions made to plum shades as a counterweight to the season's
gray clothes. ``Neutrals for us remain popular,'' Ms. Manheim said,
``though we will be going deeper into plums, which lend themselves
to the trends in fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Soda-Bottle Fashion &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200,000 Jones soda bottles bearing A/X Armani Exchange
advertising will be distributed around New York through the fall.
While customers are guzzling drinks like ``pineapple upside down,''
they can decide if they want to buy that ribbed sweater pictured on
the bottle. The idea may be extended to Los Angeles and other
markets, Lori Krauss, a spokeswoman for A/X, said.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white advertisements featured on 12 of Jones' 16
flavors are drawn from the A/X fall advertising campaign that is
running in fashion magazines. The soda bottle campaign cost A/X
about $4,000, Ms. Krauss said.
</P>
<P>
   The sodas are being sold in outlets where Jones would normally
be distributed, like fancy delis and supermarkets, but they are not
available in A/X stores. ``The theme of the whole campaign was life
style and how do you incorporate A/X into your life,'' Ms. Krauss
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For Mizrahi, Film and Ballets &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Although Isaac Mizrahi announced last week that he is closing
his fashion company, he does not plan to sit around twiddling his
thumbs. The designer said he is already working on a screenplay
titled ``Wild About Harry,'' a Barry Josephson and Barry Sonnenfeld
picture.
</P>
<P>
   This summer he and Nina Santisi, his former vice president of
public relations, formed Baby, a film production company to be
located in Greenwich Village. Baby has a deal with Dreamworks to
produce ``The Adventures of Sandee the Supermodel,'' based on
Mizrahi's illustrated book published this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Mizrahi is designing the costumes for two ballets by Mark
Morris, his friend. The first is a ballet commissioned by the San
Francisco Ballet, and the other, said the designer, is still a
secret. ``So many opportunities have come my way in the past two to
three years that I have not been able to take advantage of,''
Mizrahi said.

WILTERN SHOWCASES GIFTED WILLIAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Lucinda Williams is an artist, but sometimes she
must look back.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't especially want to Friday at the Wiltern Theatre
when, after a false start and a few smirks, she acquiesced to play
``Passionate Kisses,'' the simple pop-country tune which won her a
songwriter's Grammy via Mary Chapin Carpenter's passionless cover
version.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd, as crowds are known to do, demanded the hit. And
Williams played it.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the evening was plainly more enjoyable for the
celebrated Nashville singer-songwriter. Fronting a sturdy six-piece
band that included two electric guitars and two acoustics, Williams
eventually overcame a bad sound mix that stranded her vocals in
near-distortion for the first quarter of the 90-minute set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' songs live in a place where categories blur. A tune
like ``Still I Long for Your Kiss,'' for example, straddles the
line between r&AMP;b and country while ``Metal Firecracker'' could fit
in comfortably on a straight-ahead rock station.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, commercial radio ignores Williams, just as it does
her next-door neighbor, Emmylou Harris, with whom this soulful
honky-tonk angel shares more than just Neighborhood Watch meetings.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wiltern, Williams, dressed head to toe in black, was best
on such world-weary songs as the sensual ``Right in Time,'' the
opening track on her long-awaited ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road''
album, arguably the best record of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another standout from the same disc Friday was the mournful but
humorous ``Lake Charles,'' about a late friend who was actually
born in East Texas but inexplicably liked to tell people he was
from Lake Charles, La.
</P>
<P>
   Before counting off the sweet ``Little Angel, Little Brother,''
Williams jokingly protested that not everything she writes has to
do with death.
</P>
<P>
   While many of her songs are about concrete places, Williams
covers emotional terrain with a sharp eye for detail. A memorable
moment in concert was the aching ``Side of the Road,'' among the
most perfect love songs ever written.
</P>
<P>
   Equally good was Williams' reading of the ballad ``Something
About What Happens When We Talk'' and the gorgeous title track of
her 1992 disc, ``Sweet Old World.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' band, which included solo artist Jim Lauderdale on
harmony vocals and acoustic guitar, did its job well, particularly
the subtle slide work of John Jackson, who spent six years on the
road with Bob Dylan.

RESEARCHER PROVES SCIENTISTS ARE FUNNY (SOME OF THEM) 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The award ceremony to be held on Thursday at Harvard University
will draw more than 1,100 scientists and their students. But the
occasion will be something less than solemn.
</P>
<P>
   Paper airplanes will sail from the stage and chants will rise
from the audience as the prize-winners receive their awards. They
will be the newest IgNobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
   The program includes an extremely brief opera on a scientific
subject, three one-minute scientific lectures called the Heisenberg
Certainty Lectures (with a stopwatch and a bouncer ready should the
speaker pass the 60-second mark), and a
win-a-date-with-a-Nobel-Laureate drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The IgNobel prizes, now in its seventh year, celebrate actual
published research or other scientific activities that are, in a
word, goofy.
</P>
<P>
   Past winners include Ellen Kleist of Greenland and Harald Moi of
Norway for their disturbing medical paper, ``Transmission of
Gonorrhea Through an Inflatable Doll''; D.M.R. Georget and
colleagues of England for their analysis of why breakfast cereal
becomes soggy; Chonosuke Okamura of Japan for his ``discovery'' of
humans, horses and dragon fossils, each a complete skeleton less
than one-hundredth of an inch long; and Robert Matthews of Aston
University in England for demonstrating that toast does indeed fall
on the buttered side.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for all this is Marc Abrahams, editor of
Annals of Improbable Research, a journal sometimes referred to as
the ``Mad magazine of science.'' It is probably the only scientific
journal with seven Nobel laureates and a felon on its editorial
board.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams, 42, is a Harvard-trained mathematician, former
computer software entrepreneur and columnist whose exploits as
editor of the magazine are passing into legend among academics.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Swampscott, Mass., and after his mathematics and
computer studies at Harvard, he developed educational programs to
train people to be good at decision-making. On the side, though, he
was writing science humor and eventually he submitted some work to
The Journal of Irreproducible Results, the predecessor of the
Annals. He could not find an address for it, so he wrote to Martin
Gardner, a mathematician and games specialist who had written
articles for the journal.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's reply was unexpectedly enthusiastic. ``Would you like
to be editor?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The journal lacked an editor and was undergoing other
organizational change. In 1990, Abrahams took the job at the new
publication.
</P>
<P>
   He has since built the journal into an enterprise that includes
dozens of contributors and an editorial board of distinguish
scientists and, of course, the IgNobels.
</P>
<P>
   In its own way, the journal has high standards. ``We turn down
more than 10 pieces for every one we accept,'' Abrahams said. ``I
think that's a higher rejection rate than Science or Nature. But
then, people think twice before submitting an article to Science or
Nature. Apparently people don't always think twice before
submitting a piece to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal's contents are divided between real scientific
papers with a humorous side and unreal ones with an occasionally
serious side. Together, they demonstrate, as the physics laureate
Sheldon Glashow puts it: ``Scientists do have a sense of humor.
Some of them, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal has a paid circulation of 2,000 (at $23 a year) and
the IgNobel Prize presentation annually draws a sellout crowd of
1,200 to the Sanders Theater, where it is broadcast on National
Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
   There are recurring themes. The engineering study ``Stress
Analysis of a Strapless Evening Gown,'' first reported in The
Journal of Irreproducible Results in the 1950s, later appeared in
musical form at the IgNobel ceremonies. Deborah Henson-Conant, a
professional harpist, had turned the work into a four-movement
orchestral work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deborah gives a demonstration as she plays,'' Abrahams said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nor does the journal shy away from expose. In 1995, not long
after the Public Broadcasting Service began the children's show
Barney, featuring a purple dinosaur, the journal published a report
of an investigation that used a wide-field X-ray device to observe
Barney at a suburban shopping mall, and to get images of Barney's
skeletal structure.
</P>
<P>
   While Barney's external morphology looked to the researchers
like that of bipedal ornithischian dinosaurs, ``X-ray photographs
of Barney have provided our most astounding observations,'' wrote
the authors, Edward C. Theriot and Earle E. Spamer of the Academy
of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and Arthur E. Bogan of
Freshwater Molluscan Research Center, in Sewell, N.J. Barney's
skeleton was ``clearly hominid both in morphometry and distribution
of osteological elements.'' They went on, ``if a skeleton of a
proto-human cannot be distinguished from that of Barney, there is a
likelihood that some of the skeletal specimens of early hominids _
``Lucy'' for example _ may, in fact, be a skeleton of a Barney
ancestor.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal has also scored some firsts. One article suggested
that if surgery may have to be repeated, surgeons should install
zippers, not sutures. Nowadays, surgical zippers are actually used
in some procedures.

 &HT;    PROTESTORS DECRY LOW NUMBER OF MINORITY SUPREME COURT CLERKS
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Emotional demonstrators marched in front of the
U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to protest the low number of minority
law clerks hired at the nation's highest judicial body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The justices' record on hiring clerks of color is so poor that
if the civil rights laws applied, the Supreme Court would be
vulnerable to a charge that it has discriminated on the basis of
race,'' said Stephan Kline, legislative counsel at the Alliance for
Justice, an association of public interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 428 clerks hired by the nine current justices since they
joined the court, less than 2 percent were African American, 4
percent were Asian American, 1 percent were Hispanic and none have
been Native American, according to a study conducted by the
national newspaper USA Today. One-quarter were women.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's protest, which came as the court held its opening
session of the 1998-99 term, was organized by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, the NAACP's president and CEO, said having
minority law clerks is especially important as the court considers
such controversial issues as affirmative action, school vouchers
and welfare reform. Clerks help determine which cases the court
will consider and write the first drafts of most decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Under gray, drizzling skies, the protestors marched in a crammed
oval on the sidewalk in front of the court. Many chanted, ``no
justice, no peace,'' as they carried signs that read, ``minority
law students need jobs too'' or ``Supreme Court, no justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the two-hour rally, Mfume and a handful of
others were arrested for crossing police lines as they mounted the
west steps of the court in an attempt to deliver resumes of
minorities they say are qualified to fill the prestigious
positions.
</P>
<P>
   With minorities making up nearly 20 percent of law graduates and
women making up nearly 40 percent, protesters said the ethnicity
and gender of high court law clerks should closely reflect American
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this court that ruled against (racial) set-asides (for
minority businesses) to put away their set-asides,'' said Rodney
Brown, chairman of the National Black Law Students Association.
``In your own words, justice delayed is still justice denied.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the USA Today study, Justice Antonin Scalia has the
worst minority hiring record among the nine justices, having hired
no minorities in his 13 years in office. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, who has hired 82 clerks in his 27 years, has hired just
one minority clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Stephen Breyer and John Paul Stevens have the best
records, with 15 percent of Breyer's clerks and 13.1 percent of
Stevens's being minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Off the 33 clerks hired by Justice Clarence Thomas, the only
minority member of the court, 12.1 percent have been minorities,
including one black clerk.
</P>
<P>
   To solve the problem, justices should hire from a larger pool of
applicants, Mfume and other organizers said. About half of the
clerks hired in the last 25 years have come from Harvard, Yale or
Columbia universities.
</P>
<P>
   A Supreme Court spokesperson said the court had no comment.

MORE WOMEN CHOOSING TO HAVE DOWN'S SYNDROME BABIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by DOWNS SYNDROME-TEST) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Conner Moore, 3, helps Barney clap his hands
and stomp his feet _ really fast _ as the purple dinosaur sings,
``If you're happy and you know it ...''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's own almond-shaped eyes sparkle, and his grin shows you
exactly how he feels _ even before he shapes the letter ``B'' with
his right hand and strokes the side of his face, signing his
favorite television character's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely awesome at signing,'' Shelley Moore says of
her son, who has Down's syndrome. Speech is difficult and delayed
for most people with Down's, so many speech therapists recommended
sign language to help fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never, ever regretted that he was born with an extra
chromosome, that he's exactly the way he is,'' Moore says. ``If I
could wave a wand and make Conner different, I would not even
consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 years since reliable tests were developed for Down's
syndrome, most women who tested positive for a child with Down's
have chosen to end their pregnancies. Now, however, doctors have
noticed a slight shift in the other direction. And, thanks to
medical advances, a huge increase in educational and developmental
opportunities and more social services and family support, people
born with Down's syndrome are living longer, more productive lives.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Moore was 33 when Conner was born and hadn't considered
the possibility that her baby might have Down's syndrome. Conner
was 6 weeks old when his pediatrician heard a heart murmur and
referred him to the heart specialists at Cook Children's Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   There, tests showed that he not only had multiple heart defects,
which required immediate and extensive surgery, but also Down's
syndrome. About 60 percent of babies born with Down's syndrome _
almost 5,000 each year in this country _ have some form of
congenital heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   John and Kay McGrew knew about Grady's extra chromosome more
than six months before he was born on Dec. 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   They felt shock and disbelief. ``We hadn't even talked about it
ahead of time. We just had amniocentesis because our doctor said
that at our age, we should,'' John McGrew says. He is 44, his wife,
42.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a personal decision (to continue the pregnancy). A lot
of families may not have all the good things going for them that we
have,'' McGrew says. ``We have a lot of support from our families
and good health insurance, and Grady is a sweet, quiet, precious
baby, who hasn't had any of the major health problems associated
with Down's. We were prepared for a lot more difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people born with Down's syndrome have medical problems all
their lives, including a much higher risk for hypothyroidism and
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The McGrews had an extensive ultrasound study done after they
learned Grady would have Down's, so they would be ready to deal
with any major heart defects. But not only is his heart fine, his
hearing, vision and breathing are normal, and he is only a little
slow in developing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our baby is so normal, we just treat him normal. He's very
aware and curious. He's trying to walk already. We will take him
wherever he wants to go in life. I hope he goes further than I
have,'' John McGrew says. ``I hope he graduates from college.''
</P>
<P>
   AIMING HIGHER: Higher expectations are making the big difference
in the quality of life for people born with Down's syndrome, says
Dr. Allen Crocker, assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard
Medical School and a national authority on Down's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``At present, the cultural norm is to terminate the pregnancy if
the fetus is determined to have Down's syndrome. That's the
expected behavior, but the number who would resist that tradition
is growing,'' says Crocker.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, it is estimated that almost 80 percent of the time,
the fetus is aborted when prenatal testing detects Down's early
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get an increasing number of parents who want to talk after
the tests, who want to know more about what it means to have
Down's, what to expect. And the majority of those who seek us out
for information end up retaining the pregnancy and moving on. That
was a trickle just 10 years ago, but there are more now _ nowhere
near the majority of all those who find out they are going to have
a baby with Down's, but a few more,'' Crocker says.
</P>
<P>
   Support services are now widely available, including improved
community living and educational opportunities. Most of these
children will go to regular public schools and work for a salary.
Many will grow up and get married. Life expectancy is about 58
years, according to Crocker.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 20 years ago, many children born with Down's were
placed in institutions shortly after birth and often died before
they reached adulthood. In the early 1930s, the estimated life
expectancy for people with Down's was only nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world of the person with Down's syndrome is so much
more valued and so much more attended to. Our expectations are
greater and being fulfilled,'' Crocker says. ``It used to be said
that a child with Down's syndrome would not learn to read and, as a
result, most of them did not. Now most children with Down's
syndrome will graduate from high school and read at the fifth-grade
level.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a ways to go. ``The biggest negative is still the
system,'' says Liz Moore, an assistant director of the National
Association for Retarded Citizens (The Arc), headquartered in
Arlington, Texas. ``We did a national survey last fall, and there
are tremendous waiting lists for the kinds of services needed:
residential placement, job training, jobs themselves, therapy of
all kinds. The world has not kept up with the demands.''
</P>
<P>
   For parents who decide they cannot care for a child with Down's,
Crocker recommends adoption as an option. ``There are a lot of
people who want babies who need them, and babies with Down's are in
such demand there's a waiting list in most major cities,'' he says.
``I could find you a family in 15 minutes that wants to adopt a
baby with Down's. That's a startling departure from 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   OUTLIVING EXPECTATIONS: The overall incidence of Down's
syndrome, about 1 in 1,000 live births, has not changed in most
states in the past 10 years, Crocker says, estimating that there
are 4,000 to 5,000 babies born with Down's each year.
</P>
<P>
   Different factors such as the number of older women giving birth
and the number undergoing prenatal screening and deciding to
terminate the pregnancy seem to even out the birth rate, according
to Crocker.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of having a baby with Down's increases for women after
age 35, but about 80 percent of Down's babies are born to mothers
under 35. It's simply a matter of so many more younger women having
babies in general and the fact that screening tests are not
routinely offered to younger women, Crocker says.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed dramatically is the number of people with
Down's surviving childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting rid of institutions did a lot for us,'' says Frank
Murphy, executive director of the National Down's Syndrome
Congress. ``Most babies born with Down's in the last 20 years have
gone home and grown up in a home, not in an institution. That in
itself gives a longer, better life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are living longer today, partly because of better
medical treatment. Heart defects are being fixed that were
inoperable 20 years ago. A lot of our kids had respiratory and
heart problems that took them early. Medicine has come a long way
for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the educational system has accepted our kids. In 1974, the
first bill passed in Congress giving our kids the right to school.
House Bill 94-142, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act,
gave them the right to a free and appropriate public education,''
Murphy says. ``They are graduating from high school and becoming
productive citizens like we knew they would be if we gave them a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of his six daughters is 22 and has Down's. ``My
daughter is a taxpayer, not a tax burden,'' he says. ``She has a
job sorting and stocking greeting cards. She takes care of two
different stores. She pays taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Moore puts it, her 3-year-old son is ``differently
abled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conner never ceases to amaze us,'' she says. ``When we got to
the hospital last week, he realized where we were and held up his
little hand to sign `stop,' and said `no' very firmly.'' (He'd had
his fill of needle sticks and hospitals.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want him to learn sign at first, but it's really been
a blessing,'' Moore says. ``When he learned to sign `more' and
`finished,' I realized this is only fair. It's very frustrating not
to be able to tell people what you want. He's learning to
finger-spell the alphabet.''
</P>
<P>
   He also can say ``Mama'' and ``Dada,'' ``Nana'' and ``bye-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want people to know these children are normal,'' Moore
says. ``There are 12 kids in Conner's preschool class, and he's
just one of the 12. When we left him the first day, he was sitting
in the middle of the floor with all the other children, singing a
song, willing and eager to learn just like any other normal child
on the first day of school.''

<P>
   Downs syndrome is a chromosomal anomaly. An error in cell
development results in 47 chromosomes rather than the usual 46. The
extra gene material changes the orderly development of the body and
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Most people with Down's syndrome score in the mild to moderate
range of mental retardation on standard IQ tests. Many have low
muscle tone, which can delay walking and other physical activities
such as holding a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   Amniocentesis was the first fetal test developed to help
determine the presence of chromosomal defects, including Down's,
about 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is still the definitive test and is recommended for women
over age 35, whose babies are at higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   For pregnant women of any age, a blood test known as the
``triple marker screening'' is routinely used to determine higher
risk and the need for amniocentesis. It has been available for
about five years.
</P>
<P>
   While no test is 100 percent accurate, amniocentesis is about
99.9 percent able to detect Down's syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   About half of all fetuses with Down's will also have ``soft
signs,'' such as increased skin folds, dilated kidneys and short
femur bones, which can be detected with ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
   Just this summer, two new noninvasive tests, one a complex
maternal blood analysis and the other an ultrasound study that
measures the bump under the skin at the back of a fetus's neck,
have been reported, but it is expected to be several years before
they are in general use.

`THE UNEASY CHAIR': A COMEDY OF VICTORIAN LONDON 
</HEADLINE>
   Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
 (fb)  
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The art of glowering, as opposed to that of merely
glaring, is being practiced with exemplary skill on the stage of
Playwrights Horizons at the moment. Portraying a landlady and her
tenant at rancorous odds with each other in ``The Uneasy Chair,''
an anemic comedy by the young dramatist Evan Smith, Dana Ivey and
Roger Rees turn their eyes into simmering bogs of unspeakable
hostility and discontent. Yes, the word is definitely glower,
unless you prefer the term ``baleful glances.''
</P>
<P>
   If the vocabulary sounds antiquated, it is also appropriate.
Smith's play is set, with pointed self-consciousness, in London in
the age of Victoria, when artificial postures came as naturally as
breathing and words were often filigreed. Rees, who did hard time
in that era as the redoubtable star of ``Nicholas Nickleby,'' and
Ivey, an actress of rarefied comic instincts, know just how to
exploit that sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working their way through the maze of euphemisms and indirection
with which their characters (bearing the unbearable names of Miss
Amelia Pickles and Capt. Josiah Wickett) address each other, these
performers give new weight to the idea of the word made flesh.
Gestures, carriage, facial expressions, all are perfectly keyed to
the stiff, arch language they speak. When Miss Pickles puts on ``an
exhibition of youthful gaiety'' or Captain Wickett complains about
being harassed by ``a fierce campaign of solicitude,'' you only
wish that Phiz, the fabled illustrator of Dickens, were still
around to sketch them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all this fine comic embroidery is plied to
embellish a play that is, at best, a small needlepoint sampler.
Smith has obviously made a close study of things Victorian, from
genteel romance novels to the plays of Oscar Wilde. But he uses his
knowledge less to comment on a cultural preciousness than to
emulate it.
</P>
<P>
   Directed at an ill-advised, leisurely trot by Richard Cottrell,
``The Uneasy Chair'' feels as if it should be over before it even
reaches the end of its first act. Handsomely produced and cast with
top-drawer comic talents, the play is nonetheless a fanciful sketch
stretched to the point of emaciation. It is, one presumes, some
sort of homage to John Maddison Morton's ``Box and Cox,'' the
classic landlady farce of 1847, but Morton's play takes less than
half the time to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Set amid the plump, peach-colored appointments of Miss Pickles'
drawing room (designed by Derek McLane), with costumes (by Jess
Goldstein) that are as fully upholstered as the furniture, the
comedy charts the unhappy evolution of its two main characters from
landlady and lodger to husband and wife. This comes about through
such vintage devices as misread letters and misunderstood
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   The central nonlove story is paralleled by the relationship
between Miss Pickles' niece (Haviland Morris) and the captain's
nephew (Paul Fitzgerald), which misfires for reasons befitting a
younger generation. Michael Arkin portrays an assortment of other
characters, including a barrister who represents both the plaintiff
and the accused in a breach-of-promise suit. This bit, like much of
the rest of the play, is initially funny and eventually wearisome.
</P>
<P>
   Smith provides decent if less than scintillating imitations of
period circumlocutions and Wildean epigrams. (Miss Pickles
describes her niece as one of society's ``most sought-after
beauties for 11 or 12 seasons.'') And he creates some amusing set
pieces, including a whimsical parlor game that quickly turns into a
source of nettlesome frustration for all its participants. That's
rather like the experience of watching Smith's play.

   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Dean of Women at an exclusive girls' school was lecturing
her students on sexual morality. `We live today in very difficult
times for young people. In moments of temptation,` she said, `ask
yourself just one question: Is an hour of pleasure worth a lifetime
of shame?`

but how do you make it last an hour?`

   Johnny watched, fascinated, as his mother smoothed cold cream on
her face.
</P>
<P>
   `Why do you do that, mommy?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `To make myself beautiful,` said his mother, who then began
removing the cream with a tissue.

   `What's the matter?` asked Little Johnny. `Giving up?`

write a book. How could he write a book? You saw his testimony. He
can't remember anything that happened! 'I may have been

   ``More problems for President Clinton. Now he's being sued by

   ``A toy company announced that it's coming out with a brand-new

   ``Earlier today, Hillary Clinton spoke to a group of 1,000 women

   I heard this exchange in the breakfast room of my hotel during a
recent trip to London. Over the hubbub of Japanese, French and
Saudi guests ordering from Greek and Pakistani waiters, a woman was
explaining the scene to her young daughter. ``Darling,'' she said.
``It's just like New York; no one speaks English.''

   When Wilma Askinas' husband, Milton, decided to take a memory
course, she signed up for a course on automobiles that was held at
a different location but on the same night, at the same time. Both
prepared themselves, he with a book on memory, she with a tool
chest filled with shiny new tools. On the appropriate night, Mrs.
Askinas went off to her class. When she returned, she found her
husband asleep on the couch. ``How was the course?'' she asked. ``I
forgot to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a reception, marking the end of the academic year for
graduating psychiatry residents. A man whose wife was one of the
graduates was left on his own for a short time. The man, who wishes
to remain anonymous, was surrounded by what he called a
sophisticated group of well-known professors, residents, spouses
and other members of the psychiatric community. He was amused and
impressed at the exchange he overheard between two of the
professors.
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 1: ``I want to apologize to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 2: ``Oh really? For what?''
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 1: ``Well over the past six months or so, I feel
that I've been rather short with you. I haven't been supportive of
your work and I don't think that I've treated you with the respect
that you deserve. But I just wanted you to know that this has
nothing to do with you. I've been having some personal problems and
I never meant to bring these problems to work.
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 2: ``Oh no, no, no. Don't be silly. It's an honor
to be the object of your transference.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a one o'clock performance of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and
Dorothea A. Hecht had bought a bag of popcorn to munch and lunch
on. Several minutes into the picture, she felt a tap on her
shoulder and heard a sharp chastising voice: ``Aren't you ashamed
of yourself? Men are dying in the water and you're eating
POPCORN!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hecht kept on eating, but _ discretion being the better part
of valor _ not before she changed her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Brous and her husband, Philip, were grocery shopping at
a supermarket recently. The market was being renovated, which meant
that a number of items had been temporarily relocated. Philip Brous
asked an employee where he could find English muffins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mister, we don't carry foreign breads,'' was the reply.
</P>
<P>
   A hot day this summer found me at Kennedy Airport's
International Arrivals Building, awaiting the arrival of loved
ones. The customs doors would swing open, and sometimes a few
people would drift out and other times large groups would appear,
all pushing overloaded luggage carts.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was a collective gasp as a dark-haired young
woman walked out alone. She stood before us dressed in an elaborate
floor-length white wedding dress and veil. The huge crowd burst
into spontaneous applause as she made her way down the walkway.
</P>
<P>
   When she got to the end, she started back. At that moment, a
young man, holding a small bouquet of flowers, came out of the
crowd. As he shyly touched her arm, she turned to him and they
embraced. We burst into applause once again, but as the couple
walked out, we were left with questions:
</P>
<P>
   Was this her intended? Was this their first meeting? Were they
going directly to the wedding ceremony? Where was her luggage?
</P>

   The scene: Fast-food restaurant with an advertised special of a
slice of pepperoni pizza and a 16-ounce soda, all for $2.75. Otto
Salamon places his order but asks for a small soda instead of the
large one. He moves down the aisle to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Cashier, punching her computer-driven register: ``That's
$4.75.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamon: ``What happened to the $2.75 special?''
</P>
<P>
   Cashier: ``That's for pizza with a large soda. What you got
there is pizza with a small soda. For that we have to charge you
extra.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamon: ``How can we get the special price then?''
</P>
<P>
   Cashier: ``We can buy a large soda instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamon returned to the counter to make the exchange. The
counter man tossed his small soda in the garbage and handed him a
16-ounce container. Salamon returned to the cashier, paid his $2.75
and remarked that the whole thing made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   Cashier, with an are-you-stupid-or-what look: ``Then how come
it's in the computer?''
</P>
<P>
   Judy Lerner thinks that perhaps this note, written by her
granddaughter Jacklyn when she was 7 years old, may be a child's
version of being boiled in oil. Jacklyn had reached the end of her
patience with her little sister and dashed off a warning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Allison, I am sueing you! You are going to be punished in
a quart of law. Love, Jacklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   My wife thought it would be nice if I picked out a perfume for
her. I had never done this before, so I didn't know what to expect
when I walked into Bloomingdale's perfume department. I endured
sales pitches and smelled printed tabs of paper, which cheerful men
and women handed me after spritzing them with the corresponding
brand's scent. At one counter, I was offered a jar of coffee beans
to clean my nose's palette.
</P>
<P>
   After half an hour, during which I sampled 24 different
perfumes, I could barely discern the nuances among scents _
citrusy, flowery, earthy. I finally settled at one counter and
spent about 10 minutes among five different perfumes.
</P>
<P>
   After much thought, I made my decision. Later that day, proud of
my accomplishment, I called my wife. She began laughing when I told
her what I had selected. It was the perfume she always wore.

   My wife thought it would be nice if I picked out a perfume for
her. I had never done this before, so I didn't know what to expect
when I walked into Bloomingdale's perfume department. I endured
sales pitches and smelled printed tabs of paper, which cheerful men
and women handed me after spritzing them with the corresponding
brand's scent. At one counter, I was offered a jar of coffee beans
to clean my nose's palette.
</P>
<P>
   After half an hour, during which I sampled 24 different
perfumes, I could barely discern the nuances among scents _
citrusy, flowery, earthy. I finally settled at one counter and
spent about 10 minutes among five different perfumes.
</P>
<P>
   After much thought, I made my decision. Later that day, proud of
my accomplishment, I called my wife. She began laughing when I told
her what I had selected. It was the perfume she always wore.

 &HT;    ALLOWED THEM TO POLICE THEMSELVES, CENTERS BILKED MEDICARE
 &HT;    580&AMP;add. Florida, Texas eds: Story's final grafs list barred
centers.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal officials conceded Monday that they had
trusted private mental health centers to police themselves in a
Medicare program that ballooned from $60 million to $350 million in
five years, with rates of fraud and abuse as high as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We built it, and they came,'' said Penny Thompson, a
government overseer, of the benefit program that spawned a network
of community health centers, especially in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who works for the Health Care Financing
Administration, the agency in charge of Medicare, told a
congressional hearing that after Medicare began offering outpatient
mental health benefits for the elderly, private providers rushed to
set up services and bill the federal government for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   When government investigators began looking into a sample of
programs this year, they found that the mental health services
often amounted to no more than bingo, arts and crafts or other
social events that were billed to Medicare as intensive psychiatric
services.
</P>
<P>
   The schemes to bilk the government are especially prevalent in
Texas and Florida, which together account for more than half the
total billings in the outpatient mental health program, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just stunned that we've got another program that was able
to grow like a weed,'' said Rep. Joe L. Barton, R-Texas, who called
the House Commerce subcommittee hearing after two government
investigations discovered rampant abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a black eye to the federal government to have a program
like this that's just grown totally out of control,'' said Barton.
He displayed a posted invitation from a Washington state retirement
home saying, ``Come join us for coffee, cookies, and conversation
... in the rec center'' with the word ``Free'' prominently
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The event was not free for the government, however. The facility
billed Medicare $1,300 for psychiatric services for the 35 to 40
attendees. Although that company has been assessed $45,000 in
penalties, few of the others involved in the practice have been
caught until now.
</P>
<P>
   Under lax procedures uncovered by the inspector general of the
Department of Health and Human Services, the mental health centers
merely signed a form attesting that their services were eligible
for Medicare reimbursement and that their facility met local
certification requirements. Often, the doctors who diagnosed the
need for psychiatric treatment were employed by the centers that
offered the services.
</P>
<P>
   The Health and Human Services Department last week notified 20
centers in Texas, Florida and Louisiana that they are ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could say we'll terminate all of the offenders,''
said Thompson, but she said the department did not want to cause
disruption for clients.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Barton, Thompson predicted that most of the 1,000
community mental health programs would be excluded from Medicare
funding by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Thompson conceded that her department has known about
abuses in the mental health centers as far back as 1994. ``I think
it wasn't acted upon,'' she said, because other problems loomed so
much bigger in Medicare, whose overall spending for the year just
ended was $218 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much the outpatient mental health program will cost
after new safeguards are added, Thompson said ``much less'' than it
does now.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   But she offered no specific amount, saying that her agency was
instituting a 10-point plan for better oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is not to develop estimates,'' she said. ``Our plan
is to implement the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Community mental health centers that were notified last week
that they do not qualify for Medicare participation include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Florida: Quality Care Mental Health Management in St.
Petersburg; Daylight of East Pasco, Inc. in Zephyrhills; Serenity
House of Volusia, Inc. in Daytona Beach, Advanced Counseling
Services, Advanced Counseling Services, Inc., in Coral Gables; and
Miami centers including Sierra Norwood Community Mental Health
Center, Ultimate Medical Center, Inc., Cutler Ridge Community
Health Center, Mutual Behavioral Health Care Center, Professional
Therapeutic Alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Texas: Bright Day Treatment Center in Laredo, New Horizons of
Corpus Christi, New Insights Behavioral Center in McAllen, Sun West
Health and Wellness Center Inc. of Brownwood, Texas Serenity
Counseling Services, Inc. in Houston, and San Antonio centers
Classic Community Mental Health Center and Maren Care Inc.

   ``You get the feeling that if Ross Perot hadn't gotten rich,
he'd be writing manifestos in a cabin up there in Montana?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a basketball fan, the NBA season is in real danger
this year because of this player lockout thing. But the good news:
Looks like Shawn Kemp may have enough illegitimate kids to start a

   President Clinton could earn as much as $10 million if he would
write a book. How could he write a book? You saw his testimony. He
can't remember anything that happened! 'I may have been
President.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``More problems for President Clinton. Now he's being sued by
David Copperfield. He said he came up with the idea of the
disappearing cigar trick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton seems to be rebounding. You hear his new philosophy?
'No Stain, No Gain.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tabloids are reporting that Monica Lewinsky may be dating
a doctor. Her last boyfriend was Clinton, now she's dating a
doctor. I guess she's got a thing for men who play golf and ask
strangers to take their clothes off.''
</P>

opened their own Web site. If you want to find them, they're at

   ``This year, for the fifth time in a row, Bill Gates topped
Forbes Magazine's list of the richest people in America. To give
you an idea of how rich Gates is, the second guy on the list was
the guy who cleans Gates' pool.''

   ``A toy company announced that it's coming out with a brand-new
virtual pet that talks, eats, burps and passes gas. Apparently, it
was designed to show young women what it's like to be married.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Gillette announced their going to lay off 10
percent of their work force. Although now it may not happen,
because as soon as they announced the layoffs, sales of razor
blades went way up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was reported today that Linda Tripp has passed a lie
detector test where she has denied tampering with the Monica
Lewinsky tapes. Afterwards, Tripp said, 'Tampering with secretly
recorded conversations between friends would be wrong.'''
</P>

   ``This week Hillary Clinton attended the eighth annual
conference for the wives of heads of states. Apparently, it's
payback time, because this year's conference was held at Hedonism
II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon Stone said that recent media speculation about whether
she's pregnant is an invasion of the most private part of her body.
Stone said that part of her body is reserved for her husband, her
gynecologist and the people who see her movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Transcripts released today in Washington show that Monica
Lewinsky once told Linda Tripp that the whole situation between her
and the President 'is too much for one person to deal with.' Which
is why President Clinton encouraged her to bring a friend along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today, Hillary Clinton spoke to a group of 1,000 women
and said that now is the time for women to make gains in their
economic status. Hillary said the easiest way to do that is to
settle out of court with her husband.''
</P>

   ``Since the Clinton sex scandal erupted, the percentage of
people naming their daughters Monica has gone way down. On the
other hand, thousands of men have renamed a certain sex act a
'Lewinsky.'''

   I heard this exchange in the breakfast room of my hotel during a
recent trip to London. Over the hubbub of Japanese, French and

explaining the scene to her young daughter. ``Darling,'' she said.
``It's just like New York; no one speaks English.''

   A typical New York example of anthropomorphism, overheard by
Michael Parley. A woman in Riverside Park chastising her dog: ``You

``It's not good. It's so ...'' (pause while she searched for the
right word) ``... manipulative.''

   When Wilma Askinas' husband, Milton, decided to take a memory
course, she signed up for a course on automobiles that was held at
a different location but on the same night, at the same time. Both
prepared themselves, he with a book on memory, she with a tool
chest filled with shiny new tools. On the appropriate night, Mrs.
Askinas went off to her class. When she returned, she found her
husband asleep on the couch. ``How was the course?'' she asked. ``I
forgot to go,'' he said.

   It was a reception, marking the end of the academic year for
graduating psychiatry residents. A man whose wife was one of the
graduates was left on his own for a short time. The man, who wishes
to remain anonymous, was surrounded by what he called a
sophisticated group of well-known professors, residents, spouses
and other members of the psychiatric community. He was amused and
impressed at the exchange he overheard between two of the
professors.
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 1: ``I want to apologize to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 2: ``Oh really? For what?''
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 1: ``Well over the past six months or so, I feel
that I've been rather short with you. I haven't been supportive of
your work and I don't think that I've treated you with the respect
that you deserve. But I just wanted you to know that this has
nothing to do with you. I've been having some personal problems and
I never meant to bring these problems to work.
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 2: ``Oh no, no, no. Don't be silly. It's an honor
to be the object of your transference.''
</P>

   It was a one o'clock performance of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and
Dorothea A. Hecht had bought a bag of popcorn to munch and lunch
on. Several minutes into the picture, she felt a tap on her
shoulder and heard a sharp chastising voice: ``Aren't you ashamed
of yourself? Men are dying in the water and you're eating
POPCORN!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hecht kept on eating, but _ discretion being the better part
of valor _ not before she changed her seat.

   Barbara Brous and her husband, Philip, were grocery shopping at
a supermarket recently. The market was being renovated, which meant
that a number of items had been temporarily relocated. Philip Brous

   ``Mister, we don't carry foreign breads,'' was the reply.

   A hot day this summer found me at Kennedy Airport's
International Arrivals Building, awaiting the arrival of loved

all pushing overloaded luggage carts.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was a collective gasp as a dark-haired young
woman walked out alone. She stood before us dressed in an elaborate
floor-length white wedding dress and veil. The huge crowd burst
into spontaneous applause as she made her way down the walkway.
</P>
<P>
   When she got to the end, she started back. At that moment, a
young man, holding a small bouquet of flowers, came out of the
crowd. As he shyly touched her arm, she turned to him and they
embraced. We burst into applause once again, but as the couple
walked out, we were left with questions:
</P>
<P>
   Was this her intended? Was this their first meeting? Were they
going directly to the wedding ceremony? Where was her luggage?

BOXER TRIES TO MOVE AWAY FROM CLINTON MATTER IN TOUGH CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a college senior, Barbara Boxer came
eyeball-to-eyeball with sexual harassment, the issue that 30 years
later she would grapple with in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer described the incident involving a professor at Brooklyn
College in her 1994 autobiography. He ``grabbed me by the shoulders
tightly and leaned over to kiss me. Now I remember his old face
coming at me, my pushing him away, grabbing the door handle and
running down the empty corridor ...''
</P>
<P>
   She never revealed the incident during her five terms in the
House of Representatives nor in October 1991 when she pressed for
public hearings into Anita Hill's sexual harassment allegations
against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   As Boxer faces a tough re-election contest against Republican
state Treasurer Matt Fong, the harassment issue arises again _ she
is saddled with questions about President Clinton's behavior in the
Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer has been a vigorous political ally of the president while
her daughter, Nicole, married a brother of first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton. The woman who led the charge for Anita Hill and
later pressed for public hearings into sexual harassment
accusations against Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., finds her initial
reluctance to criticize Clinton generating charges of a
double-standard.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nov. 3 election approaches, Boxer says she is asked about
the White House scandal and rather than the her differences with
Fong on issues like gun control and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendous frustration,'' Boxer said. ``It is the
reason I have to raise so much money to go over the heads of the
media (with television advertisements), because I can't get
anything printed that I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have given speeches _ about 25 speeches _ where I have
blasted Matt Fong's positions on everything from choice to the
environment ... I mean we don't agree on anything. It has been a
surreal experience, this campaign,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton's actions, she said, ``I feel terrible about it,
obviously. I am very sad about it. But I have _ all through this
career in the Senate _ just drawn the brightest of bright lines
between my personal feelings and my duties as a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Boxer, following other Democrats who had rebuked
Clinton, took to the Senate floor Sept. 8 and spoke out against the
president's ``immoral behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My decision has been to be very straightforward about this
relationship, but also not to back off the fact that I think he has
been a terrific president for this country and this state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton matter aside, critics say Boxer hasn't produced a
major legislative accomplishment in the Senate. They say that's the
harvest of a partisan lawmaker who grabs the media limelight, but
lacks the ability to deliver a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and her supporters counter that her knack for marshaling
attention to issues, giving voice to liberal Democrats in a
GOP-controlled Congress and landing federal dollars for California
are under-appreciated assets.
</P>
<P>
   Now she finds herself matched in close contest against a
candidate who can claim the diversity banner for himself as a
Chinese American.
</P>
<P>
   For Boxer, 57, backing off has never been one of her traits.
</P>
<P>
   She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Brooklyn
College. She went to Wall Street to put her husband, Stewart,
through Fordham Law School, but found as a woman she wasn't
accepted into a broker-training program.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she took a job as a secretary and studied for the
stockbroker's exam. By 1963, she had her license, and a broker job.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer and her husband, now an Oakland plaintiff's lawyer, moved
to the San Francisco Bay area in 1965, drawn by the region's
natural beauty.
</P>
<P>
   She was elected Marin County supervisor in 1976, and in 1982,
was elected to the House of Representatives. She was elected to the
Senate six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Peel away the speeches, endorsements and the television
advertisements, and the tally of Senate successes, measured by
Boxer's legislation that became law, is meager.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when it comes to environmental protection, which Boxer
claims as a paramount concern, Sen. Dianne Feinstein delivered the
California Desert Protection Act and spearheaded talks to preserve
the Headwaters old growth redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to have very different ideas about the role of a
senator,'' said Richard Fenno, a Rochester University political
science professor and congressional scholar.
</P>
<P>
   ``One says, `I want to get in there and compromise and be an
effective legislator.' The other says, `I want to be an effective
advocate.' One wants to work the issues. The other wants to
popularize them,'' Fenno said.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer clearly is uncomfortable with comparisons to Feinstein, a
fellow Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, Senator Feinstein and I really like each other. But we
are not joined at the hip ... I don't view that as a negative,''
Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to just come out in front with the issues. I always
have found that the compelling nature of the issue will win the
day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boxer style is to grab a hot-button issue and ride the wave
of public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Boxer's strength is sniffing out good issues and
knowing how to play the media with them,'' said San Francisco
Supervisor Michael Yaki, a former aide to Rep. Nancy Pelosi,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While Feinstein could be labeled the Senate's quintessential
moderate, eager to reach across party lines, Boxer has built a few,
less visible, cross-party ties, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been very responsive,'' said Republican Barbara
Warden, a San Diego city councilwoman who relies on Boxer to get
federal funds for the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reason for liking to work with her is she tells me up front
that it is something she can do or not do. And, if she can,
somebody (on her staff) is working on it,'' Warden said.

A DETERMINED FONG OVERCOMES ODDS IN CALIFORNIA SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was summer, a time when most high school
seniors sun and snore. But Matt Fong was running hard to snap
himself into shape, eyes as always trained on a target.
</P>
<P>
   At his side, running the Oakland hills where they grew up, was
his cousin and mentor, just one year older but enrolled in the
place where ``Kip'' Fong most wanted to be: the U.S. Air Force
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time we ran together, he was clearly hurting after
five miles,'' remembers Bradford Lee, now an Air Force colonel, a
physician and attorney. ``He realized he needed to get in better
shape to make it. He has an incredible perseverance. A lot of
things didn't come easy, he had to work at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong was not a natural athlete, nor a stellar scholar. But he
was determined to survive the physical and academic rigors that
felled nearly half his academy classmates. And in due time, he won
his wings.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the dogged quality evident in Fong's youth has
put him in a position to win a seat in the U.S. Senate. Critics of
the Republican candidate say his political success stems from
another quality of his upbringing: the name of his mother, longtime
secretary of state March Fong Eu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he thinks he can ride his mother's good name to the
polls,'' said another of Fong's cousins, Pattie Fong, a Yolo County
deputy district attorney. ``I respect people with ideas and vision.
I don't see him as having a vision. He's not his own thinker. He's
malleable. I see him as window dressing for the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat turned Republican, Matthew Kipling Fong followed in
the footprints of his mother but diverged into starkly different
ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is where he is because of the tie to his mother,'' said
Republican analyst Tony Quinn. ``He is running in the shadow of the
fine reputation March carried as a public servant.''
</P>
<P>
   In a clear instance of maternal pride over partisan politics, Eu
_ a Democrat _ is avidly pitching her son's candidacy, touting the
importance of an Asian-American presence in Congress, the
competence of her son and his commitment to public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been imbued with a sense of public trust,'' Eu said.
``Even when he was 12 years old, he said he wanted to be a U.S.
senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong is a graduate of the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs,
Colo., and earned a master's degree in business administration at
Pepperdine University and a law degree at Southwestern University
School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his four years as state treasurer and one term on the
Board of Equalization, Fong, 44, is widely perceived as a political
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, California's electorate has but a vague fix on the
candidate running even in the polls with incumbent Democratic Sen.
Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fong is a benign candidate,'' Quinn said. ``It doesn't hurt
that he hasn't been ultra-specific on issues. ... Fong comes across
as a hard-working guy. His interest is tax policy, which is not a
very sexy area.''
</P>
<P>
   To critics, Fong is tentative, overly swift to spout Republican
boilerplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most timid candidate running for statewide office,''
said Bob Mulholland, a Democratic Party campaign adviser.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say Fong is the moderate California is looking
for, a low-key contrast to the bombastic Boxer. While Fong may lack
a charismatic public presence, he has become more adept in front of
a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of stiff and uncomfortable; he doesn't seem like the
kind of guy you'd go out drinking with,'' said John Pitney, an
associate professor of government at Claremont-McKenna College and
a former Republican National Committee staff member. ``For some
people, campaign skills come naturally. For Matt they have to be
learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Persistence and calm ambition are Fong's underpinnings. Two
years ago, at the genesis of his Senate bid, he wasn't given much
of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't listen to the naysayers,'' said GOP consultant Dan
Schnur. ``He worked as hard as a candidate can.''
</P>
<P>
   Touting himself as moderate, Fong's platform favors increased
military ending, school vouchers and a flat tax rate of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He personally opposes abortion but supports a woman's right to
choice during the first trimester of pregnancy. He backs a ban on
so-called late-term abortion and opposes federal funding of
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a committed Christian who (worships) in Whittier at a
Baptist church,'' said the Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the
Traditional Values Coalition. ``We don't agree 100 percent on the
abortion issue but ... it's not a perfect world. It's like you are
sitting in first class, and you don't like the salad dressing, but
the filet mignon and potatoes are great.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that a vote for Fong is less an affirmation of the
candidate than a repudiation of the far more liberal Boxer, who is
finishing her first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside is his candidacy doesn't have a great deal of
magnetism,'' Pitney said. ``Rather, it is propelled by people who
are repelled by Boxer.''

   The Dean of Women at an exclusive girls' school was lecturing
her students on sexual morality. `We live today in very difficult
times for young people. In moments of temptation,` she said, `ask
yourself just one question: Is an hour of pleasure worth a lifetime
of shame?`

<P>
   `Why do you do that, mommy?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `To make myself beautiful,` said his mother, who then began
removing the cream with a tissue.
</P>
<P>
   `What's the matter?` asked Little Johnny. `Giving up?`

<P>
   ``You get the feeling that if Ross Perot hadn't gotten rich,
he'd be writing manifestos in a cabin up there in Montana?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a basketball fan, the NBA season is in real danger
this year because of this player lockout thing. But the good news:
Looks like Shawn Kemp may have enough illegitimate kids to start a
rival league.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton could earn as much as $10 million if he would
write a book. How could he write a book? You saw his testimony. He
can't remember anything that happened! 'I may have been
President.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``More problems for President Clinton. Now he's being sued by
David Copperfield. He said he came up with the idea of the
disappearing cigar trick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton seems to be rebounding. You hear his new philosophy?
'No Stain, No Gain.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The tabloids are reporting that Monica Lewinsky may be dating
a doctor. Her last boyfriend was Clinton, now she's dating a
doctor. I guess she's got a thing for men who play golf and ask
strangers to take their clothes off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who want to see Dan Quayle elected President have
opened their own Web site. If you want to find them, they're at
www.no-chance-in-hell.com.''

saying, 'To be human is to be flawed.' He went on to say, 'And I
know what I'm talking about because I am Michael Bolton.'''

   ``This year, for the fifth time in a row, Bill Gates topped
Forbes Magazine's list of the richest people in America. To give
you an idea of how rich Gates is, the second guy on the list was
the guy who cleans Gates' pool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A toy company announced that it's coming out with a brand-new
virtual pet that talks, eats, burps and passes gas. Apparently, it
was designed to show young women what it's like to be married.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Gillette announced their going to lay off 10
percent of their work force. Although now it may not happen,
because as soon as they announced the layoffs, sales of razor
blades went way up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was reported today that Linda Tripp has passed a lie
detector test where she has denied tampering with the Monica
Lewinsky tapes. Afterwards, Tripp said, 'Tampering with secretly
recorded conversations between friends would be wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``This week Hillary Clinton attended the eighth annual
conference for the wives of heads of states. Apparently, it's
payback time, because this year's conference was held at Hedonism
II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon Stone said that recent media speculation about whether
she's pregnant is an invasion of the most private part of her body.
Stone said that part of her body is reserved for her husband, her
gynecologist and the people who see her movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Transcripts released today in Washington show that Monica
Lewinsky once told Linda Tripp that the whole situation between her
and the President 'is too much for one person to deal with.' Which
is why President Clinton encouraged her to bring a friend along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today, Hillary Clinton spoke to a group of 1,000 women
and said that now is the time for women to make gains in their
economic status. Hillary said the easiest way to do that is to
settle out of court with her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Clinton sex scandal erupted, the percentage of
people naming their daughters Monica has gone way down. On the
other hand, thousands of men have renamed a certain sex act a
'Lewinsky.'''

</P>
<P>
   I heard this exchange in the breakfast room of my hotel during a
recent trip to London. Over the hubbub of Japanese, French and
Saudi guests ordering from Greek and Pakistani waiters, a woman was
explaining the scene to her young daughter. ``Darling,'' she said.
``It's just like New York; no one speaks English.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A typical New York example of anthropomorphism, overheard by
Michael Parley. A woman in Riverside Park chastising her dog: ``You
have to learn to not bark so much,'' she said in all seriousness.
``It's not good. It's so ...'' (pause while she searched for the
right word) ``... manipulative.''

   When Wilma Askinas' husband, Milton, decided to take a memory
course, she signed up for a course on automobiles that was held at
a different location but on the same night, at the same time. Both
prepared themselves, he with a book on memory, she with a tool
chest filled with shiny new tools. On the appropriate night, Mrs.
Askinas went off to her class. When she returned, she found her
husband asleep on the couch. ``How was the course?'' she asked. ``I
forgot to go,'' he said.

   It was a reception, marking the end of the academic year for
graduating psychiatry residents. A man whose wife was one of the
graduates was left on his own for a short time. The man, who wishes
to remain anonymous, was surrounded by what he called a
sophisticated group of well-known professors, residents, spouses
and other members of the psychiatric community. He was amused and
impressed at the exchange he overheard between two of the
professors.
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 1: ``I want to apologize to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 2: ``Oh really? For what?''
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 1: ``Well over the past six months or so, I feel
that I've been rather short with you. I haven't been supportive of
your work and I don't think that I've treated you with the respect
that you deserve. But I just wanted you to know that this has
nothing to do with you. I've been having some personal problems and
I never meant to bring these problems to work.
</P>
<P>
   Professor No. 2: ``Oh no, no, no. Don't be silly. It's an honor
to be the object of your transference.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a one o'clock performance of ``Saving Private Ryan'' and
Dorothea A. Hecht had bought a bag of popcorn to munch and lunch
on. Several minutes into the picture, she felt a tap on her
shoulder and heard a sharp chastising voice: ``Aren't you ashamed
of yourself? Men are dying in the water and you're eating
POPCORN!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hecht kept on eating, but _ discretion being the better part
of valor _ not before she changed her seat.

   Barbara Brous and her husband, Philip, were grocery shopping at
a supermarket recently. The market was being renovated, which meant

   ``Mister, we don't carry foreign breads,'' was the reply.

   A hot day this summer found me at Kennedy Airport's
International Arrivals Building, awaiting the arrival of loved

all pushing overloaded luggage carts.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there was a collective gasp as a dark-haired young
woman walked out alone. She stood before us dressed in an elaborate
floor-length white wedding dress and veil. The huge crowd burst
into spontaneous applause as she made her way down the walkway.
</P>
<P>
   When she got to the end, she started back. At that moment, a
young man, holding a small bouquet of flowers, came out of the
crowd. As he shyly touched her arm, she turned to him and they
embraced. We burst into applause once again, but as the couple
walked out, we were left with questions:
</P>
<P>
   Was this her intended? Was this their first meeting? Were they
going directly to the wedding ceremony? Where was her luggage?

   The scene: Fast-food restaurant with an advertised special of a
slice of pepperoni pizza and a 16-ounce soda, all for $2.75. Otto
Salamon places his order but asks for a small soda instead of the
large one. He moves down the aisle to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Cashier, punching her computer-driven register: ``That's
$4.75.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamon: ``What happened to the $2.75 special?''
</P>
<P>
   Cashier: ``That's for pizza with a large soda. What you got
there is pizza with a small soda. For that we have to charge you
extra.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamon: ``How can we get the special price then?''
</P>
<P>
   Cashier: ``We can buy a large soda instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamon returned to the counter to make the exchange. The
counter man tossed his small soda in the garbage and handed him a
16-ounce container. Salamon returned to the cashier, paid his $2.75
and remarked that the whole thing made no sense.

   Judy Lerner thinks that perhaps this note, written by her
granddaughter Jacklyn when she was 7 years old, may be a child's
version of being boiled in oil. Jacklyn had reached the end of her
patience with her little sister and dashed off a warning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Allison, I am sueing you! You are going to be punished in
a quart of law. Love, Jacklyn.''

   My wife thought it would be nice if I picked out a perfume for
her. I had never done this before, so I didn't know what to expect
when I walked into Bloomingdale's perfume department. I endured
sales pitches and smelled printed tabs of paper, which cheerful men
and women handed me after spritzing them with the corresponding
brand's scent. At one counter, I was offered a jar of coffee beans
to clean my nose's palette.
</P>
<P>
   After half an hour, during which I sampled 24 different
perfumes, I could barely discern the nuances among scents _
citrusy, flowery, earthy. I finally settled at one counter and
spent about 10 minutes among five different perfumes.
</P>
<P>
   After much thought, I made my decision. Later that day, proud of
my accomplishment, I called my wife. She began laughing when I told
her what I had selected. It was the perfume she always wore.

GOVERNMENT PARTY WINS LOCAL ELECTIONS IN TROUBLED CHIAPAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico _ The government's party has
once again gained overwhelming control over county mayors' offices
and the local legislature in the troubled state of Chiapas,
according to results announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With 90 percent of the votes counted, the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, had won 77 of 103 counties
and 17 of the 24 seats in the state Congress that were up for
election.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant change for this tumultuous state, home to the
Zapatista guerrilla group, no serious violence was reported during
the voting. Instead, apathy was the prevailing spirit, with voter
turnout well below 50 percent in many regions.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI kept its hammerlock even though it is no longer a
majority in Chiapas in terms of the number of votes cast. In the
voting for the state congress, the PRI won 280,921 votes and the
combined opposition took 282,327. But the opposition vote was split
between two parties, the left-of-center Party of the Democratic
Revolution and the conservative National Action Party.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. There are a couple of people in our department
who spend far too much time playing solitaire on their computers
every day. It's annoying, but we don't feel it is our business to
confront them, nor do we want to rush into management to complain.
How do we get them to stop? K.I.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is not easy to know what to do when there is too much game
playing in your department, whether literally or figuratively.
However, since the solitary actions of these two employees are so
upsetting, the time has come to call them on it.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is for you and some of your associates to meet
with the players and suggest that they start pulling their weight
instead of pulling cards. You can then suggest that they stop
playing unless they are on a break.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes peer pressure can be enough to indicate to these
jokers that playtime is over, particularly if they believe that you
will take further action if necessary. If they play their cards
right, the matter should end at this point.
</P>
<P>
   However, if these players cannot exit the game, you and your
associates should mention this to your manager. By doing so at this
point, you certainly are not rushing the process. After all, the
reality of the situation is that when employees are at work, they
are supposed to work. And, when they are fooling around, management
needs to spend more time wandering around.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am in the middle of a series of interviews for a new
position. I'm interested in the job, and the people seem nice. What
bothers me is my impression of the hours. The supervisor told me he
works 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily, and I believe his employees work long
hours as well. My concern is to balance my work schedule and family
schedule. Am I expected to work long hours? M.W.
</P>
<P>
   A. Just as it is the employer's duty to try to figure out if the
applicant meets the job specifications, it is the applicant's duty
to try to figure out if the job meets his or her specifications.
During the initial phase of the screening process, the employer
asks the bulk of questions, and the applicant provides the bulk of
the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the process, it is the applicant who should be asking
the questions. You may be interested in this job and highly
qualified for it, but all it takes is one critical negative
component to turn it into a bad match. Before you accept any offer,
your real job is to make sure the job is acceptable to you.
</P>
<P>
   You already have an indicator that the work hours may be a
problem, so you should ask some specific questions about them. You
may find that the hours are actually in an acceptable range, or
perhaps there is some flexibility. However, if the hours are far in
excess of what you want, and there is no leeway to deal with your
needs, you could not have found out at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our organization is undergoing major restructuring, and one
of our co-workers was asked to stay three months beyond the general
end date. Her attitude toward work is questionable and disruptive,
and other good employees with the same responsibilities are being
let go earlier. Do you have any advice for those good employees who
believe they are just pawns in this unfair game of office politics?
M.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. One clear sign of a major restructuring that has become a
major mess occurs when surviving or departing employees view
themselves as pawns. During restructuring, employees seek
communication, equity, respect and support. Anything less is a
profound wound to an organization and one that heals slowly if
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The reality for those good employees who are being restructured
out of the organization is that instead of worrying about end
dates, they should be thinking about beginning dates, namely when
and where their next jobs are going to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are questions about the seemingly preferable
treatment granted to one problem employee, that is not the problem
of the departing employees. In fact, there can be countless reasons
why this particular employee is getting a few extra months, and
they can range from being totally business-oriented to totally
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is easy to spend a great deal of time focusing on
this employee, but it makes far more sense for the departing
employees to focus on their new careers and not on hers. And this
same advice applies to the pawns who remain.

`I MARRIED A COMMUNIST': MANLY GIANT VS. ZEALOTS AND SCHEMING
WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his last novel, the Pulitzer Prize-winning ``American
Pastoral,'' Philip Roth gave us a hero _ one Seymour (Swede) Levov
of New Jersey _ whose life mirrored the historical convulsions of
the '60s, '70s and '80s, as America lurched from complacency into
confusion, from deliberate innocence into frantic disillusion. The
interplay of public tragedy and private betrayal is also the
animating force behind Roth's new novel, ``I Married a Communist,''
a novel that purports to do for the cold war period what
``Pastoral'' did for the era of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``I Married a Communist'' lacks the cohesive,
cumulative power of ``Pastoral.'' Its view of the world remains
hogtied to a narrow, personal agenda; its narrative drama is
diluted by a willfully oblique narrative that frames one story
within another and submerges one voice within another. The result:
a wildly uneven novel that feels both unfinished and overstuffed, a
novel that veers unsteadily between sincerity and slapstick,
heartfelt melancholy and cavalier manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   The discursive narrative of ``Communist'' breaks into several
overlapping plot lines. The first is a sort of elegiac prequel to
``The Ghost Writer,'' recounting the intellectual coming of age of
the young Nathan Zuckerman: his search for a spiritual father, his
eager apprenticeship at the feet of several mentors and his gradual
loss of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Roth's favorite alter ego was torn between two literary
role models in ``The Ghost Writer'' _ between the reclusive,
ascetic Lonoff and the flamboyant, self-dramatizing Abravanel _ he
finds himself torn, in this novel, between his teacher Leo
Glucksman's modernist esthetic and his friend Ira Ringold's
communist manifesto, between a commitment to art for art's sake and
a commitment to the dogma of social change.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of ``I Married a Communist,'' however, is less
concerned with Nathan than with Ringold, his childhood mentor. Like
Swede Levov in ``American Pastoral,'' Ira is meant to be a
representative man, another American innocent sucked up, spun
around and spit out by the great whirlwind of American history.
</P>
<P>
   Ira, we're repeatedly told, is a huge, larger-than-life figure _
an Abraham Lincoln look-alike, endowed with an overheated idealism,
a violent temper and a restless need to reinvent himself. Ira has
dug ditches, worked as a stevedore and spread the communist gospel,
an increasingly dangerous undertaking in 1950s America. Ira has
also become the star of a radio show called ``The Free and the
Brave'' and married the sophisticated actress Eve Frame. To the
young Nathan, Ira is a father figure who could teach him about
``the brutish American stuff'' that he has yet to encounter
himself. He had ``never before known anyone whose life was so
intimately circumscribed by so much American history,'' never known
``anyone so immersed in his moment or so defined by it. Or
tyrannized by it, so much its avenger and its victim and its
tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Roth's evocation of Nathan's filial relationship with Ira
(by turns worshipful, tender and disillusioned) is as powerful as
any of the son-father, apprentice-mentor relationships limned in
the author's fiction, Ira himself remains annoyingly opaque. Seen
only through the hazy scrim of secondhand accounts, Ira never
becomes more than a cardboard symbol, a sort of all-purpose martyr
to right-wing zealots and vindictive women.
</P>
<P>
   It is through Nathan's recollections of the long-winded
reminiscences of Ira's brother, Murray, that we learn about Ira's
ill-fated marriage to the beauteous but treacherous Eve and his
precipitous fall from grace. As Murray tells it, Eve's fame had
protected Ira from the wrath of red-baiters in the government, but
the collapse of their marriage and Eve's publication of a
best-selling tell-all book (titled ``I Married a Communist'') have
swift, fateful repercussions. Ira loses hisjob, his reputation and
his cool. All the violence in his nature, so long suppressed, comes
bubbling to the surface, and he vows to exact revenge.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Roth has always liked to work imaginative variations on his own
life, and the reader familiar with that tendency is apt to suspect
that ``I Married a Communist'' is his own revenge on his former
wife, actress Claire Bloom, who published a memoir two years ago
that depicted him in unflattering terms.
</P>
<P>
   Eve's memoir depicts Ira as ``a Machiavellian Communist, a
vicious man of enormous cunning who nearly ruined my life, my
career and the life of my beloved child''; Ms. Bloom's memoir
(``Leaving a Doll's House'') depicted Roth as ``a game-playing
Machiavellian strategist'' driven by ``a deep and irrepressible
rage'' and ``a profound distrust of the sexual power of women.'' In
this novel, Roth depicts the fictional Eve as a vengeful and
self-deluding woman in thrall to her impossible daughter from an
earlier marriage; in her memoir, Ms. Bloom depicted Roth as a
possessive and narcissistic lover who refused to live under the
same roof with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   While such matters may be of passing interest to literary gossip
mongers, they are not transformed, in this case, into plausible or
compelling fiction. There is something synthetic and contrived
about Ira and Eve's relationship _ the reader never quite
understands what Ira the roughneck Communist sees in the
social-climbing, Dior-wearing Eve or what she sees in him _ and
their respective emotional histories are rendered in only the most
generic and diagrammatic of terms. Eve, we're told, is ``all
moderation and tact'' onstage, all exaggeration and histrionics in
real life. Ira, on his part, is supposed to be an easy mark for
utopian politics and scheming women, given his ``cruel family,
frustration in school, headlong immersion in the Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Roth's 1993 novel, ``Operation Shylock,'' the characters
in this novel talk and talk and talk; they rant and rave and riff
as though, like Scheherazade's, their lives depend on their
incessantly spinning the world into words. Some of the talk is
dazzling _ acute and funny and inventive _ but even the brilliant
talk becomes wearing in the end. The reader begins to feel that
Nathan and Murray are simply talking around and about Ira, telling
us what to think of him, without allowing us a glimpse of him
firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan himself is a curiously ghostly figure in this novel.
Sometimes he sounds like Nick Carraway: ``Talking to me doesn't
seem to present an obstacle to anyone. This is perhaps a
consequence of my having gone around for years looking as if I
needed talking to.'' Sometimes he just sounds like a world-weary
hermit who has withdrawn into Lonoff-like seclusion: ``I don't want
a story any longer,'' he declares. ``I've had my story.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Murray, the reader (particularly the reader unfamiliar with
Nathan's earlier appearances in the ``Zuckerman Bound'' trilogy,
and his tumultuous encounters with celebrity and fame) is inclined
to wonder how ``this very intense boy so much looking forward to
participating in life'' ended up ``a man by himself in the woods,''
how this onetime apprentice to Ira, so in love with the idea of the
``common man,'' ended up becoming a writer devoted to scrutinizing
his own psyche.
</P>
<P>
   As for this novel, it may masquerade as a parable about America
in the 1950s and the wages of McCarthyism, but it's actually a
smaller, less ambitious work, a novel that, in the end, has less in
common with the capacious social vision of ``American Pastoral''
than with the sexual wars and mirror games of Roth's earlier and
more solipsistic fiction.

JESSE JACKSON JOINS TV SHOW PROTEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The protest against UPN sitcom ``The Secret Diary
of Desmond Pfeiffer'' gained some national clout Monday as the Rev.
Jesse Jackson joined the call to cancel the new show.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, in town to pay his respects at former Mayor Tom
Bradley's funeral, stopped at Paramount Studios early Monday to
march with and address hundreds of participants in the third
demonstration against the comedy, which debuted Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking for censorship,'' Jackson said, ``but there
must be sense in the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Many local African-American groups, led by the Brotherhood
Crusade, have complained loudly that the show makes light of human
suffering during the time of slavery in this country. ``Pfeiffer''
is about a black British nobleman who escapes to America and
becomes President Abraham Lincoln's butler and one-man kitchen
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Danny Bakewell, the leader of the Brotherhood
Crusade, said they will not be satisfied until the show is taken
off the air.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to target the show's sponsors will begin today,
Bakewell said. Jackson said he will urge that similar action be
taken around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the dollars, it's the dignity,'' Jackson said. ``It's
not the job of an actor, it's the dignity of a people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson turned down a hand-delivered message inviting the
protest leaders to meet with UPN Entertainment president Tom Nunan,
asking instead to meet directly with UPN president and chief
executive officer Dean Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the pain, you have the power, the power to insult us,
and it's unnecessary,'' Jackson said about the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's protest was the latest episode in two weeks of conflict
swirling around the fledgling show. Last week, the Los Angeles City
Council unanimously condemned the program and said the show's debut
should be postponed until a community screening can be arranged and
the Human Relations Committee has time to prepare a report on
whether it is fit for broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood creative community has backed UPN and lashed out
at the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that there was an Iron Curtain around the city
of Los Angeles,'' said Emmy Award-winning producer Dick Wolf (``Law
&AMP; Order''). ``This is a quick fix of ink in a local market that I
can't believe will have any impact beyond the Los Angeles City
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN president Valentine was incensed that the council would pass
such a motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a terrible precedent to set,'' Valentine said.
``I think he (Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who sponsored the
motion) has no business in my business. It's a world where everyone
is looking for 15 minutes of media attention and it's very easy to
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine called the council's vote ``a sneak attack on the
First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said the council's vote is laughable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presumption of politicians to think they have any right to
say what goes out on broadcast networks is beyond ludicrous,'' Wolf
said. ``It's beyond any level of hubris and self-important
egocentricity and temerity to think they have the right to do
something like this. What planet are they living on? Not the planet
the United States is on.''

<P>
   Late Sunday into early Monday, a series of thunderstorms dropped
more than five inches of rain on Kansas City, causing widespread
flooding throughout the city. The heavy storms were ignited as an
approaching cold front intercepted a steady flow of moist air
streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the threat for heavy rain will shift to the
Mississippi and lower Ohio River Valleys as the front presses
slowly eastward. Scattered strong thunderstorms erupting within the
area of rain may produce a few tornadoes, as a jet stream
disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the front, gusty breezes from the northwest will direct
cooler and drier air into the southwest Plains. Farther north,
lingering moisture in the lower levels of the atmosphere will
produce clouds and chilly showers over the northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny skies will cover the Northeast as strong high pressure
over Ontario, Canada, settles south across the region. After a cold
morning with patchy frost, temperatures will rebound into the 50s
and middle 60s by afternoon. These conditions will make for prime
leaf viewing weather as interior New England approaches peak color.
Farther southwest, air moistening upon ascent of the central and
southern Appalachians will cause clouds to persist from the western
Carolinas to central Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, mainly sunny and dry conditions will cover the
Rockies and Pacific Coast as an expansive area of high pressure
covers the interior West. Offshore breezes will cause unusually
warm air to reach the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Fogs of October
</P>
<P>
   October can be a foggy month in the Northeast. The stage is set
by a bevy of slow high pressure systems that foster clear skies and
light winds during the lengthening darkness of October nights.
These conditions favor maximum cooling of the ground. Nocturnal
chill is enhanced in deep valleys, where heavy, cold air drains
gently down mountains. Once a layer of still air in contact with
the chilling ground is cooled sufficiently, invisible water vapor
condenses into trillions of tiny water droplets, forming fog. The
tranquil fogs of October fade once the stirring winds of November
arrive. &QL;

AS LATIN AMERICAN ART PRICES RISE, SO DO FORGERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ramon Cernuda, a Miami-based publisher and passionate collector
of modern Cuban painting, recalls his first encounter with the
shadowy world of art forgery. But there was nothing murky about the
setting: it was the mid-80s, in an elegant Miami home whose owner
was a private dealer from one of Cuba's most patrician expatriate
families. Therefore, he had no reason to doubt that the painting by
Wilfredo Lam (1902-82) being offered to him for $200,000 was
anything but an original by the acclaimed Cuban artist.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he was negotiating the purchase, he sent a
photograph of the work to the artist's widow, Lou Lam, to have it
authenticated. The work turned out to be a copy, and Cernuda
learned that the dealer had tried to force Mrs. Lam into accepting
money in exchange for her endorsement. He was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, however, Cernuda's anger continued to mount as
he saw fake paintings inundate the Latin American market. Despite
the traditional secrecy with which most collectors like to shield
themselves, Cernuda decided to speak out, and he has become one of
the leading crusaders against forgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s, the fake market was restricted to the occasional
imitation of works by Lam, but now there is a veritable epidemic of
fake paintings by Cuban masters from the '20s through the '60s,''
Cernuda said. ``Unfortunately, extortion and bribery are very much
a part of this universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many collectors, dealers and museum curators agree that
the recent boom in prices for Latin works has created a parallel
fake market, particularly for modern Cuban masters. Mary-Anne
Martin, a Manhattan dealer who founded Sotheby's Latin American
department in 1977 and was its head until 1982, said that a growing
demand from affluent Cuban-American families in Florida for modern
Cuban paintings was accounting for their dramatic rise in value.
``As soon as art starts to get valuable, the fake market begins,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just Cuban art. Martin said she had detected a
number of forgeries of Mexican works. There is some Mexican art so
obviously fake that she is identifying the different hands of
specific forgers, she said. ``I am offered at least one false Frida
Kahlo a month, and I have more copies of Diego Rivera in my files
than real ones,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The forgers are apparently getting bolder: even the sloppiest
imitations find their way at times into auction houses in Spain and
the United States, and across Latin America. Last November, for
example, Christie's opened an evening sale of Latin American art in
New York by announcing the withdrawal of six lots, all by Cuban
modern masters, because there were doubts about their authenticity.
The questioned works involved two paintings by Mario Carreno, two
by Rene Portocarrero and two by Esteban Chartrand.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the forged works was dated four years after the
artist's death,'' Cernuda lamented. ``Another carried a false
authentification certificate.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had previously been embarrassed, in 1993, by having
to print a new catalog after its cover turned out to be a picture
of a copy of a painting by the Colombian artist Fernando Botero,
rather than the original. Botero insisted on having the copy
destroyed, and a videotape was made of the artist and Martin taking
a knife to it at a lawyer's office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many Boteros are said to be copied in Asia. Martin said a friend
traveling through Saigon had come across a workshop where skilled
craftsmen were reproducing Boteros from photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to investigate as thoroughly as possible,'' said
Fernando Gutierrez, director of the Latin American department at
Christie's. ``But sometimes we receive information after the works
are published in the catalog. This is regrettable but can happen at
any auction house.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Christie's and Sotheby's withdrew works by Antonio Berni,
an Argentine artist, from their November 1996 catalogs when they
proved to be false. Since Berni works are reaching the $1 million
figure, Ruth Benzacar, the Buenos Aires dealer who handles his
estate, has just established an authentification committee.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts point to Cuba as the origin of many of the
forgeries detected in the market. El Pais, the Spanish daily,
recently reported that the Guardia Civil had broken up a ring of
con men last December who were smuggling forged paintings into
Spain from Cuba. Four are under arrest. Among the 22 paintings
uncovered by the police were works, deemed fake by experts, that
were supposedly by Picasso and Miro and Cuban masters like Pelaez,
Victor Manuel, Carreno and Mariano Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Works sold with the authorization of Cuba's National Museum of
Fine Arts carry an authentification certificate, and our customs
officers are very strict,'' said Lilian Llanes, director of the
Wilfredo Lam House of Havana and president of the Havana Biennial.
``The problem is that international interest in treasures of Cuban
art has generated a huge unofficial market of false works that may
find their way abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some experts conclude that a lack of in-depth knowledge
of Latin American art is a major factor . ``The Latin market has
become too huge, and expertise is fragmented. There just aren't
experts who cover the entire art spectrum,'' said Mario Gilardoni,
a leading Buenos Aires art market consultant.

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What would you do if you had four months to
live?
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've met several people facing that plight, and
they've asked me to share my best fishing spot, the most beautiful
hidden waterfall, the most pristine meadow, the prettiest drive,
the most secluded, untouched beach. A few explained that they
wanted to venture to a place very special, a place where they could
best take in the natural powers of the Earth, and try to come to
terms with their predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   I never figured I'd be doing the same thing myself any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   But I was.
</P>
<P>
   I went down to this little brook next to a meadow, the place
where I remember feeling the happiest in my entire life, a place
I'd discovered with my sweetheart, and just sat there, watched the
water go by, and wondered, ``How did I ever get in this
situation?''
</P>
<P>
   Four months to live. That was the worst-case scenario.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, on a trip to the Sierra foothills, I woke up one
morning with this deep soreness under my ear, on the side of my
neck. On instinct, while still mostly asleep, I touched it, and to
my surprise, there was significant swelling. Now I was fully awake.
The swelling stretched from just below the right ear, under the
cleft of the jaw, nearly to my throat.
</P>
<P>
   I know what this is, I thought, a swollen lymph node.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, I went swimming to cool off, and my right ear
seemed to plug up. For days, it wouldn't clear. And the swelling
kept getting bigger. The doctor said, yes, I had an ear infection
all right, and as for the lymph node, ``We'll put you on
antibiotics for an infection.''
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks later, after continuous doses of different
antibiotics, the node was bigger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it felt like a railroad spike was hammered through my
neck. At one campsite on a warm night, I woke up at midnight,
covered in sweat, freezing cold. The next day, hiking across a
meadow to the foot of a mountain with my sweetheart fiance,
Stephani Cruickshank, and kids, Jeremy and Kris, scouting out a
deer trail, my legs, back and arms became so sore that I had to sit
down on a log for 20 minutes. Then on a fishing trip in my canoe
with my brother, Rambob, I suddenly became so exhausted that I
almost went to sleep while paddling.
</P>
<P>
   My doctor squared his shoulders to mine and explained that the
antibiotics should have worked, but they didn't, so I might be
dealing with lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, maybe leukemia, and with
luck, maybe a lymph gland out of control. All the symptoms, he
noted, were present, and now more doctors would be brought in.
</P>
<P>
   The lymph system is your body's immune system, the doctor
explained, with a network of nodes throughout your body that makes
every person capable of fighting infections and purging toxins.
When it goes haywire or is corrupted by cancer, such as with
lymphoma, it can spread quickly and render you defenseless. So
doctors started an extensive series of blood tests, X-rays,
biopsies, and scheduled surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At this point I flew my little airplane around California for a
day, across hundreds of miles, first all around the San Francisco
Bay area, then far beyond as well, scanning the land and
reminiscing over the experiences I have had with the people I care
for, and the lakes, rivers, forests, wetlands, deserts, bays and
coast that I love so much.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, I landed in Dunsmuir to fill up with gas before
heading south along the Cascades and Sierra, and looked for my old
friend, Carl Hutchins, the airport manager. Instead I was told he
``was gone,'' that ``lymphoma got him,'' diagnosed in early summer,
gone by September. Four months.
</P>
<P>
   That night, I found another small lump, this one in my groin,
the location of another lymph node, and felt fear extend through
every cell in my body. Then I felt the lump on my neck. God, it was
huge now. On Monday, the doctors said the node was 20 times its
normal size, and by Thursday, the morning of surgery, it was 25
times its normal size.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in my canoe with my brother on a hidden lake, I
showed him where I wanted my ashes scattered. On a walk across an
untouched meadow, I finally admitted to my fiance that I was
scared. Then alone, sitting on a log near that little brook,
watching the water go by, I thought about how it didn't seem fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I'm only 44 years old. Always in perfect health, and as a
pilot, checked by a doctor every year. Climbed all the highest
mountains, hiked 20,000 miles. Don't smoke, hardly drink at all,
never did drugs, don't even drink coffee, and yet here I was,
watching that water go by. I couldn't understand how it could be
that 22 years after meeting Stephani in college I had found her
again, become engaged, had bonded with her two boys, Jeremy, 10,
and Kris, 7, and how ecstatic I was about both future adventures
and facing new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   And now this?
</P>
<P>
   I started remembering each of the people I've talked with who
had terminal illnesses, how they asked me about the most beautiful
places and how they wished they had spent more time in the
outdoors, especially exploring.
</P>
<P>
   As they wheeled me into the operating room, the air filled with
the scent of antiseptics, I realized that the most special places
are always brought to life by sharing them with the people you love
and care for, and I'd rather just sit by that little brook with
Stephani, Jeremy and Kris than head off around the world and catch
a world-record fish or climb a mountain by myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``So where is this thing?'' asked a surgeon's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here, under the right ear,'' answered the surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yikes! The thing is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all I remember. Then I blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing I remember was waking up in the recovery room,
almost incoherent, and there Stephani was, holding my arm and hand
and then whispering to me, ``You're OK, you don't have cancer, I
talked to the doctor and he said you're going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons went in on my neck, starting with an incision below the
ear and extending down toward the vocal cords, and they found
evidence of two infections, an old one with dead tissue that
apparently had blocked the node and a new one that was an offspring
from the summer ear infection. With the block in place, the node
could not purge or cleanse itself, and thus it started swelling.
From the lab, the biopsy was clean: no cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lump in my groin turned out to be a very small
hernia, not a lymph infection, and stands to barely slow me down.
</P>
<P>
   This past month has been very difficult, and I realize that the
cost of living is dying, and some day we're all going to have to
pay up. But I also realize that by knowing so, there can be magic
in every breath, especially by sharing special places with the
people you care for most.
</P>
<P>
   The great outdoors is truly grand. But love, my friends, is all
that matters in the end.

PRODI, THREATENED BY BAROQUE POLITICS, MAY ALSO BE RESCUED BY IT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Italian politics have long been enlivened by baroque
feuds and shifting alliances. And that time-honored tradition may
have won the embattled government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi a
momentary reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of Italy's hard-line Marxist faction, known as the
Communist Refounding Party, resigned Monday in protest over his
party's decision to reject the government's 1999 budget and imperil
Prodi's slender majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prodi must realize that his majority no longer exists,'' said
Armando Cossuta, chairman of the Communist Refounding Party, a
fringe group that broke with mainstream Communists after they
overhauled the party following the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991. ``Nevertheless we should do everything possible, until the
last minute, to save this government and avoid this crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Cossuta was clearly unwilling to join the most hard-line wing of
his party in withdrawing support from Prodi and risk being branded
as having torpedoed the first leftist Italian government in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the leader of the Communist Refounding Party in Parliament,
Fausto Bertinotti, seems to have no such compunctions. On Friday,
he told journalists that he was not worried about forcing new
elections that could return the right to power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have to take one step back in order to take two
steps forward,'' he said with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, however, the communist rank and file have disagreed
with that view. When Bertinotti forced Prodi to offer his
resignation last year over proposed budget cuts, the rank and file
protested, and he was forced to backpedal.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi met Monday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and
coalition leaders to devise a strategy. He is expected to go to
Parliament on Wednesday to open debate on the crisis and seek
enough votes for the budget. Without it, the Italian central bank
is unlikely to cut its key lending rates, something Italy must do
to get in line with Germany and other bigger European neighbors
before the introduction Jan. 1 of the single European currency, the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he gathers enough votes to pass the budget, Prodi
could still be left without a majority. After two and a half years
in office, his government is the second-longest in the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   But the fragile center-left coalition has held together mostly
because Italians were united for the last two years in an effort to
reduce spending, inflation and government borrowing to meet the
requirements for membership in the euro plan. Once that goal was
achieved last spring, dissension quickly revived.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi's backers are hoping that enough members of the Communist
Refounding Party will break ranks and follow Cossutta to save the
coalition. If not, Prodi is faced with two unappetizing choices. He
can resign and seek new elections, which carry the risk of bringing
the opposition to power. Or he could seek to form a new majority
without the Communists by seeking an alliance with the small
center-right party of Francesco Cossiga.
</P>
<P>
   Cossiga's party came to Prodi's rescue in June, when the
hard-line leftists refused to back Prodi on NATO expansion. But
Prodi has repeatedly said he will govern only with the center-left
majority that elected him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Cossiga also suggested to reporters Monday that he would not
welcome any invitations to join a coalition led by Prodi. ``We
wouldn't want this majority to get stained like Monica Lewinsky's
dress,'' he said.

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What would you do if you had four months to
live?
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've met several people facing that plight, and
they've asked me to share my best fishing spot, the most beautiful
hidden waterfall, the most pristine meadow, the prettiest drive,
the most secluded, untouched beach. A few explained that they
wanted to venture to a place very special, a place where they could
best take in the natural powers of the Earth, and try to come to
terms with their predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   I never figured I'd be doing the same thing myself any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   But I was.
</P>
<P>
   I went down to this little brook next to a meadow, the place
where I remember feeling the happiest in my entire life, a place
I'd discovered with my sweetheart, and just sat there, watched the
water go by, and wondered, ``How did I ever get in this
situation?''
</P>
<P>
   Four months to live. That was the worst-case scenario.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, on a trip to the Sierra foothills, I woke up one
morning with this deep soreness under my ear, on the side of my
neck. On instinct, while still mostly asleep, I touched it, and to
my surprise, there was significant swelling. Now I was fully awake.
The swelling stretched from just below the right ear, under the
cleft of the jaw, nearly to my throat.
</P>
<P>
   I know what this is, I thought, a swollen lymph node.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, I went swimming to cool off, and my right ear
seemed to plug up. For days, it wouldn't clear. And the swelling
kept getting bigger. The doctor said, yes, I had an ear infection
all right, and as for the lymph node, ``We'll put you on
antibiotics for an infection.''
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks later, after continuous doses of different
antibiotics, the node was bigger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   At times, it felt like a railroad spike was hammered through my
neck. At one campsite on a warm night, I woke up at midnight,
covered in sweat, freezing cold. The next day, hiking across a
meadow to the foot of a mountain with my sweetheart fiance,
Stephani Cruickshank, and kids, Jeremy and Kris, scouting out a
deer trail, my legs, back and arms became so sore that I had to sit
down on a log for 20 minutes. Then on a fishing trip in my canoe
with my brother, Rambob, I suddenly became so exhausted that I
almost went to sleep while paddling.
</P>
<P>
   My doctor squared his shoulders to mine and explained that the
antibiotics should have worked, but they didn't, so I might be
dealing with lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, maybe leukemia, and with
luck, maybe a lymph gland out of control. All the symptoms, he
noted, were present, and now more doctors would be brought in.
</P>
<P>
   The lymph system is your body's immune system, the doctor
explained, with a network of nodes throughout your body that makes
every person capable of fighting infections and purging toxins.
When it goes haywire or is corrupted by cancer, such as with
lymphoma, it can spread quickly and render you defenseless. So
doctors started an extensive series of blood tests, X-rays,
biopsies, and scheduled surgery.
</P>
<P>
   At this point I flew my little airplane around California for a
day, across hundreds of miles, first all around the San Francisco
Bay area, then far beyond as well, scanning the land and
reminiscing over the experiences I have had with the people I care
for, and the lakes, rivers, forests, wetlands, deserts, bays and
coast that I love so much.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, I landed in Dunsmuir to fill up with gas before
heading south along the Cascades and Sierra, and looked for my old
friend, Carl Hutchins, the airport manager. Instead I was told he
``was gone,'' that ``lymphoma got him,'' diagnosed in early summer,
gone by September. Four months.
</P>
<P>
   That night, I found another small lump, this one in my groin,
the location of another lymph node, and felt fear extend through
every cell in my body. Then I felt the lump on my neck. God, it was
huge now. On Monday, the doctors said the node was 20 times its
normal size, and by Thursday, the morning of surgery, it was 25
times its normal size.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in my canoe with my brother on a hidden lake, I
showed him where I wanted my ashes scattered. On a walk across an
untouched meadow, I finally admitted to my fiance that I was
scared. Then alone, sitting on a log near that little brook,
watching the water go by, I thought about how it didn't seem fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I'm only 44 years old. Always in perfect health, and as a
pilot, checked by a doctor every year. Climbed all the highest
mountains, hiked 20,000 miles. Don't smoke, hardly drink at all,
never did drugs, don't even drink coffee, and yet here I was,
watching that water go by. I couldn't understand how it could be
that 22 years after meeting Stephani in college I had found her
again, become engaged, had bonded with her two boys, Jeremy, 10,
and Kris, 7, and how ecstatic I was about both future adventures
and facing new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   And now this?
</P>
<P>
   I started remembering each of the people I've talked with who
had terminal illnesses, how they asked me about the most beautiful
places and how they wished they had spent more time in the
outdoors, especially exploring.
</P>
<P>
   As they wheeled me into the operating room, the air filled with
the scent of antiseptics, I realized that the most special places
are always brought to life by sharing them with the people you love
and care for, and I'd rather just sit by that little brook with
Stephani, Jeremy and Kris than head off around the world and catch
a world-record fish or climb a mountain by myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``So where is this thing?'' asked a surgeon's assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over here, under the right ear,'' answered the surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yikes! The thing is huge.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all I remember. Then I blacked out.

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Charles Ives' ``Emerson'' Concerto is less buried
treasure than Poe's purloined letter. Rediscovered pieces may
indeed emerge intact from the back of a composer's sock drawer, but
others have been there all along, lying inscrutable among a welter
of sketches and notes.
</P>
<P>
   This 20-minute piece for piano and orchestra had its first
performances over the weekend at Severance Hall thanks to a
musicologist named David G. Porter, who has assembled Ives' many
shreds of evidence and parsed his hieroglyphics into an apparently
coherent form. Unfinished pieces do not necessarily suffer from
incompleteness.
</P>
<P>
   In Ives' case, he has left too much for our own good: years of
altered decisions, additions and subtractions that have forced
Porter to do a lot of deciding on his own.
</P>
<P>
   We know the concerto indirectly as the source for the
``Emerson'' movement of the ``Concord'' Sonata,'' a solo piano work
finished in 1912. Thereafter, Ives labored over the various ideas
in various forms for almost 40 years; and as Porter pointed out in
his program notes for Saturday night's Cleveland Orchestra program,
completion may not have been particularly on his mind. Like a
gardener whose flower beds are never finished, Ives worked on some
pieces just to watch them grow and change.
</P>
<P>
   I fear the saga of discovery may be more interesting than the
music itself. Yet there are some, I am sure, who will find more
importance in this blunt and graceless piece than I.
</P>
<P>
   If the baritonal militance of Ives' orchestra is intentional _
if he truly meant tuba, trombones and deep strings to obliterate
every other instrument around them _ then his instrumental writing
succeeds. The piano part has much the same effect. Valiantly
portrayed here by Alan Feinberg, it offers brute-force virtuosity
and clotted textures with halting lyrical contrasts. I leave it to
New Englanders steeped in harsh speaking, gritty personal values
and hard winters to find the beauties here. I cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Ives' trademarks are everywhere: in the separations of orchestra
into independently moving parts and especially in the familiar
materials straining through semi-chaos to be recognized and
acknowledged. Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is the most persistent
knocker on the door; indeed, Fate-in-four-notes appears in every
conceivable rhythmic variant and transposition.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in contrast to the ``Emerson'' Concerto on Saturday was
``Central Park in the Dark.'' Shorter and more elegantly conceived,
it puts Ives' extraordinary gifts in the highest profile. Quiet
string chords float on a tidal ebb and flow, and against them play
the snippets of night life and popular song that Ives evokes by
means of solo winds, brass, percussion and piano. It is a work not
only of great sophistication but also of impudent originality. It
was handled scrupulously in this performance.
</P>
<P>
   One came to Cleveland to hear Ives but came away deeply
impressed by other matters. After intermission, Christoph von
Dohnanyi and his orchestra played the Beethoven ``Eroica''
Symphony, a piece so familiar that one braced for yet another
performance of it. How wrong to do so. Beautifully planned, with
each phrase and dynamic conscious of every other phrase, it was
played by the Cleveland with that strange combination of force and
fastidiousness that only a few important orchestras possess.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians had already played the ``Eroica'' on Thursday and
Friday evenings and were scheduled for yet a fourth run-through the
following afternoon. Yet rarely does one hear informed intensity
like this. It was a musical power that extended to each back-bench
string player and then reached out to touch everyone seated in this
agreeably shabby and soon to be restored hall.
</P>
<P>
   There is a moral force to such playing that we in New York
seldom experience, and it was felt on both sides of the footlights.
Maybe New Yorkers have too much going for their own good, and maybe
Cleveland, with somewhat fewer outlets, better channels its
spiritual energies _ in this case through a magnificent orchestra,
splendidly led. I hope the citizens of Cleveland recognize how
lucky they are.

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE FAILS TO RISE ABOVE PARTISAN BICKERING
OVER IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They invoked the wisdom of Constitutional framers
Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, spoke reverently of Peter
Rodino, the man who chaired the Watergate hearings, and sprinkled
in references to the Civil War and civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the House Judiciary Committee clearly hoped to
take their place in history Monday as they convened to authorize an
impeachment inquiry into charges against William Jefferson Clinton,
only the third president to face the prospect of removal by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the gravity of the business and the constant
references to high-minded principles, the committee failed to rise
above the partisan bickering that has sullied the ideologically
fractured panel in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The 37 lawmakers split predictably along party lines as they
delivered perfunctory five minute speeches at the outset of the
hearing, held in a cavernous chamber in the Rayburn House Office
Building across the street from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to proceed with the GOP-crafted inquiry was not in
doubt as the 20 Republicans, who sat to the right of Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., had the numbers to roll over the 16 Democrats, who
sat to the chairman's left.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the public who wandered over to catch the
proceedings on this gloomy drizzly day left as cynical as they had
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old baloney. The Democrats say one thing. The
Republicans say another. It doesn't impress me,'' said Maxine
Schneider, a visitor from suburban Chicago who watched the opening
statements on television screens in a sparsely filled room reserved
for overflow crowds.
</P>
<P>
   While Schneider said she believed Clinton should face some sort
of penalty for his actions, both she and her husband, Marvin, who
are Republicans, said they opposed impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the committee room, lawmakers insisted that they
would not be swayed by public opinion, claiming they had a higher
duty to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, said one Republican lawmaker, Howard Cobble of North
Carolina, opinion was too divided in his district. He related how
one person recently called to warn him not to return home if he
didn't vote for impeachment while another threatened she would
never vote for him again if he did not end the proceedings. He
noted that a third constituent voiced the hope that the congressman
would just die of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers conducted their debate under the stately portraits
of Hyde and Rodino, a reminder of the link between Watergate and
the present.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Rodino's Judiciary Committee that voted to impeach
Nixon almost a quarter of a century ago, the current panel includes
few moderates who could steer the committee toward compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the members are more representative of the most active
and ideological wings of the respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one woman, the Republicans are white Christian males
from suburban and rural districts. The Democrats hail largely from
urban districts and include six blacks, six Jews, three women and
an openly gay male.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong hearings drew the attention of the national media,
with the cable news networks broadcasting the proceedings live. And
when the committee took a lunch break lawmakers flocked to the
cameras to make sure their messages were repeated back home on the
evening news.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, however, most journalists had vacated their seats in
the hearing room as lawmakers droned on about the pros and cons of
Republican resolution and Democratic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   While there was not an overwhelming crush of visitors vying for
seats at the hearings, some of those waiting to enter said they
hoped to witness history.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Seymour, 19, a student at the University of Pennsylvania,
showed up with two classmates as part of a political science
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our Watergate since we weren't alive during
Watergate,'' said Seymour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a political junkie,'' said Harold Landreneau, a 29-year
old visitor from Houston who dropped by the hearing after a stop at
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Landreneau said he did not believe the committee should impeach
the president, arguing that what Clinton did does not rise to the
level of high crimes and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Paul and Kathy Schwabe, of San Jose, Calif., also stood in line
to get into the hearing even though both said they were tired of
the media coverage of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why they were there, Paul Schwabe sarcastically remarked
that he wanted to ``see the government waste some more money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schwabe acknowledged the scandal had its allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are tired of it, yet we're standing in line,'' he
said. ``Kind of hypocritical.'' &QL;

<P>
   Petah Coyne, a small woman clad in an oversize T-shirt, stood in
the center of Galerie Lelong on West 57th Street one recent day and
started to explain her latest artistic odyssey. ``Two years ago, I
had the hair and the animals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she was installing 15 intricate sculptures that look
different from anything she has done in the past. In some works,
horsehair is woven and tied like Irish lace and nestled with
antique stuffed birds, beetles and foxes. In others, statues of the
Madonna are shrouded in rivers of horsehair braids.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which opened on Sept. 11 and runs through Oct. 16, is
called ``Fairy Tales,'' and Ms. Coyne's layered tableaux are meant
to be dreamy and mystical, evoking spirituality and afterlife. A
wall hanging that yokes two birds in flight, for example, is about
her older brother, who died a few years ago. ``We're going in
different directions, but we're still connected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It all seems so coherent now. But as Ms. Coyne talks about the
creative process, which is, after all, a much-studied but still
elusive subject, it is clear that while she was going through it,
it remained a mystery even to her. None of her work is really
planned, though Ms. Coyne tries to peer into her own mind by
changing materials every few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having the rug pulled out from under me,'' she said.
``It makes me focus on what I'm trying to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coyne, who is 45 and married, is the daughter of a military
father whose family moved many times before settling in Dayton,
Ohio. Her mother, a writer, strove to give her children experiences
as well as education. Ms. Coyne was not permitted to watch
television, for example, but was taken to live both among the Amish
and in the south of France for summers.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the artist, Ms. Coyne was home-schooled as a teen-ager so
she would have more time for art. Today she acknowledges the
influence of artists like Eva Hesse and Louise Bourgeois, and feels
apart from the prevailing contemporary art movements that deal with
political themes, the body and disease.
</P>
<P>
   For her current exhibition, Ms. Coyne simply began working.
There was no moment of inspiration. She arrived at these sculptures
intuitively, by trial and error, in a two-year labor-intensive
process that eventually involved 30 helpers, mostly unpaid interns.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, she tells how she was influenced subconsciously by
a 17th-century tale she learned on a fellowship in Japan, by her
upbringing as a Catholic and by a visit to Guanajuato, Mexico,
where she saw how the hair on the ``macabre mummies'' there grew
after death.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, she has worked with sticks, mud, black sand, dead
fish and car parts. Last time around, she decided to work with wax,
assembling dense chandelierlike sculptures adorned with satin
ribbons, artificial flowers and stuffed birds, after a friend sent
her a box of candles.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the hair also came from a friend, the artist Ann
Hamilton, who had used horsehair to make a huge, undulating carpet
as part of her show at the Dia Center for the Arts in 1993-94. When
she dismantled the installation, Ms. Hamilton offered the horsehair
to Ms. Coyne.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coyne also took on another challenge. Her works have always
hung from the ceiling. ``Never before have I been on the floor or
the wall, and I wanted to see if I could,'' she said, speaking of
the shift in perspective. ``It requires a different way of
thinking, like a sculptor going to painting. It was the tougher
challenge, more than changing media. It throws you so off you don't
even know if you're an artist any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Grappling with both changes, Ms. Coyne twice postponed her show
at Galerie Lelong, taking apart what she had done and beginning
again. ``You don't know that it's not working until you're finished
with something,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   This time in particular, she added, ``I feel vulnerable because
the pieces are so new.'' Usually, Ms. Coyne completes her works in
a new medium in perhaps a year, then keeps the sculptures in her
Brooklyn studio for another year, sometimes tinkering a little
further. ``I'd feel like I'd lived with them for a while'' before
sending them out into the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coyne has exhibited widely and won many awards and
fellowships. She was featured on the cover of Art News magazine two
years ago. She has works in the permanent collections of the Museum
of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta and the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington, among other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her work appeals to the adventurous collector,'' said Jack
Shainman, the dealer she left a few years ago for what both
describe as business and personal reasons. ``I always did well with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   But she dared not ask for more time from Galerie Lelong. The
dealer is a new one for Ms. Coyne, who does make her living as an
artist (her works fetch $9,500 to $35,000).
</P>
<P>
   When she signed on with Lelong in a flowers-and-champagne
celebration last fall, she had promised to be ready for a show by
March. At the time, Mary Sabbatino, Lelong's director, was
acquainted with Ms. Coyne's previous work. She was aware of the new
ingredients _ the hair, the Madonnas and the birds. But that's
about all she knew. ``It's an act of faith,'' Ms. Sabbatino said,
describing the relationship between gallery and artist. ``You
believe they'll deliver a great new body of work, but I had no idea
what she was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ms. Coyne was not sure either. ``Somewhere inside,
I knew where I was going,'' she said. But unlike many artists, she
works ``organically,'' without drawings or jottings on paper.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her first task was separating Ms. Hamilton's salt-and-pepper
rug, which used horsehair from China, into black and gray strands
and washing them. She also did research. Ms. Coyne had seen
Victorian jewelry woven and braided from human hair in an
exhibition, and she called on a researcher at the New York Public
Library to find her an illustrated book about it.
</P>
<P>
   After studying these 100-year-old patterns, Ms. Coyne set out to
make them more contemporary. ``For three months, I worked alone,
from 7 to 7 in my studio, five or six days a week,'' she said. ``I
just started messing with the materials, like a cook. In the
beginning, you're doing battle with the material _ you have to let
it be what it is. I began with making simple jewelry, but it looked
so contrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coyne says she felt pressure: ``You're thinking, can I rise
above this? Can I make something out of something I know nothing of
that says something?''
</P>
<P>
   And what is she saying?
</P>
<P>
   ``That comes,'' she said. ``I know the issues I'm dealing
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics and curators have noted that Ms. Coyne's work speaks
about contradictions and conflicts, between, for example, beauty
and decadence or purity and sexiness, as well as about life's
cycles. Rebirth is another recurring theme, an obvious one in her
new sculptures. Most of her animals were stuffed by 19th-century
taxidermists; she bought them from museums whose dioramas had been
replaced by high-technology displays. ``This is the residue of
life, discarded things, and I'm trying to give them a second
life,'' she said. ``That means, I guess, that I believe in heaven
and hell.''
</P>
<P>
   She added a moment later: ``Did you know that in medieval
Catholicism, birds take the souls to heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   The Madonnas have a different genesis. In the 17th century, when
the poor people of Kyoto were building a Buddhist temple, the women
were asked to cut off their hair, which was braided into ropes used
to haul trees from the forest. Seeing the braids on display in
Japan, Ms. Coyne was moved, saddened by the women's loss for their
faith.
</P>
<P>
   As these thoughts ran through her mind, Ms. Coyne and her
assistants worked on all the sculptures at once, not one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Late last winter, feeling stuck, she invited an artist friend
over to look at what she had accomplished and review it _ something
she had not done since her early 30s, when she was a member of an
informal group of artists who criticized each other's work.
``Usually, you don't want feedback,'' she said, ``but I was really
having a difficult time with this.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right to worry. Her friend gave her a thumbs down, and
she postponed the exhibition until April-May and began making
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, she invited a second artist friend to view her
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, she said, ``They laid into me. I felt a failure. One
friend said to me, `It's the worst you've ever done.''' They said
it was too pretty, too decorative, too obvious. The next day,
everything was in shreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second time, I was brutal, because I was ready to trash
the whole thing,'' she explained. Mentally, she felt she had made a
leap, and in June, Ms. Coyne finally began to feel good about the
direction of her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said for sure I'd be ready in September, so that's when I
got interns,'' she said. Eight of them at a time came, mostly from
art schools. ``It was like a sewing circle,'' Ms. Coyne said. ``I
wouldn't let them talk. We listened to books on tape. Because this
is `Fairy Tales,' a lot of the books on tape were fairy tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``My payback to them was to have visiting artists come at
lunchtime that they could talk to. They were so great. It was so
hot, and they wove eight hours a day, four days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, when Ms. Coyne was plowing ahead with determination,
she was fragile. ``I asked them not to comment on my work,'' she
continued. ``I'd get very insecure. You're so vulnerable in your
studio unless you're braced for it and ask for an opinion. It may
change what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the race to finish, Ms. Coyne was working 90 to 100 hours a
week in the studio. ``It would have taken me alone 15 years,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coyne said she could not possibly have children: ``There's
too much labor in the studio.'' For years she has called her
sculptures ``my girls.'' ``Each one has such a personality,'' she
said. ``I like to fuss over them. They're like invalids; they can't
live without me.''
</P>
<P>
   As she installed the works at Lelong, she said that except for
her assistants and her husband, ``No one has seen them, not even my
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never think about how people will react,'' she said. ``That
would be too horrifying. I'd love to just put it up and disappear,
go to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, on the night of her opening, Ms. Coyne was
dressed in a long black dress and black lace shawl, a bouquet of
irises and lilies in her hands, greeting her friends and friends of
the gallery. She smiled constantly, not showing the conflict she
feels about yielding the results of her labors. ``I always feel so
sad'' when the works are sold, she said. ``I'm afraid, horrified,
to go back to the studio. It will be so empty.''
</P>
<P>
   But within days, Ms. Coyne seemed ready to move on to something
new. In between the hours she spent on jury duty, she was out
photographing the city's architecture, particularly 18th-century
buildings, reading William Faulkner, thinking about the way people
whisper and contemplating the possibilities of working with cement.
Where this will lead she is not sure. About half of Ms. Hamilton's
gift of hair remains, and she might use that. But, she cautioned,
``I won't be weaving it, like this.''

 &HT;    Sag in stock market suggests a time for defensive tactics
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Level with me. How bad is it?
</P>
<P>
   That could easily be the average investor's plea for guidance
after 2 1/2 months of volatile stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   And the answer is: Bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   We won't know how bad until it's over, but this is certainly
Wall Street's worst battering since the bear market in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has given back most of its gains for the year.
The U.S. economy is slowing, and parts of the world are in danger
of financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   This is a new environment for the estimated 67 million
individuals in the United States who own stocks and mutual funds.
While there's widespread agreement the long-term picture still
looks good, investment advisers say this is an important moment in
market history, when individuals need to keep their cool.
</P>
<P>
   This would seem to be the right time for the defensive maneuvers
that have been drummed into our heads over the years: Have a plan,
diversify, invest long-term and don't panic.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who act on fear and sell in a down market are turning
paper losses into real ones, said Jack Calhoun Jr., vice president
of Capital Directions, an Atlanta-based investment adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are also creating a dilemma for themselves because they
must decide when to get back into the market,'' said Calhoun. ``And
because the stock market often makes its upward moves quickly, it's
very likely that the market may recover most of its losses before
the investor moves back into stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hans Stoll, director of the Financial Markets Research Center at
Vanderbilt University, suggests investors think in terms of ``two
pots of money: a long-run pot for retirement, which you don't
touch, and a pot to play with, when there are buying opportunities
in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The best course is not to tamper much with long-term holdings,
but the short-term portfolio can be adjusted for market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A major decision is how to allocate investments among stocks,
bonds and other assets, including money market mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bonds are less risky than stocks, but they yield less,
for the same reason. Still, many investment advisers recommend at
least a portion of any balanced portfolio should include bonds.
</P>
<P>
   A Bloomberg News survey of asset allocation recommendations of
15 major Wall Street brokerages in late September showed an average
mix of roughly 62 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and about 7
percent cash.
</P>
<P>
   But the individual stock recommendations ranged from a low of 40
percent by Merrill Lynch analyst Charles Clough to a high of 80
percent by Lehman Brothers strategist Jeffrey Applegate. All-stock
portfolios are regarded as highly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Braving potential downturns
</P>
<P>
   As for which stocks or sectors to own, a favored defensive
approach is to buy the stocks of utilities and other companies that
provide consumer staples such as food, beverages and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in those industries are among the least likely to
experience declining profits _ at least, their profits will drop
less than those in other sectors, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether times are good or bad, people still need to eat, drink
and go to the doctor. The demand for these products and services is
fairly static,'' said Sam Stovall, a Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst who
follows industry trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilities perform well for two reasons: Demand is static, and
they pay dividends, which makes them more attractive when share
prices are falling,'' said Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   Precious metals such as gold _ or rather the stocks of precious
metals mining companies _ have also attracted investors as a
defensive move.
</P>
<P>
   Gold has historically been regarded as a hedge against inflation
and volatility, although the sustained period of falling inflation
during the 1980s and '90s has greatly diminished that role.
</P>
<P>
   While the short-term advice seems to be slanted to the cautious
side, some analysts find more reason for optimism than fear in
investor psychology, which can move the market.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer researcher J. Walker Smith, managing partner of the
Atlanta office of Yankelovich Partners, doubts the current turmoil
will end in the panic selling that has often occurred in past bear
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new dynamic to how people look at their finances,''
said Smith, whose firm researches investor behavior for a number of
financial clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe they are a lot more savvy than (their
predecessors), that they know how to deal with bad times as well as
good times,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude fits what Smith referred to as the paradoxical
pattern of the baby boom generation in particular _ the generation
credited with helping to fuel the 1990s bull market with its stock
and mutual fund buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does a declining market undermine the confidence of baby
boomers in where things are going? I think it makes them feel worse
about their current finances but not necessarily about their
prospects,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have learned to view life as a paradox, that bad always
comes with good,'' he said. ``While the market is weak now, that's
almost what people expected.''

 &HT;    Caution in order when bargain-hunting
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time to bargain-hunt?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But before you do, consider these tips from the experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is a virtue _ that's the first rule,'' said Charles
B. Carlson, consulting editor of Dow Theory Forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tendency is to jump in too early,'' Carlson said. ``If
you're buying in a bull market, you have the upward primary trend
in your favor when you're bargain-hunting. In a bear market,
however, the notion of a bargain can be kind of difficult to
discern because markets tend to move to extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we've seen how the extremes can run to the upside, I
don't think we've really got a true picture of how extreme
valuations can go on the downside,'' Carlson continued.
</P>
<P>
   So keep your powder dry, advised H. Bradlee Perry, retired
chairman of David L. Babson &AMP; Co., a money management firm in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who want to buy, I wouldn't fire off all my
ammunition right now,'' Perry said. ``We've taken the insanity out
of (stock) valuations. But, generally, I would not say we're into
bargain land yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, you've formed some reasonable price in your head
about what you're willing to pay,'' he said. ``But know that you're
not going to necessarily buy it at the bottom. Also know that what
may seem cheap now may become even cheaper. And it would be a shame
to use up all your buying power all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   So spread your buying over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use some time diversification,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   He recommends extra care in bargain-hunting for stocks that have
plummeted for a reason, such as weaker-than-expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   One key question to ask: Are the problems temporary?
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally like to see some improvement in a company's
earnings momentum before buying,'' Carlson said. ``It doesn't
necessarily mean the company's earnings are growing, just that
there seems to be improvement from quarter to quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful analysis of the company and its industry is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson provides these tips for bargain-hunting among stocks
that have crashed for cause:
</P>
<P>
   -- Invest in those with clean finances. It often takes time for
companies to turn around. Companies with lots of cash and little
debt have the ability to weather the storm.
</P>
<P>
   -- Choose stocks with restructuring possibilities. It may
require a special event to get a crashed stock going. A firm with
diversified business interests, for example, has the ability to
generate excitement by announcing a restructuring or asset sale.
</P>
<P>
   -- New management often signals a turn. The hiring of a new
president or chief executive is often the time to re-examine an
out-of-favor stock.
</P>
<P>
   -- When investing in depressed stocks, it's always a good sign
to see corporate insiders betting on a turnaround by buying stock.
</P>
<P>
   -- Looking at a chart of a stock's price movement is often
useful in determining the best time to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, it's better to buy a crashed stock after it's been
trading in a relatively narrow price range _ perhaps 5 percent from
the top of the range to the bottom _ for at least three months. At
that point, investors have some level of comfort that perhaps the
worst is behind the company.

 &HT;    Imnet quarter's leading gainer among Georgia stocks
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The secret to success in the third quarter among Georgia stocks
was to own shares of companies attractive to other corporations, or
which do little or no business overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Imnet Systems (IMNT), which reached a deal in late July to be
acquired by HBO &AMP; Co. (HBOC), was the leading gainer among state
stocks in the third quarter. It rose 79.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring Enterprises (MSPG), riding a wave of Internet
interest and three straight profitable quarters, rose 21 percent
for the quarter. It remains the biggest gainer year-to-date among
stocks trading for more than $2, with a gain of 270 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also claiming noticeable gains were two health-care-related
stocks: Serologicals (SERO) and Immucor (BLUD).
</P>
<P>
   Serologicals, whose fiscal first-quarter earnings jumped 52
percent and its second-quarter results climbed 38 percent, saw its
stock rise nearly 17 percent in the latest quarter. The company
provides human antibody-based products and services.
</P>
<P>
   Immucor announced an acquisition, won Food and Drug
Administration clearance to sell its ABS2000 blood test instrument
in the United States, and increased the size of its stock
repurchase program. The stock rose 12.2 percent in the
July-September period.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies with communications in common also rose.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth (BLS) gained 12.1 percent in the quarter, while Cox
Communications (COX), one of the country's largest cable operators,
added 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy in the Southeast and its relative insulation
from overseas problems has helped BellSouth. Cox Communications,
meanwhile, has begun to offer telephone service, digital television
and Internet access in some of its markets. Cox Communications is
controlled by Cox Enterprises Inc., which owns The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Mapics (MAPX) scored a gain of a little over 12 percent, as the
software company's revenue and earnings growth won notice on Wall
Street. Its products are designed to help mid-size companies boost
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Profit Recovery Group International (PRGX), a company that
provides accounts payable and other recovery audit services, gained
almost 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Synthetic Industries (SIND), which counts itself as the
second-biggest producer of polypropylene fabrics and fibers in the
world, finished the quarter up 11.6 percent. Its products are used
for carpet backing, erosion control and in furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were JDN Realty (JDN) and Flowers
Industries (FLO).
</P>
<P>
   JDN Realty, a shopping mall real estate investment trust, gained
8.7 percent. A number of analysts and money managers have been
suggesting investors look at REITs, because of the yields
available. JDN Realty had a quarter-ending yield of almost 6.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers Industries, up 6.7 percent, has gotten a big boost from
its controling stake in Keebler Foods, and in late September was
upgraded to ``accumulate'' from ``hold'' by Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market's problems showed up in a slowdown in initial
public offerings. Only two Georgia-based companies went public in
the third quarter, according to data from Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Towne Services (TWNE), which sells electronic processing
products and services to financial services companies, went public
at $8 a share at the end of July. It closed the quarter at $5.50.
</P>
<P>
   BioShield Technologies (BSTI) went public Tuesday at $10 per
share. There was no indication of any trading Wednesday in shares
of the medical technology company.

 &HT;    Market is going to have to earn its way out of trouble
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably the best thing that can be said about the stock market
is the high valuations everybody complained so much about are not
so high any more.
</P>
<P>
   The price-to-earnings ratio of Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
fell from a record 28.7 in the second quarter to 24.2 at the end of
September.
</P>
<P>
   The price-to-earnings ratio _ P/E _ is the way analysts measure
the value of a stock relative to the per share earnings of the
company that issued it. The ratio measures how many dollars the
investor is willing to pay for a dollar of profit.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the comedown, the S&AMP;P 500's P/E is still above what
it was a year ago _ 22.8 _ and well above the index's long-term
average of about 15 _ what's considered appropriate. And analysts
suggest if the market is to extend the bullish rise that began in
the early 1980's and accelerated in the '90s, then stock prices
must get more in line with corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   However, if third-quarter earnings turn out better than most
analysts anticipate, that could set the stage for a stock market
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big ``if.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts contend the eight-year bull market propelled stock
prices so high it will take more than the summer and fall market
drop to make them right.
</P>
<P>
   And even if that weren't the case, the chances corporate profits
will be very strong any time soon are regarded by analysts as slim
and none.
</P>
<P>
   That's because U.S. corporations find themselves in a bind.
Earnings growth can't accelerate much until revenue growth does.
And for lots of reasons _ especially competition from Asia _ U.S.
companies are constrained from raising prices and therefore
increasing revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since late 1997, many commodity and natural resource companies
have suffered precipitous drops in pricing power, much of it due to
the crisis that had begun in Asia in the early part of last
summer,'' Prudential Securities analyst Greg A. Smith explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Asian crisis no longer an Asian crisis but an Eastern
European-Latin America-Mexico-Canada currency and financial market
crisis, it's difficult to see how companies' pricing power would
improve as we move into 1999,'' Smith added.
</P>
<P>
   That dismal outlook doesn't bode well for the stock market,
although not all analysts are so pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey strategist Robert S. Robbins argues earnings
are earnings, and unless they turn into losses, ``declining
earnings'' won't be that much of a drag on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But the third-quarter earnings reports will be a big pill for
investors to swallow, according to First Call, which tracks
analysts forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston-based organization said earnings for S&AMP;P-500
companies are expected to post the first year-over-year decline
since late 1991, when the economy was still emerging from a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   But Robbins said year-over-year comparisons should begin looking
more favorable starting with the fourth quarter, since it was in
that quarter of 1997 that Asia's problems began slowing profit
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The First Call consensus for 1998 and 1999 is for annual
earnings growth of 4.5 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively, vs.
9.3 percent in 1997. Robbins noted this is subject to further
reduction, but he also added analysts' estimates are often high,
especially when expectations are weakening.
</P>
<P>
   All this uncertainty makes it difficult to predict how long the
current state of affairs in the market will last, analysts say. Is
the worst of the selling over, almost over or not over by a long
shot?
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frequent forecasts from Wall Street gurus is
stocks are still too pricey for the selling to be over, but they
have dropped low enough to be attractive to buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The result will be a trading range for the rest of the year at
least, typically defined as 7,000 to 7,500 on the low side to 8,000
to 8,500 on the high side, with the potential to break out of the
range on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe investors face a period of adjustment
because a fundamental change has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most of the 1990s _ especially the 1995-1997
period _ the future will be marked by slower, and historically more
normal, annual earnings growth, stock returns and economic growth,
the analysts think.
</P>
<P>
   The longer-term fundamentals are still favorable, however, and
analysts think stocks will return at least 5 percent through the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, stocks have returned about 10 percent per year,
on a compounded basis.

 &HT;    Expectations for third-quarter earnings turn sour
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The profit outlook for U.S. companies going into the final
quarter of 1998 does not look good.
</P>
<P>
   First Call, a Boston-based research group that tracks analysts'
earnings forecasts, said Wall Street looks for the earnings of
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 companies to decline at least 1.4 percent in
the third quarter, and possibly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the first year-over-year decline since the third
quarter of 1991, when the economy was just coming out of a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Asia is the main factor in all of this,'' said
Charles L. Hill, research director. ``What originally had been
viewed as something that most people thought wouldn't have a
significant effect on U.S. earnings now may be headed for at least
a three-quarters problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnings rose only 3.8 percent in the first quarter, 3.5 percent
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said analysts' fourth-quarter projections of 10 percent
earnings growth are excessive and will shrink as the months pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect that fourth-quarter earnings growth would come
down to the low single digits,'' said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   First Call's annual projection for earnings growth in 1998 is
4.3 percent vs. 11 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts become more optimistic as they look ahead to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus estimates for the first and second quarters are
15.1 percent and 19.4 percent, respectively.

 &HT;    Money managers keeping wary eye on global turmoil
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With turmoil in the world's stock markets as a backdrop, five
money managers gathered Sept. 21 to share their thoughts about the
state of affairs and offer their recommendations to long-term
investors. Cautious to a degree about the near term, they were
generally optimistic about long-range prospects. And one theme kept
surfacing in their discussion with Cox writer David McNaughton: The
sharp drop in stock prices has created bargains not seen in a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Let's start with the hardest question. What are you telling
your clients when they ask if we're in a bear market, how long it's
going to last, and what's going to be driving the market?
</P>
<P>
   Sandra W. Majors (Sandra W. Majors, Inc.): I, as a professional,
can't answer the question of whether we are in a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   I think if we just look at our own country, our own situation,
we have enough to deal with, with all the unsettling news in
Washington. But, unfortunately, we can't operate in a vacuum, and
we have a very unsettling foreign situation kind of tumbling around
us, from Russia to problems in South America, to Japan, to other
areas that once we could look to and not feel their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Until we get a read on how earnings are going to come out in the
third quarter, it will be difficult to tell if we end up in a bear
market, or the duration of that bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Z. Allen (Globalt, Inc.): I think earnings are the big
issue. If you would have had us here a few months ago, we would
have been very worried about expectations. Now, earnings
expectations have come way down. And for the first time in as long
as we can remember, what is referred to as the bottom-up estimates
for the Standard &AMP; Poor's (index companies) created by individual
analysts are lower than the top-down estimates for the S&AMP;P for this
year by strategists.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good sign that reality has seeped in. We think a lot of
that has been priced in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to us that the market probably would need to
spend time repairing some of the vast internal damage by at least
revisiting the 7,400-7,500 level of the Dow. But it's not out of
the question that the market could go back to where it was on gray
Monday last year, which got us down to 6,900. That was a cathartic
point in the market, and if that happens again, that would not be
significantly below were we are now, and it would probably further
improve the health of the market for the intermediate term.
</P>
<P>
   Charles B. Morris, Jr. (Morris Investment Counsel): Are we in a
bear market? It's a yes and no, because there are two markets. One
market is the Nifty Fifty, the Microsofts, Dells, Ciscos. And we're
not there.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the market? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   How long will this last? We can't answer that. It's driven by
the turmoil in the international markets, which is a function of
the lack of currency stability.
</P>
<P>
   Nola Maddox Falcone (Evergreen Asset Management Corp.): I agree
with Charlie. The level of the market is really contingent on the
speed of the major industrialized nations in working cooperatively
to remove the panic from the international currency markets. As
long as there is chaos in the financial structure, there will be
volatility in the markets. The key is the banking situation in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Scott C. Satterwhite (Artisan Partners): With respect to what's
going on in the emerging markets and what you're seeing in the
economy relative to corporate earnings, that's sort of Round 1. The
effects are the loss of export markets, import competition and
lower commodity prices. It's hard to imagine those effects are
going to get a lot, lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   You're starting to move now into Round 2. You're starting to see
some layoffs at some of the affected industries and capital
spending cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, what all these changes mean to individual investors is
that we are in a period where the earnings environment is tough.
It's certainly a lot harder for a company to make money today than
it was three months ago. And it's probably not going to be any
easier three and six months hence.
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason to be negative on a three- to five-year view.
But getting there might not be as much fun as it was in 1995
getting to 1998. That was a good three-year period. This is going
to be a tougher three-year period. But there are investment
opportunities, as there are always investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   This is a much better time to be a three- to five-year investor
than it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Generally, you as money managers seem optimistic about the
longer term. What positives for the market do you see?
</P>
<P>
   Falcone: U.S. banks are in the best shape they have been in, in
any crisis, for a very long time, because of the consolidation that
has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation issue is positive for us, the low inflation.
Another positive is technological innovation. If we continue to
have technological innovation, that will kind of keep us from
falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Another positive is the merger and acquisition trend.
</P>
<P>
   Majors: Long term, definitely we're all very positive on the
market. What I think we're talking about is shorter- term, possibly
intermediate-term (caution), because we don't know how all of this
will unfold. We don't know, if Brazil defaults on its debt, how
that will affect the rest of South America. We don't know what will
happen if we find out, in earnings from some of our domestic banks,
that we have more Bankers Trusts out there. We just don't know the
full extent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Allen: A primary silver lining is that U.S. companies, because
they are cash-rich, have been in a position to strike bargains for
the last year in buying assets, in buying entire businesses, in
gaining market share. They are facing weakened competitors, and in
many cases they have lost some of their competition altogether
through the turmoil that has affected other regions.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of this, we think that you can look down a long list
of U.S. companies, spanning all economic sectors, where we'll be in
a very good position, longer term.
</P>
<P>
   Morris: It's hard to say if I'm optimistic or pessimistic, in
the setting of the international situation, because who can predict
whether Japan, Russia, the United States, Germany, whoever, will
get their political and economic leadership acts together?
</P>
<P>
   But if it gets down to individual securities or types of
securities in the U.S. financial markets, there are some tremendous
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Q:So what securities are you recommending to investors with a
long-term view?
</P>
<P>
   Morris: For those who are interested in getting a 5, 6, 7
percent yield up front and want diversification in the portfolio
from growth equities, and want that income, maybe also want the
securities for defensive purposes, and also some attractive total
returns, you can go into the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to go there. Either directly, owning the
individual securities, or though a mutual fund. For the individual,
in most cases it's difficult to get the diversification and the
liquidity, plus minimal transaction costs, by going to direct
ownership.
</P>
<P>
   So that leads you into mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   I strongly recommend going into just Treasurys, and there is a
group of funds that has Treasury-only mutual funds, and that's
Vanguard. Coincidentally, these are no-load funds and have the
lowest fees available.
</P>
<P>
   They have a short-term Treasury fund, an intermediate-term
Treasury fund and a long-term Treasury fund.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to own individual securities, I strongly recommend
going to the Treasury Direct program. You can get any maturity for
as little as $1,000, and in $1,000 increments. I strongly recommend
investors go the Web, the site is http://
</P>
<P>
   www.publicdebt.treas.gov. It tells you what you need to know
about the Treasury Direct program.
</P>
<P>
   The only other sector I would suggest investors consider in the
fixed-income world would be municipal bonds, which are roughly in a
3.5-5 percent yield range. And there, unless you have a
multimillion-dollar portfolio, I would suggest going to mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   There are some stocks where investors can get 6-7 percent
yields. Two are electric utilities. One is Ameren. Another is
Interstate Energy. Also, there's AGL Resources.
</P>
<P>
   In the real estate investment trust world, there are many, many
high-yielding equities. There's one based in Augusta _ Merry Land
(&AMP; Investment). It is being acquired by a larger REIT, Equity
Residential Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Falcone: We look at stocks that really have already been in a
bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Brokerages are now in a consolidating mode, and I wouldn't be
surprised, somewhere down the pike, if A.G. Edwards consolidated
with someone. It's (selling) for about two times book (value), and
the most recent takeovers in the brokerage industry have been
around three times book.
</P>
<P>
   There's Raymond James. I don't really think that's a takeover
(candidate), but it is doing a big (stock) buyback. PaineWebber is
another one that we think is a likely takeover.
</P>
<P>
   We bought a position in SunTrust (Banks), which we like a lot.
It's selling for a little over two times book. It's always rumored
as a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   We're always looking for technology innovations, and we like
Scientific-Atlanta a lot. They have the most sophisticated TV
set-top digital interactive boxes. They're ahead of their
competition, and they've got the orders now on the docket, and they
are ramping up in October from 7,000 units a week to 20,000 units a
week.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Caterpillar. It got (beaten down) because of the
concern about Asia, but they are going to benefit from the highway
bill. They've done some interesting restructuring, and they also
have some buyback of shares.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific is one that's really in the doghouse. That's
something you buy and put away for a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Saks, which is the (renamed) Proffitt's, is a great value and
growth stock combined.
</P>
<P>
   And Williams. They have magnificent management. They do
pipelines, and they're also into fiber-optic communications.
</P>
<P>
   If you just look at undervalued assets, there's Atlantic
Richfield. Cabot Oil &AMP; Gas is another one. My calculation of the
value of oil and gas in the ground, minus the debt, is $26 (for
Cabot). It's selling at $16.
</P>
<P>
   The last one, benefiting from the merger and acquisition trend,
is Mercantile Bancorporation in St. Louis. It's selling for about 2
1/2 times book (value). We think it could go to 3 1/2 to 4 times
book if it gets sold.
</P>
<P>
   Allen: We think there is much appeal within large caps and the
upper tier of mid-caps. So we are not recommending delving into
small-cap equities, nor do we think it's necessary, given the
opportunities that have just been presented to us.
</P>
<P>
   We want to have brand names, to the extend the brand is nearly
synonymous with the product, like American Express is with credit
cards, as Xerox is in duplication, as Citicorp is. Also an
interesting idea is Tiffany, because of the way they restructured
their product line to adapt to all of the markets where they are
represented.
</P>
<P>
   Within the information age group of companies, there are Cisco
Systems, Microsoft, Time Warner, Computer Sciences and Walt Disney,
which is targeting its Internet expansion to perhaps 10 to 15 years
down the road when now-young people, who are very adept at the
Internet, are going to be using the Internet for other purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there are companies that are well positioned, relative to
the demographics in the U.S., and especially the U.S. baby boomers,
and also to the aging populations in the other industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
   That would include Guidant and Arterial Vascular Engineering,
Baxter International and (Eli) Lilly, which maybe hasn't gotten as
much press as Pfizer. Also, AFLAC, which is participating in the
increased health care needs here, and also in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In financial services, I certainly agree with the comments that
Nola made. We would extend that to include Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, as well as State Street Bank.
</P>
<P>
   And in the leisure area, getting past any near-term concerns
about a slowdown in the U.S. economy, we would think with any kind
of a longer-term outlook, you could look at AMR as well as Delta
(Air Lines). Disney and Time Warner also are leisure providers and
dominant companies.
</P>
<P>
   And in personal care products, a stock that has been recently
put into the bargain camp: Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   Majors: On the bond side, because I don't see the world
situation calming down much in the near future, I could almost make
a strong case for the use of Treasurys. I would approach it in a
way that could be very beneficial for people who are averse to
guessing whether to go to the long-term end of the market or the
short end, or the intermediate. I would ladder (the Treasurys)
between, say, two years and eight years, putting some at two,
three, four, five, six, seven, or eight, if people are in the
fixed-income arena.
</P>
<P>
   On the equities side, I stick more to the large-cap and
intermediate-cap names. A few of the names I had written down
include American Home Products in the drug area. I look at where
companies have traded relative to the market. It's trading near its
relative P/E.
</P>
<P>
   Merck is another one. Merck spends almost 25 percent of its
earnings on research and development and continues to crank out
drug after drug after drug.
</P>
<P>
   In the food processing area, a company I currently like is
Earthgrains, the third-largest fresh-baked goods producer in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   In business services, one of the companies I've been buying over
the last year is Equifax.
</P>
<P>
   And in the financial services industry, I also like the
brokerage industry. T. Rowe Price is at a 22 P/E and is slightly
below its historical P/E right now. The return on equity for that
company is 30 percent, they manage $99 billion, they have 70
different mutual funds, and half of those mutual funds are
represented by retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   Satterwhite: I guess in the world of stocks, bonds and cash, I
think you should probably still own less than an average amount of
stocks and probably less than an average amount of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The stock portfolio, I would think, would be slanted toward the
small-cap end of the market, where the hard values are, and
whatever cash you have kicking around, my sense would be, you would
wait for better opportunities in big-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of opportunities in the market, I classify them three
ways.
</P>
<P>
   One is what I call ground-zero stocks. These are the stocks of
companies that are absolutely in the way of all the problems _ the
commodity-oriented stocks, companies that are being hit by import
competition, companies that have lost export markets because of the
Asian situation, where the earnings pressure is currently the
greatest.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil and gas area, (there are) Synder Oil and Forest Oil.
Both of these are small-cap exploration and production companies.
They both sell at or below their net asset values, which would be
the value of their oil and gas in the ground, less debt.
</P>
<P>
   Another ground-zero industry is semiconductor equipment. There
is a huge glut in production capacity. So they've not only been
slogging through an inventory glut, now you have loss of market as
well.
</P>
<P>
   You have the opportunity to buy companies at reasonably large
discounts to hard book value. And these are companies that have
relevant product lines, product lines that are going to be needed
for the next generation of semiconductor manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley Group is one I own. FSI International is another.
</P>
<P>
   A third area is steel, and this one is a little spookier because
you don't necessarily have the wind at your back to as great an
extent, I believe, as you do with semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   But nonetheless, I think these stocks have been abused,
particularly since June or so.
</P>
<P>
   One that I think you can support on an asset value basis, LTV,
is a typical sort of integrated steel manufacturer. What maybe
separates it a little is they have some interesting assets that are
not related to the integrated steel operation. They have $4 in cash
on the balance sheet, and they have $5 per share of assets that
aren't integrated steel assets. They own, in a joint venture, the
Trico mini-mill operation in Alabama. They own a metal building
(systems) company, and they also have a joint venture with
Cleveland-Cliffs, on an iron venture that sells into the mini-mill
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is Schnitzer Steel Industries, which is primarily a
scrap processor, probably the best-positioned scrap processor in
America. They own a lot of great gathering and processing assets.
And it is probably in the best position to supply foreign mills.
Now, the trouble is, the foreign mills don't want any scrap. But if
you look out there long enough, over a three- to five-year period,
we'll probably set some settling out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   A second pocket of value, maybe it's a canyon of value, is in
the whole microcap area.
</P>
<P>
   One we recently started buying is Harding Lawson Associates
Group. It's a hazardous waste consulting and remediation company.
This industry has been under a lot of pressure for a number of
years due to too much supply in the marketplace. But consolidation
has begun in the industry. So there's some interesting
value-realizing events going on.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy Harding Lawson for $6. The current assets, minus all
the liabilities, is $7. There's $3 of cash on the balance sheet, no
debt, and the company is not discouraging anybody from believing
that 85 cents (per share) is next year's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   CFC International is another one. This is a company that
manufactures relatively complex chemical coatings. It manufactures
holographic products. You see its holographs on the Coor's box. You
see them on a tube of Aquafresh and some of the other toothpastes.
</P>
<P>
   Its coatings go on ready-to-assemble furniture. It also makes
the magnetic strip on the back of your credit card. A great line of
products and a very high return on equity.

 &HT;    Hitching on to a trend good long-term strategy
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A short-term defense is not the only strategy investment
advisers recommend for a down market.
</P>
<P>
   Since you're probably rethinking your stock holdings anyway, why
not look at stock selection on the basis of ``themes,'' or
longer-term trends that should hold up well into the 21st century?
</P>
<P>
   John M. Eade, research director of Argus Research, advocates
thematic investing geared to trends unlikely to be affected by
economic cycles or market uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   He cites five themes:
</P>
<P>
   -- Bank consolidation. This especially involves super-regionals
such as NationsBank and First Union.
</P>
<P>
   -- Deregulation in communication. The Telecommunications Act of
1996 will open new competition for well-positioned companies such
as Bell Atlantic and GTE, its planned merger partner, MCI WorldCom
and AirTouch Communications.
</P>
<P>
   -- Technology and productivity. Computer technology has enabled
the economy to grow without inflation. Improvements are ahead in
semiconductors, software, communications equipment. Compaq
Computer, Intel and Oracle are cited here.
</P>
<P>
   -- Demographics. Baby boomers are in their peak earning and
saving years, which is positive for consumer service firms:
financial, leisure, retail. Home Depot, Marriott International,
McGraw-Hill, Sears, Roebuck and Starbucks are mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rising health care costs. This goes hand in hand with the
baby boom trend. Breakthroughs have occurred in pharmaceuticals
aimed at previously unmet medical needs. Among companies mentioned:
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Warner Lambert.

 &HT;    ``S'' for sufficent, not small
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I asked the clerk where I might find the garment in
question, she muttered something and raised a big arm toward the
far end of the store.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was she said failed to register, but I headed that
way, past the camping gear, past the football jerseys, past the
hockey sticks, toward a sign that said ``Lingerie.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course. I should have known.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never heard one called that before, but it had been a while
since I went shopping for a jock strap.
</P>
<P>
   I should have known is right. No jock straps were to be found
among the lingerie, nothing even close. Only frills that wouldn't
be up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   In shirts I wear a 14 1/2-inch neck and a 32-inch sleeve. In
sport jackets a 38 short. In slacks a 30-inch waist (and holding)
with a 30-inch length. I looked for something that said Waist 30.
</P>
<P>
   On reflection I realized there's more to a jock strap than
simply the waist. But I didn't know how they were measuring it
these days. Mass? Volume?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out it was quite simple. At this store, at least, the
jock straps (they were around the corner from the catcher's mitts
and face masks) came in four sizes: regular, large, XL and I think
I actually saw a few that said XXL. Pick which one you are.
</P>
<P>
   I knew I didn't need the XXL and I didn't need the XL either. I
didn't even need the large. It's no big deal. I'm a regular guy in
every other respect, so it seemed reasonable that I'd be regular in
this one, too.
</P>
<P>
   But I wondered: What if I did need a, well, small jock strap. I
speak hypothetically, of course. ( Small? Are you kidding?) What
if?
</P>
<P>
   A man could of course always go to the boys' department, and
from there to his therapist. The boys department did have large,
medium and, for the little guys, small. ``I'm buying my boy an
athletic supporter,'' he could tell the clerk. ``Um, I think large
should be about right.''
</P>
<P>
   What man wants to be a Small? You can say small is beautiful and
less is more, but regular is better.
</P>
<P>
   I've noticed it's the same with pizzas. No one wants it small.
You're wondering what pizzas have to do with athletic supporters.
More than you'd think. I don't know anyone who has the trouble we
do ordering a silly pizza, with one child wanting extra cheese and
nothing else, another insisting on sausage, pepperoni and ham, the
first clamoring for Papa John's, the second for Pizza Hut and the
chump paying the bill holding out for Rocky's. It gets complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, after Pizza Hut swept Rocky's two heads to no
tails and then bested Papa's John's in a disputed best of five, I
said to the woman taking our order, ``Tell you what. Give us one
small with ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have small,'' she said in a hurried voice. ``We have
medium and large.''
</P>
<P>
   Phones were jangling in the background. I could see her, phone
to her ear, tired, people shouting in five directions. I didn't
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you have a medium if you have a large but no small?
What's your frame of reference?'' (These things really irritate
me.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it is. What would you like on that medium?''
</P>
<P>
   You don't give logic lessons to the woman taking your pizza
order, and you don't ask the guy selling jock straps why no man
needs a small. Unless he shops in the boys' department, a man has
the comfort of knowing he is at least regular, yessir.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the Bentley automobile. It sells for well into six
figures and the company won't tell the car magazines how much
horsepower its big engine produces. Let Mercedes-Benz and the rest
crow about their numbers. Bentley merely says, with a confident
sniff, ``S'ficient.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an idea. XXL for the circus sized, XL for what every man
wants to imagine, L for some, M for the many and the medium and S
for the Sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the regular fits fine, just fine. A little loose,
but I think they run large. I'm sure it'll shrink after it's
washed.

REPUBLICANS TRY TO WORKOUT COMPROMISE WITH WHITE HOUSE TO AVOID
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With only four days left before Congress' scheduled
adjournment for the year, Republican leaders are trying to work out
spending compromises with the White House to avoid a government
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Although some conservative Republicans still hope to attach
anti-abortion language and other controversial riders to the nine
pending appropriations bills, their leaders are pushing to avoid an
an election-eve showdown with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There shouldn't be any government shutdown,'' Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time he charged that the Clinton administration
may try to force a shutdown in hopes of using it to the Democrats'
political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Lott suggested that congressional Democrats, eager to shift
public attention away from the Monica Lewinsky scandal, have been
urging the president to veto some of the spending measures to
highlight their differences with Republicans on issues such as
education.
</P>
<P>
   That concern was also raised by House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., in a meeting with GOP members. He urged them to refrain from
loading up spending bills with favored amendments so as not to give
Clinton ``any excuse'' to follow through on threats to veto some
appropriations measures.
</P>
<P>
   Most members agreed with him, and late last week the House
passed a $56 billion farm bill after stripping out language that
would have prohibited the use in this country of the
French-developed abortion pill RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough thing for some members to do because they
feel so strongly about it,'' said one Republican leadership aide.
``But it shows how we're trying to send him clean bills so that he
doesn't have any excuse not to sign them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who still enjoys high job approval ratings despite talk
of impeachment, has signaled his displeasure with a number of
spending bills over matters ranging from abortion and environmental
language to the size of the emergency aid package included in the
farm bill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Democratic congressional leaders Monday to
discuss the appropriations process. Afterward he threatened again
to veto legislation that ignores his proposal to hire more teachers
and build new schools or that includes a GOP proposal to cut taxes
by $80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Republicans to finish their work before the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is running short,'' he said. ``Congress has important
work yet to do.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., charged that
Republicans have already ``wasted the entire year and have left the
heavy lifting'' on spending measures until the final week of the
session.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance by Clinton, Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., was designed to put pressure on Republicans,
many of whom are still fighting among themselves over various
spending measures in the closing days of the session.
</P>
<P>
   For example, differences still remain between Republicans over a
bill designed to increase competition in the financial services
industry. Texas Sen. Phil Gramm has threatened a filibuster against
it because of concerns about the impact on local lending
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A Gramm filibuster would also interrupt a tight schedule that
Senate and House leaders are trying to impose as members rush to
complete their legislative business to hit the campaign trail
before the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his concern over some measures, the White House denied
Monday that Clinton would like to provoke another fight with
Congress that would lead to a shutdown like the two that occurred
in late 1995 and early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in no one's interest to shut the government down,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, adding that the White House has
``no intention or policy of shutting the government down.''
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown three years ago turned out to be a nightmare for
Republican lawmakers, who most Americans ended up blaming for the
budget deadlock that kept federal agencies and departments closed
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart called on Congress to finish its work on the current
spending bills, noting that internal divisions within the
Republican majority's own membership rather than with Democrats had
caused many of the delays.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Congress has passed only four of the 13 major
appropriations measures for the 1999 fiscal year, which began on
Oct 1. The four measures approved include funding for defense,
military construction, energy and water resources, and legislative
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders acknowledged nearly two weeks ago that there
was virtually no chance Congress would complete its work on the
remaining spending bills before Oct. 1. To keep the government
open, the lawmakers passed a temporary spending measure that was
signed by the president. But it expires Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that there is little chance of finishing work on the
appropriations bills before then, Republican leaders are likely to
wrap at least five of them, and maybe more, into one large omnibus
measure that can then be sent to the president.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton might accept a large stopgap
package that would temporarily fund the government until a new
Congress returns next year to deal with left over appropriations
But Lockhart said it would be better for the nation if the Congress
that's now operating ``in overtime'' not be allowed to get ``more
time'' to finish up its legislative business. &QL;

 &HT;    A ``ER'' clone makes it way to the ``Star Trek: Voyager''
network
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to love UPN. It's out there flailing away, tossing out
preposterous sitcoms and dramas, hoping with all its might that
some show _ any show _ will stick.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's newest example is ``Mercy Point'' (9 p.m. EDT on UPN).
</P>
<P>
   It wants to be an ``ER'' clone way, way _ way _ out there in
space, boldly going where no man but Capt. Kirk fears to tread.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Point, you see, is a hospital ship floating somewhere out
there at the edge of the known galaxy and full of doctors, nurses,
psychologists and, you knew this was coming, aliens. You can spot
the aliens because they're the ones with big bulbous heads or 16
fingers and tentacles for feet.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Point is a serious place. Serious serious. It's work,
work, work.
</P>
<P>
   There's lots of official hospital techno-jargon involving hemo
scans, parallel linkage and o-stat processors.
</P>
<P>
   We don't exactly know what all those are, but don't they sound
cool?
</P>
<P>
   Our crew of doctors _ even the ones with tentacles for feet _
are always saving lives no matter what the lifeform.
</P>
<P>
   A pregnant woman's in serious jeopardy. No problem. It's time
for a zero gravity operation that yanks that fetus from her body
and places it inside a warm, comfy and gross-looking artificial
womb.
</P>
<P>
   And this show's full of life's age-old ticks. Sisters who can't
get along. Doctors whose former lovers show up. Lustful hallway
lip-locks. And, of course, a killer virus on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, somebody's about to go into a peroxyl phase
reversal.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what that is either, but doesn't it sound cool?

   Moshea meet Brandy
</P>
<P>
   Told she looks like singing sensation Brandy, high school kid
Moesha Mitchell (played by Brandy) acts put out. ``Please ,'' she
says. ``I don't look like Brandy ... I'm cuter than her.'' But the
two finally meet backstage at a concert, eye each other
suspiciously, then decide neither looks like the other. That's the
stunt that kicks off the third season of UPN's ``Moesha'' (8
tonight EDT on UPN), which starts with the 17-year-old title
character trying to figure out the right thing to do when her
college-age boyfriend invites her to a cabin for the weekend, then
ends with Brandy performing ``Have You Ever'' from her
platinum-selling album ``Never Say Never'' for Moesha and her
friends.

 &HT;    `Dawn' sifts the midnight of Savannah
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before John Berendt made Savannah, Georgia a major tourist
attraction with ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,''
another outsider literally put the coastal city on the map. In the
October Smithsonian ($4), a fascinating excerpt from Patricia
O'Toole's book, ``Dawn in the Garden of Good and Evil,'' describes
James Oglethorpe's thwarted attempts to provide a haven for the
poor from London's overcrowded slums. The English aristocrat's
solution was to ship them off to the New World, give them tools,
food and shelter, and let them produce materials such as raw silk
for England. And, to provide for the moral and physical well-being
of the settlement, slavery and hard liquor would be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   Oglethorpe's plan was well-intentioned, but he didn't take human
nature into account. The settlers used every opportunity to sneak
across the border into South Carolina, where liquor was plentiful.
As they drank, they saw what a luxurious life the Carolina planters
had with slaves doing all the hard work. Within a few years,
poverty in Savannah was rampant and slavery was finally introduced
as a means of attracting investors. By 1748, Oglethorpe's dream was
just a shadow.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEWSWEEKLIES: It's difficult to imagine, but there is not a
single picture of Bill Clinton, Monica Lewinsky or Kenneth Starr on
the covers of the three big news magazines. There's still plenty of
coverage of the Tripp tapes inside, but apparently the editors
decided the public was ready for other topics.
</P>
<P>
   If anything will distract us from the White House scandal, it's
the economy. Maybe that's why Newsweek ($2.95) features a
doom-and-gloom cover story on ``The Crash of '99.'' It doesn't have
to happen, says economist Robert J. Samuelson, but it might.
</P>
<P>
   Time ($2.95), meanwhile, offers a compelling look at a week in
the life of Duke University's Medical Center. Equipped with pagers
provided by Duke, reporters and photographers went on rounds with
the doctors and examined everything from the effects of managed
care to the role of religion in a patient's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   At U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.95), writer Charles W. Petit
digs into our history to discover that the New World may be 20,000
years older than experts thought. Who were the first Americans?
Some archaeologists are challenging the theory that they were
fur-clad big-game hunters who crossed over the Bering Land Bridge
to hunt giant bisons and wooly mammoths.
</P>
<P>
   OH, JACKIE: Even in death, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis will not
be allowed to rest in peace. In a steamy excerpt from Edward
Klein's new book, ``Just Jackie: Her Private Years,'' People
($2.79) reveals the newly widowed first lady desperately seeking
comfort in the arms of a Secret Service agent and beginning an
affair with John Carl Warnecke, the architect who designed JFK's
grave site.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK READS: The New Yorker's ($3) David Remnick, author of a
soon-to-be-published biography of Muhammad Ali (``King of the
World,'' Random House, $25), eloquently describes how a young boxer
named Cassius Clay invented himself as the most charismatic athlete
of the century. ... So you think Bill Gates is the richest man in
America? Not according to American Heritage ($4.95). The Microsoft
magnate ranks fifth behind John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie,
Cornelius Vanderbilt and John Jacob Astor on the list of the
richest Americans of all time.

   &QL;  RADIO PIRATES STORM CAPITAL
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 -- A rag-tag crew of radio pirates marched
through the downtown section of the nation's capital Monday, toting
bullhorns and signs as they protested outside the Federal
Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   After a 30-minute stint outside the FCC, the group of 50 to 60
protestors marched a few blocks to the National Association of
Broadcasters, where they lived up to their pirate image: stealing
the NAB flag and hoisting up the skull and crossbones, the Jolly
Roger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were loud at times, and they moved on,'' said Rosemary
Kimball, spokeswoman for the FCC. ``It was interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, police arrested two of the microradio advocates,
as they prefer to be called. One of the protestors was arrested for
stealing the NAB flag, but the industry declined to press charges
and the protestor was released, said Dennis Wharton, spokesman for
the NAB. The other was arrested for swearing at a Washington Metro
Police officer. Further information was not available about that
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The microradio broadcasters were protesting the FCC's ongoing
crackdown on illegal radio operations across the country. In the
past year, the agency has closed at least 260 low-power, unlicensed
radio stations, 44 of which were in Florida and 10 in California.
</P>
<P>
   The microradio protestors say they provide a fresh,
community-based -- if sometimes irreverent -- look at news, music
and culture in the areas in which they broadcast, providing
diversity to an increasingly corporate-dominated industry.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC, and the industry, contend that the unregulated
broadcasts often interfere with transmissions from larger radio
stations. Worse yet, the FCC says there are documented cases where
pirate radio transmissions have interfered with air traffic control
communications with planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That absolutely cannot be allowed,'' said Kimball, whose boss,
FCC chairman William Kennard, is trying to set up a plan that would
allow the pirates to broadcast but in a more regulated fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Kennard has promised to continue cracking down
on any illegal operators, prompting the defiant march on Monday.
They carried a large puppet depicting Kennard as Pinocchio being
manipulated by General Electric and the NAB.
</P>
<P>
   FCC aides said they weren't sure whether the protestors were
actually broadcasting the march over a pirate radio station. Within
a little more than an hour the march was over, without incident,
other than the two arrests and a stolen flag. But they left behind
a few posters, pasted onto the newspaper honor boxes outside the
FCC that summed up the disrespectful tone of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio pirates do it on the air,'' one said.

TECHNOLOGY, SMALL COMPANY STOCKS FALL SHARPLY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks fell sharply Monday, leading the
stock market lower as the troubled world economy seemed to
undermine investor sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   From Japan came the news that some Japanese officials think that
their big banks are in much worse financial shape than previously
thought. From Washington, where the world's financial leaders were
gathered for the twice a year meeting of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, came no reassurance that world leaders
would be able to act quickly to turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like enough is going to be done fast enough,''
Jeffrey Applegate, chief U.S. strategist at Lehman Brothers, said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the major stock gauges fell to within easy striking
distance of their Aug. 31 lows, while the index of smaller company
stocks breeched that low Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign stock markets also ended lower, with Japan's Nikkei
index down 2.08 percent to its lowest close in nearly 13 years.
Brazil's Bovespa index was off 4.5 percent, despite the apparent
re-election of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was leading
in returns from Sunday's election. How fast Cardoso moves to cut
government spending and work with the IMF on a backup rescue plan
will be watched closely by investors, who fear that an economic
collapse in Brazil would lead to a recession in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As investors were shunning stocks they were rushing again into
bonds, pushing yields even lower. The yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond plunged to 4.72 percent and has now fallen 0.4 percent in the
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But although stocks finished lower, a sharp, end-of-the-day
rebound in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's index of 500 stocks staved off a much steeper decline. The
Dow, which was down almost 233 points finished off just 58.45
points, or 0.8 percent, at 7,726.24. The S&AMP;P index was off almost
38 points before rallying to close down just 14.04 points, or 1.4
percent, at 988.56.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq index, which is dominated by technology stocks,
plunged 78.29 points, or 4.85 percent, to 1,536.69. Cisco Systems
plunged 13.3 percent, Dell Computer was off 8 percent, Intel fell
3.95 percent and Microsoft declined 2.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the selloff was triggered by a report in The Washington
Post Monday that the Federal Trade Commission was investigating
whether Cisco had illegal conversations with Lucent Technologies
and Northern Telecom about dividing up the networking market. Cisco
confirmed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But selling pressure also seemed to come from the fear that a
slowdown in the American economy would lead to a sharp decline in
sales of networking and other Internet and computer products. This
belief probably was aided by the warnings of several technology
companies, including Aspen Technology and Avid Technology, that
their third-quarter earnings would fall below expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Capital spending, which supports much of the computer industry,
has been one of the strong foundations of the economy for the last
several years. But there are signs that capital spending is
beginning to slow. The recent sharp fall in the stocks of financial
companies and the recent reports of their losses will further curb
computer investment in this crucial area.
</P>
<P>
   If world leaders cannot reassure investors that they can contain
the current financial crisis, investors will focus more and more on
the possibility of the American economy finally tipping from slow
growth into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Applegate is not forecasting a recession yet but said that
``there is a growing chance of a pretty significant slowdown.''
With Stephen Slifer, the chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers,
he is re-evaluating his outlook and said that ``all the numbers are
going to be lower.'' This includes his forecast of 1,150 for the
S&AMP;P 500 at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Meyer, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said in
a speech Monday that the Fed cut its interest rate target last week
by a quarter of a percentage point because the central bank
believed the economy will slow next year. He said the cut was part
of a strategy to allow the economy to slow with a soft landing, not
a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Acuff, the equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney,
argued that ``the best case is slow growth next year, not a
recession.'' And if that is the case, the Dow could stay above the
7,400 level. But, he added, the odds for a recession are bigger
than the odds for a sudden strong recovery.

GORE, OTHERS EULOGIZE FORMER MAYOR TOM BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore arrived for the funeral
Monday of the former five-term mayor of Los Angeles, Tom Bradley,
in a long motorcade, helicopters hovering overhead. He told the
mourners that he had come to celebrate the life of a great
American, ``in many ways the Jackie Robinson of public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Cheatham, who is 51 and unemployed, arrived on foot. He
left his house at 7 a.m. Monday and walked more than two miles but
he could not get into the church.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctuary was already packed with the high and mighty and
the ordinary, who were in line as early as 6 a.m. to attend the
funeral, which started at 10 a.m. Cheatham and dozens of others had
to listen to the service over loudspeakers from across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the money to spare to catch buses and stuff,''
Cheatham said. ``So, I walked. I just had to come to pay my
respects. Mayor Bradley didn't have no color barrier or nothing. He
just loved people and brought them together.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than three hours, Los Angeles said farewell to Bradley,
who died last week at the age of 80 after spending much of his life
breaking one color line after another in his adopted home town.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first black police lieutenant in Los Angeles, the
first black member of the City Council, and the first, and so far
only, black mayor of this sprawling and diverse city.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the only Los Angeles mayor to serve for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an impossible act to follow,'' said the city's current
mayor, Richard J. Riordan, who did follow Bradley into office when
Bradley decided not to run for a sixth term in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a giant of a man,'' Riordan added, ``physically,
spiritually and mentally. He lead Los Angeles with finesse, with
grace and with class.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker after speaker, inside the First AME Church and outside
on the curb, described Bradley's long life as the American Dream
come true.
</P>
<P>
   He was the grandson of slaves, Gov. Pete Wilson of California
told the mourners. ``Divine nature gave us Tom Bradley,'' he said.
``It was more our good fortune than Tom's that God put this man,
this grandson of a slave, on a path to this great city that he
would one day lead.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the son of Texas sharecroppers, Gore said, ``making
history with his quiet dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a role model, said the Los Angeles police chief, Bernard
Parks, who is also black. ``I can honestly say,'' Parks said,
``there would not be a Chief Bernard Parks today if there had not
been a Tom Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an ordinary man with the courage to dream impossible
dreams and then make them come true, said Yvonne B. Burke, a Los
Angeles County supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   He was a loyal man who cared about the poor, said ``Sweet''
Alice Harris, a longtime neighborhood advocate in the Watts section
of Los Angeles. ``He didn't bring us fishes down there,'' she said.
``He taught us how to fish and he didn't leave us if the fish
didn't bite.''
</P>
<P>
   In life, Bradley was known as a coalition builder, a man with a
golden gift, the ability to bring people together across color and
class lines. In death, he was still doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered in the church were San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown,
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, musician Stevie Wonder, Sen. Barbara Boxer
and George Deukmejian, the former Republican California governor,
who narrowly defeated Bradley in 1982 when Bradley tried to become
the state's first black governor.
</P>
<P>
   On the hilly streets outside of the church, black, white, Asian
and Hispanic mourners huddled in the shade as the voices from a
100-member choir singing ``Grace of God'' poured out of a
loudspeaker. Marie Arvealo and her daughter, Connie, each stood
with a copy of the L.A. Watts Times newspaper over their hearts. On
the front page was a photograph of Bradley. ''I remember him with
love,'' Mrs. Arvealo said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Kate Wilkerson, 75, sat in the sun on one of
the white folding chairs set up outside by the church for the
overflow crowd. She came to the service by bus. ``I didn't leave
home meaning to come here,'' she said. ``I was planning on paying
some bills, but I just got drawn here. As far as I'm concerned, he
was the best mayor we ever had. My bills may not get paid today.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin Hill, 34, was just a boy when Bradley was first elected
mayor in 1973. To pay his respects and to make a few dollars, Hill
and his friends made up some T-shirts with a series of photographs,
depicting stages of Bradley's life, from his days as a track star
at UCLA, to his time on the police force and finally his years as
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of older black people are buying the shirt,'' Hill said.
``They can relate best to his struggle from sharecropper to mayor
of L.A. But if you think about it, what he did was incredible.'' On
the front of the shirt it says, ``Mr. Mayor, thanks for the
memories.''

BRAZILIAN PRESIDENT'S NARROW RE-ELECTION DIMS HOPE FOR REFORM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Through the anxious weeks leading up to
the national elections here on Sunday, as some $30 billion fled
Brazil despite the doubling of domestic interest rates,
international financial officials watched for the government to
tackle cost-cutting reforms as soon as voting ended.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, as official returns indicated President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso was barely squeaking through to re-election and
governors allied to him were locked in runoffs later this month,
the road to reform is looming longer and more complex. Polling
groups and television stations that reported an overwhelming
victory for Cardoso came under severe criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Though exit polls reported Cardoso taking some 56 percent of the
vote, official tallies Monday afternoon gave him 51 percent, with
56 percent of the votes counted. His nearest rival, Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva, of the leftist Workers Party, took 34 percent,
substantially higher than the 24 percent polls predicted he would
take. Cardoso's margin was just 1.2 percent higher than needed to
avoid a second round of balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Ciro Gomes, an up-and-coming former finance minister from the
northeastern state of Ceara, took 11 percent, while Eneas Carneiro,
a nationalist who called for Brazil to build an atom bomb, gained
2.2 percent of the vote. Though voting in Brazil is largely
obligatory, the share of abstentions and invalid votes reached 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of the president did poorly in many of Brazil's most
populous and politically influential states, weakening Cardoso's
hand going into negotiations for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brazil has not yet submitted a formal request, Brazilian
officials have been in Washington negotiating some form of
assistance from the International Monetary Fund that will likely
total $30 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   The country's failure to cut spending in two key areas _ social
security and civil service _ and to simplify and improve tax
collection, makes Brazil heavily dependent on foreign capital at a
time when investors generally are fleeing emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's budget deficit is exceeding 7 percent of Gross National
Product, and its current account deficit, which includes its
balance of trade as well as debt service and other payments,
constitutes more than 4 percent of GNP. Government cutbacks of $5
billion, and the doubling of interbank loan rates to almost 50

</P>
<P>
   Investors appear to be watching for lasting reforms from the
government and for signs that wealthy nations will back Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But the political arena remained strangely silent Monday, almost
suspended. By Monday afternoon, Cardoso still had not claimed
victory, and da Silva had not conceded defeat. Sergio Amaral, the
president's spokesman, said Cardoso would wait until official
results were completely tallied before speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo headlined exit polls
showing the president doing vastly better than official tallies
bore out, and in state races, polling institutes by and large
underplayed the strength of leftist candidates, bringing them under
sharp attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation has watched the most shameful political and
electoral manipulation heard of in recent history,'' said a
statement from the coalition of parties that da Silva represented.
It accused the polling institutes, media, and electoral officials
of conspiring ``to influence public opinion and alter the electoral
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro Francisco Paulino, director of opinion polls for
Datafolha, one of the main polling services, denied any intentional
manipulation of the results. He predicted the final results would
support the exit polls. While it is illegal to announce exit poll
results while voting is still going on, it is ``traditional'' in
Brazil, he said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brazil's Congress, out campaigning for gubernatorial candidates,
will likely not convene to consider reforms before the end of the
month, however dire the international situation. Cardoso appears to
be planning for a low profile in the coming weeks, with a brief
vacation and a trip to Portugal coming up. He is not expected to
openly campaign for any candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Dalvo Kinzo, a political scientist at the University of
Sao Paulo, said the only factor that might make pushing reforms
easier for the president this time is the urgency of the crisis.
``There's a consciousness that the crisis is very serious,'' Ms.
Kinzo said.
</P>
<P>
   But she warned that with the strong showings of leftist
candidates in important state races, and with half the deputies
newcomers to Congress, the president's governing coalition was
appearing more fragmented. ``Now, he's going to have to really
patch together support,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Augusto Guilhermo de Albuquerque, coordinator of the
research center on international relations at the University of Sao
Paulo, agreed. ``His coalition will be larger and less
ideologically committed than the current one,'' Albuquerque said.
Party discipline, customarily half-hearted, will be even weaker in
the new panorama, he added.

CLINTON URGES FINANCIAL LEADERS TO HALT SPREAD OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC
CRISIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, pressing his proposal for new
emergency aid to fiscally faltering nations, called on
international financial leaders Monday to ``do whatever it takes''
to protect against the spread of the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that as formidable as the challenge may seem,
it is well within our grasp,'' Clinton said at the beginning of a
U.S.-sponsored meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers
of 26 rich and developing nations. After his speech, Clinton began
private consultations with the group.
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks come after a generally noncommittal
international response to his call last week for new emergency loan
authority to shore up the economies of nations that face being
engulfed in the international fiscal crisis and cannot service
their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought to make a virtue of the richest nations' promise
to study his proposal. He said he was ``pleased to hear'' that the
Group of Seven leading industrial democracies and the management
committee of the International Monetary Fund ``have agreed to look
at ways of strengthening our capacity for stability ... (and) to
help countries ward off financial contagion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must find ways that do not penalize those nations who
follow strong economic policies in times of crisis,'' Clinton said.
``They will minimize the frequency, severity and human cost of the
financial crisis. They will put in place social structures to
protect the most defenseless. And they will promote broad
democratic support which is necessary for economic change.''
</P>
<P>
   The president is scheduled Tuesday to continue his personal
intervention in the growing global economic crisis with an address
at the opening session of the annual meeting of the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, Clinton's chief economic adviser, suggested any
resistance to Clinton's proposal was prompted by the need to review
the plan as part of a complicated overhaul of international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the long-term structural reforms that are
going to be very difficult and complex, and that will take
significant time to develop,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   Financier George Soros, the billionaire currency trader, said
Monday that the U.S. proposal was ``on the right track, but he
contended financial leaders from the wealthiest nations should have
settled differences on the U.S. plan rather than promising to
explore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those people should have been shut into a room and hammered
this thing out and come out with a decision,'' Soros said.
</P>
<P>
   Some international economic leaders indicated they were
withholding judgment on the Clinton initiative until the president
can settle his dispute with the House of Representatives over a
delayed U.S. payment of $18 billion to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is insistence by the Republican-controlled House to
deny funds to international agencies advocating family planning
that includes abortion. Sperling said Clinton would not back off
his opposition to the prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the dispute
harmed the U.S. ``capacity to respond to the current crisis, our
capacity to maintain confidence ... in the current crisis and our
capacity to exercise influence on the IMF and the monetary system
of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. markets did not respond well to the indecision of the
international economic leaders. The Dow Jones industrial average,
which had been off more than 230 points in midsession Monday, ended
down 58.45, or 0.8 percent, at 7,726.24.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's addresses are part of a flurry of economic
developments surrounding the annual meeting of the 182-nation IMF.
The group's policy-making body said Sunday that the global economic
outlook has ``worsened considerably'' over the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   But even with that despairing assessment, the IMF interim
committee signaled it could not settle on a firm recommended course
of action. The committee noted only that the spreading economic
crisis ``lends urgency'' to calls for strengthening the
international financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced Clinton plans to visit Japan, the Far
East's faltering economic linchpin, in late November after
attending the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in Malaysia. Clinton will also visit South Korea,
another nation hit hard by the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Summers renewed the U.S. call for the Japanese to ``take strong
steps to stimulate their economy, to bring fiscal stimulus on line
rapidly and to work to strengthen their banking system.''
</P>
<P>
   On another international economic front, the Clinton
administration expressed relief that President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso of Brazil won a second four-year term in an election
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, soon may need an
emergency line of credit from international institutions worth
about $30 billion, but Summers said ``the international community
greatly respects what has taken place in Brazil and is certainly
prepared to be supportive of Brazil at this important juncture.'' &QL;

GM, SURPRISING ANALYSTS, REPORTS STRONG SALES REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The General Motors Corp. is rebounding faster than
expected from the strike that shut down virtually all of its North
American factories during the summer, according to sales figures
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   GM said September vehicle sales totaled 393,364 cars and light
trucks, a 3.1 percent decline compared with the strong sales in the
month a year earlier but less of a drop than analysts had expected.
GM's truck sales totaled 164,196 vehicles, down 1.5 percent. Car
sales were off 4.2 percent, at 229,168 units. GM closed the 1998
model year, which ended on Sept. 30, selling 4.6 million light
vehicles, down 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in September, GM's market share bounced back to 31
percent, about the level it was at before the 54-day strike began
in early June. GM had not expected its market share, which had
slumped to 21 percent, to reach 30 percent until this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sales numbers show that we're back,'' Roy S. Roberts, vice
president and general manager for GM field sales, service and
parts, said at a news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the numbers were better than analysts had predicted.
``My estimate assumed GM would be down 6 percent from September
last year,'' said David Healy of Burnham Securities in New York.
``A lot of the rapid rebound was due to the very heavy rebates on
leftover 1998 models.''
</P>
<P>
   GM extended its production of 1998 models longer than is typical
to use up leftover parts. GM officials, however, vehemently denied
that the auto maker was offering larger incentives than its rivals.
``We're not leading this parade,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   According to GM's estimates outlined at the news conference
Monday, the Ford Motor Co. spent an average of $2,200 a car and
$1,400 a truck on incentives in the third quarter, compared with
$1,500 a car and $1,300 a truck for GM. ``There's been a lot
written about us being higher on incentives,'' said Mike
DiGiovanni, GM's chief forecaster. ``But Ford just completely
outspent us hugely in the third quarter because we were hit by the
strike and didn't have product.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford refuses to release its per-vehicle incentives, calling it
proprietary information. George Pipas, Ford's sales analysis
manager, said that calculating a rival's incentive spending
required complicated calculations and too many assumptions to make
the numbers valid.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Healy agreed that GM outspent Ford, estimating that GM's
incentives amounted to about $1,400 a vehicle in the third quarter;
Ford's were slightly less at $1,300.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also released its sales figures Monday, saying that it sold
326,941 Ford, Mercury, Lincoln and Jaguar cars and trucks in
September, up 4.1 percent compared with sales in the month a year
earlier. Truck sales totaled 196,707, up 9.2 percent. Car sales
were down 2.6 percent, at 130,234.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's market share for September amounted to 25.2 percent, down
from 25.6 percent in the month a year earlier. Ford's sales for the
model year were 3.8 million, about even with the previous year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   GM and Ford were the last auto makers to report September sales.
Their numbers put total American vehicle sales for the month at
1,279,264 cars and light trucks, a 6 percent increase compared with
figures from September 1997. Car sales totaled 684,786 units, up
2.4 percent; truck sales increased 10.4 percent, to 594,478
vehicles. That put the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for
light vehicles at 15.6 million cars and light trucks for September.
</P>
<P>
   ``What jumps out of the September sales report is the overall
strength of the industry,'' Healy said. ``We are running above
trend despite the volatile stock market, the expiration of high
incentives and the effects of the G.M. strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tumbling stock market and slips in consumer
confidence, GM and Ford are bullish on car and truck sales in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   GM intends to build 1.5 million cars and trucks for the last
three months of the year, the highest level for a fourth quarter in
a decade. With all its factories running at full speed and many of
them on overtime, GM's inventories continue to run at only about 80
percent of what is typical. The average day's supply of cars and
trucks on G.M. dealer lots is about 58 days, with supplies of the
most popular vehicles, such as the Pontiac Grand Prix, much less
than that.
</P>
<P>
   Ford added 20,000 vehicles to its fourth-quarter production
plan, pushing its production to 1.1 million vehicles in the
quarter.

LAWYERS IN HISTORIC CASE STICK TO THE SCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Clinton-Offenses)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a casting of lawyers straight from a John
Grisham novel, featuring opposites of the legal profession arguing
the case of a lifetime: for and against an impeachment inquiry of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   David P. Schippers, a little-known 68-year-old Democrat who once
helped bust up the Chicago mob, was deployed by Republicans on the
House Judiciary Committee as their prosecutor. Democrats countered
with a consummate Washington insider, Abbe Lowell, 46, a frequent
TV talk show guest who once defended House Speaker Jim Wright in an
ethics case before Wright resigned in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no courtroom, and no one was pretending that the
legal fight would be fair and even. The framers of the Constitution
made clear that impeachment _ even while requiring credible
accusations of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' _ is a political
decision. Republicans control the committee and have made clear for
days that they intend to follow Schippers' recommendation that an
inpeachment inquiry be launched.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers was first on the attack _ and first to stumble.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated assertions of his impartiality, Schippers
inexplicably ended his hour-long argument by offering his personal
views on the case, saying the committee must protect the nation
from ``the winds of evil and tyranny.'' That earned him a rebuke
from the man who hired him, committee Chairman Henry Hyde of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know he was going to do that,'' a visibly startled
Hyde said in a stage whisper to the ranking Democrat,
Representative John Conyers of Michigan. Hyde then ordered that
Schippers' personal remarks be stricken from the record, an
admonishment that was clearly embarrassing to the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell then argued the Democratic case by employing the
unavoidably awkward defense that Clinton may have lied and acted
improperly but did not commit an impeachable act.
</P>
<P>
   The key difference between the arguments delivered by the two
lawyers was over what constitutes an impeachable offense. Each
cited the vague standard that a president can be impeached for
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' _ to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers repeatedly said there was ``substantial and credible''
evidence that the president may have committed perjury and
conspired with others to cover up his sexual relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky. As a result, Schippers declared in a monotone
voice, there is enough evidence of possible impeachable acts to
proceed with an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At some points, Schippers used legalistic language to poke holes
in Clinton's defense. ``The president described himself as a
non-reciprocating recipient of Miss Lewinsky's services,''
Schippers said, referring to Clinton's insistence that he did not
have sexual relations with Lewinsky even though she performed oral
sex on him.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, while not directly disputing that Clinton had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky, made a two-part argument against
proceeding with the inquiry. First, Lowell said, the committee
should delay any action until it has decided what constitutes an
impeachable offense. Any other course, Lowell argued, would be
premature. Second, Lowell said, Clinton shouldn't be impeached
because the alleged actions don't rise to the level of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, for example, said Clinton's initial denials of an affair
with Lewinsky ``were misstatements about a consensual
relationship'' and did not rise to the level of an impeachable act.
</P>
<P>
   While the two lawyers' words rang with history, the performance
was a distinctively Washington set piece, with the legal arguments
likely to make little impact on politicians who will decide whether
to proceed with the impeachment inquiry. Indeed, while Schippers
and Lowell argued over what is an impeachable offense, many of the
37 members of the Republican-controlled committee had made clear
for days how they would vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both counsels ended up playing station identification, saying
what you would expect,'' said Laurence Tribe, professor of law at
Harvard University. Tribe decried the way Republicans moved toward
a vote on the impeachment inquiry without following a Democratic
suggestion that the committee first agree on what is an impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had agreed to focus on that initial question, then the
counsels would have an understandable role,'' Tribe said. ``Instead
there is this notion you can have an investigation into whether a
standard has been violated but not tell anyone what the standard
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, who during the 1960s was the chief of the Justice
Department's Chicago organized crime section, became friends with
Hyde with the two served together on a Chicago anti-crime panel in
1969.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Schippers struck a somber, professorial tone for most of
his hour at the witness table, as he spelled out one alleged
impeachable act after another. Unlike a normal court room, in which
an opposing lawyer is allowed to object to statements and appeal to
a judge, the Judiciary Committee forbade any interruption. Thus,
Lowell was not allowed to object to Schippers' tactics or his
occasional use of hearsay to make his case.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Schippers said that Lewinsky's assertion that
the president had touched her breasts was ``corroborated by several
of her friends,'' Lowell was not allowed to object that these
friends could not have seen the private encounter.
</P>
<P>
   But later, Lowell's voice dripped with sarcasm as he suggested
the Republican case for impeachment boils down to ``who is telling
the truth about who touched who, when and where.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lowell sounded as uncomfortable as many of Clinton's
Democratic defenders as he sought to argue that a president who
lies is not necessarily one who should be impeached. Noting that
the Judiciary Committee in 1974 did not approve an article of
impeachment regarding former President Nixon's false statements to
the IRS, Lowell said: ``If President Nixon's alleged lies to the
IRS about his taxes were not grounds for impeachment in 1974, how,
then, are alleged lies about President Clinton's private, sexual
relationship with Miss Lewinsky grounds in 1998?''
</P>
<P>
   The most awkward moment for Republicans came when Schippers'
delivered his surprisingly personal coda to his otherwise
legalistic statement.
</P>
<P>
   After declaring that his guiding principle had been ``a search
for the truth fairly and impartially,'' Schippers ended his
statement by announcing that he wanted to say something ``as a
citizen of the US who happens to be a father and grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws of this country are the great barriers that protect
the citizens from the winds of evil and tyranny,'' Schippers said,
quoting from the play, ``A Man for All Seasons.'' ``If we permit
one of those laws to fall, who will be able to stand in he winds
that follow?
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of this committee, you are being watched... by 15
generations of our fellow Americans, many of whom are reposing in
military cemeteries throughout the world, are looking down on you
and judging what you do today.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats and Republicans seemed startled by the remarks.
Within moments, Conyers walked over to Hyde and said something
privately to him. Then Hyde, who has said he wants to be
bipartisan, said he found ``some substance'' in he complaint raised
by Conyers and ordered that Schippers' personal comments be
stricken from the record.

MARKET REACTS TO G7 NEWS, DOW DROPS 58 POINTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Disappointment over prospects for a global solution to the
world's economic crisis sparked a huge selloff in stocks Monday as
investors rushed to put their money into the relative safety of US
Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow Jones Industrial Average managed to bounce back
from a 200-point deficit earlier in the day, the technology-laden
Nasdaq composite index fell 4.9 percent, its worst beating since
August 31, when it fell 8.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As stocks tumbled, bond prices soared in the biggest rally in 10
years. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond surged 2 5/32 points,
or $21.56 per $1,000 bond, pushing the yield down to a record 4.71
percent, from 4.85 percent on Friday. The yield is the lowest in 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   After initially falling 232 points, the Dow, an index of 30
large industrial companies, finished 58 points lower at 7,726. The
Dow remains about 200 points below where it started the year and
1,600 points beneath the July 17 record close of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks suffered the biggest losses, as the Nasdaq
slumped 78.29 points, or 4.8 percent, to 1,536.69. Even the
industry's biggest stars weren't spared, as shares of Cisco Systems
Inc., Dell Computer Corp. and Microsoft Corp. all tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. dropped 2 15/16 to 101 9/16 and Cisco lost 7
7/16 to 48 5/16 and Dell dropped 5 to 57 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; (begin optional trim) &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among Massachusetts-based technology companies, the biggest
victims were Avid Technology Inc. and Aspen Technology Inc. Both
companies warned of lower profits for the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tewksbury-based Avid, which makes digital editing equipment,
tumbled 9 5/16 to 13 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge-based Aspen, , which makes software for the oil and
energy industry, has lost two-thirds of its value in two days. On
Monday, it fell 7 15/16 to 6 7/8, after the company said it would
lose about 26 cents a share for the period ended Sept. 30. Analysts
had been expecting a profit of about 6 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen said it expects revenue for the quarter to be $46 million.
The company also said it was re-evaluating its business prospects
for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   EMC Corp. of Hopkinton, which makes computer storage equipment
for businesses, lost 4 3/4, closing at 48 5/8. Shares of Keane Inc.
of Cambridge, a technology consulting firm, continued their recent
slide, falling 4 5/8, to 28 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; (end optional trim) &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the stock market slide suggests that investors
don't think the world's leaders are doing enough to tackle the
growing economic turmoil overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There continue to be concerns in the market that inadequate
policy responses are being taken by the central banks globally, or
by the IMF, and fears that whatever policies they come up with will
fall short of what's needed to offset the problems of bad loans in
emerging markets and hedge funds,'' said Sylvester Marquardt,
research director of John Hancock Funds.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend meeting in Washington among leaders of the Group of
Seven largest industrial nations failed to turn up any concrete
plans for tackling the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The technology sell-off, in particular, was also attributed to
slowing demand for computers, software and services in Asia and
other parts of the world that caused many companies to warn of
lower quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   When a company issues such a warning in a volatile market,
``it's the kiss of death,'' said Giles McNamee, senior vice
president and director of technology investment banking for First
Albany Corp. in Boston. That sentiment quickly spreads to other
technology companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are expecting the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason technology stocks have plunged so dramatically, he
added, is that prices had been driven up by investors who were
anxious for a big payoff but didn't really understand what they
owned. Now, in a panic about the market's overall direction, they
are dumping their holdings at big losses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're throwing out all the babies and all the bathwater,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the technology sell-off, according to William
Becklean, a managing director of Boston-based Tucker Anthony Inc.,
was the fear that banks and investment firms _ traditionally
aggressive spenders on technology equipment _ would clamp down on
purchases because of their investment exposure to risky hedge
funds.

CIVIL SUIT AGAINST AU PAIR PROCEEDS   IN HER ABSENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Although she returned home to England almost four
months ago, the legal saga of former au pair Louise Woodward
continued in her absence in a Boston courtroom Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after a jury convicted her of killing 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen, US District Judge William G. Young &UR;  &LR; said he will
determine the amount of damages that the child's parents are
entitled to in the wrongful-death suit they filed against Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward has chosen not to contest the suit by Sunil and Deborah
Eappen, which alleges that Woodward is responsible for the fatal
injuries the infant suffered in his Newton home while under her
care. No one appeared in court on Woodward's behalf Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Young has already issued a default against Woodward. Monday he
directed the Eappens' attorney, Frederic L. Ellis, to file a motion
for judgment and an assessment of damages by Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory and
punative damages on the Eappens' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But Young observed Monday that it is unlikely the couple will
collect on any judgment because there is no evidence Woodard has
``assets of any significant size.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Woodward family in England have said that she
continues to disclaim any responsibility for the child's death and
abandoned her defense in the civil case only for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to England in June after the Supreme Judicial Court
upheld her manslaughter conviction and 279-day sentence. The
wrongful-death suit was filed hours after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis again emphasized that the Eappens decided to sue Woodward
to prevent her from profiting from the death of their son and the
international publicity surrounding the ensuing trial. He said he
wanted to ensure that Woodward ``is not driving around in a
Rolls-Royce three years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis declined to say whether he has ferreted out any book or
movie deals Woodward may have signed since her release. The Eappens
have said that any award they recover will be donated to a
foundation they have launched to fight child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and her parents have repeatedly insisted that her story
is not for sale. Young already has frozen Woodward's assets in the
United States and enjoined her from spending any money she receives
for her story.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said it is still unclear whether any award would be
collectible in England. But he said having a judge, rather than a
jury, determine damages may cut in his favor; British judges, he
said, may look more favorably on such a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's hearing, the judge denied Ellis's request to take
sworn depositions to help establish Woodward's culpability and set
punative damages. Young said the transcript from Woodward's
criminal trial will give him all the information he needs to
determine the extent of Woodward's culpability.
</P>
<P>
   Young said Ellis is free to take depositions after the judgment
to try and locate Woodward's assets to pay any award.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, a jury convicted Woodward of second-degree
murder and sentenced her to life in prison. But Judge Hiller B.
Zobel reduced her conviction to manslaughter and her sentence to
the time she had already served.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Woodward shook the baby and slammed him against
a hard object, fracturing his skull. The defense said Matthew's
injuries were pre-existing.

HIGH COURT TO RULE WHETHER JUDGE ERRED IN CASE OF TEXAS DEATH ROW
INMATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of a Texas
death row inmate, has agreed to decide whether a judge erred by
failing to tell jurors of a mandatory life sentencing provision had
they chosen not to condemn him.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. district court jury in Lubbock found Louis Jones Jr.
guilty of kidnapping Air Force private Tracie Joy McBride, 19, from
a laundry room on the Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo,
beating her over the head with a tire iron and leaving her body
under a bridge in February 1995. The jury, which rendered its
verdict Oct. 23, 1995, returned nearly two weeks later to recommend
that Jones, of San Angelo, be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal to the high court, Jones argues that the judge,
Sam R. Cummings, should have instructed the jurors that their
failure to rule unanimously for death would result in a
court-imposed life sentence without possibility of parole. The
jurors chose to condemn him, even those prone to spare his life,
out of fear that any decision but death might have resulted in a
lenient prison term, Jones says through his attorney, assistant
federal public defender Timothy Crook of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The erroneous interpretation of the jury instructions ... in
this case gave the death-prone jurors a big stick to wield over the
heads of those jurors leaning toward a life sentence,'' Crooks
wrote in urging the justices to hear the appeal. ``The (in reality
nonexistent) threat of non-unanimity resulting in a less-than-life
sentence coerced the life-leaning jurors into voting for a death
verdict to avoid the more unpalatable (but actually nonexistent)
option of a less-than-life sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected Crooks'
argument, saying the judge's failure to alert jurors to the
possible life sentence had no legal effect on the jury's
recommendation for death. In its decision, the 5th U.S. Circuit
gave little weight to affidavits from two jurors saying they would
have spared Jones' life had the judge said life in prison without
parole was the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which prosecuted Jones, unsuccessfully
urged the Supreme Court to let the death sentence stand. The
department, through Solicitor General Seth Waxman, said the
justices have never held that the Constitution requires judges to
instruct juries that a life sentence will result if they fail to
reach a unanimous decision regarding death.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the contrary, the court has noted that, even when jury
deadlock returns the matter to the judge for sentencing, the state
has in a capital sentencing proceeding a strong interest in having
the jury express the conscience of the community on the ultimate
question of life or death,'' Waxman argued. ``(Jones') proposed
instruction would undermine that strong interest by discouraging
deliberations to achieve jury unanimity.''
</P>
<P>
   The justices, who have not yet scheduled arguments in Jones vs.
United States, are expected to render their decision by next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The high court, acting on the first day of its 1998-99 term on
Monday, refused to hear the appeal of a Baptist minister from
Dallas who was found liable for malpractice and breach of fiduciary
duty for having sex with two female church employees who had sought
marriage counseling from him. Shelby Baucum, minister of
administration and education at the Casa View Baptist Church,
argued that the constitutional First Amendment right to free
religious exercise barred courts from interfering with his
``spiritual'' counseling of Robyn Sanders and Cynthia Mullanix.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court for Northern Texas ordered Baucum to pay
$115,000 to each woman. The 5th Circuit upheld the verdict,
rejecting Baucum's argument that his behavior enjoyed
constitutional protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment does not categorically insulate religious
relationships from judicial scrutiny, for to do so would
necessarily extend constitutional protection to the secular
components of these relationships,'' the 5th Circuit ruled. ``To
hold otherwise would impermissibly place a religious leader in a
preferred position in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   In other high court action, the justices told the 5th U.S.
Circuit to reconsider its March 6 decision that barred a former
Plano building inspector from suing the city for the sexual
harassment she allegedly endured from a supervisor. The U.S.
District Court for Eastern Texas, followed by the 5th U.S. Circuit,
ruled that Plano could not be held liable for harassment because
city leaders had no actual knowledge of the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   However, those lower court decisions were rendered before the
Supreme Court ruled in June that cities could be held liable for
harassment by municipal supervisors even if city officials were
unaware of the misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   In Wilson vs. Plano, Texas, Susan Wilson claims that her former
supervisor's boss made unwelcome sexual remarks and touched Wilson
several times in an offensive manner. The city claimed it had no
knowledge of Jack Newton's alleged actions until Wilson filed a
sexual harassment complaint with Plano after she resigned. &QL;

WHITE HOUSE STEPS UP ATTACKS ON GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House Judiciary Committee began its
impeachment debate Monday, the White House stepped up its attacks
on Republicans, accusing them of allowing the issue to overshadow
the nation's other business.
</P>
<P>
   Top Democrats in the House and Senate rushed to the White House
to join President Clinton in criticizing Republicans for not
passing spending bills to keep the government running and trying to
provoke a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   At the hastily arranged meeting with Clinton, the Senate
minority leader, Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota, and the House
minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, called on
Congress to approve the president's fiscal 1999 budget and
legislative proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop playing politics, pass legislation, and let's make some
progress,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for his part, said the Republican majority has failed
to pass 11 of the 13 spending bills and urged them to do so by
Friday, when lawmakers are scheduled to recess for the year and a
stop-gap spending measure the president recently signed expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to work with Congress to get this important work
done,'' Clinton said. ``There is still time for us to put the
people of our country ahead of politics, and I hope we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the historic proceeding of the Judiciary Committee unfolded
live on cable television, a determined Clinton tried to show he was
not distracted by the possibility of becoming the third president
in US history to face an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Besides meeting with Gephardt and Daschle, Clinton spoke by
phone to Russian President Boris Yeltsin about the pending military
action in Kosovo and attended a special meeting of finance
officials from 22 nations on the world financial crisis. He also
appeared at two Democratic fund-raisers _ a luncheon and a
reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not spending any time focusing on what's going on up on
the Hill,'' said White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart.
Later, he said: ``But I don't want to leave you with the impression
that he has spent no time on this.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton continues to lobby congressional leaders,
pressing against the opening of a formal inquiry and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the White House dispatched four staff members _ lawyers
and legislative liaisons _ to Capitol Hill to monitor the Judiciary
Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now had four hours or so of opening statements, and
they've yet to spend a minute talking about what is a reasonable
standard for impeachment,'' Lockhart said Monday afternoon.
``They're putting the cart before the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats on the Judiciary Committee already on the same
page as the White House in arguing that Clinton's relationship with
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky does not rise to the
level of impeachment, the administration turned its focus to a
united front against the GOP in the policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, White House officials discussed how they
needed Democrats to join them in criticizing Republicans for
failing to approve the president's budget, including his proposals
for education, a patient bill of rights, and setting aside the
budget surplus for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, White House officials contacted the
Democratic leaders. Daschle and Gephardt met Clinton after the
Monday fund-raising luncheon and rode back to the White House,
where they talked briefly before delivering joint statements on the
South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt singled out Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate
majority leader, for special criticism, saying he was playing
``showdown politics over a government shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott angered the White House and made some Democrats nervous by
saying on a Sunday talk show that he was not certain he could trust
the Clinton administration to get a budget agreement. Lott said he
had been told by a White House official that the administration was
prepared to shut down the government if it would be to their
political advantage. White House officials denied that and said
that chief of staff Erskine Bowles was misquoted.
</P>
<P>
   After calling the Republican majority ``the worst Congress that
has ever sat in the United States Capitol,'' Gephardt said if a
government shutdown occurs, ``it will be a failure of one group and
one part of our government and one part only, and that is the
Republican leadership.''

 Includes a color slide of Oprah Winfrey with Thandie Newton and

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Oprah Winfrey wept as the man towered over her.
 &HT;    ``You belong to me!'' he roared.
 &HT;    ``I think there has been a mistake,'' Winfrey sobbed, her knees
sinking deeper into the mud. ``Let me get my papers. I think we can
fix this thing.''
 &HT;    ``Don't think nothing,'' the man yelled. ``You are not supposed
to think. You are mine.''
 &HT;    It wasn't a dream. Nor was it a scene from Winfrey's new movie
``Beloved,'' which is about slavery. This was real.
 &HT;    Well, sort of real. To research her role as Sethe, a former
slave, Winfrey had turned to a Maryland company that stages
slave-master re-enactments.
 &HT;    Blindfolded and taken by wagon deep into the woods at dawn on a
hot morning in summer 1997, Winfrey spent the day being harassed by
various ``masters,'' unable to see, run or defend herself.
 &HT;    ``What I remember is that I started crying hysterically,''
Winfrey recalls. ``I just felt shock waves of pain. I felt hollow
darkness and howling agony. I touched that thing, that place of
what it was like to be a slave.''
 &HT;    It's a long time and a long way from that day, as Winfrey
relaxes for an interview at Chicago's Four Seasons Hotel.
``Beloved'' is due to open Oct. 16, and its producer/star is
strikingly thin and radiant in a billowing, floor-length,
black-crepe skirt and matching sweater.
 &HT;    She may be relaxed, though, but she's anything but comfortable
with the memory.
 &HT;    ``Many times I thought, `OK, just take the blindfold off and
tell them that it's over. Enough of this,''' Winfrey admits. ``Then
I would say to myself, `This is what I need to feel to do the
movie. I must know the pain of belonging to someone else.'''
 &HT;    If it sounds like this isn't just another movie, that's
understandable. Winfrey had fought to bring ``Beloved'' to the
screen since 1987, but actually making the film was even more
harrowing than getting it made.
 &HT;    ``I am not the same person after this movie,'' Winfrey says. ``I
came out of it fearless, and my entire life I have been a very
fearful woman. I've been fearful of everything. That's what my
weight issues were about _ repressed fear.
 &HT;    ``Now I know I come from a people who had no shoes, but they
said, `I will run on,''' she says. ``I come from people who said,
`Don't know which way north is, but I will find it.' They said,
`Don't know if I can swim when I get to the Ohio River, but I'll
find a way.'
 &HT;    ``Now I know what my people always knew,'' she concludes,
``which is that you have to look inside yourself and find the
spirit to say, `I am better than this.' To me that is the ultimate
fearlessness.''
 &HT;    It's been 11 years since the talk-show host first read Toni
Morrison's novel, on which the movie is based. She couldn't put
down the mystical story of Sethe, who kills one of her daughters to
spare her the horrors of slavery, only to be haunted by her
apparent reappearance years later.
 &HT;    ``I was taken in,'' she recalls. ``I felt absorbed by it. I felt
I was in the interior of the words.''
 &HT;    The moment she finished the book, Winfrey tried to contact
Morrison about the film rights. But it was a weekend, and she
couldn't get the author's phone number.
 &HT;    ``I scanned the back of the book to find the town she lived in,
and I ended up calling the fire department and asking them to
please call Toni and say Oprah wants to talk to her,'' Winfrey
recalls.
 &HT;    Morrison did indeed call back, but she laughed at the idea of
``Beloved'' ever being filmable.
 &HT;    ``I believe I can do it,'' Winfrey told her. ``In fact, I know I
can. I just need you to trust me.''
 &HT;    That trust was strained over the next decade, as producer
Winfrey struggled to find the right director for the project.
Finally, she settled on Jonathan Demme, director of ``Silence of
the Lambs'' (1991) and ``Philadelphia'' (1993).
 &HT;    She was nervous about approaching the Oscar-winning director,
but as it turns out he was equally edgy.
 &HT;    ``I was the one who was so nervous,'' he recalls in a separate
interview. ``I was having dinner at Oprah's house, and I wanted to
make this movie so badly.''
 &HT;    That night, Demme says, they discussed Winfrey's biggest
concern: ``Oprah was worried that she was too well-known for
audiences to accept her as this 19th-century farm woman.''
 &HT;    Actually, Winfrey _ who has acted in only a handful of roles in
films and television _ had a series of worries. For example, for
the first time she would be required to do a love scene.
 &HT;    It helped that cast opposite her was Danny Glover, with whom she
had worked _ and earned an Oscar nomination _ in ``The Color
Purple'' (1985).
 &HT;    ``Oprah did have all this anxiety about the love scenes,''
Glover says in a separate interview. ``I whispered to her, `I don't
care if we're 44 and 50 years old. Let's just pretend we're 17 and
doing it for the first time for real.'''
 &HT;    ``I was a wreck,'' Winfrey says, laughing. ``I asked one of the
dressers to please get me some lemons to suck on. I hear lemons
give you fresh breath.''
 &HT;    In the end, Glover says, ``We made each other feel safe, and
when I looked in Oprah's eyes, all I could see was the truth.''
 &HT;    Winfrey did draw the line at nudity, however.
 &HT;    ``I said, `Excuse me, Jonathan, I have breasts that flatten out
when I lie down,''' she says, laughing. ```If you want breasts, we
gotta go call Naomi Campbell. Stunt breasts!'''
 &HT;    Demme relented, and the scene was excised.
 &HT;    On the whole, however, Winfrey reveled in her first role since
the 1989 television movie, ``The Women of Brewster Place.''
 &HT;    ``I actually had an out-of-body moment the first day of
filming,'' she recalls. ``I was literally flying out of my body and
floating out of myself the first time Danny Glover walked up to
Sethe's front porch. I kept whispering to myself, `I read the book.
I dreamt the movie. And now I can't believe this is really
happening.'''
 &HT;    To hear her talk, it won't be another nine years before Winfrey
tackles her next role.
 &HT;    ``My father once equated actresses with strippers,'' she says.
``He told me, `No self-respecting woman goes into that profession.'
 &HT;    ``Acting for me is the ultimate in compassion and empathy,'' the
television star says. ``Ultimately you've got to give yourself up.
You've got to lose yourself, step into somebody else's life and
absorb it. I love it.''
 &HT;    Already, there is talk of a second Oscar nomination. Winfrey
smiles, but won't discuss her chances.
 &HT;    ``All awards are is a confirmation that your work mattered as
much to somebody else as it mattered to you,'' she says. ``They
just say, `Yeah, you did OK.' That's what an Oscar would mean to
me.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, Winfrey will continue with her usual routine as
host/executive producer of one of the most popular shows in
television history, balancing the pressures of the business world
with exercise _ she intends to keep her weight down this time _ and
daily meditation.
 &HT;    ``I believe there is a force bigger than myself,'' she says. ``I
call it God. I try to align myself with the force bigger than me
every morning, so I open myself up to the possibilities.''

CIVIL SUIT AGAINST AU PAIR PROCEEDS   IN HER ABSENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Although she returned home to England almost four
months ago, the legal saga of former au pair Louise Woodward
continued in her absence in a Boston courtroom Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after a jury convicted her of killing 8-month-old
Matthew Eappen, US District Judge William G. Young &UR;  &LR; said he will
determine the amount of damages that the child's parents are
entitled to in the wrongful-death suit they filed against Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward has chosen not to contest the suit by Sunil and Deborah
Eappen, which alleges that Woodward is responsible for the fatal
injuries the infant suffered in his Newton home while under her
care. No one appeared in court on Woodward's behalf Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Young has already issued a default against Woodward. Monday he
directed the Eappens' attorney, Frederic L. Ellis, to file a motion
for judgment and an assessment of damages by Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory and
punative damages on the Eappens' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But Young observed Monday that it is unlikely the couple will
collect on any judgment because there is no evidence Woodard has
``assets of any significant size.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of the Woodward family in England have said that she
continues to disclaim any responsibility for the child's death and
abandoned her defense in the civil case only for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to England in June after the Supreme Judicial Court
upheld her manslaughter conviction and 279-day sentence. The
wrongful-death suit was filed hours after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis again emphasized that the Eappens decided to sue Woodward
to prevent her from profiting from the death of their son and the
international publicity surrounding the ensuing trial. He said he
wanted to ensure that Woodward ``is not driving around in a
Rolls-Royce three years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis declined to say whether he has ferreted out any book or
movie deals Woodward may have signed since her release. The Eappens
have said that any award they recover will be donated to a
foundation they have launched to fight child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and her parents have repeatedly insisted that her story
is not for sale. Young already has frozen Woodward's assets in the
United States and enjoined her from spending any money she receives
for her story.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said it is still unclear whether any award would be
collectible in England. But he said having a judge, rather than a
jury, determine damages may cut in his favor; British judges, he
said, may look more favorably on such a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's hearing, the judge denied Ellis's request to take
sworn depositions to help establish Woodward's culpability and set
punative damages. Young said the transcript from Woodward's
criminal trial will give him all the information he needs to
determine the extent of Woodward's culpability.
</P>
<P>
   Young said Ellis is free to take depositions after the judgment
to try and locate Woodward's assets to pay any award.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, a jury convicted Woodward of second-degree
murder and sentenced her to life in prison. But Judge Hiller B.
Zobel reduced her conviction to manslaughter and her sentence to
the time she had already served.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Woodward shook the baby and slammed him against
a hard object, fracturing his skull. The defense said Matthew's
injuries were pre-existing.

JOAN ALLEN: THE ACTRESS'S ACTRESS TAKES A DETOUR TO
`PLEASANTVILLE'

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Joan Allen with William H. Macy in a
scene from ``Pleasantville.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Joan Allen knows about small towns.
 &HT;    ``I grew up in Rochelle, Ill., a city of 8,000 people about 80
miles west of Chicago,'' says Allen, a Tony Award winner and
two-time Oscar nominee. ``My dad worked at a gas station, so like
Opie would visit Andy at the jail, I'd hang out with my dad at the
gas station.
 &HT;    ``It was a quiet, safe way to grow up.''
 &HT;    Now a New Yorker, Allen revisits that Mayberryesque childhood in
her latest film, ``Pleasantville.'' Due in theaters on Oct. 16,
writer/director Gary Ross' film stars Tobey Maguire and Reese
Witherspoon as siblings David and Jennifer _ she a high-school
tramp and he a bored kid who kills time watching repeats of a 1950s
black-and-white sitcom called ``Pleasantville.''
 &HT;    In Pleasantville it never rains, the temperature never deviates
and the ice-cream shop never closes. In fact, nothing ever changes
... until David and Jennifer magically land in the
``Pleasantville'' universe and become the picture-perfect children
of uberparents Betty (Allen) and George Parker (William H. Macy).
 &HT;    The kids infuse Pleasantville with some life and, literally, a
little color.
 &HT;    ``To me, the film is about embracing the multitude of feelings
we as humans possess,'' Allen says, relaxing at Manhattan's Essex
House hotel. ``It's about tolerance and acceptance of who we are as
people.
 &HT;    ``Order and perfection seem nice in theory,'' she says, ``but
they can also be very limiting, and Gary explores all of that quite
beautifully.''
 &HT;    The actress remembers such shows as ``Father Knows Best'' and
``Leave it to Beaver,'' but she resisted mimicking any of the era's
prototypical sitcom moms.
 &HT;    ``When we started, I asked Gary if he wanted me to base Betty on
somebody in particular, like Loretta Young or Donna Reed,'' she
recalls. ``He said, `No, no. We know what those characters are
like. We're going to make our own character, but in the mold of
that '50s sitcom mother.'''
 &HT;    In a way, the story is a coming-of-age tale _ but for the mother
as much as for the children. Exposed to the real world through her
new ``children,'' Betty enjoys a rebirth, discovering her own
sexuality _ which, of course, doesn't exist in the 1950s-television
world _ and gradually herself turning from black-and-white into
color.
 &HT;    ``We tried different degrees of intensity,'' Allen says. ``We
experimented to figure out what was too little and what was too
much. We played with humor, pathos and anger.
 &HT;    ``And it became a pattern,'' she says. ``It always came back to
`We have to keep Betty in mind.' We had to go back to her voice, to
her temperament, until it felt right, until it was Betty.''
 &HT;    Growing up, Allen watched television, but it was televised
movies that captured her.
 &HT;    ``I remember being a teen-ager and stumbling onto Katharine
Hepburn doing `Long Day's Journey into Night' (1962),'' she
recalls. ``I thought, `Oh, my God!'
 &HT;    ``I so loved the material and Hepburn's performance,'' the
actress says. ``I think I already wanted to act by then, but those
`Oh, my God' moments added fuel to my fire.''
 &HT;    Allen acted in several shows in high school, then attended East
Illinois University in Charleston. Still in college, she joined her
friend John Malkovich's Chicago-based Steppenwolf Theater Company,
where she eventually starred in ``Burn This'' and ``Of Mice and
Men,'' among others.
 &HT;    Success did not come overnight, however.
 &HT;    ``I was a secretary for many, many years,'' she says. ``Even
when I was with Steppenwolf I worked as a secretary, because we
hardly got paid anything, certainly not enough to live on.
 &HT;    ``I moved to New York in 1983,'' the actress adds, ``and after
that I made my living solely as an actor.''
 &HT;    Allen won a 1987 Tony for her Broadway debut in ``Burn This,''
and earned another nomination for ``The Heidi Chronicles'' (1989).
Between stage stints, she landed supporting parts in such films as
``Compromising Positions'' (1985), ``Peggy Sue Got Married'' (1986)
and ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' (1988).
 &HT;    ``My film career slowly evolved,'' Allen says. ``I actually
haven't done a play since 1990, and I've done about a film a year
since then.''
 &HT;    That pace suits Allen just fine.
 &HT;    ``I don't get offered every film, and I don't want to do every
film,'' she says. ``I'm pretty selective about what I choose to do,
and I don't think that'll ever change.''
 &HT;    Allen wowed audiences with the heavy-duty triple header of
``Nixon'' (1995), ``The Crucible'' (1996) and ``The Ice Storm''
(1997), securing Oscar nominations for the first two and howls of
protest that she wasn't nominated again for ``Ice Storm.''
 &HT;    She still hasn't won one, however.
 &HT;    ``Losing wasn't painful, but there is a certain amount of `Aw,
gee' after they say the name of the winner,'' she says. ``Everybody
was saying that Lauren Bacall was going to win the year I was
nominated for `Crucible,' so I didn't think I'd win. The one I felt
bad for was Lauren. With `Nixon,' it was disappointing in the
moment, but the party was nice.
 &HT;    ``If I get nominated again,'' she adds, ``after all the work it
takes to get ready, it might be nice to win next time.''
 &HT;    Allen giggles. Yes, it's true _ Joan Allen, so often grim and
tight-lipped onscreen, can actually laugh and smile. In fact, she
does it often.
 &HT;    ``I've gotten to do some truly quality work, but I did sense at
a certain point that I was falling into a serious mode,'' Allen
says. ``That's what attracted me to `Face/Off' (1997).''
 &HT;    In that John Woo actioner, Allen was cast as the wife of police
detective John Travolta and, in a way, terrorist Nicolas Cage. Even
amid the flamboyant fight scenes for which Woo is known, she
brought a surprising credibility to a story which, after all,
involved the surgical exchange of faces.
 &HT;    ``Even though I had a dramatic role, and my action
responsibilities were minimal, to say the least, it was a
completely different type of film,'' the actress says. ``A lot of
people saw `Face/Off,' so it gave me greater visibility.
 &HT;    ``Let's face it, a lot of people never saw `Crucible,' never saw
`Nixon,''' she says. ```Face/Off' appealed to a whole other segment
of the movie-going audience, and I was happy for that.
 &HT;    ``Would it be fun to break out and do a comedy-comedy? Sure,''
she says readily, ``but it would depend on finding a director I
could trust, and on the other cast members involved.''
 &HT;    Allen hasn't worked since completing ``Pleasantville'' a year
ago, and she's in no rush to. She'd rather spend time with her
husband, actor Peter Friedman, and their daughter, Sadie.
 &HT;    ``I waited a long time to have a child,'' Allen says softly,
``and I love her. I'm probably only going to have one child, and I
don't want to miss out on her.''
 &HT;    But there's one upcoming film that Allen is champing at the bit
to make.
 &HT;    ``I'm attached to a film about Veronica Guerin, who was a
hotshot Irish journalist,'' Allen says. ``She wrote about crime
figures in Dublin and the drug trade, and she was fearless.
 &HT;    ``These crime figures warned her that she was pushing too hard
and that harm would come her way if she didn't relent,'' she says.
``But even though she had friends and family she adored, she didn't
relent and she was murdered.
 &HT;    ``If all the pieces fall into place, I'll do that,'' the actress
says, ``because this woman's story so fascinates me. Why would she
throw everything away?''

 IAN McKELLEN TAKES ANOTHER WALK ON THE DARK SIDE  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes a color slide of Ian McKellen in a scene from ``Apt
Pupil.'' 
 By JEAN OPPENHEIMER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There's something about Ian McKellen which seems to draw him to
the dark side of life.
 &HT;    He's played sinister villains on stage _ Salieri in ``Amadeus,''
Iago in ``Othello'' _ and on screen _ Richard III and, in ``Last
Action Hero'' (1993), Death himself.
 &HT;    But his latest villain may be the scariest yet. In ``Apt
Pupil,'' opening Oct. 23, he plays Kurt Dussander, a Nazi war
criminal who has lived quietly _ and unrecognized _ in the United
States for decades. At last he is unmasked by a high-school student
_ but the catch is that the boy doesn't want to turn him in, but
rather to learn details of the Nazi atrocities he'd committed.
 &HT;    Based on a Stephen King novella and directed by Bryan Singer,
who helmed the 1995 thriller ``The Usual Suspects,'' ``Apt Pupil''
is an unusually disturbing _ and powerful _ film.
 &HT;    ``This is a nasty little story, and it will have
reverberations,'' McKellen acknowledges.
 &HT;    The British actor is in Los Angeles to star in a stage
production of Henrik Ibsen's ``An Enemy of the People.'' Dressed
casually, with wire-rimmed glasses framing his expressive blue
eyes, he has the manner of a slightly aloof university professor.
 &HT;    ``The shocks and nastiness didn't affect me,'' McKellen hastens
to add. ``I genuinely didn't know when I was making the film what
it was going to be like. Bryan knew. He was very particular about
what he wanted from the actors, but in terms of how it was going to
cut together and to what effect, I decided to remain indifferent to
that.''
 &HT;    Although he has now seen the completed film twice, McKellen is
reluctant to discuss it, saying only that he believes the film does
have a moral purpose.
 &HT;    ``As filmmakers,'' he adds, ``the only question we need to ask
is to what purpose are we trying to affect people?''
 &HT;    Asked that very question, however, he dodges the issue.
 &HT;    ``I don't think it appropriate for me to answer,'' he says,
``because I didn't write or direct the film.''
 &HT;    No matter how you look at it, ``Apt Pupil'' is difficult to sit
through _ the casual cruelty and brutality on display is horrifying
_ but it's also riveting, with McKellen's aged Nazi the complex
enigma at its core.
 &HT;    It's the latest star turn from an actor who has been dazzling
audiences for nearly 40 years. Born in the industrial north of
England in 1939, McKellen first performed in school plays and then
at Cambridge University, where he majored in English literature. In
lieu of formal training, he spent the next three years touring with
regional theater troupes.
 &HT;    In 1964, his first London appearance earned him an invitation
from Laurence Olivier to join the newly founded National Theatre
Company. McKellen later also worked with the Royal Shakespeare
Company and the Actors Company, which he co-founded in 1972.
 &HT;    On stage, McKellen has shone as Richard II and III, Hamlet,
Macbeth and Iago. He won a Best Actor Tony for his role as Salieri
in the Broadway production of ``Amadeus'' (1981).
 &HT;    Until recently his film career had consisted primarily of fine
performances in small roles in not-very-successful films. In 1995,
however, he scored a coup in ``Richard III,'' which McKellen not
only starred in but also wrote, recasting Shakespeare's historical
drama to set it in an imaginary fascist England, circa 1939.
 &HT;    That outing seems to have caught moviemakers' eyes. Besides
``Apt Pupil,'' McKellen will also be seen this fall in ``Gods and
Monsters,'' a fictionalized drama about James Whale, the troubled,
gay director of ``Frankenstein'' (1931) and ``The Bride of
Frankenstein'' (1935).
 &HT;    A burgeoning film career isn't all good news, because McKellen
has many demands on his time. In the last decade he has devoted
himself to a crusade for gay and lesbian rights in Britain. Since
publicly acknowledging his own homosexuality in 1988, he has been a
leading voice for the gay community, enjoying a stature only
enhanced by his 1991 knighthood.
 &HT;    ``Trying to make the world a better place for lesbians and gays
is as important to me, and as fulfilling and rewarding, as
acting,'' he says. ``I know it has an impact on the world, in a way
that I couldn't honestly say my performance of `Richard III' is
going to do.
 &HT;    ``I know people's lives are changed because I and others have
done certain things _ changed laws, for example. And that feels
more significant to me than anything else I have done.''
 &HT;    McKellen has twice met privately with British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, the Labour party leader whom he considers more
sympathetic to gay issues than Tory predecessors such as John
Major.
 &HT;    ``Compared with John Major,'' the actor says, ``Mr. Blair is an
expert on what troubles gay women and men in Britain, vis a vis the
law, because he has gay friends and because he lived in Islington,
which is one of the gay middle-class centers of London.''
 &HT;    McKellen doesn't expect Blair actually to provide leadership on
gay issues, he adds. Rather, he believes the prime minister is
adept at responding to already-existing movements and trends, such
as the gay movement.
 &HT;    ``He is very much in favor of the integration of everyone _
white, black, gay, foreign,'' McKellen adds with a note of resigned
caution. ``But when you look at the details of it, it's a little
bit sluggish.''
 &HT;    McKellen pauses a moment, and when he continues he sounds almost
wistful.
 &HT;    ``I'm old Labour,'' he says. ``I believe in free education, free
health care and parks, cheap theaters and money spent on the arts.
And the way they all have been funded is disintegrating. It's
difficult for people like me to adjust and to see whether the
amount of good that is being done outweighs what I think are some
of the disadvantages.''
 &HT;    McKellen brightens when the discussion turns to a surprising
interest: his website, which the actor designed and created himself
_ unlike most actors' ``official'' sites, which are the work of
studio flacks or fan clubs.
 &HT;    ``It's a much bigger audience than a book,'' he says
enthusiastically. ``It's really a sort of hobby for me. I can put
programs, photographs and reviews on it, and they are accessible to
anyone who might want to look at them. One day I would like to make
myself write something regularly for it.''
 &HT;    Finding the time to do anything more for the site _ which may be
found at www.mckellen.com _ would be difficult, McKellen
acknowledges, because of his frenetic professional pace. Even his
personal life takes a back seat, he says, which probably explains
his lack of any long-term romantic relationships in recent years.
 &HT;    ``I am trying to be more open to meeting people,'' he says. ``I
need to give more attention to things which have nothing to do with
my career.''
 &HT;    But for now, he's doing so more in theory than in practice. Even
after two years of nonstop stage and screen work, the actor isn't
taking any time off.
 &HT;    ``I know I should be sitting back and taking some time and
enjoying,'' he says. ``But, instead, I'm off to Leeds with a small
company of 10 actors and we are doing three plays, one right after
the other.''
 &HT;    The world on the other side of the footlights will, it seems,
have to wait.

 Includes a color slide of Michael Boatman in a scene from ``Spin
City.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The climb to stardom demands sacrifices from everybody who
dreams of it. Some sacrifice their illusions, some their families,
some their integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Boatman sacrificed his hair.
</P>
<P>
   Like Yul Brynner, who shaved his head for his career-defining
role in ``The King and I,'' ``Spin City's'' Carter Heywood is
instantly identifiable by his polished pate. But Boatman insists
that he had nothing of the kind in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I ended up shaving my head had nothing to do with
`Spin City,''' he says. ``Actually, I did it to land a movie
audition I wanted. The producers wouldn't see me, because they were
familiar with my work and liked me but thought I had the wrong
look. So I said to myself, `I'll give them a look.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get the job,'' he adds, ``but then `Spin City' came
up one week later and my hair hadn't grown back yet. And since it
kind of worked for the character, I stuck with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges of the role extend well beyond the barber's
chair. As special assistant for minority affairs in New York's
highly dysfunctional mayor's office, Carter represents prime time's
first stab at a gay, African-American character.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Boatman has both the grace and the talent to
sidestep the stereotypical risks of a double-minority role and
concentrate instead on Carter's overall complexity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What initially attracted me to the role,'' he says, ``was that
here was a complicated, funny, somewhat neurotic, gay,
African-American activist in New York City. I mean, my God, the
whole package was just so interesting, and the potential was just
sort of limitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I knew that people were going to focus on the gay
aspect of it,'' he says. ``But there's so much more to Carter than
just that, and I think that's due to our great writers. They were
interested in creating a really believable group of characters _
people who, just like in real life, are defined by much more than
whatever their sexual orientation might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most powerful statements that people have made to me about
Carter are always along the lines of, `Well, he's definitely not
what I would think or what I would expect.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of his colleagues _ including Mayor Randall Winston
(Barry Bostwick), Assistant Mayor Mike Flaherty (Michael J. Fox)
and homophobic housemate Stuart (Alan Ruck) _ Carter remains
perpetually unlucky in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it this way,'' Boatman says. ``We're all very
driven people in our work. We're all very successful. But I do
believe we're all completely socially retarded. I think the writers
stumbled upon that theme because they found success in it with
regard to Mike's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's that way,'' the actor adds. ``I've heard a
couple of critics say, `Well, why can't Carter have a substantial
positive, healthy relationship with a gay man?' But there's nothing
funny in that. I mean, it gets boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the only gay, and only African-American, character
on the show to have a nobly sort-of-healthy relationship would have
been a real dead end,'' he says. ``On American television, whenever
there's a minority character, they're so afraid of offending
whatever minority that person represents that they take all the fun
out of it. They take all the humanity away.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I like delving into a flawed guy like Carter, because it's
not something you get to see very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Spin City'' isn't the only opportunity Boatman has
to explore character flaws. During his summer break, he transported
his family from New York to Los Angeles so that he could continue
his recurring role as uptight _ and decidedly straight _ business
manager Stanley Babson on the hit HBO sports-agency sitcom,
``Arli$$.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a decade of theatrical training has, he says, made it
relatively easy for him to shift from one character to another,
Boatman admits to occasional crossed wires.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `Arli$$,' I sometimes find myself doing Carter things, and
I have to stop that,'' he says. ``I've made very specific choices
about both characters with regard to their kicks and nuances and
odd behaviors. But every once in a while I'll do something as
Stanley that I know works for the scene and is going to be funny,
and then think, `Oh, God, that was a Carter thing!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Though it's probably apples and oranges to people watching,''
Boatman adds, ``to me it's kind of tricky, because what I love as
an actor is trying to be as different as I possibly can from role
to role.''
</P>
<P>
   These days crossovers between series are all the rage _ even
shows on different networks can cross over. The worlds of ``Spin
City'' and ``Arli$$'' aren't so different that, say, a campaign to
build a new stadium might bring Boatman's two worlds into
conjunction.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question: Assuming digital magic made it
possible for them to meet, would Carter and Stanley get along?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Boatman says. ``Carter is a
dyed-in-the-wool liberal who's a great believer in the
liberal-slash-Democratic agenda. Stanley is an absolutely robotic
Republican, faithful to the party and its views to the very end.
That alone would be enough to keep them very far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Concurrent success as both Carter and Stanley notwithstanding,
Boatman cites neither as his most significant achievement. Instead,
he points with fatherly pride to his 2-year-old daughter, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Since Boatman originally hails from Chicago and plays a key role
in a sports-themed sitcom, it seems impossible that it could be
sheer coincidence that his first child shares her name with a
certain high-profile basketball star from the Windy City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a slight coincidence,'' he admits, ``but it's not
what you think. I once knew a woman in acting class in Chicago
whose name was Jordan. There was no dating or anything like that _
I just knew her from class and liked the name. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, everybody says, `You're from Chicago, you must love
Michael Jordan,' and everybody assumes that I'm a big basketball
fan,'' Boatman adds. ``In actual fact, I couldn't possibly be more
inept on a basketball court.''

DAVID WELLS: DECEIVING LOOKS, DECEIVING PITCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He looks more like a Thursday night softball pitcher
with one eye on the ball and the other on the neighborhood tavern.
</P>
<P>
   Overweight, his shirt unbuttoned at the top and sometimes
untucked at the bottom, David Wells looks more like a child of
bikers (which he is) and devotee of Metallica and the Who (which he
also is) than a white-hot major league pitcher for the dreaded,
tradition-empowered Yankees (which he also is).
</P>
<P>
   Appearances in this case not only are deceiving, they are dead
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Wells delivered a gem in Game 1 of the American League Division
Series, shutting out the mighty Texas Rangers for eight innings
with his oddball assortment of pitches, speeds, and locations on
the way to a 2-0 victory. It was the latest of many vintage
performances from the 35-year-old lefthander, who, in his second
year in pinstripes, may finally have found a home after 10 years
and four previous big league stops.
</P>
<P>
   He may be goofy, different, emotional, wild. Hey, he's a lefty.
His nickname is ``Boomer.'' In New York this season, he has been
all of the above while also becoming the 14th man to pitch a
perfect game (May 17), retiring 33 straight hitters, and starting
the All-Star Game in Colorado. For the season, he was 18-4 with a
3.49 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said a lot of things about David Wells the last couple
years,'' said manager Joe Torre, cracking a sly smile. ``The
difference in him this year from last year is that when he doesn't
have his best stuff or when he is running out of gas, he is still a
battler. He finds a way. I didn't see that last year. It's a
180-degree turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Wells will start Game 1 of the American League Championship
Series tonight against the Cleveland Indians here. That's just the
way he wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the opportunity to succeed and fail,'' Wells said. ``I
think it makes an individual stronger. Some people can't handle the
pressure. I want it. I can relate to it. I want to be that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells and New York seem like such an obvious match that it's a
wonder it took him so long to get here. In the previous three
years, he had been on four teams (New York, Baltimore, Detroit,
Cincinnati) after spending the early years of his career in
Toronto. His numbers were never gaudy, and there were always doubts
about his, er, commitment to fitness, shall we say? Prior to this
season, his career won-lost record was 106-85.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays simply released him after the 1992 season. Detroit
waited until two days before the start of the 1993 season before
signing him as a free agent, then traded him to the Reds the next
year, a move to bolster Cincinnati's postseason chances. The Reds
traded him to Baltimore, where he spent one year (1996) and beat
the Yankees in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   New York signed him to a three-year deal before the 1997 season.
The Yankees got a decent season (16-10) from him last year, but how
many were prepared for what he submitted this season? Until Roger
Clemens blew away the field, Wells was one of the leading
candidates for the Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to the Stadium every day, for me, it's unbelievable, an
honor,'' said Wells, a baseball history buff. ``To play here, with
all those great performances before, well, I have to try and take
it in stride. There are a lot of legends here. A lot of heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Yankees are playing not only against the Red Sox, but
also against those heroes. Wells's achievements were only a part of
their fabulous 114-win season, which also saw Bernie Williams win
the batting title. But, entering the postseason, the players knew
that nothing less than a world title would suffice; otherwise, the
regular season would be rendered moot.
</P>
<P>
   Torre had plenty of time to set up his playoff pitching
rotation. He could have gone with veteran David Cone, a 20-game
winner, to open the series. He could have turned to 1996 hero Andy
Pettitte. He didn't. He went with Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have twice as much faith in him this year,'' Torre said.
``He's a much, much tougher pitcher. He always had good stuff, but
he sometimes would get frustrated and lose his energy. This year
that energy is devoted to getting through.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells has done that and more. Given the opponent and the
situation, his Game 1 performance ranked up there with his best
outings of the year. It's all falling into place for him now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I wanted to be my whole life,'' he said. ``Now
that I have the opportunity, I want to give it my best.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting otherwise.

SERBIAN FORCES REPORTED STILL ATTACKING KOSOVO ALBANIANS, DESPITE
U.N. BAN
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In a tough report that was welcomed by the
United States, Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Monday that
Serbian security forces are continuing to carry out punitive
operations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo Province as part of a
campaign of ``terror and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan acknowledged that he had no officials of his own to
monitor the fighting in Kosovo and verify the level of compliance
by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia with the Security
Council's demands that he stop the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But drawing on accounts from the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, diplomats in the region and the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, the secretary-general produced a report
that was unequivocal in its conclusions, bolstering assessments
made by NATO and American officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am outraged by reports of mass killings of civilians in
Kosovo, which recall the atrocities committed in Bosnia and
Herzegovina,'' Annan wrote in his report, referring to
Serbian-backed campaigns against Bosnian Muslims and others several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   American and NATO officials said Monday that despite some
withdrawals, the Yugoslav army still had substantial forces in
Kosovo. A senior NATO official estimated that four to five brigades
remained.
</P>
<P>
   There was also evidence, officials said, that the Yugoslav armed
forces had for the first time begun to disperse its air defenses,
including surface-to-air missile batteries, throughout Kosovo and
Serbia. This is a defensive measure, signaling that Milosevic now
believes that NATO strikes are at least a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, said
Monday that it was clear that Milosevic had failed to respond
adequately to Security Council demands, and that NATO was ready to
act if he did not comply. American officials traveling to the
Middle East with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday
that NATO may meet as early as Thursday to decide whether to
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said he had not yet read the secretary-general's report,
which was made public Monday morning. But he added that it seemed
obvious that the Yugoslavs had not pulled back as demanded on Sept.
23 in a Security Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's report will solidify that opinion, American officials
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Monday that the secretary-general's report laid
out starkly ``the appalling atrocities committed in Kosovo,'' and
left no doubt that Milosevic's security forces were to blame for
most of them.
</P>
<P>
   While saying that abuses had also been committed by the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting for Kosovo's
independence, Annan said that ``it is clear beyond any reasonable
doubt that the majority of such acts have been committed by the
security forces in Kosovo acting under the authority of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is expected to begin discussions of Annan's
report on Tuesday or possibly Wednesday, but it is under no
compulsion to act. There is also disagreement among council members
_ and within governments _ about how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, which reads like an indictment, Annan catalogued
the hallmarks of the Serbs' drive against the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, which he called ``a collective punishment to teach them
that the price of supporting the Kosovo Albanian paramilitary units
is too high and will be even higher in the future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The Serbian security forces have demanded the surrender of
weapons and have been reported to use terror and violence against
civilians to force people to flee their homes or the place where
they had sought refuge, under the guise of separating them from
fighters of the Kosovo Albanian paramilitary units,'' Annan wrote.
``The tactics include shelling, detentions and threats to life, and
finally short-notice demands to leave or face the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been disruptions in electricity and other
services,'' he added, ``and empty dwellings have been burned and
looted, abandoned farm vehicles have been destroyed and farm
animals have been burned in their barns or shot in the fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan said he was concerned about the appearance of Serbian-laid
land mines in new areas, noting that they were no longer confined
to Kosovo's borders with Albania and Macedonia. This development,
he said, was making it more difficult for people to move around
safely and for relief goods to be delivered.
</P>
<P>
   He said that refugee officials put the number of displaced
people at about 280,000, putting strains on families and food
supplies within Kosovo and in neighboring regions and countries.
</P>
<P>
   The council resolution of Sept. 23, which called on Milosevic to
stop attacks on civilians and allow refugees to return to their
homes, was passed under a provision in the U.N. Charter that allows
it to be enforced militarily.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, Russia has made it clear that it will not
support the use of NATO military power in Kosovo, which would
probably begin with air strikes and later involve the stationing of
ground troops to monitor a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, including the United States, believe that NATO
already has the authority to strike, and that returning to the
council for a more explicit resolution would only risk a Russian
veto. Other nations want clearer Security Council backing for
attacks. Diplomats say that the French still seem to be debating
this among themselves, with conflicting signals coming from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Boris Yeltsin of Russia spoke by telephone
for 25 minutes with Annan about Kosovo. Although U.N. officials did
not provide details, the talks were reported from Moscow to include
a report on a high-level delegation that Yeltsin sent to Belgrade
on Sunday to speak with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   That delegation, led by Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov,
and Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, told top Yugoslav defense
officials that air strikes would be a reality if ``decisive
measures'' were not taken, according to to a report from the
ITAR-Tass news agency. Yeltsin said in Moscow on Monday that his
delegation had persuaded Milosevic to allow monitors from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to visit
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's report left the impression that the United Nations was
not convinced that the much-publicized pullouts of Yugoslav troops
could be taken at face value.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general had also been given those assurances
earlier by Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic. On
Sept. 29, Annan recalled in his report, Jovanovic ``assured me that
troops were returning to the places of their permanent location.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that assurance and reports in recent days of more
withdrawals, Annan said, ``the secretariat is still receiving
information that the government's armed presence remains
significant and that operations of the special police continue.''

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WEIGHS VOTE ON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A deeply divided House Judiciary Committee prepared
late Monday to authorize an impeachment inquiry against President
Clinton for lying and obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution authorizing the inquiry would have to approved by
the full House, possibly later this week. It will be the third time
in U.S. history that the House has considered impeachment
proceedings against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution supported by Republicans, who dominate the
committee 21-16, contains no limits on the time or subject of the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   During a day-long marathon hearing, Republicans argued that as
commander in chief, President Clinton must be held to the highest
standards in terms of his personal conduct and adherence to the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly reminded how weary America is of this whole
situation and I daresay most of us share that weariness,'' said
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. Nevertheless, he
added, ``it is imperative we be able to look back at this episode
with dignity and pride, knowing we have performed our duty in the
best interest of the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that Clinton's effort to hide his sexual
relationship with Lewinsky was evidence of nothing more than a man
covering the tracks of a personal indiscretion, hardly the stuff of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Watergate, it's an extramarital affair,'' said the
committee's senior Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan. Conyers
is the only committee member who was on the panel the last time it
authorized an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's vote that day, Jan. 31, 1974, set in motion
impeachment hearings on the Watergate scandal that preceded the
resignation of President Richard Nixon seven months later. More
than 100 years before that, the House voted to impeach President
Andrew Johnson. The Senate in 1868 fell one vote shy of removing
Johnson from office.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Republicans turned back two alternative Democratic
resolutions. The first would have set a deadline of Nov. 25 for the
inquiry unless the House granted an extension, and would have
required the committee to hold hearings on the Constitution's
standards for impeachment before determining whether any of
Clinton's actions are impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   The second would have declared the Sept. 11 report of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair to
be fact. Then the committee could focus on whether the Starr report
_ the basis for the impeachment inquiry _ is sufficient grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the committee Republicans' top investigator, David
Schippers, set out 15 instances in which Clinton's conduct in the
Lewinsky matter ``may constitute grounds to proceed with an
impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   They covered most of the now-familiar elements of the affair as
documented in Starr's report to Congress, as well as the thousands
of pages of grand jury transcripts and documents the committee
released in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges in the Schippers report: Clinton lied under
oath during his January deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit, and his August grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The report also accuses Clinton of conspiring with Lewinsky to
concoct a ``cover story'' to conceal their relationship, hiding
gifts to Lewinsky, and helping her find a job in New York in
exchange for silence.
</P>
<P>
   But Schippers dropped two of the 11 grounds for impeachment
cited by Starr in his Sept. 11 referral. Starr had accused Clinton
of abusing his constitutional authority and obstructing justice by
refusing to testify before the grand jury for seven months and
lying to White House aides, who repeated his false statements.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the committee's Democrats, Abbe Lowell, countered
that a ``laundry list'' of laws Clinton may have broken is
insufficient for the Constitution's impeachment standard of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all offenses are `high crimes and misdemeanors,' and not
all `high crimes and misdemeanors' come from criminal conduct,'' he
said, quoting founding father George Mason as saying impeachment is
for ``great and dangerous offenses to subvert the Constitution,''
and Alexander Hamilton: Impeachment remedies ``injuries done
immediately to the society itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's misstatements in the Jones deposition about his
relationship with Lewinsky were irrelevant because the federal
judge in that case, Susan Webber Wright, ruled in January that the
Clinton-Lewinsky relationship was ``not essential'' to resolving
the Jones case, Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   And Starr's report did not include Lewinsky's statement that
``no one asked me to lie, and I was never promised a job for my
silence,'' Lowell added.
</P>
<P>
   As the hearing opened, Republicans focused their attack on
perjury charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president serves as a role model for us and our
children,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. ``He influences the
lives of millions of Americans ... Actions do have consequences;
the difference between right and wrong still exists; and honesty
always counts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to former White House Counsel John Dean's
statement to Nixon during Watergate that a ``cancer'' was growing
on the presidency, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said the nation is
``witnessing nothing less than the symptoms of a cancer on the
presidency. If we fail to remove this cancer, it will expand and
destroy the principles that matter most to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats concentrated their fire on Starr and their view that
impeachment is only for serious misdeeds that threaten the nation's
political fabric, not a president's indiscretion with a young White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had an affair,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,
D-Fla., his voice rising in emotion to a shout. ``He lied about it.
He didn't want anyone to know about it. Does anyone reasonably
believe that this amounts to a subversion of government? Does
anyone reasonably believe that this is what the Founding Fathers
were talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler called Starr's four-year probe of Clinton that culminated
in the Lewinsky report a ``politically inspired witch-hunt that
rivals McCarthyism in its sinister purpose.''

FINANCE OFFICIALS SAY CRISIS   PLAN WILL WORK _ IN TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Finance officials from 22 countries gathered Monday
to discuss ways to prevent future global financial crises, while
trying to assure investors that they also have a credible plan to
revive the economy from its current slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are doing important work, perhaps the most important work
the world can be doing at this moment in history,'' President
Clinton told the so-called Group of 22 industrial and emerging
nations, gathered at the Sheraton Luxury Collection Hotel. ``The
institutional reforms that flow from this work will shape the
global financial system for the next half-century.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Treasury Department called six months ago for the
meeting, which includes officials from the Group of Seven major
industrial nations, or G-7, and from 15 emerging market countries.
Their goal is to find ways that governments, private companies and
agencies can work better to prevent future crises.
</P>
<P>
   But fears that a G-7 meeting Saturday yielded no solid solution
to the current downturn helped push the Dow Jones industrial
average down 233 points Monday, though the index recovered to close
at 7726, down 58 points.
</P>
<P>
   In separate press conferences, finance ministers asserted that
the G-7 had made significant steps toward ending the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot expect us to pull rabbits (from a hat) that dazzle
us with their white fur and settle the situation overnight,'' said
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, finance minister for France. Strauss-Kahn
also said finance officials are contending with the fact that some
investors are ``no longer rational'' in selling off stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House briefing, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said the G-7 had agreed that the major industrial nations
should be more concerned with growth than inflation, a signal that
each country's bias should be toward lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   He said the group also agreed to ``explore'' President Clinton's
proposal to establish a new line of credit, using no new funds, at
the International Monetary Fund to help nations before they run
into financial crises. Currently, the IMF generally makes loans
once a country is already in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting of 22 nations was called to consider reports from
three ``working groups'' on changes to global investment rules and
to international agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The reports, which will be revised and presented to heads of
state by the beginning of next year, call for better
``transparency,'' or stronger international standards for financial
accounting and disclosure that give investors better information
about what countries and companies are running into financial
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transparency will not prevent more financial crises, nor
</P>
<P>
   will it resolve crises. . . But greater transparency can help
reduce the frequency of crises and can also reduce the severity of
crises by minimizing the scale of surprises that hit the markets,''
said Mervyn King, deputy governor of the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
   The group also called for countries to disclose more data on
their banking systems and foreign exchange reserves. Its report
noted that while Thailand said it had $32 billion in reserves in
July 1997, it also had claims on those reserves of $29 billion.
South Korea reported gross reserves of $24 billion at the end of
November 1997, but almost two-thirds of that had been deposited in
overseas branches of Korean banks to assist them in meeting their
debt payments.
</P>
<P>
   Had those countries reported their reserves more accurately,
they might have been forced to make better policy decisions that
would have prevented problems later on, one report said.
</P>
<P>
   The working groups also called for a study of how to compile and
publish data on the international exposures of investment banks,
hedge funds and other institutional investors.

 &HT;    For N.C. State's Holt, consistency matters most
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Torry Holt may be the best wide receiver in college
football this year, as well as a splendid punt returner and a
Heisman Trophy candidate. But one thing he's apparently not good at
is remembering names.
</P>
<P>
   After North Carolina State upset Syracuse last week, Holt was
asked to assess new placekicker Dan Deskevich, a walk-on who hit
four extra points and a field goal in a 38-17 rout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' Holt blurted out, then covered his mouth to hide an
embarrassed grin.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to more familiar foes, Holt is equally
non-specific. Since ripping through Florida State for three
touchdowns in a stunning upset of the Seminoles last month, he has
been queried repeatedly whether he thinks anybody can cover him
one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there is,'' Holt said. ``I'd love to go against
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it's unlikely N.C. State will meet Georgia and Champ
Bailey in a bowl game, and he's already proven himself against Dre'
Bly of North Carolina and Virginia's Anthony Poindexter, Holt may
not get the chance until he gets to the NFL. For the 23rd-ranked
Wolfpack, maintaining consistency has never been more important.
</P>
<P>
   Like Georgia Tech, which comes to Carter-Finley Stadium on
Saturday, N.C. State is hitting a mid-season stretch that could
sort out its bowl ambitions. Its last post-season game was a win
over Mississippi State in the 1994 Peach Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The week after beating FSU, N.C. State traveled to Baylor, fell
behind 26-0 and scrambled back only to lose 33-30 as a game-tying
field goal attempt was blocked in the dying seconds. The Wolfpack
also had to rally to defeat Ohio University in their season opener,
finally surging ahead after blocking a punt and returning it for a
touchdown in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is. If I knew, it wouldn't have
happened,'' Holt said of the inconsistency. ``At Baylor, we weren't
as hungry as we were against Florida State and Syracuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack is a mystifying team in other ways. Until breaking
out for 226 yards against Syracuse, their rushing game was
non-existent. A rebuilt secondary, dubbed the ``Rough Riders,''
leads the country with 12 interceptions, but the defense is one of
the poorest against the run in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the real team,'' head coach Mike O'Cain said
after the Syracuse game. ``We don't have a tremendously talented
team, so we have to beat people with emotion. We have to make sure
we do that every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt has been the electrifying constant. He racked up 225
receiving yards at Baylor to set a school single-game record, and
against Syracuse became N.C. State's all-time receiving leader with
2,369 yards. His speed is too much to handle in single coverage,
but he exploits zones with ease. Syracuse dropped back to avoid the
long bomb, but was repeatedly burned as Holt sliced and faked his
way past several layers of defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Against Syracuse, however, it was quarterback Jamie Barnette who
did the most damage, throwing for 282 yards and two touchdowns and
running the option stylishly, easily outshining Donovan McNabb with
85 yards rushing to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier for me when we have a lot of guys making
plays,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   The maturity of Barnette, thought to be too small at 5-foot-11
to be a good ACC quarterback, has been a critical development.
Tossed into the fray two years ago as a raw redshirt freshman, he
has molded himself into a near mirror-image of Georgia Tech's Joe
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie never ceases to amaze me,'' O'Cain said. ``He always
keeps his options open, and makes the plays when you need them.
Torry's the game-breaker, but Jamie keeps it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is what the Wolfpack need most as they head into the meat
of their ACC order. After playing at Duke next week, they travel to
Virginia and Clemson before October is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I really believe we're on the right path,`` Holt said.
``We just have to continue doing what we've been doing.''

 &HT;    Does impact of libertarians invite equal time?
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anyone planning a major political forum in Georgia
this fall has had to deal with the Bert and Jack question.
</P>
<P>
   Should Bert Loftman and Jack Cashin, the Libertarian Party's
candidates for senator and governor, be included on the stage with
their more advantaged Republican and Democratic rivals, or do they
just get in the way of voters trying to chose between the
candidates with realistic chances?
</P>
<P>
   The impact they've had on Georgia politics in this decade _
throwing the 1992 U.S. Senate race into a runoff and prompting
Democrats in the Legislature to dump the old majority requirement
in federal general elections _ makes a persuasive argument that the
Libertarians shouldn't be shut out. On the other hand, there's only
a limited amount of time in these debates and they can chew up lots
of it.
</P>
<P>
   And they are getting better at it. Loftman inserted himself so
forcefully in Sunday night's Senate debate on an Atlanta public
television broadcasting channel that Democrat Michael Coles asked
him the key question _ about whether patients should have the right
to sue their HMOs or insurance companies _ that he should have
asked Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame that on the Libertarian, however.
</P>
<P>
   Coles brought the people featured in his recent commercials
about HMO abuses to the studio, and seemed to be setting this up as
a debate in which he'd attempt to paint Coverdell as the Senator
from Insurance. But then the self-made businessman meandered into
less vital arguments with Coverdell over his votes on PeachCare and
veterans benefits. He even took the bait and prolonged another full
airing of the regrettable drug test dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell proved to be a much more formidable debater than he
was when he faced incumbent Democrat Wyche Fowler in 1992. Six
years in the Senate has given him a more confident delivery, and he
still has his old canniness, as he showed when he declined to ask
Coles a question and further diminished the Democrat's air time.
</P>
<P>
   If Loftman hadn't been there Coles and Coverdell would have been
able to talk more, but that doesn't mean they would have said as
much.
</P>
<P>
   Loftman may not have had all the right answers, but he asked a
lot of the right questions. He forced the Democratic and Republican
candidates to talk about ideas, pushing them out of the rigid you
did-I didn't box that so many debates have become.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody sees today's political ads, Loftman says, and most who
could don't vote. He argues that limiting public debates only to
Democrats and Republicans simply deepens the alienation many voters
feel.
</P>
<P>
   In this month when the quality of the nation's political
dialogue appears destined to reach an all-time low, there's
something bracing about a candidate who'll stand up and advocate
the repeal of the 16th Amendment. Whether that's good idea or not,
it helps to create the sort of political debate you could let your
kids listen to.

 &HT;    Yankee's newest hero just may be the real dea
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees have just eliminated the Texas Rangers in
three games, and the New York clubhouse stinks of champagne. Many
players are spraying bubbly at a teammate, who takes the dousing
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer, a sticky mess from head to toe, is having the
time of his 26-year life. In the series with Texas, the rookie who
spent nine years in the minor leagues blasted two homers,
accounting for four of the club's nine runs, to continue his
stranger-than-fiction story.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Mantle and the Babe. New York's new player to toast is
more like Roy Hobbs, who shattered light towers with homers in
``The Natural,'' or Joe Hardy, who exchanged his soul for a shot at
stardom in ``Damn Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 years, I don't think I've ever seen anything like
that,'' longtime Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Yankees manager Joe Torre: ``He doesn't ever seem to get
fazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was not called up from the minors for good until
September. He proceeded to hit eight homers, including three grand
slams, in the last 10 days of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates said, ``I'll tell you what, he
doesn't get cheated. He knows what that piece of wood is made for,
and it's not for cleaning his teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball lore is filled with flukes. In 1957, Bob (Hurricane)
Hazle came up late in the season for the Milwaukee Braves, hit .403
with seven home runs in 41 games and played in the World Series.
But he appeared in only 63 more major league games.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer does not put himself in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you were to ask anyone who has played with me, they
would say I am for real,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Braves scout Bill Lajoie, the right-hand man for Atlanta general
manager John Schuerholz, agrees. ``If you ask me, he looks like he
may be for real,'' he said. ``When I first saw him, he could hit
the heck out of pitches in on the belt buckle and not much else.
But now I'm seeing him hitting balls out off the plate, going the
other way, and basically showing he has a pretty good idea up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players require several seasons to develop. (Example: Sammy
Sosa.)
</P>
<P>
   But even the late bloomers usually do not take nine years to get
to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't just get this all handed to me,'' Spencer said. ``I
worked my butt off to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer was not considered much as a prospect because, while he
had the ability to hit, he is slow and has a below-average arm.
</P>
<P>
   He signed with the Yankees in 1990 as a 28th-round pick out of
El Cajon (Calif.) who passed up a college football scholarship to
Utah and Montana and took a $25,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't help himself early in his career when, at a minor
league spring training camp, he was laughing on the field when
Steinbrenner walked up behind him and asked him what was so funny.
Spencer froze, which pretty much described his career at the time.
He hit just three homers in his first 618 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1995 season, general manager Gene Michaels met with
Spencer and gave him an ultimatum. It was either start producing or
go elsewhere. Spencer got the message.
</P>
<P>
   During his sixth straight year at Class A, he learned how to hit
more than just the fastball, got stronger and extended his swing.
The result was a .300 average with 16 homers and 88 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The organization started to notice and promoted him to Class AA
in 1996, where he hit 29 homers. Last year, he drilled 30 homers
for the Yankees' Class AAA team in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer again began this season at Columbus, but when Chili
Davis was hurt he got his first taste of the majors. He was
recalled and sent down three times before arriving in September to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas series began with Spencer on the bench as Chad Curtis
started. He got the start in Game 2 and put the Yankees ahead with
a solo homer.
</P>
<P>
   Then he put away the clinching game with a three-run homer in
the sixth inning. The ball didn't shatter lights, as Hobbs' did,
but Spencer still made headlines in the New York tabloids. One
summed up the game as a ``Shane-Saw Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just grinning when he runs around the bases,'' Yankees
right fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``It's fun to see, especially for
a guy who's paid his dues in the minor leagues. You need stories
like that in baseball.''

 &HT;    PSC expected to allow 19 companies to market natural gas
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today, Georgia's Public Service Commission is expected
to give the green light to 19 companies to immediately begin
selling natural gas to 1.4 million Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC is expected to follow a staff recommendation that all
the marketers' applications be approved, said spokesman Shawn
Davis. Conditions, however, may be added to some of the
certifications.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers will be permitted to start quoting prices and
making deals as soon as the commission acts at a morning meeting.
But TV ads planned by most major players do not begin until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is also expected to approve a multimillion-dollar
promotional campaign planned by Atlanta Gas Light Co. that is
intended to educate consumers about deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   The company wants to spend $12.3 million over two years and bill
ratepayers over a five-year period at a cost of $8.80 for each
residential and small-business customer, or $1.76 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1997 law, Atlanta Gas Light will become a distribution
company responsible only for delivering gas to consumers over its
pipeline system. Marketers will take over the sale of the commodity
to AGL's 1.4 million customers at deregulated prices.
</P>
<P>
   In order for consumers to begin receiving gas when deregulation
begins Nov. 1, they will have to sign up with a marketing company
by Oct. 25.
</P>
<P>
   But it could take a year or more for deregulation to be fully
phased in. Consumers who do not choose a marketing company will be
assigned one at random by the PSC.
</P>
<P>
   A total 28 companies initially applied for certification to sell
gas. But nine withdrew their applications, including Houston-based
Enron Corp. and San Francisco-based PG&AMP;E, both major players in
national energy markets.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to receive approval today is the marketing
subsidiary of AGL Resources Inc., parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co.,
and affiliates of Shell Oil Co., South Carolina-based SCANA Energy,
Duke Energy, Florida Power &AMP; Light, Columbia Energy of Ohio and two
Georgia-based companies, Optimum Energy Sources and PS Energy
Group.

 &HT;    High court rules against Alltel in overcharge case
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The state's highest court has ruled Alltel must lower
rates to make up for about $50 million in overcharges, but Alltel
maintains the battle is not over.
</P>
<P>
   In a 4-3 decision announced Monday, the court endorsed the
Public Service Commission ruling, which had decided the rates
charged to Georgia customers by the Little Rock-based company in
1996 were excessive by about $24 million a year. The PSC ordered
the company cut rates, and the company filed suit to overturn that
order.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's Supreme Court decision apparently requires Alltel to
cut its access fees, which are charges paid by long-distance
companies. Those reductions are supposed to be passed on to
customers. Alltel has 446,000 local telephone customers in Georgia
_ most of them rural.
</P>
<P>
   But the company believes it is ``questionable'' whether those
customers would see rate reductions, arguing long-distance
companies are not compelled to trim their rates, said Skip Frantz,
Alltel executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Phone company rates in Georgia have typically been overseen by
the PSC, which would permit a set profit. But 1995 changes in the
law allowed companies to shift to new rules that allow greater
flexibility in how rates are set. When Alltel filed for the right
to change, the PSC investigated and found its earnings excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel argued the PSC lost its authority to investigate its
rates the moment the company's request was filed for operating
under the new rules. The PSC argued it had 30 days to take a look.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled the PSC was right, upholding a previous
decision by the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel has filed a motion asking the Supreme Court to reconsider
the issue and reverse itself. ``This was a very narrowly decided
opinion, with a strong dissent,'' Frantz said. But should the court
reject that motion, the case would return to Fulton County Superior
Court, where the suit began. Alltel believes it can still prevail
by arguing other issues on which the justices did not rule, Frantz
said.
</P>
<P>
   PSC spokesman Shawn Davis said a reversal at the lower court is
unlikely. ``I think the primary issues have been decided by the
Supreme Court.''

 &HT;    Barr on Clinton investigation: 'A cancer on the presidency'
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Georgia Republican Bob Barr stayed true to his
feisty form Monday as one of President Clinton's most outspoken
critics. As the House Judiciary Committee contemplated whether to
begin an impeachment inquiry, Barr sounded like someone ready for a
final vote on the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing nothing less than the symptoms of a cancer
on the American presidency,'' Barr said, adapting a memorable
phrase from Watergate on a day rife with comparisons to that
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's colleagues in both parties warned against judging Clinton
prematurely, lest the American public reject the process as overly
partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, the 49-year-old former federal prosecutor, assumed as fact
several pieces of information that are very much in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with Paula Jones's claim that Clinton harassed her
sexually when he was governor of Arkansas, Barr offered a summation
of the case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton, first as governor and then as president, using
power entrusted to him, coarsely demanded personal favors from
individual citizens,'' he said. ``Yet instead of apologizing, Bill
Clinton continued to abuse his office to smear that citizen's name
and block her access to justice. Instead of telling the truth to
the court and a grand jury, the president lied. Instead of
cooperating with the court, he obstructed its efforts. At this very
moment, government and private employees are working under his
direct orders to block this committee's effort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The graphic nature of Starr's report was unavoidable, Barr said,
because of Clinton's ``sorry attempt to deny reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27th speaker on a momentous morning, Barr infused his talk
with dire references to the future of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to destroy one life or billions,'' Barr
said of Clinton and his role as commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Barr said, ``If we fail to address such
charges, we will soon be left standing dazed and befuddled among
the smoldering ruins of a great democracy,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   He also invited any Clinton defenders who would argue the
president's behavior does not matter to ``summon up whatever
tattered remains of honor they have left,'' and leave the room.
</P>
<P>
   No one took him up on that.

 &HT;    Wolf Camera to buy chain in Colorado
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The buying spree continues for Wolf Camera, which said
it will acquire Waxman Camera, a 16-store specialty photo chain in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes just weeks after Wolf closed its purchase
of Eastman Kodak's 449-store Fox Photo chain and is the latest in a
string of acquisitions that has increased the company's store base
150 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed for the purchase, which more than
doubles Wolf's presence in Colorado and advances the retailer's
strategy of acquiring well-established independent photo dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waxman is to the Denver and Boulder area what Wolf is to
Atlanta,'' said Wayne Freedman, senior vice president of marketing
for Wolf, which has its corporate offices in Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is closing in on Beltsville, Md.-based Ritz Camera, the
country's largest photo retailer with 810 stores. With Waxman, Wolf
will have 766 stores in 34 states. Wolf began the year with 300
stores.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of the largest photo retailers have rapidly
consolidated the industry as it faces mounting competition from
mass merchants. Drugstores, in particular, have cut into the
customer base as they increasingly open one-hour photo processing
labs. And new technology such as digital photography and 24mm film
is making it too expensive for smaller retailers to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The mergers could be winding down, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to survive is to combine, but with all of the
recent consolidation, there aren't that many specialty retailers
left,'' Freedman said.

 &HT;    Nasdaq takes a drubbing
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Investors continued to show their disappointment at
economic policy-makers on Monday with widespread selling, although
late bargain-hunting narrowed losses among the blue-chip stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The late rally did not help technology stocks as much. There,
the selling gave the Nasdaq composite its fifth worst point
decline. The index lost 4.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The targets of investor ire Monday were finance ministers and
central bankers of the world's industrialized nations, who failed
over the weekend to agree on a financial package to rescue troubled
economies in Asia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, investors were disappointed at the Federal Reserve,
whose quarter-percentage-point cut in short-term interest rates was
regarded as too small to protect the U.S. economy from the threat
of a globally-induced recession.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, two of the market's staunchest bulls continued to
make optimistic forecasts in advance of this month's release of
third-quarter earnings reports, Dow Jones News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs' strategist Abby Joseph Cohen told the National
Association of Business Economists that investors might be in for a
``pleasant surprise'' from 1999 corporate earnings, when profits
are compared with weaker year-earlier numbers. She said ``operating
profit growth has decelerated but remains positive.''
</P>
<P>
   A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons chief market strategist Alfred Goldman,
meanwhile, said the market's sell-off on Monday may set the stage
for a rebound that could take the Dow to 9,000 by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   That would be about 338 points below the Dow's all-time high on
July 17, but well above the recent trading range of 7,600 to 8,100.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said investor sentiment is ``extremely pessimistic and
stocks are very oversold,'' which are preconditions for a rebound
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell as much as 233 points on Monday before late buying
narrowed the loss to 58.45 points. Last week the index fell more
than 200 points on Wednesday and again Thursday before rallying by
152 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market continued to attract investors looking for a
safe haven, which pushed yields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury
bond to an all-time low of 4.72 percent, just four days after the
yield dropped below 5 percent for the first time.

family and friends in the dark about what American prosecutors
charge were their true activities. Comoran officials are
embarrassed that Abdallah Mohammed Fazul (who was indicted in the
United States under the name ``Haroun Fazil,'' an alias he
apparently used in Kenya) has turned the world's eyes on them. But
they say he is a true product of the forces that shaped his

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of communications, software and financial services
companies plans to announce an alliance Tuesday aimed at creating
standards for speech recognition that will push electronic commerce
and the Internet beyond the boundaries of the personal computer,
potentially making it accessible to anyone with a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, to be made at an industry trade show in New
York, is intended to expand the ability to perform Internet
transactions or retrieve data from the World Wide Web by using
speech-recognition technology to translate spoken words into data
commands transmitted via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, which include Motorola Inc., SAP AG, Visa
International, Broadvision Inc., and Nuance Communications, a unit
of SRI International, describe their effort as V-Commerce and argue
that telephone access will break down the last barrier remaining
between the mass of consumers and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Currently access to the Internet is limited to those with
personal computers and Internet capability, but increasingly
executives in both the computer and communications industries
envision a new Internet platform that will be controlled by voice
and will display information on a small portable screen.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year speech recognition technologies have improved
significantly, making it possible for a number of companies to
begin deploying systems that answer questions for phone call and
package routing, stock trading, banking, airline reservations and
other commercial transactions. Now the companies are making an
effort to integrate voice systems with Internet and corporate data
bases.
</P>
<P>
   The new drive toward integration will make it possible for
consumers to pose questions by telephone and then receive data in a
variety of different ways, including by phone, portable devices
such as pagers and cell phones, or in the Web browser of their
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see voice recognition making tremendous advances,'' said
Todd Chaffee, executive vice president for corporate development
and alliances at Visa. ``Voice technology is going to lead to a
massive extension of electronic commerce beyond those with PC's.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, according to the alliance executives, it will be
increasingly simple to use a telephone to make a query such as
``tell me the flights from San Francisco to New York leaving
tomorrow.'' The answer to that question could then be immediately
spoken by phone, or displayed on a pager or in a computer Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, gaining access to the same information via a Web
browser alone can require as many as 15 mouse clicks and take up to
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Nuance is one of a small group of companies, including Applied
Language Technologies, Lernout &AMP; Hauspie Speech Products NV, Dragon
Systems and the IBM Corp., that are now developing basic speech
recognition technologies that are speaker-independent and do not
require training.
</P>
<P>
   This is a significant advance and is permitting wider deployment
of voice applications, such as recent Nuance systems that permit
call routing at Sears, Roebuck or stock information at Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Both Visa, the credit card processor, and Motorola are investors
in Nuance and both companies are moving to deploy both new services
and products that are based on the new voice technologies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Visa executives said the company had created prototypes of five
voice-based financial services including credit card activation,
lost and stolen card replacement, travel planning, voice banking
and bill payment.
</P>
<P>
   The services will be available commercially next year. Motorola
executives said the communications company was working to create
new Internet standards that would make speech extensions to
standard Internet services simple to implement.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently introduced a new voice Internet standard
called Voice Markup Language, or VoxML, to allow software
developers to add speech to their Web applications. Because VoxML
applications can be deployed on standard Web servers, the company
maintains it is straightforward to add the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorola looks at this area as a fundamental element of our
strategy,'' said Maria Martinez, vice president and general manager
of Motorola's Internet division.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strengths of the VoxML standard is that it would
permit responses to voice queries to be displayed on a variety of
existing Web devices, from pagers to browsers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, electronic commerce has been constrained by the PC,''
said Ron Croen, Nuance's chief executive officer. ``We're intent on
making the audience larger by an order of magnitude.''

PROBERS TO REVIEW ALLEGATIONS AGAINST RUSSIAN EMIGRES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ Insurance investigators will take a closer look into
allegations that 11 recent emigres from Russia and a
Brookline-based insurance agent conspired to file more than
$150,000 in questionable claims against defraud Trust Insurance Co.
of Taunton for staged or phony accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Skelly, chief of the Insurance Fraud Bureau of
Massachusetts, said Monday that the case, which prompted a civil
law suit filed by Trust last month, will be assigned to bureau
investigators this week.
</P>
<P>
   Skelly said his investigators checked the allegations several
months ago when Trust brought them to his attention. At the time,
his agency determined there was not enough evidence to build a
solid criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot more to prove a criminal case than it does a
civil one, so it may be that we cannot proceed,'' Skelly said.
``But the allegations are serious enough that we'll take another
look.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency, could recommend that the Attorney General's office
prosecute the case if the investigators find evidence of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Trust's lawsuit alleged that the Gene Dvorkin Insurance Agency,
who wrote policies for Trust, had sold autombile insurance in 1995
and 1996 to 11 people _ all recent arrivals from Russia who listed
a single apartment in Framingham as their address.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the group has been traced to previous addresses in
Brooklyn and New York City when the policies were sold. During the
next two years, the group began filing more than $150,000 in
medical and property claims for accidents that mostly took place in
the New York City area.
</P>
<P>
   In its investigation, Trust concluded that the accidents either
did not happen or were staged. It also found that the claimed
injuries were non-existent or were far less severe than warranted
by the prescribed medical treatment, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dvorkin, who sells auto insurance to approximately 2,000 Russian
immigrants living in metropolitan Boston, has denied that he had
willingly participated in any fraudulent scheme.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Trust had sued him in retaliation for contesting a
company policy which automatically bars safe-driver credits to
recent emigres seeking auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Trust executives denied Dvorkin's charge and maintained the
lawsuit is part of its ongoing fight against fraudulent claims. But
they acknowledged that Trust was looking to drop Dvorkin and four
other independent agents who write policies in high-risk
neighborhoods because they allegedly failed to abide by industry
guidelines _ including inaccurate records and failing to cancel
policies for non-payment of premiums.
</P>
<P>
   That effort was derailed, however, when Dvorkin and several
other agents went to Commonwealth Autombile Reinsurers _ a
little-noticed, quasi-public organization that oversees insurers'
high-risk pool. They complained that Trust ignored state
regulations when it refused to give safe-driver credits to recent
emigres.
</P>
<P>
   William E. Ryan, Trust's assistant vice president for
governmental affairs, said the dispute underscores the need for
legislation that would set out clear, consumer-oriented rules of
procedure for CAR's operation. Such legislation has passed the
Senate but is stuck in the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William R. Keating (D-Sharon), the bill's sponsor, said the
way CAR currently operates ``is far too arbitrary and away from
public scrutiny. It is in the public's interest for insurance
companies to fight fraud vigorously and for that to happen there
has to be clear rules of procedure within CAR.''

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO HOLD IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS grafs 1-3 with committee vote; adds optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A deeply divided House Judiciary Committee on
Monday authorized an impeachment inquiry against President Clinton
for lying and obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-dominated committee voted 21-16, along party
lines, to approve the inquiry, which the full House is expected to
approve later this week. It would be the third time in U.S. history
that the House has considered impeachment proceedings against a
sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts by Democrats to set a deadline for the
investigation, the resolution contains no limits on the time or
subject of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   During a day-long marathon hearing, Republicans argued that as
commander in chief, President Clinton must be held to the highest
standards in terms of his personal conduct and adherence to the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly reminded how weary America is of this whole
situation and I daresay most of us share that weariness,'' said
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. Nevertheless, he
added, ``it is imperative we be able to look back at this episode
with dignity and pride, knowing we have performed our duty in the
best interest of the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that Clinton's effort to hide his sexual
relationship with Lewinsky was evidence of nothing more than a man
covering the tracks of a personal indiscretion, hardly the stuff of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Watergate, it's an extramarital affair,'' said the
committee's senior Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan. Conyers
is the only committee member who was on the panel the last time it
authorized an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's vote that day, Jan. 31, 1974, set in motion
impeachment hearings on the Watergate scandal that preceded the
resignation of President Richard Nixon seven months later. More
than 100 years before that, the House voted to impeach President
Andrew Johnson. The Senate in 1868 fell one vote shy of removing
Johnson from office.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Republicans turned back two alternative Democratic
resolutions. The first would have set a deadline of Nov. 25 for the
inquiry unless the House granted an extension, and would have
required the committee to hold hearings on the Constitution's
standards for impeachment before determining whether any of
Clinton's actions are impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   The second would have declared the Sept. 11 report of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on the Clinton-Lewinsky affair to
be fact. Then the committee could focus on whether the Starr report
_ the basis for the impeachment inquiry _ is sufficient grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the committee Republicans' top investigator, David
Schippers, set out 15 instances in which Clinton's conduct in the
Lewinsky matter ``may constitute grounds to proceed with an
impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   They covered most of the now-familiar elements of the affair as
documented in Starr's report to Congress, as well as the thousands
of pages of grand jury transcripts and documents the committee
released in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the charges in the Schippers report: Clinton lied under
oath during his January deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit, and his August grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The report also accuses Clinton of conspiring with Lewinsky to
concoct a ``cover story'' to conceal their relationship, hiding
gifts to Lewinsky, and helping her find a job in New York in
exchange for silence.
</P>
<P>
   But Schippers dropped two of the 11 grounds for impeachment
cited by Starr in his Sept. 11 referral. Starr had accused Clinton
of abusing his constitutional authority and obstructing justice by
refusing to testify before the grand jury for seven months and
lying to White House aides, who repeated his false statements.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the committee's Democrats, Abbe Lowell, countered
that a ``laundry list'' of laws Clinton may have broken is
insufficient for the Constitution's impeachment standard of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all offenses are `high crimes and misdemeanors,' and not
all `high crimes and misdemeanors' come from criminal conduct,'' he
said, quoting founding father George Mason as saying impeachment is
for ``great and dangerous offenses to subvert the Constitution,''
and Alexander Hamilton: Impeachment remedies ``injuries done
immediately to the society itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's misstatements in the Jones deposition about his
relationship with Lewinsky were irrelevant because the federal
judge in that case, Susan Webber Wright, ruled in January that the
Clinton-Lewinsky relationship was ``not essential'' to resolving
the Jones case, Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   And Starr's report did not include Lewinsky's statement that
``no one asked me to lie, and I was never promised a job for my
silence,'' Lowell added.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the hearing opened, Republicans focused their attack on
perjury charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president serves as a role model for us and our
children,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. ``He influences the
lives of millions of Americans ... Actions do have consequences;
the difference between right and wrong still exists; and honesty
always counts.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to former White House Counsel John Dean's
statement to Nixon during Watergate that a ``cancer'' was growing
on the presidency, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said the nation is
``witnessing nothing less than the symptoms of a cancer on the
presidency. If we fail to remove this cancer, it will expand and
destroy the principles that matter most to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats concentrated their fire on Starr and their view that
impeachment is only for serious misdeeds that threaten the nation's
political fabric, not a president's indiscretion with a young White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president had an affair,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler,
D-Fla., his voice rising in emotion to a shout. ``He lied about it.
He didn't want anyone to know about it. Does anyone reasonably
believe that this amounts to a subversion of government? Does
anyone reasonably believe that this is what the Founding Fathers
were talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler called Starr's four-year probe of Clinton that culminated
in the Lewinsky report a ``politically inspired witch-hunt that
rivals McCarthyism in its sinister purpose.''

LATIN AMERICAN ECONOMIC OFFICIALS LASH OUT AT IMF  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Increasingly angry at what they consider the
lenient treatment that Russia received in its $4.5 billion bailout
by the International Monetary Fund, Latin American officials and
economists warned Monday that the programs being offered to protect
their own countries were too paltry.
</P>
<P>
   Guillermo Ortiz, Mexico's central bank governor and former
finance minister, said that faced with the mounting financial
pressures on Latin America and the rest of the developing world,
the $90 billion the United States wants to give the monetary fund
in extra lending money would be adequate ``if things go well, but
not enough for a bad scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   By some calculations, he said, the developing world might need
$200 billion in new loans by 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz's warnings came at a seminar here during this year's
annual meeting of the World Bank and the IMF. When Russia defaulted
in August on its huge foreign debts and the United States and other
major powers allowed it to happen, he said, South America's ability
to withstand the global financial crisis was seriously undermined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then we were doing fine,'' he said. ``But everything
changed after Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   What clearly angered Ortiz and other officials at the seminar
was the strong political and financial backing that the United
States and other major powers gave Russia right up to the moment it
defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia was treated like a member of the Group of Seven,''
Ortiz said, referring to the world's most powerful nations, at
whose behest the monetary fund lent Russia $17 billion. ``It was
unthinkable it could fail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while Mexico could survive ``a period of market
instability, it must be temporary or the situation will be out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said Russia's default made investors around the world wary
of all emerging market countries, including those in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat of Chile said: ``It's the
packaging effect. Analysts don't differentiate between regions,
countries or sectors anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is being buffeted by external shocks this time,
it is not the source of the shocks,'' said E. Gerald Corrigan of
Goldman Sachs and a former president of the New York Federal
Reserve, alluding to the Mexican peso's collapse in 1995 and the
financial turmoil that it provoked.
</P>
<P>
   All ministers and officials speaking at the seminar, entitled
``Latin America: a steady ship in troubled waters?'' promised that
their countries would continue the free-market-oriented economic
reforms they have introduced in recent years, selling off
state-owned companies and encouraging private business.
</P>
<P>
   But they also insisted that the United States, other important
nations and institutions like the World Bank and the IMF must be
ready to help.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian finance minister, Pedro Malan, who was greeted
with cheers when he announced the apparent re-election of President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, pledged the government to impose painful
new austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit. ``We interpret
the election as a mandate to do what we said we would do,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that early in September the finance ministers and
central bank governors of nine Latin American countries had met
with World Bank and IMF officials in Washington and vowed ``to
deepen our reform efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, consequently, there would be no changes in the
government's exchange rate policy and no resort to controls on
outflows of money even though the country has seen about $30
billion of its reserves drain away since July.
</P>
<P>
   But he said nothing about the big financial aid package he is
rumored to be negotiating with Washington, the World Bank and the
IMF and which some officials now say could total as much as $60
billion.
</P>
<P>
   He did evoke the possibility of a serious breakdown in Latin
America's largest economy _ which is bigger than those of South
Korea, Malaysia and Thailand combined _ by saying the world now has
``an historic opportunity to show how by acting together we could
have a successful experience at crisis prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Latin American economies have weathered the
international crisis relatively well. The IMF currently expects
them to grow at a rate of 2.8 percent this year and 2.7 percent
next year, down only 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent respectively on
what it predicted last May.
</P>
<P>
   But international confidence in the region's currencies is
vulnerable to the balance-of-payments deficits that all major Latin
American countries are running. They currently range from 3.6
percent and 4.4 percent of total output respectively for Brazil and
Argentina, to 7 percent in the case of Chile.

CLINTON'S SCANDAL IS GRIST FOR THE LAW SCHOOL GRIND
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ The students' pens in the classroom at the
University of Maryland School of Law were poised the way law
students' pens often are.
</P>
<P>
   The topic of the lecturer, Alan I. Baron, seemed dry enough to
be the usual law school fare: compliance with subpoenas seeking
documents. But the point of the lesson was not from the usual stale
old cases _ it was from the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to assume if you're turning over documents to
Congress that they're going to be made public,'' Baron advised the
would-be lawyers. ``And if they're really, really hot documents,
they're going to be above the fold in The Washington Post within
three days.''
</P>
<P>
   The era of the permanent investigation of the president has
produced all sorts of legal curiosities. The latest is a crop of
courses on the subject at law schools across the country. In these
classes, leaks, politics and the president's videotaped testimony
are as important as the established precedents law students have
been poring over for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The course here, ``Legislative Investigations,'' drew students
for all sorts of reasons. Scott Conwell, 34, said after class that
in the course, as perhaps in the country, ``the politics and the
legal are intertwined'' in a way that ``keeps us awake.''
</P>
<P>
   David Coughlin said he had signed up to find out how
investigations of important officials were conducted and how they
``could be thwarted, which was obviously happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Allen, 24, seemed to have thought more than most about
the practical applicability of such a course. She said she had
watched the legal experts on television, the legion of ``talking
heads,'' discuss the same legal questions that have been covered in
class. Presto. She had found a potential legal job she knew she
could handle. ``They just completely did not understand the basic
legal principles,'' she said. ``I said, `OK, I want that job.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that law schools are incorporating the
president's difficulties into their offerings to increase their
graduates' opportunities in the talking-head market. But courses
dealing with various aspects of the endless legal tangle in
Washington are proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Florida College of Law in Gainesville,
Charles W. Collier planned a class for next semester that could
cover legal issues just when they are preoccupying Congress:
``Constitutional Theory: Presidential Impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   At Widener University School of Law in Wilmington, Del., the New
England School of Law in Boston and other law schools, professors
said they were expanding normally abbreviated discussions of
impeachment in their constitutional law classes.
</P>
<P>
   And at Harvard Law School this semester, Alan M. Dershowitz is
teaching a course called ``The Presidential Investigation: A Cast
of Ethical Problems.'' He said it dealt with issues like ``the
Kendall problem,'' named for President Clinton's private lawyer,
David E. Kendall. Dershowitz described the dilemma as a
circumstance in which a lawyer might have a client who wants to
testify before a grand jury but ``doesn't want to be completely
frank and candid.''
</P>
<P>
   The course here in Baltimore is taught by two adjunct
professors, Baron, a lawyer in private practice in Washington, and
Glenn F. Ivey, a former prosecutor who is now the chairman of the
Maryland Public Service Commission. Until March, Ivey was chief
counsel to the Senate Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, and in earlier Congressional jobs he worked on
Whitewater and other investigations. Baron, who was once
impeachment counsel to the House of Representatives in the cases of
two federal judges, was recently minority counsel to the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee for the investigation into campaign
finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the lecturers described for their students the
nitty-gritty of working on such cases. How, one student asked, does
a congressional lawyer get someone cited for contempt?
``Subcommittee, committee, floor'' votes, Ivey said.
</P>
<P>
   Though few legal textbooks say so, the two teachers told their
students that time could be an important tool in fighting any
congressional inquiry. Speaking purely theoretically, they said,
delay can mean the election of a new Congress, whose members might
view alleged offenses differently from their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Baron described one age-old strategy for dealing with such
investigations. ``Run the clock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the students seemed puzzled by the fine points of
legal warfare. Then it became clear. For example, Ivey was
describing how one strategy in trying to thwart an investigation
was to wait until the eve of a congressional hearing and then dump
thousands of pages of documents on the chief investigator. If you
are that lawyer, Ivey said, ``your staff is looking at you and
saying, `Boss, we can't go through 10,000 documents by tomorrow.'
''
</P>
<P>
   From his seat one student, John Costello, 31, said he
understood. ``It sounds to me,'' he said, ``like the way I'm going
to feel a week before the end of this class, when the paper's
due.''

   WARSAW, Poland _ Scott Mackie doesn't envy his old boss.
</P>
<P>
   Before he took over recently as head of General Motors Poland,
Mackie worked at GM's big German unit, Opel, under David Herman. In
June, GM dispatched Herman to Moscow, where he is now puzzling out
a strategy in the wake of Russia's troubled collision with
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie, 37, has no such headaches. In August, right on schedule,
a new $535 million GM factory in southern Poland came on line, and
work is proceeding on a $300 million upgrading of a plant in
Warsaw. To supply parts, GM's Delphi subsidiary has built or
acquired six plants in Poland. A finance company set up last year
feverishly plies Poles with credit to pay for the cars the plants
churn out.
</P>
<P>
   Poland, in short, is not Russia. For some time now, Eastern
European nations have been uncoupling themselves from their giant
neighbor to the east and refocusing westward. And the breathtaking
collapse of the Russian economy, which left Eastern Europe
standing, served to banish all doubts that this trend is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Central and Eastern Europe's trade ties to Western
Europe are far stronger than those to Russia,'' said Albrecht
Schmidt, chairman of Bayerishce Hypo und Vereinsbank, one of
Germany's largest banks. ``They have completely reoriented their
economies to the West.''
</P>
<P>
   True, stock markets in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest have taken a
whipping because of the Russian debacle. Credit is harder to come
by. But by and large the region sidestepped Russian-style woes,
with Poland providing perhaps the most vivid example of the power
to survive _ and even thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the pieces are in place. Mackie's Polish
headquarters, in a corporate park erected hastily south of Warsaw
after the fall of Communism nearly a decade ago, exudes
impermanence. But he stresses that GM is in Poland for the long
haul. ``Our ambition is to get not just a toe in the door, but a
significant stake in the market,'' he said recently. ``We don't
build plants with a 5-year horizon, but with a 30- to 40-year
horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   And that horizon clearly is to the West. The formation of a new
government in Germany is now scrutinized more closely here than the
assembling of a Cabinet in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all battered a little, and obviously they will face
difficult access to international capital markets for some time,''
said Hans Peter Lankes, director of transition strategy at the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. ``Yet
you can see markets discriminating already.''
</P>
<P>
   Polish companies have deftly exploited the opportunities that
came with the collapse in 1989 of the old trading regime, Comecon,
quickly establishing ties with Western Europe. The government took
steps, at times haltingly and with mixed results, to overhaul
creaking financial and industrial systems. And since Poland, unlike
Russia, did not have vast sums lavished on it by the International
Monetary Fund, it had to scramble for private cash, but the foreign
money came.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, Poland made a virtue of necessity. Without Russia's
natural resources like gold, oil and gas, Polish executives were
largely unable to create the types of leveraged fortunes that have
collapsed in Russia, accelerating the failure of that economy,
experts say. In addition, government regulatory scrutiny of a kind
unknown in Russia helped avoid excesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poland got off to a very good start'' by not succumbing to the
fatal combination of bloated finances and real economic desolation
that toppled Russia, said Jadwiga Staniszkis, a leading Polish
sociologist, ``The temptations were similar, and the connections
were there,'' she said, ``but the degree to which it happened was
far less.''
</P>
<P>
   As the largest Eastern European market, with 38 million people,
and the region's principal motor of economic growth, Poland has
many eyes on it, and it is not home free yet. With roughly 70
percent of its trade now conducted with Western Europe, a slowdown
there would have ripple effects farther east. Fragile Polish
industries now compete with hardened industrial old-timers from
Europe, Japan and the United States, and the Poles must often use
weapons still blunt from decades of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Poland, though besieged, continues to command
international attention. The government is preparing big chunks of
the nationalized economy, like the national telephone company and
several large banks, to go public. The results will provide a gauge
of global interest in investing here. Hugely unprofitable
industries like coal and steel, with immense debts that are a drag
on growth, are set for reorganization. Next year, the pension
system will get an overhaul to avoid bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While hedge funds and short-term speculators liquidated holdings
in this summer's crisis, many investors, like GM, are committed for
the duration.
</P>
<P>
   After years of managing funds in New York and Tokyo, Alicja
Malecka returned to her native Poland in 1991 to build a fund
business for the Pioneer Group, asset managers based on Boston. In
1994, Pioneer, which has $400 million of assets under management in
Poland, less in Hungary and the Czech Republic, plunged farther
east, establishing asset management and brokerage businesses in
Russia as well.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Malecka's business epitomizes the region's contrasts.
While she is bullish on Poland, she traveled recently to Moscow to
sort out Pioneer's activities there. That operation, as she put it,
was ``extremely successful until six months ago,'' but is now ``in
a kind of survival mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Poland is all wine and roses. When Warsaw's stock
exchange took a hit in 1994, she said, two-thirds of Pioneer's
business melted away; this summer, when the market plummeted again,
Pioneer's business shrank 20 percent as investors turned skittish.
``It's a very volatile market,'' Ms. Malecka said, seated in her
office in a Communist-era tower that like Poland itself is
undergoing a renewal. ``About 85 percent of our customers are
individual investors.''
</P>
<P>
   But change is coming. To rescue Poland's pay-as-you-go pension
system, established under the communist regime, a new law takes
effect in April that will require about 3.5 million Poles under the
age of 30 to begin paying part of their earnings into private
pension funds, and Pioneer expects to be among the dozen or so fund
groups licensed for this business. Ms. Malecka is talking to about
400 companies, including big nationalized industries, about forming
corporate pension plans to supplement the government's social
security payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years down the road, most of our assets will come from
pension funds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie has seen similar changes help his business.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he said, GM's forecasters were predicting a
market in Poland of about 400,000 automobiles by 2004. Yet they had
not reckoned with changes in Polish laws enabling car makers to
open consumer finance companies. Now, the market leader, Fiat, does
60 percent of its Polish sales through credit. By last year, total
car sales had reached 477,000, and promise to be even higher this
year. In fact, 280,000 cars were sold in the first six months,
making Poland Europe's sixth-largest automobile market, after
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Doing business in Poland may not be easy, Mackie said, but it
gets done.
</P>
<P>
   As do many Western executives, Mackie laments the Byzantine
twists of Polish bureaucracy. In Gliwice, in southern Poland, site
of GM's new plant, workers can use only one of several factory
cafeterias, he said, since local officials have yet to issue
sanitation permits for the others; the general contractor, a Polish
construction group called Mostostal, performed technical miracles,
he said, but was poor at efficiently organizing hundreds of
subcontractors. Still, construction was fully on schedule, and on
Aug. 31, the first cars rolled off Gliwice's assembly lines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Exactly when Poles' appetite for consumer goods like cars will
be sated is hotly disputed. Consumer debt, despite offers like
those by the auto companies, remains at less than 10 percent of
disposable income, minuscule compared with levels in the United
States and Western Europe. Yet growth in real wages is declining,
to about 4 percent this year from 6 percent in 1997, and figures
suggest that growth of the crucial automobile market will slow to 7
percent this year, from more than 25 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as attractive as Poland's domestic market may be, car
makers like Mackie will use factories here to ship abroad, further
cementing links with Western Europe. Though GM expects to sell
about 45,000 cars a year in Poland, the assembly lines in Gliwice
will churn out more than 150,000. All of Fiat's two smallest models
sold in Western Europe come from factories in Poland. Polish auto
workers earn 20 percent of the salaries of their Western European
counterparts, and cars made in Poland enter Western Europe duty
free, thanks to agreements to ease Poland into the European Union
by early in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Poland is not isolating itself economically from the
east, where millions of consumers in the forme Soviet Union offer
a potentially huge and hungry market. Deputy Foreign Minister
Radoslaw Sikorski pointed out how Poland had in recent months
abolished visa requirements for Ukrainians and reduced visa fees
for Russians, to $15 from $60, in part to stimulate barter-based
cross-border trade that aids businesses in eastern Poland that
supply consumer goods, like food, to Ukraine and Russia. As Russia
heads toward a catastrophic harvest this year, he said, ``we think
most of that will remain.''
</P>
<P>
   But Poland's trade with Russia accounts for only about 7 percent
of the total, he said, adding, ``We are closer to Brussels than to
Moscow, and not only geographically.''
</P>
<P>
   As economic reorganization produces increasingly close ties to
Western Europe, it is there, economists say, that Poland's economic
fortunes will eventually be decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there are clear signals that accession to the
European Union is on track,'' said Lankes of the Reconstruction
Bank, ``then Central European countries are going to be decoupled
from emerging-market risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the biggest question facing countries like Poland
is ``what will happen to Western European economies, and there is
increasing uncertainty about that.''

CONGRESSIONAL CONFEREES APPROVE MORE HOUSING SUBSIDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate negotiators approved a $26 billion
budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development Monday
that would add 90,000 families to subsidized housing rolls and
raise federally insured loan limits so more poor Americans can buy
homes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hailed the measure, which would boost HUD's
annual budget by about $2 billion, as a ``bipartisan housing bill
that incorporates all of the essential principles for which we have
fought during the long, difficult negotiations that led to this
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will put America back in the business of
providing new affordable housing, will transform public housing and
will increase home ownership opportunities,'' Clinton said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   While he praised the fiscal 1999 HUD budget approved by the
congressional negotiators, the president held out the possibility
that he may veto a larger legislative package that contains the
housing budget as well as funds for the Department of Veterans
Affairs and various independent agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he ``remains concerned '' about the funding levels
for certain environmental and economic development programs
contained in the larger measure, which Congress is still reviewing.
</P>
<P>
   HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo said he was pleased that the budget
for his agency includes most of what the administration had
requested from Congress in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the president's program,'' Cuomo said in a telephone
news conference. He called the HUD budget ``truly historic
legislation'' and a ``tremendous win'' for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators' budget would include:
</P>
<P>
   _Additional subsidies for rental housing. Funds would pay part
of the housing costs for 90,000 additional poor families through
the so-called Section 8 rental assistance program. Congress has not
approved additional Section 8 subsidies in nearly five years.
Currently, about 3 million families receive the aid.
</P>
<P>
   _Funds to increase home ownership. The negotiators agreed to
increase the limits on Federal Housing Administration-insured
mortgage loans from $170,362 to $197,621.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Reid, vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America, said the boost in FHA loan limits is a ``critical step
toward giving every citizen a fair chance at home ownership,
especially those who live in high-cost areas.''
</P>
<P>
   _Money to promote a wider distribution of income levels in
public and assisted housing. In this effort, a number of large
dilapidated public housing projects would be torn down and replaced
with townhouses. The program would also ``deconcentrate'' poor
families by placing some of the lowest-income groups in buildings
with somewhat higher-income families.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators also approved $975 million to fight
homelessless, an increase of 17 percent over the funds for fiscal
1998, which ended last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A contentious measure approved by the House this summer that
targeted San Francisco's domestic-partners ordinance failed. The
ordinance requires private contractors doing business with the city
to offer single employees with domestic partners the same benefits
that they give married heterosexual employees.
</P>
<P>
   The House measure would have barred San Francisco from spending
federal housing money to implement the ordinance. The Senate
version of the HUD bill contained no such provision, and House
negotiators dropped the idea in deliberations with their Senate
counterparts.

THE RUBLE IS ON A TILT, BUT THE RUSSIANS ARE KEEPING THEIR BALANCE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It's drive time, and Muscovites are heading home after
another day of crisis. After the news, all of it bad, an ad comes
on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruble is falling,'' says the cheerful voice from a private
dental clinic, ``but with us, at least your teeth will stay in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The next ad urges crisis-weary listeners to get away from it all
and book a Turkish vacation, now just a dream for what was once
Moscow's middle class. The music starts again. The first song,
sponsored by a cellular phone company now battling to hold on to
its newly poor clientele, is ``Sacrifice'' by Elton John.
</P>
<P>
   So goes another crisis in Russia, a time when people dip into
deep national reserves of fatalism and retrieve a special mix of
resolve and self-deprecating humor that thrives best when things go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crisis is nothing special for Russians,'' said Viktor
Shenderovich, creator of the popular satirical show ``Puppets,''
who spent two hours telling old and new jokes at a Moscow supper
club recently. ``As long as no one is shooting at us or sending us
to labor camps, as long as we can find food for our children, we
just live life as we have always lived it.''
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did the ruble collapse, businesses close down and
inflation shoot up than the jokes started flowing, along with a
steady stream of practical advice on how to cope with the stress of
it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing your job is always a stimulus for new projects,'' says
Profil magazine, a weekly that not so long ago catered to the whims
of Moscow's free-spending arrivistes. ``So, you ask, what do we
eat? Almost every normal person has some money set aside for black
days.''
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein of roll-with-the-punches advice, the magazine
dropped its usual review of high-fashion boutiques and steered
readers to a more useful line of shopping _ ``armored equipment for
home use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last month we have become decisively convinced that
keeping money in the bank is an inadmissible luxury,'' wrote the
writer of the Let's Go Shopping section. ``It's better to keep your
treasures at home, `in your sock,' according to the old Russian
tradition. But you can also keep it in a safe. This is much more
modern and reliable.''
</P>
<P>
   The jokes, told on the air, on the streets and in the corridors
of Parliament, are also about the gathering gloom. One businessman
calls another to check in on how he's doing. ``Great,'' comes the
answer. ``Sorry, wrong number,'' the caller says and hangs up.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the one about the woman who walks up to the teller
at a bank. ``Whom do I see about opening a bank account?'' she
asks. ``A psychiatrist,'' comes the answer.
</P>
<P>
   There are old jokes, recycled to fit today's leaders. President
Boris Yeltsin addresses the nation. ``For years we have stood on
the edge of an abyss. Now, fellow countrymen, we have taken a great
step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to crisis, Russians will boast that they are
world-class professionals. The elderly remember World War II and
stock up on buckwheat, potatoes, salt and matches. Housewives,
wedded to the joy of a newly acquired washing machine, buy boxes of
imported detergent. Young couples, aghast at the thought of washing
dirty diapers, stuff their wardrobes with the disposable variety,
which appeared in Russian stores only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken care of the essentials, people settle in for the
long haul _ in this case, bracing themselves for another round of
inflation like the one that emptied their pocketbooks in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to the future'' is the popular phrase among television
commentators and headline writers, which often give a sarcastic
twist to the day's events. (A recent front-page headline in
Argumenty i Fakty, Russia's most popular newspaper: ``If the Crisis
Is All in People's Heads, Why Hit Them on the Head So Hard?'')
</P>
<P>
   ``People are again discussing how many pounds of potatoes a
balcony can hold before it collapses,'' was the wry comment from
Mikhail Osokin, a television anchor, at the end of a recent evening
broadcast.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the unnerving aspects of this crisis is how invisible it
is. Even when people were rushing to their banks trying to withdraw
their savings, they did so in quiet clumps while other Muscovites
walked briskly by, seemingly unperturbed.
</P>
<P>
   On the night that Shenderovich was telling funny stories, the
atmosphere at Petrovich _ a basement supper club named after an
Everyman cartoon character _ could have been a scene from the ``new
Russia,'' the period, now ending, when this city seemed to be
inching its way to normality. Mobile phones still jingled during
his monologues as he mocked, in turn, Russia's new rich, old-style
bureaucrats and out-of-touch politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But the well-dressed crowd laughed easily at the jokes, even
when they were about people like themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Russians are not in places like this,'' said Elena
Korjenevich, 22, a marketing specialist for Coca-Cola, who had
joined friends for an evening out. ``They are home in their
kitchens. The ones who are here are thinking about today. If they
have money, they spend it. They don't think about tomorrow. It is
the crisis psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite the outward calm, there are inklings of panic.
But like dissidence in Soviet times, panic here takes place
privately, at home.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 534 Muscovites reached by telephone by the Russian
Market Research Company found that 61 percent had been hard-hit by
the crisis, either because of salary cuts, loss of savings or a
job. Only 7 percent said they had avoided its impact.
</P>
<P>
   Every third family said they had tried to stockpile food,
fearing shortages and price rises in equal measure. Twenty-two
percent of those questioned said they had ``general feelings of
agitation, or even panic.''
</P>
<P>
   The first rush to stock up kitchen shelves, wardrobes and
balconies with all sorts of goods has subsided somewhat, followed
by price shock. With some domestically produced foods, goods and
services still holding at previous levels, consumers are once again
faced with a dizzying dislocation of prices. Six pounds of meat
bought at a local market can cost as much as a bottle of imported
shampoo. A pack of chewing gum costs as much as two loaves of
bread.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is particularly funny, but people make do, counting
on their own ability to survive. How the country as a whole will
fare is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   One joke making the rounds sets out two scenarios for Russia's
escape from its current predicament. The more optimistic of the two
is that aliens arrive from another planet to sort out the crisis.
The second, more pessimistic version has Russia saving itself.

NATO FINDS GREATER ROLE IN BOSNIA FOR ITALIAN POLICE UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ When an angry crowd of Bosnian
Croats put up a roadblock on the main road south of Mostar the
other day, commanders of NATO's peacekeeping force here refrained
from flooding the area with their troops, as they might have not
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they sent in the Carabinieri.
</P>
<P>
   In a subtle, scarcely noted shift in NATO's operations, the
Carabinieri Corps, Italy's domestic military police force, has
arrived in Bosnia to form the core of a new battalion that NATO's
commanders hope will take on the sorts of law-enforcement jobs they
are loath to give their combat forces _ from quashing riots to
protecting refugees trying to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The battalion, known as the Multinational Specialized Unit,
includes some 380 Carabinieri officers, as well as 70 gendarmes
from Argentina and 23 military policemen from Romania. All of them
have been trained in their own countries to act, essentially, as
domestic armies, trained to deal as much with civilians as with
enemy troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true military tasks are finished here,'' said the
battalion's commander, Col. Leonardo Leso of the Carabinieri.
``Now, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to restore the public order.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has no domestic force like the Carabinieri and
has not contributed troops to the new unit, except for a couple of
liaison officers at the unit's headquarters at a base near the
capital, Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO's American commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, strongly
advocated the creation of the force, saying it fills a gap between
NATO's force and the local authorities who are supposed to enforce
the civilian aspects of the Dayton peace accords. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen also went to lengths to highlight the unit
during his recent visit to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years after the arrival of NATO's peacekeeping
force, the unit's paramilitary approach may offer a largely
European alternative to keeping large numbers of combat troops in
Bosnia. There are roughly 33,000 NATO-led troops there now,
including 7,700 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those forces are more capable of providing the kind of broad
support to civil implementation that's required,'' General Clark
said in a recent interview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The battalion remains a part of NATO's Stabilization Force and
still operates under its command. Its first units arrived in
August, but its first operations began, uneventfully, during
Bosnia's national elections last month. The operation the other day
was the first that involved violence.
</P>
<P>
   The battalion's troops arrived after a group of Bosnian Croats,
including women and children, blocked the main road south of Mostar
to protest an attempt by Muslim refugees to return to their homes
near the village of Capljina. Although the Dayton accords provide
refugees the right to return, the local Bosnian Croat police did
nothing to intervene, NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Carabinieri arrived, two hours of negotiations followed
before the troops forcibly cleared the road. In the melee three
soldiers were hit by stones, but none were seriously wounded, a
NATO spokesman, Maj. Richard Saint Louis, said.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the size of the battalion is likely to grow as
NATO's commanders put more emphasis on operations like escorting
refugees or war crimes investigators. Slovenia has pledged to
provide forces to the battalion, and others with similar forces at
home, like Spain and France, are also expected to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Leso said that as NATO's role in Bosnia evolved from enforcing
the peace to rebuilding the country's shattered society, the
battalion would be used more and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more means to convince people,'' he said. ``We can
shout or shoot.''

CLINTON APPEALS FOR UNIFIED ATTACK ON GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton made a direct appeal on Monday to
a select group of the world's top financial officials to come up
with a unified attack on the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's comments on Monday night came at the beginning of a
five-hour, closed door exchange with finance ministers and central
bankers from the largest industrial economies and from 15 emerging
markets nations that have been striken by currency devaluations,
plummeting stock markets and growing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread criticism being expressed here at the annual
meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund that
there is too little attention on coordinated, immediate action, the
session on Monday night focused chiefly on long-term ideas for
making the global economy less vulnerable to shocks.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of international markets, Clinton said, ``has helped
t lift millions and millions of people out of poverty.'' But
echoing a lament heard often these days by politicians who feel
whiplashed by the markets, he added that ``global capital markets
also can react swiftly and harshly when countries stray from sound
policies, and the markets also can overreact, subjecting even
countries following good policies to severe pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before Clinton opened the talks, the markets proved
his point, continuing their fall around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   While the reasons varied _ from heightened fears about Japan's
banks to concern that it is taking too long to put together an aid
package for Brazil _ the declines appeared fueled by fears that the
first few days of meetings here have contained more finger-pointing
than action plans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's stock market closed below 13,000 on Monday for the first
time in 12 years _ further undercutting the financial viability of
its banks _ and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 235 points,
before recovering to close off only 58 points.
</P>
<P>
   While officials seem to be reaching some consensus about
preventing future turmoil, Monday's meetings saw more open fissures
over how the world should respond to the current turmoil with the
United States, the Europeans and the emerging market nations all
having different prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for example, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin directly
confronted Southeast Asian nations that have been pressing for, and
in a few cases enacting, rules that would restrict the rights of
investors to move money freely across national borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misguided exchange and capital controls are not the answer for
dealing with the effects of this crisis,'' Rubin insisted in a
speech to the leading advisory panel to the World Bank. ``While the
loss of confidence and resulting flight of capital from many
emerging market economies has carried with it a heavy cost,
measures that would effectively prevent the return of this capital
will only postpone recovery and the restoration of economic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring most directly to Malaysia, which has not only
imposed such controls, but arrested and imprisoned the country's
former finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, an ally of Rubin's.
Malaysia announced on Monday that it would postpone Anwar's trial,
on charges of revealing state secrets and sodomy, until just after
Clinton visits Malaysia next month for the next major meeting on
the global crisis, involving leaders from around the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also delivered a rare public rebuke to both the World Bank
and the IMF, institutions created 53 years ago to stabilize the
world economy, for their difficulty in coming up with common
solutions to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is past time to put aside institutional rivalries
unbefiting public institutions with the same shareholders,'' he
said. ``The IMF and World Bank must evolve to meet the new demands
of the global economy. All of us must work together.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the thousands of delegates who moved through the
meetings, wending their way from seminars on debt restructuring to
glittering embassy receptions, there were growing criticisms that
Rubin and leaders of the other major economies should move more
quickly to show the world they have a short-term plan.

HARLEM RENAISSANCE BLOOMS IN `BLUES FOR AN ALABAMA SKY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Pearl Cleage brings a fresh slant to the fabled Harlem
Renaissance in ``Blues for an Alabama Sky,'' her neatly written
play making its Houston debut in an able production at the Ensemble
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Writers such as Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Countee Cullen,
Zora Neale Hurston and Jean Toomer (among others) set the stage for
Harlem's creative surge of the 1920s _ producing the first
significant body of work describing black life from a black
perspective. Amid the daring and social ferment of the '20s, other
figures rose to prominence, such as entertainer Josephine Baker,
who became the toast of Paris. For a time among certain circles, as
Hughes put it, ``the Negro was in vogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cleage sets her play in 1930, as the Depression tightens its
grip and the high-stepping of the 1920s gives way to the sober
trudge through the 1930s. Cleage peoples her play with colorful,
diverse and believable characters, depicting varied attitudes and
philosophies within the black community.
</P>
<P>
   Touched by the spirit of the Harlem Renaissance, yet realizing
change is in the air, these characters are at the point of making
changes in their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   The play's center is the loving, platonic relationship between
showgirl Angel and costume designer Guy, soul mates who fled
together to Harlem from the rural South. It's clear that Angel
would like their relationship to be more than platonic, but Guy, a
self-described ``notorious homosexual,'' is equally clear about his
own identity.
</P>
<P>
   As the play begins, Angel has just been dumped by her gangster
boyfriend and lost her job at the nightclub. Guy has lost his
position, too, by standing up for Angel. But he assures Angel that
all will be well; he has been sending costume sketches to Baker in
Paris and expects that, any day, she will summon him to become her
designer. Angel has heard Guy's big dream before _ and doubts it
will become reality.
</P>
<P>
   Delia, a friend who lives in the flat across the hall, is a
genteel crusader for women's rights, a disciple of Margaret Sanger
working to establish the first birth control clinic in Harlem. Sam,
known as ``Doc,'' is the hard-working, hard-drinking physician who
offers to assist Delia in her campaign for family planning. In the
process, and rather unexpectedly for both, they fall in love.
</P>
<P>
   Into the midst of this free-thinking set comes Leland, an
old-fashioned country boy newly arrived from Alabama, who begins a
flirtation with Angel. Weary of her string of gangster boyfriends
and her past as a prostitute, Angel is ready to fall for the
gentlemanly Leland.
</P>
<P>
   But Leland's narrow views put him on a collision course with
Angel and her friends, for things like homosexuality, birth control
and abortion are beyond his ken. The clash guarantees a bumpy
course for Angel and Leland's romance, also setting the stage for a
tragic turn.
</P>
<P>
   Cleage, whose ``Flyin' West'' was seen at the Ensemble in 1995,
has filled ``Blues for an Alabama Sky'' with strong writing. The
characters are well-rounded, persuasive and appealing. The action
rings true. The dialogue is natural and flavorful, with many
standout passages: the wry banter between Angel and Guy, the sexy
flirtation of Angel and Leland, the skillfully underwritten love
scene between Delia and Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Cleage suggests the larger social currents of a volatile period,
raising issues still valid today.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Morris has directed Cleage's script naturally and
unobtrusively, bringing thoughtfulness to the play's issues and
delicacy to the well-limned relationships.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent cast brings Cleage's characters to vivid life with
no false notes. BeBe Wilson is marvelous as Angel _ tough, saucy,
just a bit soured on things but still resilient.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Washington understates deftly as Guy _ natural, relaxed,
appealing and self-aware.
</P>
<P>
   Melita Hawkins makes a fine Delia. She reflects the sense and
sweetness of a devoted crusader who is herself demure, reticent and
ladylike.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Stansberry brings a quiet strength and seriousness to Sam,
the ``Doc'' who pragmatically faces matters of life and death, but
just as pragmatically recognizes that when he is off duty, it is
time to ``let the good times roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Marshall plays Leland with affable, well-meaning
earnestness, but also makes it clear that he is on a different
wavelength, bewildered by his new Harlem set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blues for an Alabama Sky'' is a refreshing look at a
fascinating time and place in the American experience, a welcome
depiction of black lives not usually explored on stage or screen. &QL;

STAMP HONORS ERA, NOT THE PEOPLE

<P>
   D &UR; orothea Lange &LR; 's heartbreaking photo ``Migrant Mother'' is the
image on one of 15 stamps honoring the '30s, issued with fanfare
last month by the Postal Service. This week, a woman who as a
little girl is pictured on the stamp said she was disappointed that
her late mother, who raised a family during the toughest decade of
the century, received less attention than the imaginary hero
Superman.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph, taken by Lange in 1936 for the Farm Security
Administration, featured  &UR; Florence Thompson &LR;  of Modesto (who died
in 1983) with three daughters.  &UR; Ruby Sprague, &LR;  (on the right), &LR;  has
died of cancer;  &UR; Katherine McIntosh &LR;  (on the left) and  &UR; Norma &LR; 
 &UR; Rydlewski &LR;  (in Thompson's arms) are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very uncommon for the Postal Service to print stamps of
individuals who have not been dead for at least 10 years,'' reader
 &UR; Emmett Corrigan &LR;  wrote a few days ago. ``Never heard of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Horace Hinshaw  &LR; of the Postal Service insists that the stamp
isn't honoring the people it depicts ``but rather the event: the
Depression era. ... To be honored with a stamp, a person must have
been deceased for 10 years, with the exception of a past president.
... There is no stamp that features people who are still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh, 67 sees it differently: If the photo was about an era,
the era was about the people who endured it. McIntosh, who lives in
Modesto and works for Frito-Lay, says the Postal Service hasn't
properly honored her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the year, when the subjects were asked for permission
to use the picture, they agreed to keep the news quiet. Then they
learned that first-day-of-issue ceremonies would take place in
September in Cleveland, &LR;  because Superman, one of the other stamp
``honorees,'' had first been drawn there. McIntosh and Rydlewski
paid their own way to be on hand.
</P>
<P>
   During the festivities, however, ``there was nothing mentioned
that we were there,'' McIntosh told Personals. ``We were very
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to honor Mother, but it was all for Superman. He's a
fictitious character. We were very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh says she can't understand the Postal Service's
insistence that the image is not about people.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother's picture shows up everywhere, she said, ``even in
Russia, I've heard. And my little grandson has a dictionary in his
school, and under the word `haggard' is that picture. Her face will
never be forgotten.''

   _ The Yale Daily News has joined the Georgetown student
newspaper in calling on  &UR; President Clinton &LR; , an alumnus of both
institutions, to resign. Nonetheless, Bill and  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR; 
are planning to attend their 25th reunion at Yale Law School next
week. ``People are entitled to their views,'' White House
spokeswoman  &UR; Amy Weiss &LR;  told the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Bozeman, Mont., Judge  &UR; Frank Davis  &LR; has ruled that  &UR; Pat &LR; 
 &UR; Shannon &LR; , who had a 29-year affair with  &UR; Charles Kuralt &LR; , is not
entitled to a painting, a desk, a desk chair and a rug. The judge
had ruled earlier that she wasn't entitled to 90 acres of land
around a house she and Kuralt had occupied.

observed, Monday's debate and votes in the House Judiciary
Committee marked only the third time in the nation's history that
impeachment of a President has been formally considered on Capitol
Hill. In that limited sense, the approval of a full-scale
impeachment process was historic. But it was by no means decisive,
no matter how much the legislators huffed and puffed. It was only a
first short step along a rocky road whose length is not known. By

   EMBASSY-BOMBER (Moroni, Comoros Islands) _ Nearly two months

hailed from different countries, labored in various professions but
shared a devotion to radical Islam and a striking ability to keep
family and friends in the dark about what American prosecutors
charge were their true activities. Comoran officials are
embarrassed that Abdallah Mohammed Fazul (who was indicted in the
United States under the name ``Haroun Fazil,'' an alias he
apparently used in Kenya) has turned the world's eyes on them. But
they say he is a true product of the forces that shaped his
tropical nation -- poverty, Islam, racism, and French colonialism.

   OVER-THE-HILL-GANG (New York) _ Five men from Brooklyn are
arrested for a series of burglaries in the New York City region
that may date back 15 or 20 years. The men were characterized by
some as the ``Smash and Grab Gang,'' because they would typically
break one window and be out with jewelry, furs, money and antiques
and be out of the house in less than 5 minutes. But one prosecutor
today called them ``The Over-the-Hill Gang,'' because they are all
in their 50s. One has had a stroke and is in a nursing home.

TWO HOSPITAL COMPANIES CHARGED IN FRAUD SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The government announced Monday that it had sued two of the
nation's biggest hospital companies, contending that they had
defrauded federal health programs over more than 14 years through a
huge scheme involving bogus expense claims.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, brought against Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. and
Quorum Health Group in federal district court in Tampa, Fla., comes
after years of investigation into allegations of fraud at the
companies. It contends that the hospital giants routinely
overstated expenses in reports to the government to increase their
compensation from federal programs like Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said in a statement that in addition to
their corporate parents, more than 200 hospitals in 37 states were
defendants. Columbia owns some 320 hospitals, while Quorum owns or
operates about 250 hospitals. Also named in the suit was
Healthtrust, a for-profit hospital chain now owned by Columbia, and
Quorum Health Resources, a subsidiary of Quorum that is the
country's largest manager of not-for-profit hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was originally filed under seal in 1993 by one
corporate whistle-blower. Under the federal statute governing such
cases, the suit was then reviewed and investigated by the Justice
Department, which filed its motion to join the litigation last
week.
</P>
<P>
   For Columbia, the world's largest health care company, the
lawsuit marks the first time since a series of government raids
last year that federal officials have contended that the company
itself engaged in a sweeping fraud scheme. The government had
previously brought criminal charges against four Columbia
executives who had been involved in the preparation of cost reports
for one Florida hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Quorum, which has been under investigation since 1993 for
possible irregularities in its cost reports, was part of the
Hospital Corporation of America until the late 1980s. Columbia
bought HCA in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the litigation are the workings of a complex,
little-understood part of modern hospitals known as the federal
cost-reporting system, one that has meant billions of dollars in
reimbursements by the government to hospitals and other health care
providers over the years. Those reports generate hundreds of
millions of dollars in payments each year to Columbia and Quorum
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Through that system, portions of costs associated with patient
care are reimbursed by programs like Medicare at different rates.
But, in its suit, the government contends that the companies
intentionally misrepresented costs to increase the reimbursement
rate or receive payment for costs that were not eligible for
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lawsuit does not specify the amount the government
is seeking from the two companies, it says that through the scheme,
federal health programs ``have been damaged in the amount of many
millions of dollars.'' Analysts have estimated that Columbia may
have to pay more than $1 billion to settle the various fraud claims
being investigated by the government, including the cost-reporting
case.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the government's critical evidence in the case comes
from secret, duplicate sets of cost reports and work sheets
maintained at the hospitals that contained significantly lower
expenses than those in reports submitted to the government,
according to the suit. Much of that information was obtained by the
government during a civil investigation into the two companies'
cost-reporting practices.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal statement to its employees issued Monday,
Columbia said that the issues raised in the suit were not new. But
the statement added that the government action could well be an
important step in bringing an end to the dispute. ``We anticipate
that the government joining of this lawsuit will facilitate our
ability to reach a resolution of these issues,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   James Dalton, president and chief executive of Quorum, said in a
statement Monday that the company had always strived to submit
honest claims to the government. ``Throughout Quorum's existence,
we have tried our very best to follow all the applicable rules,''
he said. ``Quorum is very proud of the rigorous honesty and the
highest ethical values that we believe our people _ from management
to all of our associates _ exhibit every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was originally filed under seal by James Alderson,
former chief financial officer of North Valley Hospital in
Whitefish, Mont., which is managed by Quorum. Last week, the
government filed its motion to join Alderson's suit.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by Phillips &AMP; Cohen, Alderson's lawyers, said
that their client was ordered to file aggressive cost reports with
the government and establish a second document called a ``reserve
report.'' The second document, the statement says, contained
accurate information about the true expenses. When Alderson refused
to follow those instructions, the lawyers said in their statement,
he was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Meagher, a lawyer for Alderson, said that his client was
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The case was brought under the False Claims Act, which allows
whistle-blowers to file suit on behalf of the government. Under
that Civil War-era law, the government can potentially recover
three times any amount defrauded from a federal program. If the
suit is successful, Alderson stands to receive as much as 25
percent of any amount recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the case said that the investigation had
obtained large amounts of evidence proving the fraud and that the
final claim against the companies could be huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence we have seen absolutely establishes systemic
wrongdoing at Columbia,'' said Meagher. ``Given the size of
reimbursement claims contained in the cost reports, the liability
is potentially staggering.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 33-page complaint spells out a wide array of methods it
contends were used to misrepresent costs and defraud federal health
programs. Many of those methods have never previously been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the suit says that the companies often
misrepresented expenses in their reports that were unrelated to
patient care _ and thus not reimbursable. The suit says that the
companies included costs associated with marketing, physician
recruitment and even hospital televisions. Each of those costs was
misrepresented in the filed cost reports, according to the lawsuit,
but were identified correctly in the second set of reports.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the suit says, the companies were ``keeping two sets
of books _ one for the as-filed cost report and one for the reserve
report.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, shares of Quorum fell $1.50, to $13.50, while Columbia
dropped 31.25 cents, to $19.75. The shares of both companies
touched their low price for the year.

ANALYSIS: ROCKY ROAD, LENGTH UNKNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ind., Mich., Mass.)  (See also CLINTON-IMPEACH, CLINTON-SCENE, CLINTON-TEXT,
CLINTON-BOWLES) 
(mk) 
 By R.W. APPLE JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As several of its members observed, Monday's debate
and votes in the House Judiciary Committee marked only the third
time in the nation's history that impeachment of a president has
been formally considered on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In that limited sense, the approval of a full-scale impeachment
process was historic. But it was by no means decisive, no matter
how much the legislators huffed and puffed.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a first short step along a rocky road whose length
is not known _not by President Clinton, not by the public and not
even by committee members (although the chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., said this weekend that he hoped the House of
Representatives could finish its work before year's end).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution provides our compass,'' said Rep. Edward
Pease, R-Ind. ``I intend to follow it.'' But neither he nor his
colleagues could say for sure where it would ultimately point.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in the same room where Richard Nixon's fate was sealed a
quarter-century ago, Republicans stressed parallels to that era.
This case is about law-breaking, they said, and not about illicit
sex. To which Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee's
senior Democrat, retorted: ``This is not about Watergate. It is
about an extramarital affair.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the fault line, so far unbridgeable, between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
   People in Washington universally assume that the House as a
whole will vote later this week to ratify the committee's decision.
The Republicans have the votes to prevail. But if only Republicans
support the procedural plans set out by their leadership, as was
the case in the final vote Monday night, the decision will be seen
by many in the country as a purely partisan proposition.
</P>
<P>
   That next roll call will help set the tone for what lies ahead.
If only a half-dozen Democrats join the Republicans, the image of
trench warfare will be reinforced and the subsequent inquiry will
begin under something of a cloud; if 50 or 75 do so, the vote will
confer a greater degree of legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   The more the average voter thinks that the Republicans are
ganging up on the president, his strategists believe, the better
his chances of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, consensus or something approaching it may develop
later. Only well into the final stages of the committee's 1974
hearings on the impeachment of Nixon did significant numbers of
Republican members join the Democrats in concluding that Nixon had
committed impeachable offenses. The fact that they finally did led
people on both sides to judge its actions fair.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case of presidential impeachment, Andrew Johnson
survived a Senate trial because just enough members of the
opposition party broke ranks and voted to back him.
</P>
<P>
   Once this week's votes have been taken, attention will shift to
the midterm elections on Nov. 3. The conventional wisdom in
Washington has shifted rapidly in recent days, from a belief in the
days before the release of Kenneth Starr's report that changes
would be minimal, especially in the House, to a suspicion that
Democratic losses would be large, which took hold in the days
before the tape of Clinton's grand jury testimony was released.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a growing conviction that the Republicans erred by
releasing the tape, creating a backlash that could help marginal
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Two caveats seem in order, however. While the president's
troubles seem less likely to influence Senate races, Democrats were
in big trouble in those without any drag from Washington. A number
of independent analysts see Republican gains of four to six seats.
Major losses in the House are still possible, too, perhaps 20 or
more seats if Republican voters turn out en masse and Democrats do
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astonished,'' said a senior Republican senator on Capitol
Hill, who comes from the Sun Belt. ``Differential turnouts aren't
really very common, you know. But this year, Democratic voters seem
to be in a sulk, and the Republicans act like they'd turn out even
if it snowed on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Big gains might embolden Republican legislators in their pursuit
of Clinton. But the political terrain is tricky. After November,
both parties will have to play to the 2000 electorate _ larger,
spread more broadly across the economic scale, and less intensely
partisan _ and that might have a tempering effect on the zeal of
the Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed terms of the case developed by the inquiry, and how
it is developed, will have an impact as well. Unshakeable as the
preconceptions of many committee members sounded Monday, experience
suggests that over a long period, some of them and some others in
the House will change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton and Monica Lewinsky are called as witnesses, their
deportment will certainly influence some representatives. How they
and their interrogators behave will influence voters as well.
Clinton is a formidable persuader, and any attempt to break down
his testimony would run the risk of alienating people who would
sense disrespect for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign crisis _ a genuine foreign crisis, as opposed to one
that the administration was suspected of inventing _ could
radically change the context of the inquiry, too. Republicans might
find themselves under fire for distracting the commander in chief
from important security responsibilites.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the topics other than Ms. Lewinsky that Starr has
investigated? Hyde insisted Monday night that the independent
counsel was still pursuing the original Whitewater matter and other
controversies; one of the committee's ranking Democrats, Rep.
Barney Frank of Massachusetts, insisted that no more would be
forthcoming from Starr. Ambiguity keeps the pot boiling; wrapping
up the other cases would take some of the steam out of the House
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   All of those ideas, all of those possibilities will be in the
air as the House debates impeachment in November and December.
Depending on how they coalesce, the Republican leadership might or
might not be receptive to a compromise, either before a committee
vote or after a committee vote to approve articles of impeachment,
before ratification by the House as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   At any time, of course, Clinton could change his mind and decide
to resign. Nixon's decision to quit came after the committee had
voted. But it was motivated by the emergence of new evidence (the
``smoking gun'') more than the vote itself, plus the belief he
could not win in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say he would rather be a second Andrew Johnson,
surviving in the Senate by a tiny margin, than a second Richard
Nixon. As things now stand, he would appear to have a good chance
of getting the 34 votes he would need (one-third of the total plus
one) to win a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not chiseled in stone, either. The Republicans could
have 60 seats by the time the case reached the Senate. In that
case, if they lost none of their own partisans, a switch of only
seven Democrats would doom Clinton. A remote possibility,
certainly, but then so much of what has happened so far in this
case seemed highly improbable until it happened.

IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS FOR NIXON WERE JUST AS PARTISAN 
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On Jan. 31, 1974, at the end of a session similar
to the one Monday, the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously
to recommend to the full House that an impeachment inquiry against
President Richard M. Nixon be authorized.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, the House voted, 410-4, to begin the formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, this looks like a paragon of bipartisanship. And
that is the way many Judiciary Committee members Monday referred to
the Nixon proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., pointed to a portrait of Peter
Rodino of New Jersey, the Democrat who headed the Judiciary
Committee in the Nixon years, and declared, ``He brought fairness
to these hearings 24 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steven Rothman, a Democrat who now is the only member of
the committee from New Jersey, said that Rodino had ``set the
standard for American fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that although the Judiciary Committee back then
may have been a bit more temperate than the panel was Monday, its
deliberations in 1974 were frequently angry and highly partisan.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Republicans, then in the minority, fought
unsuccessfully to have a time limit placed on the investigation, to
limit the scope of the inquiry and to establish a definition of
impeachable offenses _ the same battles the Democrats waged and
lost Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the unanimous and lopsided votes were taken in 1974, one
vote after another to establish the rules and procedures had been
cast along party lines. One such vote would have given Republicans
control of one-third of the committee's budget and staff.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Republicans were given only a dozen of the more than
130 staff positions on the inquiry. Democrats now have about
one-third of the slots on a much smaller staff.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most junior Democratic lawyers in 1974 was Hillary
Rodham, 26 years old when she was hired and six months out of law
school. She did legal and factual research on a variety of topics,
said those who worked with her, but was never in a decision-making
position. The following year, she married Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi is the only Republican in
Congress today who was a member of the Judiciary Committee that
investigated Nixon. Now the Senate Republican leader, Lott, who
voted against all articles of impeachment, was asked last month how
he remembered those proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that was bipartisan, I would like to see partisanship,'' he
replied. ``I remember very definitely how partisan I thought it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, in words strikingly similar to what Democrats said
Monday, Lott told Congressional Quarterly: ``It has all been
decided. We are just going through an exercise. Right now, I doubt
whether it will be expeditious or fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In an Op-Ed article Monday in The Washington Post, M. Caldwell
Butler, who was a congressman from Virginia in 1974 and one of the
six (out of 17) Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who voted
for impeachment, ran through a series of partisan moves by Rodino
and his Democratic colleagues that preceded the Jan. 31 committee
vote and added, ``Partisanship continued throughout the inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one big difference between the partisanship then
and now, it is that the party leaders in Congress in 1974 expressed
respect for one another.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after Rodino promised to try to wrap up his inquiry
by the end of April, John Rhodes of Arizona, then the House
Republican leader, spoke against a Republican effort to set an
April 30 deadline in law. Rodino's word, Rhodes declared, was
``good with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodino's promise to the contrary, the inquiry was not concluded
until July 30.
</P>
<P>
   Like theologians debating the Scriptures, the lawmakers at the
hearing Monday sifted through the documents of yesteryear to find
quotations that applied to the positions they are now taking.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the top Democrat on
the Judiciary Committee and the only member Monday who was on the
Nixon panel, used this quotation from a 1974 staff report on what
constitutes impeachable offense: ``Constitutional wrongs that
subvert the structure of government or undermine the integrity of
office and even the Constitution itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., quoted another part of the same
report as saying that there were ``no fixed standards for
determining whether grounds for impeachment exist.''

A LAWMAKER ASKS: WATERGATE OR PEYTON PLACE?

By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The question rang forth from the committee room as
a succinct outcry at what the nation is being put through: ``Is
this Watergate or Peyton Place?''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintive query, put by Rep. Lindsey Graham to his
colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee, was the gist of the
committee's agenda as, steeped in anguish as much as partisanship,
the panel proceeded toward a formal impeachment inquiry by Congress
against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is I have no clue yet,'' said the South Carolina
Republican as he weighed his own open question: Is President
Clinton's coverup of an intimate affair with a White House intern
the high-crime stuff of Richard M. Nixon's downfall? Or is it a
gross Beltway bodice-ripper that deserves only a sorry rebuke for
its relentless domination of the nation and its political leaders?
</P>
<P>
   For all the allusions to sex and mendacity, this day was notable
for the frequent invocation of the Watergate impeachment scandal of
1974. A shift in mood from the sensational to the purgative was in
the air as the issue was finally put to measure against the
Constitution and mercifully free of further disclosures about DNA
stains and confessional tape-recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing nothing less than the symptoms of a cancer
on the presidency,'' cried Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., Congress' most
dedicated Clinton antagonist, taking the case to the president's
jugular as he invoked the ultimate Watergate allusion _ the
malignancy warning delivered to Nixon as his incumbency approached
the brink.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., was no less passionate as he
thundered that the public is smart enough to see that Clinton's
failings are not the impeachable stuff of Watergate. ``Is this
where we want to set the bar for future presidents?'' he boomed out
while day-long television coverage delivered the 37-member
committee as a fresh cast of characters for the impeachment
struggle's rise to the next tier of national concern. ``End this
nonsense,'' Wexler pleaded. ``We have work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The shadow of Watergate took hold early as Rep. Henry J. Hyde,
R-Ill., who chairs the committee, gaveled the session to order
under the committee portrait of Peter W. Rodino Jr., the retired
committee chairman who presided over the downfall of Nixon. Rodino,
now a law professor in New Jersey, has been quietly consulted by
committee members for weeks, as if he offers oracular powers in the
current struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I observed that national ordeal from afar,'' said Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., recalling for the committee his law school days
at the University of Arkansas. ``The rule of law was the mantra and
Watergate was the real-life case study,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the brightest and most respected young law professors
at that time was William Jefferson Clinton,'' he added in a
bittersweet tone as he sat in potential indictment of the Little
Rock professor who became president.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson offered his own concerns to the panel about his law
school lessons: ``Are not the important questions the same? Is the
rule of law less significant today than 25 years ago? Is unchecked
perjury _ if proven _ less of a threat to our judicial system today
than when Watergate was the example?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Through the day, Hyde was easygoing as he looked forth upon the
scene. Eight seats were reserved for the public, with the news
media otherwise packing Room 2141 in the Rayburn House Office
Building. A time-tattered copy of the Senate Watergate hearing
record tilted on one desk corner. A slice of cold pizza curled atop
a nest of TV equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., leafed through a paperback copy of
The Federalist Papers as others spoke. ``We would be better off,''
she told the committee in her turn, ``if we spent more time reading
what George Mason and James Madison said to each other than what
Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp said to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebuke of the president debated by some as a possible
punishment for the president was already being delivered by Rep.
Steve Buyer, R-Ind. He compared military drill sergeants, recently
court-martialed and imprisoned for having seduced subordinates,
with their ``commander in chief,'' noting testimony that Clinton
was on the telephone with a congressman, eating pizza and
discussing ``life-and-death'' matters in Bosnia, ``while he had a
subordinate perform a sex act on him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,'' the
congressman added icily.
</P>
<P>
   With elections only four weeks off, the Democrats took care to
endorse the idea of at least a limited inquiry, even as they railed
against the Republican measure as too open-ended. Some were ready
to stipulate without further lengthy inquiry Clinton's guilt: The
president had ``an adulterous relationship with a White House
employee half his age'' and misled the nation in ``a dangerous game
of verbal twister in his sworn testimony,'' said Rep. Martin T.
Meehan, D-Mass., who questioned whether that merited impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As they talked toward dusk, committee members said they were fed
up with Clinton's predicament in many ways. Rep. Howard Coble,
R-N.C., related what one furious voter who disagreed with his
position told him: ``I hope you die a painful death from prostate
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Various lawmakers disowned all sheerly political machinations
and fears _ ``even the possibility of a President Gore,'' said Rep.
Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., summoning his party strategists' ultimate
unintended consequence. ``This is about seeking the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   As he mused between Watergate and Peyton Place, Graham said
censure was a suitable punishment for Clinton ``if this guy just
has a problem and can't control it.''

<P>
   ``No need to turn the country upside down,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   But if the president obstructed justice by having aides secretly
and illegally ``going after women or anybody else'' who gets in his
way, impeachment is merited, Graham said. ``That is Richard Nixon
times ten,'' he declared, once more summoning the ghost of
Watergate before the House committee.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ With elections next month in 36 states, including the
8 most populous, this year's campaigns for governor will determine
whether the Republicans maintain their remarkable hegemony in the
nation's statehouses or the Democrats rebound from their
catastrophic losses of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome rests with more than a dozen fiercely competitive
races, including those in California, where the lieutenant
governor, Gray Davis, is trying to break the Republicans' 16-year
hold on the state's top office, and here in Georgia, where Guy
Millner, a businessman who lost two previous tries for statewide
office, hopes to become the first Republican governor since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when the economy remains fundamentally sound and polls
show that most Americans approve of the country's direction, the
Republicans begin with the advantage of running 18 incumbents,
compared with 6 Democratic incumbents and one independent, Gov.
Angus S. King Jr. of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   And at the moment, polls show that Republican candidates hold
leads, some of them seemingly insurmountable, in seven of the eight
most populous states _ Texas, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Ohio and Michigan. The exception is California, where
Attorney General Dan Lungren, the Republican nominee, is thought to
be trailing Davis by a slim margin.
</P>
<P>
   The status of those races has given Republican strategists
confidence that they will at least maintain their current count of
32 seats and possibly pick up a few more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say that Republican governors may rival
the National Park Service after this election in terms of their
sheer control of land mass,'' said Chris Henick, a political
consultant and former executive director of the Republican
Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are running unexpectedly strong races in states
like Alabama, New Mexico and South Carolina, and if a few
significant races break their way they could still reclaim a share
of the turf that was ceded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disaster for Democratic governors four years ago, so
clearly we'd like to pick up some seats,'' said Gov. Howard Dean of
Vermont, the immediate past chairman of the Democratic Governors
Association. ``The rebuilding process is long and difficult. You've
just got to outwork the opposition and get better candidates than
they do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 elections, the number of Republican governors soared
to 30 from 19, the party's largest one-year gain since 1938. The
Republicans lifted their tally to 32 in 1996, when they took
control of governorships in Louisiana and Arkansas. Only once this
century has the GOP exceeded its current count, and that was back
in 1921-22, when it had 34 governors.
</P>
<P>
   The party has made similar gains in state legislatures and now
control both houses in 18 states, an increase of 10 over 1994.
Democrats have two-house majorities in 20 states, and 11
legislatures have each party controlling one chamber. (Nebraska has
a unicameral and nonpartisan legislature.)
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, with support from a devolutionary
Congress, those Republican governors and lawmakers have left an
unmistakable imprint on national policies on taxation, welfare,
criminal justice and education. And if the Republicans hold or
expand their trove of governorships, their dominance could become
self-perpetuating after the next round of redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the governors elected on Nov. 3 will have veto power
over the drawing of district maps after the 2000 census, giving
them influence for a decade over the partisan makeup of the U.S.
House of Representatives and of their own legislatures. And because
many governors still exert considerable control over the political
machinery in their states, the outcome of this year's races also
could affect the organizing strength of the parties in the next
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic strategists said that their party was suffering
now because it did not pay enough attention to building its second
string in the years when it dominated gubernatorial politics. ``The
Republicans have done a much better job developing the so-called
B-team,'' said Harold Ickes, a former White House aide who now
advises the Democratic Governors Association. ``I think we got sort
of fat and lazy, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   The party also must contend this year with uncertainty over the
turnout of its base voters, which could be depressed by
demoralization over President Clinton's troubles. Studies show that
turnout in non-presidential election years typically drops anyway,
a phenomenon that tends to favor Republicans because their core
supporters vote more reliably.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists in both parties said that most races for governor
this year are being waged on local issues, not national ones, with
candidates parrying over tax cuts, education reform, managed care,
gun control and juvenile justice. But some Republican operatives
are convinced that the White House scandal is having at least an
indirect effect on Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been amazed at how few of them are getting any
traction,'' said Clinton Key, executive director of the Republican
Governors Association. ``There's got to be a reason for it, and I
think it's Clinton. Not in a specific sense but just as a general
malaise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethical questions surrounding Clinton clearly have
influenced strategy in a handful of states, including California,
Maryland, South Carolina and Georgia, where candidates have been
prompted to emphasize character, integrity and trust.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here in Georgia, for instance, the Democratic nominee, State
Rep. Roy Barnes, has been broadcasting a television advertisement
that attacks Millner on ethical questions, including being fined
for failing to report contributions to a previous campaign. ``This
year more than ever, character counts,'' the advertisement
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Millner has fired back with an advertisement
of his own that criticizes Barnes for, among other things, getting
in a shoving match with a prosecutor while defending a client in a
criminal case. ``If character is the question, Roy Barnes isn't the
answer,'' the advertisement maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kahn, Barnes' campaign manager, said he probably would
not have opened the war on character were it not for Clinton's
travails. ``I'm not sure we would have,'' he said. ``But it's
certainly on everybody's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week
gave Millner a lead over Barnes of 47 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican incumbents in the strongest position include
Govs. George Bush of Texas, George Pataki of New York, Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania and John Engler of Michigan, all of whom are far ahead
in the most recent polls and are expected to cruise to victory.
</P>
<P>
   In the contest for Florida's open seat, a poll released last
week showed Jeb Bush, a Republican who lost in the 1994 governor's
race, with a 15 percentage point lead over Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay,
the Democratic nominee. MacKay has had to contend with demoralizing
defections from prominent black Democrats. And his campaign
manager, Robin Rorapaugh, complained that her campaign could not
break through the news media's obsession with the White House sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts so much clutter in front of voters that it's hard for
a local candidate to talk about local issues,'' Ms. Rorapaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Top Republican strategists, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, say that the Florida race is all but over, and leading
Democrats acknowledge that it is very uphill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is, ugh, we have a major challenge,'' said Gov. Pedro
Rossello of Puerto Rico, the chairman of the Democratic Governors
Association. ``It's doable but time is running out.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, where Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, is retiring,
the Republican nominee, Secretary of State George Ryan, has held a
constant lead of 20 percentage points or more over his Democratic
opponent, U.S. Rep. Glenn Poshard, for more than a month. In Ohio,
where Gov. George Voinovich, a Republican, is retiring to run for
U.S. Senate, the Republican candidate, Secretary of State Bob Taft,
has a lead of just under 10 percentage points in the most recent
public polls over his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Lee
Fisher. Democratic strategists maintain that internal polling shows
that the race is tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also are heavily favored to maintain governorships
in Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Wyoming. In Massachusetts,
where the Democratic nominee, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger,
has struggled to maintain party discipline, a poll released last
week shows Acting Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci, a Republican, with a
lead of 11 percentage points. Democrats are expected to keep
control in Alaska, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bush in Florida, GOP candidates are leading in
several states where Democrats govern, including Hawaii, Nebraska
and Nevada. Conversely, polls show that the Democratic candidate in
Minnesota, Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, is ahead in his
campaign to reclaim that state for his party.
</P>
<P>
   But many major races remain neck-and-neck and are likely to stay
that way until election day. In Maryland, for instance, polls show
the incumbent Democrat, Parris N. Glendening, in a dead heat with
Ellen Sauerbrey, the Republican legislator who lost the 1994
election for governor by 6,000 votes out of 1.4 million cast.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, the former Albuquerque mayor, Martin Chavez, a
Democrat, is waging a spirited campaign to wrest control from the
Republican incumbent, Gov. Gary Johnson, in a race that strategists
expect to be close to the end. The same is true in Alabama,
although a poll taken late last week showed Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman,
the Democratic nominee, with an expanding lead of 13 percentage
points over Gov. Fob James Jr., a Republican who has become a
national icon for school prayer advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising Republican vulnerability is in South
Carolina, where public polls show that the Democratic challenger,
Jim Hodges, has cut the lead of Gov. David Beasley to 9 percentage
points from 15 in the last month. Beasley is chairman of the
Republican Governors Association, a job typically given to a
governor who has few worries about his own re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Other close races can be found in Rhode Island, which features a
rematch of the 1994 campaign between Gov. Lincoln Almond, a
Republican, and Myrth York, his Democratic challenger, and in
Colorado, where State Treasurer Bill Owens, a Republican, faces Lt.
Gov. Gail Schoettler.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO OPEN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a long day that veered from sober
constitutional discourse to bitter partisan scrapping, the House
Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Monday night to
recommend that Congress open a formal impeachment investigation
into a president for only the third time in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   With a 21-16 committee majority, Republicans sent to the House a
resolution modeled after the language used in the Watergate
inquiry. It authorizes the committee ``to investigate fully and
completely whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of
Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach
William Jefferson Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats tried and failed, on another party line vote, to
substitute a plan for a more limited, two-phase inquiry. It would
have required the committee first to define an impeachable offense
before deciding whether to open a formal inquiry of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats sharply condemned Clinton's behavior but said it
fell short of warranting impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is set to vote on the impeachment inquiry Friday,
as one of its last acts before recessing for the midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the memories of Watergate were summoned
repeatedly as Republicans and Democrats presented sharply different
views of the severity of the president's lies and evasions over his
affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Making the case for an impeachment inquiry, David Schippers, the
chief investigative counsel for the Republicans, told the committee
that ``substantial and credible evidence'' existed of possibly 15
impeachable offenses by Clinton _ more than the 11 such charges
made by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The core of his argument concerned the sanctity of the nation's
judicial system and the president's role as the nation's chief law
enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle that every witness in every case must tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, is the foundation
of the American system of justice which is the envy of every
civilized nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If lying under oath is tolerated and when exposed, is not
visited with immediate and substantial adverse consequences,''
Schippers said, ``the integrity of this country's entire judicial
process is fatally compromised and that process will inevitably
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers recast Starr's own charges somewhat. He dropped what
many lawyers considered to be Starr's two weakest accusations of
abuse of power stemming from White House claims of executive
privilege and from Clinton's refusal to voluntarily testify while
lying to potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   He divided some of Starr's charges and added several new ones,
including a failure to disclose Ms. Lewinsky's filing of a false
affidavit and a ``conspiracy'' to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of a conspiracy, he highlighted three days of
constant phone calls to and from the White House showing Clinton
reaching out to his friend, Vernon Jordan, and his secretary, Betty
Currie, after he denied a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in
a deposition in the sexual harassment case of Paula Jones in
January. The calls then show Ms. Currie trying repeatedly to find
Ms. Lewinsky, instructing her in code to ``Call Kay.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending his testimony with a touch of drama,, Schippers asked to
speak not as a committee staff member, but as a citizen, a ``father
and a grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrasing Sir Thomas Moore from the play ``A Man of All
Seasons,'' he said, ``The laws of this country are the great
barriers that protect the citizen from the winds of evil and
tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   Lecturing the committee, the Chicago lawyer who is a lifelong
Democrat, added, ``Fifteen generations of Americans, our fellow
Americans, many of whom are reposing in military cemeteries
throughout the world, are looking down on and judging what you do
today.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Democrats objected to this, Rep. Henry Hyde, the
committee chairman who had selected Schippers as his counsel, had
the remarks removed from the record.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuttal, Abbe Lowell, the counsel for the Democrats pn the
committee, countered that impeachment is reserved only for high
crimes against the state and that no matter how the Republicans had
recast Starr's case, ``one basic allegation _ the president was
engaged in an improper relationship which he did not want disclosed
_ is the core charge.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Schippers, he contested the legal significance of
Clinton's original lie about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in
the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said that the judge in the case, Susan Webber Wright of
Federal District Court in Little Rock, Ark., had called evidence
about Ms. Lewinsky unessential to the sexual harassment case
against the president. He noted that the judge ultimately ruled
that regardless of what Clinton had done with other women, Ms.
Jones had not proven that she had suffered any harm after her
alleged encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge was giving the committee the ability to determine
that the president's statements, whether truthful or not, were not
of the legal importance suggested by Starr,'' he said, ``let alone
grave constitutional significance to support impeachment.''

NBA ANNOUNCES CANCELLATION OF ENTIRE PRESEASON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision that will almost certainly lead to the first work
stoppage in National Basketball Association history, the league
Monday announced the cancellation of all 114 preseason games.
Citing stalled negotiations with the Players Association over a new
collective bargaining agreement, league officials said they would
decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season
games.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision had been expected for 10 days, it nonetheless
sent a strong signal that the owners and players will probably be
willing to cancel at least part of the regular season in order to
settle their labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that it would take at least three weeks to hold
abbreviated training camps and sign over 200 free agents to new
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, officials on both sides do not believe the season
will start as scheduled on Nov. 3 or even before December. Unlike
Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the
National Hockey League, the NBA has never lost a regular-season
game to labor strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we're not even negotiating, you have to conclude it's
very likely that we're going miss some part of the regular
season,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said Monday night.
``We'll try and defer any decisions until the last minute, but
right now it does not look good.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides will meet on Thursday _ their first official
bargaining session since Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern and a group of owners walked out of a
meeting after dismissing the merits of a new proposal from the
players. Neither Granik nor players association executive director
Billy Hunter sounded as if this week's meeting would go a long way
toward the signing of a new agreement _ the precursor to playing
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you have any choice but to miss games at this
point,'' Hunter said. ``In fact, I think the they've intended it
all along. They've locked us out, they've refused to negotiate and
they've given us a proposal that's ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are both sides still awaiting the outcome of an
arbitration decision that is due before Oct. 18 - the Fordham Law
School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more than 200
players with $800 million in guaranteed contracts should be paid
during the lockout _ but the owners and players also are making
time to win public opinion before they test their fans' loyalties
by canceling games.
</P>
<P>
   Monday in 11 cities throughout the country, the players are
holding make-shift press conferences at training-camp venues, NBA
arenas and gymnasiums. Patrick Ewing, the union president, and
several teammates will speak at SUNY-Purchase in Purchase, N.Y.,
where the Knicks train during the season. With training camp
originally scheduled to open on Oct. 6, the message from the
players is clear: if the owners would call an end to the lockout,
we would be ready to play today.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 players are expected to attend, speak and sign
autographs for fans afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish they would put their energies into trying to negotiate
a deal rather than the various other things that they've been
doing,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is essentially over how the owners and players will
judiciously divvy up $2 billion in income. It began last year with
the contention by the owners that their employees were receiving
more than their fair share of the pot. The owners were allowed to
terminate the current agreement because of a clause that enabled
them to do so after player salaries reached 53.8 percent of total
basketball-related income. The owners say that figure is currently
hovering around 57.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though many economic issues need to be resolved, the main point
of contention since the labor agreement expired and the owners
declared a lockout on July 1 has been a clause which allows teams
to pay their own free agents whatever they want, regardless of
salary-cap rules governing the NBA's 29 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Larry Bird exception, it was created to allow the
Hall of Fame Boston Celtics forward to re-sign with the Celtics
near the end of his career. Michael Jordan exercised the clause the
last two years with the Chicago Bulls, earning more than $30
million per season _ figures more than $5 million more what a team
is allowed to spend on all its players.
</P>
<P>
   But with exorbitant salaries paid to several unproven stars over
the last few years and $100 million deals sprouting up routinely,
the owners are determined to swing the income pendulum back toward
themselves by enforcing a restricted salary cap _ a hard cap _ and
putting a ceiling on how much one player could earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, the players received about $1 billion dollars in
salaries and benefits and we have made proposals that are
guaranteed to increase that number by 20 percent over the next four
years,'' Granik said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposals would result in an average player salary of more
than $3.1 million and a minimum salary for 10-year veterans of
$750,000. Unfortunately, the union leadership has been unwilling to
give any serious consideration to what we have offered.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter labeled those claims as optimistic projections, and shot
down a number of new proposals presented to the players on Sept.
25. ``If they had left the current deal in place, we would have
gotten much of that anyway,'' he added. ``All we're saying is,
we're not in position to accept a hard cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision to cancel the preseason came less than two
weeks after the NBA indefinitely postponed training camp and
canceled the first week of exhibition games. Through tickets sales
alone, Granik estimated that losing the exhibition season would
cost the league between $35 million and $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions about the cancellations of regular season games are
expected to be made next week, he added. A league official said the
games would be canceled in blocks of one or two weeks, depending
upon circumstances regarding negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's bargaining session has suddenly become the last hope
at starting the season on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurdles could be overcome very quickly, but I have no reason
to believe they will on Thursday,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Hunter: ``Of course they don't expect much to get done.
When Russ and David decide the negotiations are going to be real
and substantive, then something will happen. What they're banking
on now is that the players are going to miss paychecks and cave in
November. It's as if they've ingested something that has to pass.
And once it passes, then they'll negotiate.''

EMBASSY BOMB SUSPECT KNOWN FOR RELIGIOUSNESS, WIT, TEMPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORONI, Comoros _ The man accused of directing the bomb attack
on the American Embassy in Kenya came of age in this impoverished
Indian Ocean archipelago, a land where gifted teen-agers leave home
to enroll in the radical Islamic academies of Libya, Sudan and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   A tightly wound, brilliant student of the Koran who was thrown
out of religious school for caning a lazy pupil hard enough to draw
blood, Abdallah Mohammed Fazul set out for Pakistan 11 years ago,
at age 15, to continue his education.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime over the next few years, American authorities assert,
he fell under the sway of terrorists waging what they call a holy
war against the United States. He was transformed into a killer who
could coolly execute a bombing that left 250 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   He is still at large after being indicted in the United States
under an alias, Haroun Fazil, which he apparently used in Kenya. As
the object of a worldwide manhunt, he has a $2 million reward on
his head.
</P>
<P>
   The stark portrait of him as a terrorist baffles his wife, his
Koran teacher and relatives in Comoros, a country with a relatively
liberal Muslim character. Even relatives who admit that he had a
darker side say his religious fervor seemed limited to mundane
things like animosity to television and threats to chase family
members into the street if he caught them drinking beer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months after the bombings of the American Embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania, a picture of those charged in the case is
slowly emerging. They lived in different countries, labored in
various professions but shared a devotion to radical Islam and a
striking ability to keep family and friends in the dark about what
American prosecutors say were their true activities.
</P>
<P>
   Comoran officials express embarrassment that Fazil has turned
the world's eyes on them. But they say he is a true product of the
forces that shaped his tropical nation _ poverty, Islam, racism and
French colonialism. He is one of thousands of young Comorans who
have been forced by the lack of higher education to leave these
strange and beautiful islands, where the world's largest volcanic
crater meets startling aquamarine waves, where huge bats flit
between the palm trees by day and the moon glows vividly at night,
especially during power blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   They study far away, in harsh desert lands where the path to
holy martyrdom and the path to a bit of cash for a suffering family
back home are the same: Join the legions of the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments filed so far suggest that Fazil was no ordinary
legionnaire, but a highly intelligent, natural leader who played a
central role in the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   His wife's extended family lives in a yellow cinder-block
building behind a one-room Islamic school on an alley paved only
with sharp pumice. They graciously welcomed two journalists into
their threadbare rooms, offered coffee and talked for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, a first cousin who married him five years ago and
lived with him in Sudan and Kenya, called him a hard-working
computer student and said he sometimes disappeared for weeks at a
time. His big brother said he had been a gentle, sometimes boastful
child who could ``smurf-dance like Michael Jackson'' and never said
anything about hating America.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, those who knew him said in so many words that they
did not know him very well. His siblings did not see him for years
at a time, his wife does not expect a message even though he has
been gone more than a month, and his old teachers say he never
visited. Each said, ``He has no friends I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, Fazil headed the Kenya cell of Al Qaeda,
the terror network founded by Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi
businessman. It says Fazil rented the room where the bomb was
assembled and drove the white pickup that guided it to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, a week after the Nairobi blast, he flew here. He
visited relatives and his local mosque.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22, Fazil took a flight to Dubai. He had a ticket onward
to Pakistan, but it went unused, and he disappeared. His family
says he left without explaining, as was his custom, and they drove
him to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by Nairobi telephone records that showed calls to a
Moroni number, investigators descended on the family home on Sept.
2. The Comoran gendarmes were accompanied by FBI agents with
pistols and radio headsets, ``just like Delta Force'' said an
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   They took his brother, Omar, as well as his wife, Halima
Badroudine Fazul, 22, and sister-in-law, Nabatte Fazul, 19, in for
questioning. They also seized two computers, diskettes, a camera,
CDs and tapes, old letters, passports and birth certificates, two
Korans, piles of old Newsweek and Time magazines and Kenyan
newspapers, rubber stamps, most of the clothing of the family's men
and some belonging to women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the search ended badly. ``The FBI behaved correctly _
they were not threatening,'' said Halima Fazul. ``But the Comoran
gendarmes tipped my father out of bed to search it, even though he
had a catheter in him.''
</P>
<P>
   They banged on the ceiling over his bed with their gun butts,
she said. On her way back from the police station that evening, she
was told that her father, who had been suffering from a bleeding
ulcer, was collapsing. She ran, stumbling in the dark. ``He took my
hand and said, `Ah, Halima, you're back,''' and died, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about that later, a prosecutor and a ranking gendarme
both shrugged, saying they were unaware that the older man had
heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   No complete listing of the evidence against Fazil has been
issued _ some may still be being tested by the FBI _ but threads
can be pieced together from interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil had passports or ID documents from countries that he is
not a citizen of, apparently including Kenya and France, and stamps
for forging others.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan newspapers he had kept were mostly about the bombing,
an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a list of prominent Comorans who would have to be
killed to make way for fundamentalist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found a letter he wrote in 1991, when he was
19, to his brother Omar, then 24, in which he boasted that he had
been trained to use explosives and fire machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked his reaction, Omar Fazul, an English teacher, said: ``I
was impressed _ but I considered it childish. I thought he was
boasting. I didn't believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Fazul said he never discussed religion, politics or
military service with his brother. ``We talk only about family
problems,'' he said. ``It has never been proved to me that my
brother is an Islamist. He wears jeans and boots.''
</P>
<P>
   Fazil was born in 1973, the youngest of six, just before his
parents separated. He began Koranic studies at 4 with an uncle and
at 7 began studying with a professional teacher, Fundi Twawilou
Abdulfateh. By the age of 9, he knew the Koran by heart and was
giving religious instructions on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   He was so smart, another relative said, that he was in third
grade while his older sister was in first. He played soccer and the
flute and could do a standing flip. As a teen-ager, he showed off
with kung-fu fighting sticks and called himself James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   He also had moments of rage. He got into a fistfight with a
teacher at his French public school, and slammed younger students
down in their chairs when they failed at Koran recital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sometimes had a strange attitude,'' Fundi Twawilou said.
``On the soccer field, he would provoke fights with bigger guys.
When that guy would go to beat him, he would run away. So Omar, his
brother, would be beaten. But Omar has crippled feet, so Abdallah
would return to fight for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 11, he cut another pupil's ear. Asked to leave, he
studied for two years with Fundi Mohammed Ali, an older teacher,
who remembers him as ``brilliant, respectful to others, deeply
religious and very calm.''
</P>
<P>
   At 14, he switched to a school run by Fundi Soidiki Mbapandza,
one of the leading Islamic fundamentalists here, before leaving for
Pakistan. Outside the tin walls of that school compound, girls and
young women enter through one door, carefully avoiding eye contact
with the opposite sex, while male students glower aggressively at
visitors. Fundi Soidiki, who was questioned by the police, declined
several requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The most militant strains of fundamentalism are almost unknown
in Comoros. The islands are 99 percent Sunni Muslim, and many men
wear ankle-length shirts and Arab-style caps, while almost all
women wrap scarves around their bodies, legs and heads. But the
atmosphere is relaxed _ the scarves often merely adorn Western
dresses and few women hide their faces or hair. Speaking of Fazil,
Justice Minister Mohammed Abdou Mmadi said, ``Mr. Fazul learned a
different culture abroad. It would be impossible for a Comoran who
grew up here to become a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   The islands are very poor, with a gross domestic product of $470
per person. Tourists _ mostly divers _ are few, and 80 percent of
the local people are subsistence farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Because scholarships to France have dried up, many accept the
meager ones offered by religious colleges in Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan
and Libya, where they are recruited by fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of Haroun Fazils all over the world,
recruited into the foreign legion of Libya and the armies of
Iran,'' warned Said Hilali Moussa, chief of President Abdoulkarim
Taki's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Many families get only one letter from their departed sons, said
a tourism official. It says they are safe, living in a hostel.
``Then they don't hear from them for years, and they they find out
they are in the army. Lots end up fighting in Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Something like that happened to Fazil. ``When he came back from
Pakistan,'' a relative said, ``he told his mother he wanted to go
into the army. She told him, `It is up to you.'''
</P>
<P>
   After that he became more of a mystery. He was trained,
presumably in Afghanistan, and has lived in Sudan, Kenya and
perhaps in Yemen. He comes home only for short visits, never leaves
an address and calls from pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, on a brief visit, he went with his father to
Moheli Island to meet his uncle for the first time. His cousins
Halima, 17, and Nabatte, 14, were there. ``We were eating, and not
well dressed, so we were embarrassed,'' Halima Fazul recalled. ``We
ran inside to change.'' At the end of the day, he had his father
ask for her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fazul used to go fully veiled, with only her eyes showing,
relatives said, and neighbors in Kenya said the same thing. But
when she went out visiting in Comoros, she wore her scarf off her
face and was unfazed when her young son pulled it off in front of
male visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband used to wear the traditional long shirts but now
wears trousers and sometimes a suit. When teased about the Western
dress by his father, a relative said, he pointed at his heart and
replied: ``Proving you fear God is not in your clothes. It's in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He now has money, relatives said. He sends some home, and last
year paid half the cost for his mother to go to Paris for cancer
treatment. His wife cannot identify his boss or say exactly what he
does, except work on computers. ``He goes away at 8 and comes back
at 6,'' she said. ``I don't know what he does outside.''
</P>
<P>
   She denied having heard of bin Laden before the blast and
protested that her husband did not hate Americans. She also gave
him an alibi, saying that at 10:30 a.m. on Aug. 7, when the bomb
went off, he was with her at the Nairobi airport trying to get her
sick father on a plane home.
</P>
<P>
   There have been accusations that a fundamentalist clique within
the Comoros government might shelter terrorists. Critics note that
the ``hit list'' for local politicians found in Fazil's house
called for killing President Taki's political opponents, but not
him. And local journalists were surprised to hear that Fazil got to
the airport late but boarded the plane in only 15 minutes, as if
someone had cleared his way.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa, the president's top adviser, called the accusations
ridiculous and said they emanated from political rivals and
separatists. The government, he said, first heard from the FBI on
Aug. 29, a week after Fazil's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Fundi Twawilou said he still felt like a father to Fazil and did
not believe him guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdallah knows good from bad,'' he said. ``He knows that for
planting a bomb that kills 250 innocent people, a Muslim would go
straight to hell.''

   Who needs Congress when there's ``Crossfire''? During the House
Judiciary Committee's televised debate about an impeachment inquiry
Monday, Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., a vehement opponent of
impeaching the president, said he was scheduled to appear on
``Crossfire'' later that night with Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., one of
the president's fiercest critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort not to ruin the show tonight, I'm going to wait
to respond to Barr's comments earlier until we get on the show,''
Wexler said. It was a joke and it wasn't. Television has clearly
superseded Congress as the primary site of political debate.
</P>
<P>
   Even at its most vociferous, Monday's House committee meeting
seemed quaintly undramatic and familiar, as if transcripts of
``Nightline'' or ``This Week'' were being read into the
Congressional Record. The lack of surprise reveals how central
television has become in this story, shaping its every turn.
</P>
<P>
   The committee chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and its ranking
Democrat, Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, drew their battle lines
while appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday. What were
they going to say that was different on Monday?
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm afraid we're going to get is an impeachment in search
of a high crime,'' Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said in the most
memorable line on ``This Week'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement Monday, he plagiarized himself: ``Let
us not turn this into an impeachment inquiry in search of a high
crime.'' It was memorable deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   The television coverage of the hearings also seemed caught in a
strange time warp, filled with countless allusions to the Watergate
hearings of 24 years ago. An odd formality was built into the
traditional congressional language. (``I thank the gentlelady,''
Hyde said in response to comments from Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.)
And an unusually straightforward aura came from the single pool
camera feeding all channels the same picture.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening statements, Watergate proved to be an
infinitely malleable image, its specter hovering over the debate,
used by both Republicans and Democrats when it suited their
purposes. Conyers said the Republicans were trying to ``conjure the
ghost of Watergate,'' and rejected that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Watergate, this is an extramarital affair,'' he
said. Yet member after member reached for the sense of import
recalled from those years, in statements loaded with references to
the Constitution, history and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   A glance back at the real Watergate hearings suggest more
differences than similarities, though. Largely experienced through
television, Watergate has also been misremembered and idealized as
a pure, nonpolitical process.
</P>
<P>
   The two sets of Watergate hearings are, in fact, often conflated
in many people's memories. There was Sam Ervin's committee
investigation in the Senate in 1973 (the John Dean testimony) and
Peter Rodino's House Judiciary Committee hearings, which voted
articles of impeachment against Richard M. Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rodino committee hearings, now idealized as a model of
nonpartisan statesmanship, seemed quite otherwise when they were
shown on the History Channel last week. Party politics and an
awareness of the television audience were almost as evident then as
they are now.
</P>
<P>
   As one debate stretched into the evening, Rep. Charles Sandman,
R-N.J., a member of the minority, complained that his opponents
were playing to the cameras. ``This bunch of baloney was supposed
to be taken up this afternoon, not tonight,'' he said, but
``there's a bigger audience'' in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   And on a typical day at the Ervin committee (preserved at the
Museum of Television and Radio), ABC's coverage seemed like a
two-man show. During a brief break, anchor Frank Reynolds spoke
slowly. ``Well, it's about 4:35 in the afternoon,'' he began, while
their reporter in the committee room, Sam Donaldson (some things
never change), raced out to the hall to collar an interview
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Today there would be a crew of legal analysts in the studio, as
well as reporters in the committee room, on the stairs and in the
rest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   So throughout Monday's meeting, the 24-hour news channels (CNN,
MSNBC and Fox News) struggled to adapt their usual fancy graphics
and expert-laden approach to the Judiciary Committee's deliberate,
declamatory process. Early in the day they cautiously dipped in and
occasionally out of the members' opening statements, as if turning
away might seem irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the afternoon, when the most cantankerous debates
about limiting the length and scope of an impeachment inquiry broke
out, it was clear there would be no genuine surprises, and the
channels moved in and out more freely.
</P>
<P>
   It was surely happenstance that a committee recess coincided
with ``Crossfire'' on CNN. Wexler and Barr raced from the committee
room to appear on the program. Standing side by side, they had
nothing more or less to say than they had before. And while they
were still standing there, another part of the screen showed Hyde
banging his gavel down to recall the meeting to order.
</P>
<P>
   CNN switched back to Congress; Wexler and Barr returned a little
late, as the television show and the official congressional debate
blended together conspicuously. In reality, they had merged long
ago.

CLINTON'S LAWYERS ACCUSE STARR OF MISLEADING FEDERAL JUDGES
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening two new legal fronts, President Clinton's
lawyers Monday accused the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, of misleading a federal appeals panel in a battle over
lawyer-client privilege and asked the Justice Department to release
the information he provided for approval to begin the Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent on Monday evening to Attorney General Janet
Reno, Clinton's top personal lawyer said that the records should be
made available to test whether a group of ``anti-Clinton
partisans'' trumped up the investigation of the president last
January. The letter, by David E. Kendall, cited five recent news
articles, in The New York Times and Newsday, that raised questions
about whether some lawyers assisting Paula Corbin Jones in her
sexual harassment lawsuit contacted prosecutors before Linda Tripp
last January.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Starr's office have denied accusations by allies
of the president that their investigation was coordinated with the
assistance of people working on Jones' behalf. Reno's chief
spokesman, Bert Brandenburg, said the Justice Department could not
comment on the letter since it was received too late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   In a Supreme Court filing Monday, Clinton's lawyers also accused
Starr of misleading a federal appeals court last June when he
argued that impeachment was too remote an issue for the judges to
consider in deciding whether a senior White House lawyer must
testify. Three days after making that argument, Starr secretly
petitioned a different panel of federal judges for permission to
file an impeachment referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The different tacks Starr took before the two courts were cited
as part of the White House's efforts to reverse court decisions
compelling the testimony of Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House
counsel and one of Clinton's most trusted aides. Invoking the
lawyer-client privilege on behalf of the president, Lindsey has
declined to answer some questions in the grand jury that has been
examining Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on June 29 over the privilege, Starr conceded
before the appeals court that government lawyers could
confidentially advise the president during an impeachment
proceeding. Starr added, however, that it was premature to consider
the impeachment question for purposes of the lawyer-client
privilege case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not where we are,'' Starr told the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, a court where he once served
as a judge. ``It is premature for this court to look down the road
and look at impeachment. It is beyond the compass of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   But on July 2, three days later, Starr secretly filed a motion
before a special federal panel of judges asking for permission to
make an impeachment referral to Congress. The panel granted Starr's
request three weeks later. When Starr filed his impeachment
referral last month with Congress, he disclosed the secret motion.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, the Court of Appeals ruled against the White House,
holding that Clinton could not invoke the privilege to limit the
questioning of Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   The White House appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. In
a brief filed Monday with the court, the president's lawyers
criticized the Office of Independent Counsel for failing to level
with the federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our knowledge, the Office of Independent Counsel never
sought to correct the record in the court of appeals,'' the White
House lawyers wrote. ``Nor, in its brief in this court, has the OIC
explained why it made such a representation or, for that matter,
even addressed in any meaningful fashion the constitutional
implications of its role in the impeachment process.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles G. Bakaly III, a spokesman for the independent counsel,
said the issue presented in the brief was ``a red herring,''
particularly since the lawyer-client privilege could not be invoked
to shield Lindsey's testimony even before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common law privilege at issue here would not apply at
impeachment proceedings, which recognize only constitutional
privileges,'' Bakaly said. ``The court of appeals agrees with us.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Supreme Court brief, Starr urged the justices to deny the
White House appeal and not disturb the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court ruled that in impeachment proceedings,
executive privilege was the only possible shield that the President
could invoke to keep the advice of his aides confidential. In
rejecting the lawyer-client privilege in both the criminal inquiry
and in any impeachment proceeding, the court said the special
obligations of all government lawyers was different from private
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an executive branch attorney is called before a federal
grand jury to give evidence about alleged crimes within the
executive branch, reason and experience, duty and tradition dictate
that the attorney shall provide that evidence,'' the court said.
``Government attorneys stand in a far different position from
members of the private bar. Their duty is not to defend clients
against criminal charges and it is not to protect wrongdoers from
public exposure. The constitutional responsibility of the president
and all members of the executive branch, is to `take care that the
laws be faithfully executed.'''
</P>
<P>
   The court is expected to decide later this fall whether it will
hear the appeal. The justices are also considering whether to grant
an appeal by the Secret Service to the court orders that have
compelled the testimony of the president's bodyguards.

HOLBROOKE TELLS MILOSOVIC TO PULL BACK OR FACE ATTACK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met
with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday night and
according to American diplomats told him that he had to take
further steps to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face
a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was also told, the diplomats said, that he had to
insure that the roughly 250,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have
been forced to flee their homes in the fighting in the last six
months be allowed to return home. Most of these refugees are
reluctant to return because many of the Serb police officers who
destroyed their homes and villages remain in the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering his sternest message so far to Milosevic over
the Kosovo conflict, Holbrooke said at a news conference that
NATO's military plans for attacking Serbia were moving ahead on a
``serious, intense and sustained basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's mission to Milosevic was described by the American
diplomats as ``not a do or die trip,'' but they added, ``We're at a
very serious juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Holbrooke's meeting with Milosevic, the Yugoslav
leader issued a defiant statement on Serbian television in which he
said the ``threats of aggression'' outlined by Holbrooke
represented ``a criminal act.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who rarely comments about his meetings with foreign
diplomats and whose tough words cast an unusually ominous tone,
also said that Holbrooke's position constituted ``support for
Albanian terrorists and not the Albanian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke of supporting the
ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have
been fighting to make the Serbian province of Kosovo an independent
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader added that ``for more than seven days there
have been no skirmishes or military action.''
</P>
<P>
   An American diplomat familiar with the themes Holbrooke planned
to stress to Milosevic said there had been no expectation that the
American envoy would walk out Monday night with an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the point was to underscore to the Yugoslav leader and
make explicit what was expected of him. ``It was not quite an
ultimatum,'' the diplomat said, ``but more a matter of what steps
have to be taken to show compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Holbrooke's demands centered on issues outlined
in a United Nations Security Council resolution of two weeks ago.
The resolution ordered Milosevic to withdraw the extra army and
police forces that were sent to Kosovo to deal with the guerrillas
and to send back to their bases the military forces normally
stationed in the province.
</P>
<P>
   So far, American diplomats said, Milosevic has withdrawn troops
from the field but not all of them are in their barracks. Such a
move is essential, American diplomats said, to create a conducive
atmosphere for any possible negotiations on the future status of
the province.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. resolution also calls for a political solution.
Holbrooke and the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill,
discussed with Milosevic a political document drawn up by the State
Department that calls for broad autonomy for Kosovo. Milosevic
withdrew the autonomy in 1989 as he began his campaign of Serb
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   The countryside in central Kosovo has been eerily silent since
last Thursday. The sound of artillery thuds and mortar rounds have
been noticeably absent and the coils of white smoke that signified
burning villages have vanished from the green hills and valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Police checkpoints are more relaxed and areas that were sealed
off this time last week by the Yugoslav army are now open to the
patrols of diplomatic monitors from the United States, European
Union and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   These monitors, many of whom are former military officers, have
reported that the Yugoslav army has ``stood down'' and that they
have seen virtually no military action since late last week. There
has been sporadic shooting, the monitors have reported.
</P>
<P>
   But this superficial calm is not good enough because the Serb
military has the capacity to resume fighting very quickly, a NATO
military officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer added that a cease-fire in Kosovo is ``pretty much
enacted.'' He also said that the ``trend toward compliance is
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The interior ministry police must also reduce their presence
around villages so that refugees who have fled have the confidence
to return, the military officer said. Some interior ministry police
officers had left the province, but not enough, he added.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of how badly damaged the KLA had been by the
Yugoslav army's three-month offensive, the NATO officer said,
``It's a fair assessment that the KLA is dismantled but not
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's first stop Monday was Brussels, where he met with
the secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana. On Tuesday he plans
to travel to Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, where he is scheduled
to meet with the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova to present
the political proposal for the future status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected back in Belgrade on Tuesday afternoon for another
session with Milosevic.

YANKS RELIEVED, RELAXED AND READY FOR REVENGE
</HEADLINE>

By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees worked out in near silence last Thursday
after learning that Darryl Strawberry had been found to have colon
cancer. But their mood had changed dramatically Monday as they
prepared for the start of the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is faring well, according to teammates who visited
him in the hospital on Sunday, and with his encouragement, they are
focusing on the job at hand _ winning the final round of the
playoffs, and then the World Series, and assuring the team's
potentially lofty standing in history. The Yankees' David Wells
will pitch against Cleveland's Jaret Wright at Yankee Stadium
Tuesday night in Game 1 of the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees swept the Texas Rangers in three games in the
division series to advance to the ALCS, while the Indians beat the
Boston Red Sox, three games to one.
</P>
<P>
   With one more victory, the Yankees will match the single-season
record for combined victories in the regular season and
post-season; with 117 victories, they are one short of the record
set by the 1906 Cubs, who won 116 games in a 154-game regular
season and two in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of Yankees, including Manager Joe Torre and
pitcher David Cone, visited Strawberry at Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center here on Sunday night, chatting with him for about 30
minutes. ``He was very alert,'' Torre said. ``He looked real good.
I mean, he was sitting up, and of course the one complaint he had
is that he is not going to be able to eat for a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter said, ``He looked great, he talked normally,
everything you would expect from Straw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees intend to send small groups of players to see
Strawberry each day, for small doses of conversation. Scott
Brosius, the third baseman who sprained his ankle on Friday in
Texas, stopped by Monday after undergoing a CAT scan that revealed
no fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, who batted .400 with three runs batted in against the
Rangers, worked out after the tests and said he was fine and ready
to play. As of Monday night, the Yankees intended to add outfielder
Ricky Ledee as their 25th man, rather than another third baseman,
Mike Lowell. Ledee will probably be used as a late-inning
pinch-runner and defensive replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no instability,'' Brosius said, ``just a little bit of
pain there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius will probably bat ninth in Tuesday night's game, two
spots behind the rookie left fielder Shane Spencer, who is becoming
a fixture in the Yankees' post-season lineup. Tim Raines will bat
sixth and start as the designated hitter, rather than Chili Davis _
probably because Raines is a little better at handling high
fastballs, such as those thrown by Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove and Wright tried to play down
the ill will caused by Wright's two incidents with the Yankees this
season _ when he broke Luis Sojo's hand with a pitch in spring
training, in what Sojo believes was an intentional act, and when
Wright hit Paul O'Neill with a pitch on June 19, prompting O'Neill
to offer personal commentary on Wright as he walked to first base.
``Pitching inside is part of my game, and I'm not trying to hurt
anybody or hit anybody,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   But the bad feelings exist below the surface, and memories
remain intact. Wells obliquely made reference Monday to others who
``headhunt,'' after mentioning how Sojo had his hand broken. The
Yankees do not like the 22-year-old Wright, do not like what they
perceive as his smugness, and though no one would say so for the
record, they would love to score lots of runs against him.
</P>
<P>
   Wright pitched erratically this season, winning 12 and losing 10
and compiling a 4.72 earned run average. But he throws very hard,
and on those days when he is able to get his curveball over the
plate for strikes, he can be very difficult to hit. What the
Yankees will try to do, Raines said, is make Wright throw strikes,
make him pitch deep into counts. Wright averaged 17.44 pitches per
inning this season, and the Yankees will want to drive up that
count and drive him off the mound in the middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wells made one start against the Indians this season, beating
them with eight solid innings on June 20, when he struck out nine
and walked none while yielding eight hits and two runs in eight
innings. Wells, 5-0 in the post-season, has shown he has a knack
for pitching in big games. Wells remembers that when he was a
junior at Point Loma High School, in San Diego, he started and lost
a championship game and was angry about it for a year, then came
back the next year to beat Sweetwater for the CIF-San Diego Section
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a follower, and I believe that I am a leader going
out there and trying to set the tone,'' Wells said, ``especially if
I get the ball first. I am not afraid to fail, and I hate to
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won 7 of 11 games against the Indians this season,
including the last three meetings in the final week of the season,
when both teams kept their best pitchers out of action to prevent
the other side from getting one last look. &QL;

JUSTICES AGREE TO CLARIFY THE LAW ON LENIENCY FOR REFUGEES SEEKING
ASYLUM
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Adding an immigration case and five other new cases
to the term that opened Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to clarify
the law on leniency for refugees who seek to remain in the United
States despite having committed crimes in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   The justices accepted the Clinton administration's appeal of a
ruling in favor of a Guatemalan who, as a student leader in
Guatemala, had burned 10 buses and vandalized stores while
demonstrating against the government. He had entered the United
States illegally in 1993 and, when faced with deportation the next
year, requested asylum and the ``withholding of deportation,'' a
form of administrative relief granted by immigration officials in
the name of the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Although an immigration judge granted his request, finding that
he had established a ``well-founded fear'' of political reprisal in
Guatemala, the Immigration and Naturalization Service appealed. The
service argued that the man, Juan Anibal Aguirre-Aguirre, was
ineligible for leniency, citing a provision of the immigration law
that denies relief to an alien who has ``committed a serious
nonpolitical crime outside the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   An immigration appeals board agreed with the agency, but its
ruling was overturned last year by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the 9th Circuit, in San Francisco. That court ruled that the Board
of Immigration Appeals should not have simply applied the law
automatically, but should have weighed a number of factors,
including the seriousness of the offenses when balanced against the
seriousness of the reprisals Aguirre faced, and the nature of the
crime in proportion to the political situation and objectives.
</P>
<P>
   In its Supreme Court appeal, Immigration and Naturalization
Service vs. Aguirre-Aguirre, No. 97-1754, the administration
essentially takes the view that decisions of immigration officials
on whether to proceed with deportation or grant administrative
relief is not subject to second-guessing by the courts. The Court
of Appeals ``failed to give due deference'' to the Board of
Immigration Appeals and ``improperly substituted its judgment'' for
that of the board, the administration told the justices.
</P>
<P>
   The court's reaction to these arguments could indicate how the
justices will respond to other immigration cases now making their
way through the courts in the wake of Congress' sharp curtailment
two years ago of aliens' ability to challenge adverse
administrative decisions. Several federal appeals courts have ruled
in the past few months that immigration decisions cannot be
completely insulated from judicial review and that, at least in
certain circumstances, aliens must be given access to federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, in a major ruling late last month, the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, in New York, rejected the
administration's view and ruled that Congress lacked authority to
deprive federal courts of jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus
petitions from immigrants who are in custody and who are
challenging deportation orders.
</P>
<P>
   The six new cases the justices accepted on Monday brought to 51
the number now available for decision during the new term. The
court denied review Monday in some 1,700 cases that had accumulated
since the last term ended in June.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One unusual feature on Monday was the extent to which the
justices undertook to reformulate the legal questions posed by the
cases they agreed to take on. Typically, the court simply announces
that review has been granted, presumably on the terms presented by
the lawyer who brings the case. In the immigration case Monday, for
example, the court simply said ``granted.'' But in the five other
cases, the justices actually rewrote the questions, sharpening the
focus and limiting their review to those questions that were
logically interrelated. In one case, in which the lawyer offered a
full page of what he described to the court as ``a cascading series
of sub-issues,'' the justices boiled the matter down to two
questions and six lines of type.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is too early in the term to tell whether the
justices are taking a new and more aggressive approach to managing
their docket, the action Monday may reflect their frustration with
cases in recent terms in which the underlying issue was important
but the presentation was too unfocused to let the court make much
headway.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the highlights of the opening day:
</P>
<P>
   Disability Policy
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to resolve a dispute among the lower federal
courts over the relationship between the Americans With
Disabilities Act and receipt of Social Security disability
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The disabilities act, a 1990 federal law, prohibits employers
from discriminating against ``a qualified individual with a
disability,'' meaning someone who is able to work, although perhaps
with reasonable accommodations to the disability. The question in
this case, Cleveland vs. Policy Management Systems, No. 97-1008, is
whether receipt of disability benefits under Social Security
creates a presumption that the employee is not able to work and is
therefore not covered by the disabilities act.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of disability necessary to qualify for Social
Security benefits is considerable: a person must be unable ``to
engage in any substantial gainful activity'' in the economy. Some
federal courts have ruled that a person who qualifies as disabled
for Social Security purposes is, by virtue of that fact, outside
the disabilities act's protection.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, in
New Orleans, established a presumption to that effect, and
dismissed a disabilities act suit brought against an employer by a
woman who had collected Social Security benefits following a
stroke. The woman argued that her subsequent dismissal from her job
violated the disabilities act.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters' Access
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court turned down an appeal from a
coalition of news organizations, including The New York Times,
challenging denial of public access this year to court hearings and
legal motions connected to the Whitewater independent counsel's
investigation into the Lewinsky matter and to assertions of
privileges raised by grand jury witnesses. Hearings on claims of
executive privilege and lawyer-client privilege by White House
officials were not announced in advance and took place behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
ruled on May 5 that the First Amendment did not provide a right of
access to proceedings that were ``ancillary'' to a grand jury
investigation. In their appeal, Dow Jones vs. Clinton, No. 97-1959,
the news organizations said the ruling ``effectively bars the
public from meaningful and timely access to information of
overwhelming public interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug Testing
</P>
<P>
   Also without comment, the court refused to hear a challenge to
an Indiana school district's drug testing policy, under which any
student who wants to participate in any extracurricular activity
must agree to be subject to random testing for alcohol, illegal
drugs and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The policy, upheld earlier this year by the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the 7th Circuit, in Chicago, goes considerably beyond a
student drug-testing policy the Supreme Court upheld three years
ago in an Oregon case that applied only to student athletes. In
that case, the court found that an existing drug problem and the
role of athletes as student leaders justified the policy.
</P>
<P>
   In Rush County, Ind., a rural area with no evidence of a drug
problem, the policy applies to members of the French club, the
Future Homemakers of America, the library club and many others. The
Indiana Civil Liberties Union challenged the policy on behalf of a
student who had volunteered to videotape football games but was
barred from doing so because he refused to submit to random drug
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The case was Todd vs. Rush County Schools, No. 97-2021.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Search
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed to decide whether two Los Angeles prosecutors
violated a defense lawyer's due process rights by having him held
and searched in a separate room of the courthouse while his client
was required to testify before a grand jury. The prosecutors are
appealing a ruling by the 9th Circuit that in its timing and
motivation _ to prevent the lawyer from consulting with his client
_ the search amounted to an unreasonable interference with the
right of the lawyer, Paul L. Gabbert, to practice his profession.
</P>
<P>
   Gabbert was representing Traci Baker, a defense witness in the
trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez for murdering their parents. The
prosecutors had obtained a warrant to search Gabbert to see if he
was carrying a letter to Baker from Lyle Menendez, her former
boyfriend. No letter was discovered. The case is Conn vs. Gabbert,
No. 97-1802.

HOW TV COVERED THE IMPEACHMENT DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The impeachment debate in the House Judiciary Committee received
gavel to gavel coverage on cable news channels Monday, and a few
minutes of live coverage on the ABC network. Neither NBC nor CBS
had any live coverage of the debate, though the two networks did
provide a form of live coverage Monday night for the vote by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   CBS interrupted its programming for five minutes to cover the
vote, and NBC used a part of its screen for a written report on the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy said that because of ``Monday
Night Football,'' the network would not do a live report on the
vote. But the network's ``Nightline'' program was to be based on
the debate last night.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, Fox News and Court TV provided live coverage.
</P>
<P>
   CNN also focused most of its attention during the day on the
debate, though it did break away for regular programs like its
legal discussion program, ``Burden of Proof,'' which focused on the
debate, as well as for brief reports on other stories in the news.

HOUSE OK'S IMPEACHMENT PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee, poised to launch
historic proceedings that a Republican member warned ``will be a
difficult ordeal for all Americans,'' voted Monday night to
recommend a full-scale inquiry into whether President Clinton's
alleged attempt to cover up an extramarital affair warrants his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled panel, nearly unanimous in disdain for
Clinton's misdeeds but deeply divided over how to punish him, voted
21-16, along party lines, to seek an open-ended impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   In a 10-hour skirmish that foreshadowed a prolonged partisan
showdown over the sex scandal, the panel called for the inquiry
after its chief Republican lawyer, David P. Schippers, asserted
there is ``substantial credible evidence of 15 separate events
involving President William Jefferson Clinton that could constitute
felonies'' and grounds for his possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The House is expected to approve the committee's recommendation
by the end of the week, setting up the third presidential
impeachment investigation in US history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denied the charges, including several counts of
perjury, attempts to obstruct justice, and witness tampering. But
no one, not even members of the president's inner circle, expects
him to emerge unscathed from the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is also bracing for a possible backlash as the
potentially explosive investigation unfolds. ``This will be an
emotional process, a strenuous process,'' said the committee's
chairman, Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois. But Hyde urged
his colleagues not to abdicate their ``inescapable responsibility''
to conduct the high-stakes inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final vote Monday night, the committee voted along
party lines to reject several Democratic alternatives to the GOP
plan, including a proposal that would have set a Thanksgiving
deadline for the probe. Although the GOP plan sets no deadline,
Hyde has said he hopes to complete the inquiry by New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic amendments also would have required the panel to
determine what constitutes an impeachable offense before lawmakers
launch the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all I know, there may be grounds for an inquiry,'' said
Representative William D. Delahunt, a Quincy Democrat. ``But before
the committee authorizes proceedings that will further traumatize
the nation and distract us from the people's business, we must
satisfy ourselves that there is probable cause to recommend an
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde led the opposition to the Democratic proposal, saying the
GOP plan includes the standards the Judiciary Committee followed
when Democrats controlled the panel during the Watergate hearings
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, said Representative Lindsey O. Graham, a South
Carolina Republican, Clinton's fate may turn on whether the
committee determines the allegations stemming from his illicit
affair with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky are more
similar to ``Watergate or Peyton Place.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was clear to many Democrats. Waving a copy of the
Constitution above him, Representative Robert Wexler of Florida
accused the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, of conducting
``a politically inspired witch hunt that rivals McCarthyism.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler asserted the Lewinsky-related charges do not constitute
``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the standard for impeachment.
``Impeachment is not about adultery,'' Wexler shouted. ``It is
about subversion of government. The president had an affair. He
lied about it ... . Does anybody reasonably believe that this
amounts to subversion of government?''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's GOP legal staff agreed that two of Starr's 11
allegations that Clinton committed possibly impeachable offenses
did not warrant the panel's scrutiny. Rather than pursue charges
that Clinton abused the power of his office by essentially
asserting his legal rights, Hyde indicated the panel will dismiss
them.
</P>
<P>
   But Schippers added several other counts to Starr's array of
charges. Notable among them was an allegation that Clinton engaged
in a conspiracy with Lewinsky and others to obstruct justice by
trying to conceal their sexual liaisons. Schippers did not name
anyone as a co-conspirator, although he described Clinton's friend,
Vernon E. Jordan, and his White House secretary, Betty Currie, as
active participants in activities related to the alleged
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has received immunity from prosecution in exchange for
her testimony about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Schippers' additional charges involved Clinton's alleged
perjury and other purported efforts to conceal the Lewinsky affair
from lawyers in the former sexual harassment case brought against
him by Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges also involved Clinton's testimony in August to a
federal grand jury investigating his affair with Lewinsky.
Schippers alleged, for example, that Clinton may have lied to the
grand jury when he testified that Lewinsky's false affidavit in the
Jones case was ``absolutely true.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers triggered outrage among several committee Democrats
when he ended his presentation by warning the panel about the
gravity of the allegations against Clinton. He said they should
honor the spirit of ``15 generations of Americans, many of whom
repose in military cemeteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid protests from Democrats, Hyde ordered Schippers' comments
stricken from the official record. However, Representative Bob
Barr, a Georgia Republican who ranks among Clinton's leading foes,
later adopted Schippers' comments as his own and inserted them in
the committee record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are witnessing nothing less than the symptoms of a cancer
on the American presidency ...,'' Barr had said earlier in the
hearing. ``If we fail to address such charges, we will soon be left
standing dazed and befuddled among the smoldering ruins of a great
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuttal, the committee's chief Democratic lawyer, Abbe
Lowell, accused Starr of creating a ``grave constitutional crisis''
by exploiting Clinton's attempt to hide an embarrassing adulterous
affair from his family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell accused Starr and Schippers of using a common
prosecutorial strategy against Clinton by seizing several core
allegations (perjury, obstruction of justice, and witness
tampering) and developing several additional counts to make the
case ``look more serious or foreboding.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said Schippers had done little more than ``subdivide''
Starr's allegations to produce additional counts. He also
criticized committee Republicans for refusing to define what
constitutes an impeachable offense before launching a full inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the equivalent of a ship's captain leaving on a
difficult, uncharted voyage and hoping to find his compass
somewhere along the way,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic gesture, committee Republicans sat before a table
stacked with worn volumes of the 1974 Watergate report. On the wall
behind them was a large portrait of former Representative Peter
Rodino, a New Jersey Democrat, who presided over the Watergate
hearings, which hastened Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bill McCollum, a Florida Republican, countered
critics who have argued that perjury is not a serious offense by
saying 115 inmates are currently serving federal prison terms for
perjury convictions.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is found to have committed perjury, McCollum said,
``That's enough for us to impeach and enough for him to be thrown
out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat,
downplayed the charges. ``Mr. Starr, reflecting his bias, follows
the principle that if you don't have anything bad to say, you don't
say anything at all,'' Frank said. ``But that ought not to be the
cue for this committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats denounced Clinton's actions in the Lewinsky
matter and some of his legal defense tactics. ``He had an
adulterous affair with a White House employee half his age, then he
misled the American people ... and engaged in a dangerous game of
verbal `Twister' in his sworn testimony,'' said Representative
Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said the committee should conduct a ``thoughtful and
fair'' inquiry,'' then ``sanction the president in a manner
commensurate with the seriousness of his wrongdoing.''

 LUCK FINALLY RUNS OUT FOR `OVER-THE-HILL' GANG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The annals of crime in metropolitan New York _ a long
registry of mayhem, thievery and skulduggery _ is replete with
tales of clever rogues, acts of mindless savagery and other
headline-grabbing sensations.
</P>
<P>
   But a little troupe rounded up Monday on federal burglary and
racketeering charges, the authorities said, was remarkable for the
more prosaic qualities usually associated with diligent,
middle-aged workers: perseverance, attention to details and, above
all, longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 15 to 20 years, officials charged, the suspects _
six men and a woman, most of them now in their 50s (one in a
nursing home) and dubbed the ``over-the-hill gang'' _ made a career
of burglary, hitting thousands of homes and estates in affluent
communities of New Jersey and Long Island, and selling the loot to
``fences'' in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully selecting targets, striking at night when no one was
home, five Brooklyn men carried out the break-ins, taking furs,
jewelry, paintings and antiques, as well as cash, and amassing an
inventory of stolen goods valued at $5 million to $10 million,
officials said. Much of it, they said, went to a Canal Street
gold-and-jewelry store operated by the other two defendants.
</P>
<P>
   But after years of quiet success, the gang's luck ran out,
officials said, when federal, state and local law-enforcement
agencies began to detect patterns of burglaries in disparate places
like Upper Saddle River and Englewood Cliffs in New Jersey and Old
Westbury and Old Brookville on Long Island. Surveillance and a
two-year investigation by a score of agencies led to Monday's
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very sophisticated organization that operated in
many different towns,'' Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney for the
Southern District of New York, said at a news conference in
Manhattan. ``To catch them, it really took a regional approach to
law-enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by a dozen officials from the FBI and from regional
police departments and prosecutors' offices, Ms. White announced a
35-count indictment accusing the suspects of 20 burglaries in New
Jersey that netted $1.2 million, and/or of involvement in a
racketeering conspiracy that transported stolen goods over state
lines.
</P>
<P>
   While only a score of burglaries were detailed, Ms. White and
others said their investigations showed the suspects had actually
carried out thousands of burglaries since the early 1980s, making
off with millions, including $500,000 in jewelry in a single haul.
</P>
<P>
   The five men accused of committing the burglaries were listed as
John Davis, 52, described as the mastermind of the gang; Fyndle
Brooks, 56, who recently suffered a stroke and lives in a nursing
home; Jerry Richardson, 56; Amos Miller, 51, and Goldie Willoughby,
40, all of Brooklyn. Terry Kaplan, 41, and his wife, Martha, 43, of
Manhattan, were accused of conspiring to sell stolen goods though a
shop they formerly operated at 95 Canal St.
</P>
<P>
   At hearings Monday night before federal Magistrate Judge
Theodore Katz, Davis was held without bail, Miller was held for a
hearing on Friday and the Kaplans were released on personal
recognizance bonds. Brooks was ordered held at his nursing home.
Hearings for Richardson and Willoughby were pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were good at what they did,'' William Schmidt, the Bergen
County prosecutor, said at the news conference. ``These were
professionals who were very successful, who made a career out of
their crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said the burglars, operating in groups of three or
four, staked out estates or large homes in Bergen and Essex
Counties in New Jersey, or in Nassau County on Long Island, waited
until nightfall and made sure no one was home. Apparently no one
was injured in any of the break-ins, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With one acting as lookout and another as getaway driver, the
team disabled burglar alarms and smashed windows or bored holes
through doors to gain entry, Ms. White said. One or two men then
ransacked the homes, taking valuables and cash, usually from
bedrooms or dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Ms. White said, the gang would return to Davis'
apartment and split up any cash. The other loot would be sold to
the Kaplans or to other fences, who would sell it from retail
outlets in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Local police departments investigated the burglaries, but did
not connect them until a pattern was detected. ``We started putting
together the types of homes and the times they would strike at
these homes,'' Schmidt recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Some jewelry was recovered in the ensuing investigation, but the
vast bulk of the loot has disappeared, the officials said. They
said, however, that the arrests spelled the end of one of the most
successful, and durable, burglary rings to operate in the
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``For victims, this criminal activity literally hit home,'' said
Victor Gonzalez, an FBI official in New York. ``It's the sort of
crime that is particularly upsetting to victims.''

 WASHINGTON: support impeachment.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He also accused Starr of overreaching and showing bias when he
cast the president's claims of executive privilege as an abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an attempt to organize his staff to spread
misinformation about the progress of the war in Vietnam,'' he said,
returning to the Watergate era. ``Or about a break-in of the
Democratic headquarters at the Watergate, or even about how funds
from arms sales in Iran were diverted to aid the Contras in
Nicaragua. This was a president repeating to his staff the same
denial of an inappropriate and extremely embarrassing relationship
that he had already denied to the public directly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Time and again, Democrats sought to turn attention as much on
Starr as on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to have prosecutors with unlimited powers
accountable to no one, who will spend millions of dollars
investigating a person's sex life?'' asked Rep. John Conyers, Jr.,
the senior Democrat on the committee. ``Who then haul before grand
juries every person of the opposite sex the person has had contact
with? Who then record and release videos to the public of the grand
jury questioning of the most private aspects of one's sex life?''
</P>
<P>
   A few members of the committee departed from party lines and
sought to look for a middle ground. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.,
chastised both parties alike. Republicans, he said, have ``an
obligation to recognize that high crimes and misdemeanors has a
meaning. All felonies are not high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   He lectured Democrats that they had to recognize that it was a
Democratic Congress, at the urging of Clinton, which passed the law
that allowed the naming of an independent counsel. And it was
Clinton's attorney general, Janet Reno, who approved Starr's
inquiry into the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,
said, ``I have no idea what I am going to do yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, one of the conservative Republican rebels who had once
tried to topple House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, ``I don't know if
censure is appropriate, we should just drop it or we should throw
him out of office. Nobody knows yet in my opinion who has really
got an open mind about this thing. Is this Watergate or Peyton
Place? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's committee vote marked only the third time that Congress
has begun a formal impeachment process against a president. But it
is far from a foregone conclusion that Clinton will be removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes, as expected later this week, to authorize an
impeachment inquiry, the Judiciary Committee then begins the
process of holding hearings and weighing the evidence against
Clinton. It then decides whether to recommend that the full House
impeach the president _ the equivalent of a grand jury indictment.
</P>
<P>
   If the House impeaches, the Senate then tries the president with
the chief justice of the Supreme Court presiding. It takes a
two-thirds vote of the Senate to remove a president from office.

   JUDICIARY-SCHIPPERS _ Few counties are as important to the
Democratic National Committee as Cook County. The Illinois county
surrounding the city of Chicago was where the famed Mayor Richard
J. Daley ran his beloved Democratic Machine for the better part of
this century. David Schippers is part of that fabric. The South
Side Irish lawyer is as Democratic as they get. His first cousin is
the chairman of the Democratic Party of Cook County and he has been
a loyal party supporter. And that is what makes Schippers such an
interesting profile. The man who made his name taking down
Chicago's Mafia is now heading up the special congressional
Republican task force to determine wwhether there is grounds for
the president to be impeached. We profile Schippers and Democratic

A TRIMMED TOBACCO SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL TAKES CENTER STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Conn., Mass., Md., Mich., Wis., Calif., Colo., N.Y.,
N.C., N.D., Okla., Pa.)  (fb) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As state attorneys general on Tuesday start to review the
outlines of a new national tobacco settlement proposal, even
supporters of the plan acknowledge that it represents a new phase
in the nation's debate over smoking: one of lowered expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which has not been completed, is expected to cost the
tobacco industry more than $200 billion over 25 years and provide
huge windfalls to the states which participate in it. But following
a period when politicians and policymakers offered visions of a
landscape swept clear of tobacco advertising and promotions, it is
likely to strike many public health groups as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Christine A. Gregoire, the attorney general of Washington
State who has led the eight states involved in the current
negotiations, said recently that the proposal will probably fall
short of public expectations. And as more details become known,
they appear to underscore how strongly the momentum has shifted in
favor of industry negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which seeks to be the basis of a nationwide
settlement and will be reviewed Tuesday in New York City by a group
of states believed most likely to oppose it, does contain steps to
reduce cigarette consumption, particularly among young people.
Among other things, it calls for a ban on billboard and transit
advertisements paid for by tobacco producers as well as a ban on
the sale of clothing and other merchandise with brand logos.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal includes $25 million a year for 10 years for a new
national foundation to look at ways of reducing teen-age smoking,
one person briefed on the plan said. It also contains some $300
million annually over the next five years for counter-advertising
and smoking-cessation campaigns, according to lawyers and others
familiar with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan would allow companies to continue to use a number
of marketing tools, including using human figures like the Marlboro
Man in advertisements and placing promotional signs outside stores,
apparently even in areas close to schools, several lawyers said.
Each producer could have one major sports sponsorship and there
would be no restrictions on print advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Some anti-smoking advocates said that while it is not known
precisely how to reduce the numbers of teen-age smokers, the
proposal allows producers too many marketing vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that it leaves so many avenues open it is
difficult to predict that it will have a positive effect,'' said
Matthew Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a
group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of about 10 states _ including Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan and Wisconsin _ who are expected
to review the plan on Tuesday, are calling for tougher public
health measures and, in some case, more money.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of states are expected to accept a new
settlement proposal, if one emerges, the fate of the plan may rest
with these 10 states, which may decide to battle the companies in
court rather than settle. An official of one of the states, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, said all states which decide
to participate in a settlement will be offered a minimum of $1
billion regardless of their size or whether they sued the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for the industry, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Washington, the states involved in the latest
negotiations are California, Colorado, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. The tobacco companies
involved are the Philip Morris Companies; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a
unit of R.J.R. Nabisco Holdings; Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco, a
subsidiary of B.A.T. Industries; Lorillard Tobacco, a subsidiary of
the Loews Corp., and the smokeless tobacco producer U.S. Tobacco, a
subsidiary of UST Inc.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the $368.5 billion settlement plan negotiated last year
between the tobacco industry and 40 state attorneys general, the
industry agreed to advertising and marketing restrictions, ceding
regulatory authority over nicotine to the government and paying
fines if youth smoking did not fall.
</P>
<P>
   But that plan collapsed this year in Congress. And Gregoire said
that because the current talks involve lawsuit settlements rather
than legislation, state officials cannot force producers to yield
regulatory authority or pay fines if youth smoking does not
decline.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor of talks has also been markedly different this time.
In recent months, many court decisions have gone in favor of the
industry, and some of the officials involved in the current talks,
such as Dennis C. Vacco _ the New York state attorney general, and
Dan Lundgren, the California attorney general _ are involved in
heated election campaigns and may see a tobacco agreement as
benefiting them.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate last year focused largely on public health
issues like government regulation of nicotine, the discussions this
time have shifted to issues of concern to producers, such as how to
deal with marginal cigarette makers who will not be parties to a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Gregorie and others said the issue, which has consumed
negotiators for weeks, is crucial because smaller producers may
grow bigger and decide to play by their own rules. But some
officials suggest that the real issue for negotiators should be
industry giants like Philip Morris who are the subject of state
lawsuits.

the market gearing up to do battle with them?'' said one state
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

MOTOROLA SAYS 3RD-QUARTER EARNINGS BEAT FORECASTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc., the wireless communications and
semiconductor company that has been stumbling for about two years,
said late Monday that its third-quarter earnings were better than
expected, largely because of an aggressive restructuring and
cost-cutting effort.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had warned Wall Street a few months ago to
expect a flat third-quarter profit, said that it continues to
suffer from weakening demand for its products in Asia, but that its
revamping efforts had partly offset that slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of trading Monday, Motorola reported that it had
an operating profit of $40 million, or 7 cents a share, excluding
special charges, down from $308 million, or 51 cents a share, in
the period a year earlier. Revenue was $7.15 billion in the third
quarter, down from $7.35 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, surveyed by First Call Inc., had been
expecting the company, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., to earn
a penny a share. But the stronger-than-expected showing belies the
more serious worries that have surrounded Motorola, which has seen
its revenues and stock price hammered in recent quarters on
slackening demand at home and abroad for its cellular telephones
and computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, ahead of the earnings report, shares of Motorola fell
$1.4375, to $38.5625, its lowest level in more than five years. The
stock is down more than 50 percent from its all-time high, which
was set last year.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's paging, cellular and semiconductor businesses are all
suffering, but the company says that it is refocusing its
operations, integrating units and headed toward greater efficiency.
``The program is on track to achieve its goal of an annualized
savings rate of at least $750 million by mid-1999,'' said Robert L.
Growney, the company's president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of lackluster earnings and heavy criticism,
Motorola has moved swiftly in the last six months. In June, the
company said it would eliminate 15,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its
work force, and last month Motorola said it was suspending
construction of a $3 billion chip manufacturing plant in Richmond,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have applauded the company's efforts to restructure its
operations and become more focused, but they say that there are few
signs Motorola is going to return to strong profitability anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's report listed a $40 million third-quarter profit,
cost savings from restructuring were about $140 million, excluding
special charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the cost-cutting savings were really the
difference between the break-even and the results they reported,''
said Eric Buck, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``This
is not from any underlying improvement in the business. They said
they're not satisfied with their financial performance and they
shouldn't be; they still have a long way to go.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Motorola, however, has attributed much of its slowdown to the
``continuing impact of adverse business conditions in Asia and
weakness in semiconductors and paging products on a worldwide
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors and analysts have criticized Motorola for more
than a year now for a series of corporate missteps, ranging from
its failure to move aggressively into the digital cellular
telephone market, to technical problems with some of its computer
chips.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular telephones using digital technology have become the
standard, and the Finnish company Nokia has garnered substantial
market share in recent years from Motorola, which has long been
wedded to analog technology.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has also seen a sharp slowdown in its paging business.
Sales in Asia have been particularly troubling. ``The Chinese
market, which is the largest, is slowing, said Ajay Diwan, an
analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``There's a pause in spending
there. The million-dollar question is whether China will slow down
over the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   With cellular telephone sales slackening amid fierce competition
and semiconductor demand slowing sharply in Asia, some analysts
said it is surprising that Motorola's revenue is down just 3
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties in all of its core lines of business _
cellular, semiconductor and paging _ could have been even worse.
</P>
<P>
   But Herschel Shosteck, who runs his own company in Wheaton, Md.,
that tracks the cellular business, says that Motorola is still a
force in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorola has an absolute hammerlock on distribution,'' he
said. ``Once their digital products come to market they will regain
market share. They're going to continue to be a powerful player.''

 &HT;    Both teams saluting Strawberry
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Everyone is talking about Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Indians are showing their respect for the Yankees
slugger, who underwent surgery to remove a tumor from his colon on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Indians starter Bartolo Colon is wearing Strawberry's number
(39) stenciled under his hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a big fan of his since I was a kid and I got a
chance to talk with him this year,'' Colon said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Strawberry remains in good condition at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center as doctors said there was no
visible evidence during surgery that the cancer had spread beyond
the colon. However, it will be another week until tests results
come back and doctors know for sure the severity of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry continues to be visited by his teammates, and even
owner George Steinbrenner has dropped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk all we want to, but it's a scary situation,''
Yankees right-fielder Paul O'Neill said. ``It started off on a good
note, obviously. The surgery is the No. 1 step. From what the
doctors said, there were no setbacks. You go on from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Advice for Strawberry
</P>
<P>
   Two Octobers ago, Frank Torre, the brother of Yankees manager
Joe Torre, was awaiting a heart transplant and it became a big
national story. The same has happened this year to Strawberry but
Frank Torre said the outfielder should concentrate on getting
better and the media should leave him alone. ``If you really love
Darryl Strawberry and you really want him to recover, then forget
he exists for the next four or give days,'' he said. ``He'll be so
exhausted just from speaking for a few minutes. To hell with
baseball right now.'' With a new heart, Frank Torre is doing just
fine and will be in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius, who hurt his ankle in Game
3 of the division series, had it X-rayed and the result were
negative. Still, Brosius is expected to play tonight with a heavily
taped ankle. . . . With Strawberry out, outfielder Ricky Ledee will
be activated. During the regular season, Ledee, once considered the
club's top prospect, hit .241 with one homer and 12 RBIs in 42
games. . . . The reason Andy Pettitte, now pitching Game 3, and
David Cone, now pitching Game 2, were flip-flopped in the rotation
was because Cone threw only 83 pitches in the division series. This
will mean with David Wells will pitch the opener and a Game 5, if
necessary, Cone will go in Game 6 and Pettitte in Game 7. Rookie
Orlando Hernandez, who did not pitch against the Rangers, gets Game
4. . . . Indians right-hander Jaret Wright, who gets the start
against the Yankees tonight, was 2-1 with a 3.66 ERA during the
regular season against New York. He beat the Yankees twice during
the postseason last year. . . . Indians right fielder Manny Ramirez
has 11 postseason homers, tying him for fifth on the all-time list.
Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson lead with 18.

 &HT;    Odds stacked against Indians
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees and Indians open their American League
Championship Series tonight, and few people are giving Cleveland
much of a chance.
</P>
<P>
   This is an old storyline for the Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when they faced the Yankees in the division series,
the Indians were written off after falling behind two games to one.
Didn't matter. Cleveland won.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Indians were underdogs in the ALCS to Baltimore. Didn't
matter. Cleveland won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worry about what everyone says because this game is
played on the field,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Yankees favored again, many forecasts include
the word sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rangers slugger Juan Gonzalez after his team was whiplashed
by New York in the division series, ``If the Yankees continue to
pitch the way they pitched against us, they can sweep all the way
without losing a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the clubs is best illustrated by pitching. In
the first round, the Yankees allowed one run, the Indians 20. The
Yankees will send out starters David Wells, David Cone, Andy
Pettitte and Orlando Herandez, while the Indians counter with the
less intimidating Jaret Wright, Charles Nagy, Bartolo Colon and
Dwight Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Cleveland is resilient.
</P>
<P>
   Of the last four playoffs series they have won, the Indians lost
the first game. They also play well on the road, having proved that
with two wins in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just refuse to accept defeat until the last out is made,''
outfielder David Justice said. ``This team has a lot of talent and
a lot of pride.''
</P>
<P>
   As if their talent weren't enough, the Yankees have some extra
incentive after losing to the Indians last October when they were
going for back-to-back titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly something that you could speculate about, that
if we had gotten by Cleveland and got to the World Series, we could
be playing for No. 3,'' Cone said. ``But it didn't happen. Maybe
this is why we won 114 games. Maybe last year was such a slap in
the face that guys were motivated in the off-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Another motivating favor is Darryl Strawberry, who will be
watching from a New York hospital after having surgery to remove a
cancerous tumor from his colon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the American League champions last season, so we're
the ones defending this,'' Indians general manager John Hart said.
``That's the way we're looking at this.''

 &HT;    Padres sit Brown in Game 1
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Take Livan Hernandez, Edgar Renteria, Eric Gregg,
Moises Alou and any other demon that tore at the Braves' trousers
as they were chased out of the 1997 NLCS and send them all to the
corner of the dugout. No one player did more to bring about
Atlanta's ouster last October than Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the Braves were dubious to news that the San Diego Padres
are sitting their ace in Wednesday night's Game 1 of the National
League Championship Series. Andy Ashby (17-9) will face John Smoltz
(17-3) in the opener before Tom Glavine takes on Brown Thursday,
all but eliminating Brown starting three games this series, unless
the Padres expect to bring him back on two days rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a lot of success against us the last couple years,''
Chipper Jones said. ``The series will probably hinge on whether or
not we can beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was just used twice on three days rest in a 10-days
stretch and against Houston in the League Division Series he showed
little wear. He struck out 16 in Game 1 (118 pitches) and though he
allowed a run on a bases-loaded walk in Game 3 (100 pitches), he
won both times. San Diego manager Bruce Bochy hedged on what to do
but the matter seemed settled when the Padres charter hit
Hartsfield International Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin went beyond the call of duty and by Saturday, he was
running on fumes,'' Bochy said. Greg Maddux is slated to face
left-hander Sterling Hitchcock in Saturday's Game 3 in San Diego.
Bochy's plans after that will be dictated by how Brown performs in
his first start and the Padres' standing in the series. In last
year's NLCS, the Marlins only needed two starts out of Brown. He
beat Maddux in Game 1, 5-3, and then nailed down the pennant
against Glavine 7-4 in Game 6. Both starts were at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're going to be different this year,'' said Javy Lopez.
``We already had that bad experience and we don't want to go
through that again. They (the Padres) beat Randy Johnson twice. Why
can't we beat Kevin Brown twice.''

 &HT;    Putting bitter back in rivalries
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia coach Jim Donnan will take some things
personally. History shows that college football rivalries are one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 30-year career as an assistant and head coach,
Donnan has served as a drought breaker of sorts. Georgia fans are
hoping that trend remains true Saturday at Sanford Stadium when the
seventh-ranked Bulldogs host No. 4 Tennessee, which has won seven
straight games in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game in our league counts, but anytime you've had a
tough time with a team, you work twice as hard preparing,'' Donnan
said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, Oklahoma had one of college football's
greatest dynasties. But for three straight seasons (1981-83), the
Sooners couldn't get past archrival Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma finally beat the Cornhuskers in 1984, and Sooners coach
Barry Switzer hired Donnan as his offensive coordinator the
following season. The Sooners won three straight games in the
series with Donnan on board.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Donnan left Oklahoma for his first head coaching job at
Division I-AA Marshall, which had lost 13 of 14 meetings to
Southern Conference rival Furman. But the Thundering Herd's
fortunes turned immediately under Donnan, who won five games
against the Paladins in his six-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Oklahoma, we felt like we not only needed to recruit
better, but we also need to build our weight program around what
Nebraska was doing,'' Donnan said. ``We felt like we could always
run with Nebraska, but we just weren't strong enough. When I got to
Marshall, we felt that Furman was the premier team in the league,
so we built our offense around beating them.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan faced a similar situation when he came to Georgia in
1996. Florida and Tennessee have been the dominant teams in the SEC
this decade. During the '90s, the Gators have compiled a 55-7
league record; Tennessee is 48-13-1. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs have
been mediocre at 29-32-1.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan addressed the problem through recruiting, adding speed at
the skill positions and signing several linemen. In two-plus
seasons, it appears the Bulldogs are closing the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia finished second to Tennessee in the SEC East last year
with a 6-2 league record. The Bulldogs also ended their seven-year
drought to Florida with a stunning 37-17 upset in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done (at Georgia) is build our scheme around
beating Florida and Tennessee,'' Donnan said. ``We haven't done it
against Tennessee yet, but hopefully we've done enough to be
competitive this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Bulldogs players admit they were intimidated by Florida,
which beat Georgia by an average of more than 26 points from
1990-96. But they insist the same isn't true with the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly felt that there was some (intimidation) with
Florida before last year,'' senior strong safety Kirby Smart said.
``Tennessee's just been weird. There were bad matchups. (Vols
All-America quarterback Peyton) Manning played well and really
ripped us apart. I think one of the big things with Tennessee is
that we hadn't played a big game before playing them in the past.
Now, we've played that big game against LSU.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers probably enter this week's SEC showdown with a
fragile psyche following Monday's loss of star tailback Jamal Lewis
to a season-ending knee injury. But can Georgia overcome the demons
of a seven-game losing streak?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're intimidated,'' offensive tackle Matt
Stinchcomb said. ``This is obviously a big game for us. It's big
for me. It's the last shot (against Tennessee) and I'm 0-3 so far.
This group of seniors wants it pretty bad.''

BOEING DELIVERIES DOWN 10 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. said Monday it delivered 123 airplanes
in the third quarter, or about 10 percent fewer than in the
previous quarter. Analysts said the decline in deliveries, while
troubling and worse than expected, reflects the deepening financial
crisis in Asia and not continued production problems.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be difficult for Boeing to make its earnings goal of
$1 a share this year if Boeing can't sell completed planes that
were intended for Asian customers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 30, the end of the third quarter, Boeing had 36
undelivered planes in desert storage, which is up from 20 in
storage at the end of the second quarter. More planes are being
sent to the desert because some Asian carriers don't have the money
to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Thai Airways International said it would cancel
or delay delivery of 15 jets made by Boeing and European rival
Airbus Industrie. ``Boeing is going to be challenged to get those
airplanes in storage delivered,'' said Peter Jacobs, industry
analyst with Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But Boeing said it still expects to deliver 550 airplanes this
year, though doing so means the company will have to deliver a
record 61 planes a month for the rest of the year. It delivered 368
planes in the first nine months, including 137 in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing Chairman Phil Condit cautioned several weeks ago that
Boeing would not deliver as many planes in the third quarter as it
had hoped. At the time, many analysts had been expecting Boeing to
deliver as many as 160 planes in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Condit's warning, analysts had already lowered
their third quarter earning estimates before Monday's delivery
figures were announced. On Wall Street, Boeing shares rose 11/16 to
$33.75.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nisbet, aerospace analyst with JSA Securities, said he will
stick with his estimate that Boeing will earn about 21 cents a
share for the third quarter. He had previously lowered his estimate
after Condit's warning.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs said he was forecasting Boeing would deliver 135 planes
in the third quarter. Even though that figure proved overly
optimistic, Jacobs said that for now he is sticking with his
estimate that Boeing will earn about 25 cents a share for the third
quarter. That is down from his estimate of about 32 cents a share
before Condit's advisory
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortfall in deliveries mainly is planes that have either
modest or no profit margin contribution,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   He also believes Boeing will still end the year with earnings of
about $1 a share.
</P>
<P>
   But part of Boeing's forecast that it will deliver 550 planes
this year depends on the company delivering most of the planes now
in storage.
</P>
<P>
   The planes in storage, Boeign said, include 10 classic models of
the 737 and eight next-generation models of the 737, as well as
nine 747s, one 767, three 777s and five MD-90s.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Boeing said ``the majority of these airplanes
are awaiting final customer-financing arrangements, most of which
are expeceted to occur in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the planes in storage are deliveries that Boeing delayed
until customers could obtain financing. But in other cases,
customers no longer want the planes they ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing must try and find a new home for those planes (that
customers no longer want,'' Jacobs said. ``That will be more of a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Boeing delievered 89 planes in the third quarter as
the company was reeling from a series of production problems that
eventually resulted in Boeing's first operational loss in a half
century for 1997
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Monday that Boeing appears to have worked through
those problems, but it will still be tough to produce those 550
planes this year, they said. That's because production lines
usually shut down for two weeks in December for the holidays.

YANKEES FORMIDABLE FOES FOR INDIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &UR;  &LR; -- &UR;  &LR; Having taken out the team that hasn't won a World
Series in 80 years, the Cleveland Indians, who have gone a
half-century since their last Series title but came within one out
of winning one last fall, are given little chance of observing a
happy anniversary. Not with the New York Yankees standing in their
way.
</P>
<P>
   But back in '48, the last time the Indians won, people thought
Dewey was a lock against Truman, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if too many teams match up against the Yankees,''
David Justice was saying in Fenway Park the night he sent the Red
Sox packing with a game-winning double off Sox closer Tom Gordon.
``But the favorite doesn't always win.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice has first-hand knowledge of that maxim, having played
for the Atlanta Braves, who are widely considered the team of the
'90s but have just one World Series ring to show for all their
autumn exercises.
</P>
<P>
   And it shouldn't take any special powers of recall for the
Yankees to recognize the Indians as a threat to disrupt their
coronation as one of baseball's all-time great teams.
</P>
<P>
   Just last season, the Yankees, who as a wild-card entry were a
much more modest participant than this season's 114-win Beast from
the Bronx, were four outs away from eliminating the Indians when
Sandy Alomar Jr. shocked closer Mariano Rivera with a home run,
much as Justice left Gordon dazed on Yawkey Way Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians went on to knock off the Yankees and polished off
the Orioles, too, before falling to the Florida Marlins in seven
games in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   And while 21-year-old Jaret Wright looked out of his league last
week against the Red Sox, who buried him with home runs by Mo
Vaughn and Nomar Garciaparra, he has been the right choice against
the Yankees. He beat them twice in the playoffs last season,
including the deciding Game 5, beat them twice during the regular
season this summer, and also found another way to aggravate the
pinstripers.
</P>
<P>
   In March, during an exhibition game, Wright threw a head-high
fastball to Yankees infielder Luis Sojo, who threw up his hand to
protect his face and wound up sustaining a fractured left hand.
Monday, Sojo was asked if he thought Wright was throwing at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, no doubt,'' he said. ``If I didn't lift my hand up, it
would have hit me in the head. That's why I was so upset. You can't
be a head-hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in June, Wright drilled a more important member of the
Yankees' repertory company, Paul O'Neill, hitting him in the elbow.
O'Neill stared at Wright all the way to first base, while umpire
John Shulock acted as his escort.
</P>
<P>
   Those two incidents left Wright Monday having to defend himself
against head-hunting accusations almost as much as Pedro Martinez
in his early incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthander David Wells, who will oppose Wright Tuesday night in
Yankee Stadium, intimated without naming names that Wright threw at
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much I can say about that,'' Wright said when
asked if he thought the Yankees might carry a vendetta against him.
``I don't think we need to turn this thing into more than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Indians to beat the Yankees, they'll have to generate a
little more offense than the Texas Rangers did in being swept by
the Yankees in their division series. The high-powered Rangers
scored just one run in 27 innings against the Yankees, who used
Wells, David Cone, and Andy Pettitte in that series and will start
El Duque, Orlando Hernandez, in Game 4.

 &HT;    Panel OKs probe of Clinton
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The ghost of Watergate hung over the House
Judiciary Committee chambers Monday as a divided panel approved an
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-16 party-line vote sets the stage for the full House to
act on the measure later this week before members head home for
elections. Given the Republican majority, the House is expected to
approve what would be the third presidential impeachment inquiry in
the nation's history and the second within 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry would allow investigators to explore 15 grounds of
potentially impeachable offenses that range from lying under oath
to obstructing justice to tampering with witnesses. The charges are
somewhat broader than those independent counsel Kenneth Starr
delivered to the committee four weeks ago but lack some of Starr's
more far-reaching allegations, such as the charge that the
president obstructed justice by refusing to testify for seven
months during his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican chairman of the committee, Henry Hyde of
Illinois, opened the proceedings with a plea that his colleagues
put aside their partisan differences and a pledge to do their
constitutional duty in the same way members investigating President
Nixon did in the very same room in the summer of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to ask and answer this one simple question: based
upon what we know now, do we have a duty to look further, or to
look away?'' Hyde asked in a solemn tone.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde then became the first in a string of lawmakers to invoke
the name of former New Jersey Rep. Peter Rodino, the chairman of
the Nixon impeachment hearings. Quoting Rodino, as he sat
underneath life-size portraits of himself and his predecessor from
the Watergate hearings, Hyde said: ``We cannot turn away, out of
partisanship or convenience, from problems that are now our
responsibility, our inescapable responsibility to consider.'' Rep.
John Conyers of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the panel and the
only member left on the committee from the Watergate days, said the
Republicans are out to embarrass the Democrats by ``conjuring up
the ghost of Watergate'' whenever they can. In reality, he said,
the charges amount only to the president lying about sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Watergate, it's an extramarital affair,'' Conyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario replayed itself again and again throughout the
daylong hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans portrayed the president as a liar who obstructed
justice and engaged in a conspiracy to conceal an adulterous affair
with Monica Lewinsky, a former employee half his age.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats see it, Clinton lied about the relationship, but to
shield himself from public humiliation and to protect his family
from the pain that accompanies exposure of such affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, given the 21 to 16 split of the committee,
Republicans defeated two Democratic efforts to limit the duration
and scope of the impeachment inquiry. The majority insisted the
inquiry should not be restricted and investigators should be
allowed to follow the truth wherever it takes them.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Republican investigator David Schippers unveiled 15
charges, four more than set forth by Starr in his 445-page report.
The accusations allege there ``is substantial and credible
evidence'' that the president committed perjury, obstructed justice
and abused his presidential powers in trying to conceal his affair
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the minority's chief counsel, quoted historians
such as George Mason and Alexander Hamilton in arguing that
impeachment is an offense reserved for the most serious of crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the 1974 impeachment hearings of former President Richard
Nixon, Lowell said President Clinton was not lying about breaking
into the Democratic Party's headquarters, nor was he using the CIA
for personal benefit. He was lying about an adulterous affair and
therefore should be judged in that context, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   The 37 members of the committee delivered their individual takes
on the evidence amassed by Starr since January. Starr has spent
four years and $40 million investigating a series of allegations
against the president, but nothing materialized from any of the
other charges.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the members clearly had made up their minds about the
Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this president is allowed to use the presidency to gratify
his personal desires, in the same way a corrupt county or parish
boss solicits money for votes, future occupants will, sadly, do the
same,'' said Georgia Republican Bob Barr, a member of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Barr had pushed for impeachment of the president even before the
Lewinsky affair surfaced, citing campaign fund-raising abuses and
allegations that the White House improperly obtained FBI files on
political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's fiery speech Monday starkly contrasted with Florida
Democratic Rep. Robert Wexler, who drew a burst of applause from
members on his side of the aisle for condemning Republicans for
taking the process so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is not about adultery; it is rooted in a
constitutional standard that has met the test of time,'' Wexler
said. ``It is about subversion of government. The president had an
affair. He lied about it. He didn't want anyone to know about it.
Does anyone reasonably believe that this amounts to subversion of
government?''
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the mood was more amicable, even light-hearted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this Watergate or Peyton Place?'' asked Lindsey Graham
(R-S.C.), one of the few members on the committee who appears not
to have made up his mind about whether the president should be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   If the charges amount only to the president lying about a sexual
affair, Graham said, he would not support impeachment. But if the
evidence shows the president ran a criminal enterprise from the
Oval Office, then he would have no other choice but to support
impeachment. ``It would be Richard Nixon times 10,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the elegant three-story high Judiciary Committee
chambers, reporters and camera crews started lining up for position
early Monday morning. Inside, the speeches were passionate at times
and off course at other moments. James Madison and Thomas Paine
were among the favorites to quote. There was even a comparison
between the current scandal and Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Three White House aides monitored the hearing from the third row
of the audience, sitting right next to Republican investigators. At
the close of the day, both sides were attempting to control the
outcome of the day's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears what (David) Schippers has done is to replace the
most serious of Starr's allegations and replace them with a
multiplicity of less serious charges that while perhaps easier to
prove are less serious in nature,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for
the Democrats on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republican staffers countered by saying the sheer number of
charges indicated the gravity of the position faced by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of nearly 11 hours of fiesty debate, Hyde brought the
proceedings to a surprising close when he told his committee
members that he had a very important announcement: Please, he said,
do not miss the committee's photo session on Wednesday morning.

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday urged a select group of
the world's top financial officials to develop a unified attack on
the global economic crisis, after nearly three days of debate here
have produced a near stalemate over immediate cures.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke on Monday night at the beginning of a five-hour,
closed session with finance ministers and central bankers from the
largest industrial economies and 15 emerging markets nations that
have been striken by currency devaluations, plummeting stock
markets and growing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But the session on Monday night focused chiefly on long-term
ideas for making the global economy less vulnerable to shocks,
proposed by the United States and others, despite widespread
criticism here that those meeting are spending too little attention
on coordinated immediate action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton returns to the arena on Tuesday morning, when he
addresses the International Monetary Fund. It is holding its annual
meeting here along with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Monday night echoed a lament heard often these days
by politicians who feel whiplashed by the markets, saying that
global capital markets ``can react swiftly and harshly when
countries stray from sound policies.'' He added, `` the markets
also can overreact, subjecting even countries following good
policies to severe pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before Clinton opened the talks, the markets proved
his point, continuing their fall around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   While the reasons varied, from heightened fears about Japan's
banks to concern that it is taking too long to put together a huge
package of aid for Brazil, the declines appeared set off by fears
that the first few days of meetings here contained more
finger-pointing than plans for action.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's stock market closed below 13,000 on Monday for the first
time in 12 years _ further undercutting the financial viability of
its banks _ and the Dow Jones industrial average also plunged,
before recovering much of the day's loss.
</P>
<P>
   While officials seem to be reaching some consensus about
preventing future turmoil, more fissures opened at Monday's meeting
over how the world should respond, at a moment when the United
States, the Europeans and the emerging-market nations all have
different prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, for example, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin directly
confronted Southeast Asian nations that have been pressing for _
and in a few cases enacting _ rules that would restrict the rights
of investors to move money freely across national borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Misguided exchange and capital controls are not the answer for
dealing with the effects of this crisis,'' Rubin insisted in a
speech to the leading advisory panel to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the loss of confidence and resulting flight of capital
from many emerging market economies has carried with it a heavy
cost, measures that would effectively prevent the return of this
capital will only postpone recovery and the restoration of economic
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He was clearly referring most directly to Malaysia, which has
not only imposed such controls, but also arrested and imprisoned
the country's former finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, an ally of
Rubin's. Malaysia announced on Monday that it would suspend Anwar's
trial, on charges of revealing state secrets and sodomy, until just
after Clinton visits Malaysia next month for the next major meeting
on the global crisis, involving leaders from around the Pacific
Rim.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also delivered a rare public rebuke to both the World Bank
and the IMF, institutions created 53 years ago to stabilize the
world economy, for their troubles in coming up with common
solutions to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is past time to put aside institutional rivalries
unbefitting public institutions with the same shareholders,'' he
said. ``The IMF and World Bank must evolve to meet the new demands
of the global economy. All of us must work together.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the thousands of delegates who moved through the
meetings, wending their way from seminars on debt restructuring to
glittering embassy receptions, criticism grew that Rubin and
leaders of the other major economies should move more quickly to
show they have a short-term plan.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund manager, said in a
forum sponsored by Foreign Policy magazine on Monday that ``the G-7
should be shut in a room and not allowed to come out until they
have reached a decision'' to extend loan guarantees and other
backup financing to countries like Brazil that are ``essentially
following the right policies.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Soros was blamed by many at the IMF and World Bank
meetings in Hong Kong for accentuating Asia's troubles by betting
against its currencies _ an accusation he denied. But on Monday, he
pressed his argument that countries have increasingly become slaves
to the notion that markets are always right and self-correcting,
declaring, ``Right now, market fundamentalism is a greater threat
to open society than any totalitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   In his public comments at least, Clinton has stepped around the
sensitive issue of how much governments should intervene to contain
market excesses. It is a territory where he is likely to bow to
Rubin, a former Wall Street trader who is extraordinarily cautious
about any moves that might smack of government efforts to restrict
the free flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rubin has pressed an agenda of long-term fixes to make
the way countries handle their resources more transparent and to
establish uniform rules when countries or companies cannot pay
their debts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, several of those were endorsed in three reports
issued by the G-22 _ a group of 22 countries that has turned into a
think-tank about future economic crises. One called for the release
of far more economic data by countries and companies alike, noting
that the lack of such information ``exacerbated'' the panic that
began in Asia last year. Thailand and South Korea, for example,
both hid the depths of their problems last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another report endorsed changes in IMF strategy so that
countries that could be hit by economic contagion _ a phrase that
was rarely heard at these meetings until the Mexican peso crisis of
1995 _ can ``seek early assistance.'' That is the essence of a
proposal Clinton made on Friday, but its success depends on the
approval by Congress of $18 billion in additional funds for the
agency. Republicans in the House of Representatives are
overwhelmingly opposed, and there was no action Monday on resolving
the House's differences with the Senate, which approved the
commitment to the Fund more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   A final report on strengthening weak financial systems in
countries around the world calls for a series of regulatory
changes, including bankruptcy laws and established procedures to
govern the restructuring of a nation's debt. In the present crisis
that has been done on a case by case basis _ and in the case of
Russia, the debt restructuring so far has been done largely by
Russian decree.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ideas have been in circulation for long enough now
that they have begun to develop a momentum of their own. But they
do not address the current crisis, and many of the officials here
are complaining that Rubin and the IMF are focusing on rebuilding
the hospital before they have treated some critically ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   But coordinated action is in short supply. The markets have been
waiting to hear word of some kind of pre-emptive financial
assistance for Brazil, totaling $30 billion or more, but while the
details have largely been negotiated the Brazilian government is
loathe to announce it until President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
apparent victory in a Sunday election is secured.
</P>
<P>
   And representatives of virtually all the major countries here,
especially Asian nations, say they are still waiting for most signs
that Japan is ready to deal with its banking crisis. The market
drop in Tokyo today, just days after the lower house of Parliament
passed the latest bill over dealing with the banks, suggested that
investors believe Japan is still not doing enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's straightforward,'' said Kenneth Courtis, the chief
economist for Deutche Bank's Asia operations. ``We've gotten from
Japan all that we are going to get.''

COMMENTARY: TWO VIEWS OF ONE CONCEPT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ We have before us today, in dramatic opposition, two
views of what it means to be a conservative and a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   One respects institutions, cares about fair means as well as
ends, puts country before party. The other has no regard for
institutions or fairness, believing that the end of winning
justifies any means.
</P>
<P>
   The first is Gerald Ford. The second is Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   President Ford, writing Sunday on the Op-Ed page of The New York
Times, conveyed a sense of honor that has been achingly absent in
the sordid months of debate about President Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come,'' Ford said, ``to pause and consider the
long-term consequences of removing this president from office based
on the evidence at hand.'' He foresaw, if Congress goes down that
road, ``a protracted and increasingly divisive debate over those
deliberately imprecise words `high crimes and misdemeanors.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Ford suggested that, after the House Judiciary Committee
considers possible ground for impeachment, Clinton appear at the
end of the year in the well of the House. There he would receive
``a harshly worded rebuke as rendered by members of both parties
... By his appearance the president would accept full
responsibility for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let it be dignified, honest and above all cleansing,''
President Ford wrote. ``The result, I believe, would be the first
moment of majesty in an otherwise squalid year.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could doubt him when he said he had no political agenda
and no ``interest in `rescuing' Bill Clinton. But I do care,
passionately, about rescuing the country I love from further
turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Kenneth Starr. He was a fine judge. But in the
role of independent counsel, over these last four years, he has
become a caricature of a prosecutorial zealot.
</P>
<P>
   In his relentless desire to destroy President and Mrs. Clinton,
Starr has damaged the institution of grand jury secrecy that
protects us all. He has deprived this and future presidents of the
right to consult White House lawyers in confidence. He has filed a
report to the House with irrelevant salacious detail in order to
humiliate his target.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few examples of Starr's overreaching tactics.
And now we know more.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29 Starr argued in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington that White House lawyers should be forced to testify in
his investigation of the president. He conceded that Clinton would
be entitled to talk to them in confidence to defend against
impeachment, but he said impeachment was ``too remote a possibility
to be considered by the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three days later, we have learned, Starr asked another
court to approve his use of secret grand jury material in his
planned impeachment report to the House. So he lied to the Court of
Appeals. Or, more charitably, he was sleazy.
</P>
<P>
   An important article in The New York Times, by Don Van Natta Jr.
and Jill Abramson, disclosed something else. Three right-wing
lawyers helped Linda Tripp and got word to Starr's office about her
accusations at least a week before she telephoned the office on
Jan. 12 _ which was when the Starr report said the office got into
the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three was a partner in Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, the law firm
in which Starr remained a partner until July 31 of this year.
Moreover, at least two of the lawyers also did work on behalf of
Paula Jones. A section of the Independent Counsel Act forbids a
counsel, or anyone in a law firm with which he is associated, to
represent any person ``involved in any investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether those maneuverings violated the act is impossible to
answer at this stage. But if Starr had disclosed the pre-Jan. 12
involvement, Attorney General Janet Reno might well have thought it
wise to ask another lawyer _ one more detached _ to undertake the
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   We ought to know more, much more, about the relationship among
Paula Jones' lawyers, Linda Tripp, her entourage and Starr. In
fairness, he should answer questions under oath. But we should
follow the example of Ford, eschew zealotry and strive above all to
end the turmoil.

 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Atlanta has lost most of its allure as commuting has
grown more difficult,'' carped The Economist magazine recently,
citing cities around the world _ from Sao Paulo to Singapore_ where
traffic jams have become a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to shout back that we're still pretty alluring here in
the metropolitan South. It's just that we eat fried green tomatoes
as an hors d'oeurve now instead of at breakfast with our grits.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, though_trafficis changing southern lifestyles. We don't
have time for grits; we don't have time for breakfast at all. We
have to start driving to work before dawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist slam is just the latest of a series of negative
jabs about Atlanta's congestion. The bad publicity has gotten the
attention of business leaders. The Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce formed the Metro Transportation Group earlier this year
with the aim of presenting a new governor with some possible metro
congestion solutions. Listening in this week on the group's
discussion of specific targets, I'm encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, members seem inclined to dump the ``local
control'' excuse for never-ending sprawl, a leftover from the
Populist era when locals didn't trust higher-ups, be they state or
federal. Here in the land of green tomatoes and grits, we now know
only a stronger state hand can save us from choking on our
prosperity. If it weren't for federal Clean Air Act mandates, state
transportation officials would holler for more asphalt to the last
gasp.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro Group wants to add clout to regional plans, something
other cities did long ago, and members want to figure out how to
fund ``a world class transit system.'' Atlanta's regional planning
structure is fatally flawed. Despite its well-meaning staff, the
Atlanta Regional Commission Board is dominated by county
commissioners obligated to local constituencies and cozy with
developers. Over the years, the state DOT has made the most of
parochial politics: counties present their lists of desired new
roads, and the ARC votes to approve most of them. Even before the
ARC votes, there are bilateral agreements between the counties and
the state DOT on pet projects. The deal-making system works against
the regional good.
</P>
<P>
   The model that should be in place is one that elevates regional
priorities and regional funding. In San Diego, San Francisco and
Portland, the metropolitan planning agency, not the state DOT,
controls the regional federal and state funds.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, like most southern states, will receive more federal
transportation dollars than ever before this year, but the federal
Environmental Protection Agency says they can't be spent on new
road projects until ozone pollution is brought under control. A new
regional transportation structure not subject to manipulation by
the developer-prone DOT is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The second challenge is a more viable transit system. Atlanta's
system is stunted because development around train stations wasn't
encouraged and because racial undercurrents kept the trains from
expanding to the suburbs. As Jeff Rader, transportation specialist
with the Atlanta Chamber says, ``Transit is like a hot-house
flower. In the right environment, it can flourish.'' Metro Atlanta
offered a chilly environment for mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   The Metro Group wants a dedicated source of state funding for
transit. Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Roy Barnes
supports earmarking the state sales tax on gasoline _about $40
million a year_ which would require legislation, not a change in
the constitution. Meanwhile, frontrunner Guy Milner, the GOP
candidate, is focusing on eliminating the car tax, not some of the
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But the Metro Group is chock full of conservative business types
who could influence Millner. So, regardless of who wins the Georgia
governor's race, a new generation of commuters may savor grits for
breakfast again before the millennium_and fried green tomatoes too_
at home or on the train.

AT&AMP;T TO ACQUIRE VANGUARD CELLULAR SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expanding its wireless network in the Northeast from big cities
into smaller markets, AT&AMP;T Corp. said Monday that it had agreed to
acquire Vanguard Cellular Systems Inc. for about $900 million in
stock and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Vanguard could allow AT&AMP;T to further exploit the success
of its new Digital One Rate pricing plan. That plan has shaken up
the wireless communications business by eliminating long-distance
fees and ``roaming'' charges for using phones outside of home
areas.
</P>
<P>
   While customers who use the new program pay a flat fee for calls
to anywhere in the nation, AT&AMP;T must still pay extra when those
customers use other companies' networks. That means AT&AMP;T can lose
money when its customers range far afield.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Vanguard could help solve that problem. Under the
brand name Cellular One, Vanguard operates wireless systems along
the Maine coast, in Pennsylvania around Allentown and around
Charleston, W.Va. Those systems would help link AT&AMP;T's systems
around New York, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we save expenses there? Absolutely,'' Dan Hesse,
president of AT&AMP;T's wireless unit, said in an interview. ``But the
primary reason we're acquiring Vanguard is that it fits into our
footprint and allows us to provide seamless service.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Vanguard's shareholders could elect
to receive either $23 in cash or .3987 share of AT&AMP;T for each share
of Vanguard. AT&AMP;T's shares closed at $58.625 on Friday, making the
stock component of the deal worth about $23.37 for each share of
Vanguard. But the deal says that half of the overall payment will
be in stock and half in cash, so some Vanguard stockholders may not
be able to get what they want.
</P>
<P>
   The companies expect to complete the acquisition in the first
quarter of 1999. Hesse said the deal could mildly dilute AT&AMP;T's
earnings for the first year after completion. AT&AMP;T will also assume
Vanguard's debt of about $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T was advised by TD Securities. Vanguard, based in
Greensboro, N.C., employed Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than stay independent or stay on our past laurels, we
decided to seek a transaction where we could become part of
something lasting,'' said Stephen Leeolou, Vanguard's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications Inc., which owns wireless businesses in the
Boston area and in western New York, and has agreed to acquire
Connecticut's dominant communications company, was seen as a
logical bidder for Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the process said SBC considered acquiring
Vanguard a few years ago and passed. They added that AT&AMP;T was the
only bidder with a serious telecommunications background this time
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good strategic move for AT&AMP;T,'' said John Bensche, a
wireless communications analyst at Lehman Brothers.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Anti-environment mind games
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only a guess here, but if the current majority in Congress had
its way the Environmental Protection Agency would be the size of an
Orange Julius day crew, just without the snazzy uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   EPA would be downsized _ the P gone _ and privatized, maybe to
be run by Dow Chemical, Exxon or RJ Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   That the EPA still has its middle initial is a credit to voters
who chose Bill Clinton for president in 1992 and 1996. What the
Republicans are trying to do to the EPA right now is good reason to
wish new vitality for Democrats. They need vigor to combat
budgetary hooliganism that gets cover in a Capitol veiled in Silly
String.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks mainly to the Democrat in the White House, the new
Republican majority in Congress could not carry off designs to
emasculate the EPA in 1995 by cutting its budget by one-third.
</P>
<P>
   That defeat caused the GOP to retreat from environmental
scorched-earth budget tactics, to choose more limited skirmishes to
show that the party that controls purse strings shall command how
the EPA shall act.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon of choice now is the budget rider, language attached
to allocations that tells recipients what they can or cannot do
with the money authorized. Riders scattered throughout eight budget
bills for different departments are attracting veto threats from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   One such rider was removed recently from the teh appropriations
bill for Veterans Affairs-HUD and independent agencies, which
include EPA. The rider effectively would have placed a gag order on
the EPA on the issue of global warming _ no educational activities,
including workshops and conferences.
</P>
<P>
   In July the House stripped the gag rule 226 to 178.
</P>
<P>
   While that rule was stripped, report language (words to explain
the intent of legislation) in the same bill remains that
effectively would prevent the EPA from doing anything ``in
contemplation'' of regulations to curb global warming. That's
right. Don't even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress hasn't signed on to the Kyoto Protocol measures
to which President Clinton agreed on curbing greenhouse emissions,
bill authors don't want a taxpayer-subsidized thought going toward
the subject. This, though Congress has asked the administration to
explain how it intends to implement the Kyoto accords. Seemingly,
such a request would require contemplation by EPA.
</P>
<P>
   People in the EPA would be left in a quandary with a requirement
such as this, since contemplation of any type of air pollution
regulation could be construed as violating this insane prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   After all, reducing emissions isn't just a matter of combatting
greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. It's also a
matter of curbing particulates and toxins like lead and mercury.
Just what can the EPA contemplate, Mr. Congressman?
</P>
<P>
   High in the Colorado Rockies, a think tank called the Keystone
Center brings together players from government and industry to find
mutually satisfactory solutions to environmental issues like air
pollution and global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Observers of this commendable process say the mind games written
into the budget bill might put an end to the EPA's role in the
Keystone Center's brainstorming and sharing sessions on air
pollution. You wouldn't want to bend a contemplation ban.
</P>
<P>
   To have an agency assigned to protect the environment and to
forbid it from ``contemplating'' solutions to what vast numbers of
climatologists warn is a grave global problem? That is stupidity
beyond contemplating.

 &HT;    Protesters claim bias at court
 &HT;    By Nichole Monroe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Emotional demonstrators marched in front of the
Supreme Court on Monday to protest the low number of minority law
clerks hired at the nation's highest judicial body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The justices' record on hiring clerks of color is so poor that
if the civil rights laws applied, the Supreme Court would be
vulnerable to a charge that it has discriminated on the basis of
race,'' said Stephan Kline, legislative counsel at the Alliance for
Justice, an association of public interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 428 clerks hired by the nine current justices since they
joined the court, less than 2 percent were African-American, 4
percent were Asian-American, 1 percent were Hispanic and none has
been Native American, according to USA Today. One-quarter were
women.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP head Kweisi Mfume and other organizers said justices
should hire from a larger pool of applicants. About half of the
clerks hired in the last 25 years have come from Harvard, Yale or
Columbia universities. Mfume said the issue of minority law clerks
is especially important as the court considers such controversial
issues as affirmative action, school vouchers and welfare reform.
Clerks help determine which cases the court will consider, and
write the first drafts of most decisions.

 &HT;    The debut of a princess
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it a Cinderella story. Or maybe just a princess story. But
it is certainly a dream come true for actress Kendra Munger, 25,
former apprentice at the Jupiter Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening at the Grove Street Playhouse in Greenwich
Village, she opened in a new musical, Queen of Hearts, her first
role ever on a New York stage. No, not as the third chorus singer
from the left, but starring in the title role _ as the late Diana
Spencer, former Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Although her debut was at a tiny 73-seat, off-off-Broadway
theater, Munger has had to bear up through a media frenzy usually
reserved for Andrew Lloyd Webber's multimillion-dollar phantoms and
felines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been so much coverage, and the way that I dealt with
it was I just didn't let myself think about it,'' Munger says. Not
easy when you get a panicked call from your producer warning that
there are London tabloids hot on your trail, looking for a scoop
about this Connecticut lass who dares to play their beloved Diana.
</P>
<P>
   By now Munger has become a pro at television, taping more
interviews than many a stage veteran has in an entire career. ``I
was on Access Hollywood, I was on CNN, Fox Cable News. We filmed
stuff for Extra, but I haven't seen it on yet,'' says Munger with a
nervous giggle.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous perhaps, because she knows that such attention could
backfire on the production. ``That scares me a little,'' Munger
concedes. ``I worry that people's expectations will be extremely
high. It worries me that the general public will be coming,
thinking they'll be seeing some Broadway-quality production. It
can't be. We don't have that budget at all.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, though, Munger is just relieved that the
production is happening at all. This Cinderella almost got the
pumpkin treatment when war broke out during rehearsals between
Queen of Hearts' writers and its producer. Charges and
counter-charges of ``erratic,
</P>
<P>
   volatile and irrational behavior'' almost halted the show before
it opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't sided with anyone, because I don't honestly
understand what the whole thing is about,'' Munger says. ``It's
like anything we hear from one side is completely contradicted by
the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the creative team was encouraging the actors to
leave the production,'' Munger says. ``I've received so much
publicity, I don't feel comfortable with the idea that a show
doesn't go on because I back out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the theater, Miss Munger. Trade in your tiara for a
protective helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after graduating from Skidmore College with honors in
theater, Munger auditioned in New York for the one open space in
Jupiter Theatre's 1994-95 apprentice class. ``That was the first
audition that I went to in the big, bad city,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Norb Joerder, the defunct dinner theater's resident director,
``was choreographing some simple little routine to Tea for Two and
I was not even getting it,'' she says forlornly. ``So I thought I
had done a terrible audition, and I remember writing my boyfriend,
saying, `You don't have to worry. I'm not going to be taking off
for a year.''' Of course, she got the job and left for South
Florida a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jupiter was a nice introduction into the professional
world,'' says Munger, ``a real training experience. We weren't
treated badly as apprentices, because they couldn't have run the
place without us, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sommerville of Tequesta, a freelance director and acting
teacher who worked closely with the Jupiter apprentices, recalls
Munger as a standout of the group. ``Because she was so quiet and
approached everything from an intellectual level first. She was
very quiet, very elegant, but you could tell that that brain was
just churning away. Everything about her was just very truthful,
onstage or off.'' As to her latest role as Diana, ``It's the most
perfect casting in the world,'' Sommerville says.
</P>
<P>
   During that year, Munger appeared in Mame, The Secret Garden,
It's A Wonderful Life and My Fair Lady, usually in the ensemble and
occasionally understudying a major role. She had to struggle to get
the understudying assignment as Eliza Doolittle, and her mother
cites that as a sign of her personal growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they were going to give it to an intern,''
recalls Doris Munger, a former airline flight attendant living in
New Canaan, Conn. ``She's always been kind of shy and retiring, but
she felt she deserved that and could do it, so she really went and
pleaded for the role. That's where I saw her growth really, in
seeing her develop the tenacity to stand up for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask the younger Munger what her most vivid memory of the Jupiter
Theatre is, though, and she'll mention being in the children's show
Jack and the Beanstalk on the day the theater caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Munger was backstage when she heard an unexpected silence. ``And
I thought, `Oh, somebody dropped a line,' and then I heard them
say, `Fire, there's a fire,' and soon the whole curtain was in
flames. So basically I was yelling at everyone to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a baptism by fire did nothing to extinguish her
determination to become an actress. ``Ever since she was a little
girl, it's been the only thing she ever wanted to do,'' says Mrs.
Munger.
</P>
<P>
   After Jupiter, Munger worked at other dinner theaters and toured
the country with one-afternoon-stands of children's shows.
Eventually, her voice teacher advised her that she needed to land a
role in New York to attract an agent and move her career forward.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Munger was thumbing through the classified ads in the
trade paper Backstage when an audition notice for Queen of Hearts
caught her eye. Hoping she could land a supporting role in this
Princess Di musical, she headed for the open, non-union casting
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I auditioned for it, it was honestly just because it was
something in New York,'' she insists. ``I didn't think I'd get
called back for Diana.'' Other actresses looked more like the
princess than she did, says Munger, but after a five-hour-long
callback audition where she read most of the 95-page script, the
part was hers.
</P>
<P>
   Every parent probably thinks of her daughter as a princess, and
Mrs. Munger is no exception. ``I think she's always had a certain
bearing. She does have the build and the coloring, and the haircut
doesn't hurt either,'' Kendra's mother says, referring to a Vidal
Sassoon Di cut that completes the stage illusion.
</P>
<P>
   Munger recalls that her folks gave her a book about Diana some
15 years ago, but she would hardly describe herself as obsessed by
the princess. ``I didn't follow her, but she was always there,
y'know? It was kind of hard to miss her. I have a memory of
watching the wedding, and I must have been 8. And I remember
thinking, `Oh, I want to have a dress like that, and I want to get
married to a prince.' I think that my generation of girls were the
ones who were hit hardest by it,'' says Munger, referring to
Diana's abrupt death a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Stephen Stahl, who was also Queen of Hearts' director
until his recent ouster, began writing it as a non-musical long
before Diana's demise. ``Once she died,'' says Munger, ``he felt he
needed to make it a musical to make it less heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   The musical, the actress says, is very favorable to Diana. It
does not shrink from the royal couple's marital difficulties or her
imperfections, but it sides with her, telling matters from her
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   As Queen of Hearts opens, Diana has just been killed. ``She's
sort of in that state of limbo that people describe, where her life
is flashing in front of her,'' says Munger. Answering her cries for
help is another princess who expired in a car crash _ Princess
Grace of Monaco _ acting as Diana's guardian angel to guide her
through a tour of her life.
</P>
<P>
   If this strikes you as sounding like A Christmas Carol, you're
not the only one. ``Exactly,'' agrees Munger. ``She goes back to
her Christmas Past.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last image you see of Diana, she's very happy, she's with
Dodi (Fayed) and I sing this song called It's My Time, this great,
upbeat song. That makes it really ironic, because we know what lies
ahead for her,'' says Munger. Then, following reports of Diana's
death, ``it has bits of the Earl of Spencer talking at the funeral
and then, at the very end, Princess Grace leads Diana into the
light.''
</P>
<P>
   Try acting that scene with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   Lyric soprano Munger carries much of the show's singing load,
including a love duet with Fayed (You Are My World) and a touching
ballad at the bedside of an AIDS patient (Time To Let Go). There is
even a musical number that she sings while playing with her sons,
William and Harry (Back To My Babies). ``You almost feel like I
should have a hat and cane,'' Munger says.
</P>
<P>
   Besides learning these songs, dealing with interview requests
and watching the skirmish between the producer and the writers,
Munger has had to come up with a believable British accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that people are always very hard on that, especially
when you've got an American playing a British person,'' says
Munger, who studied one summer at the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art. Where most productions would have hired an expert to
train the cast, it simply wasn't in Queen of Hearts' budget. ``I
literally went to a professional dialect coach and gave him $185
for an hour,'' explains Munger. ``And I've rented some videotapes
of (Diana), too.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, she's been too busy to worry about the eventual fate of
Queen of Hearts. ``I hope they'll like it,'' Munger says of the
critics. ``I hope that the expectations aren't too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushed off from consideration at the moment is the next step for
the show, which might move to a larger New York theater for an
open-ended run or perhaps transfer to London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just focusing on this production,'' says Munger. ``It
would be nice to get good reviews, of course. Maybe I won't read
any unless somebody says one's good, so I don't get my feelings
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens to the show, Munger's future
prospects look good. She will certainly get her wish, that the
theater world's eyes will be on her this week. And yes, just in
case the musical and its star get thumbs up, the debuting performer
has kept her calendar clear to continue her ride with Princess
Diana.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I don't have makeup on. Do you mind?''
</P>
<P>
   She sits, slowly. Eleanor Lambert has penciled in this breakfast
visit as her first activity of the day, just before going to her
office to meet with her accountant. She still keeps 40-hour weeks.
She is 95.
</P>
<P>
   She recently had cataract surgery on her right eye and keeps
wiping it. ``I hope he doesn't make me look ghastly,'' she says,
watching the photographer who is preparing to take her picture.
</P>
<P>
   It is a passing thought. ``Let's go on,'' she says, going back
to her topic.
</P>
<P>
   She was talking about fashion.
</P>
<P>
   She has always been talking about fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert is a fashion publicist, but that doesn't explain much.
Then again, it's hard to fit this on a business card:
</P>
<P>
   Co-founder, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute,
1937.
</P>
<P>
   Founder, the International Best-Dressed List, 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Founder, fashion's Coty Awards, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Founder, the semi-annual New York fashion week, 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Founder, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Hostess, kickoff brunch for fashion week, every year.
</P>
<P>
   But no brunch on this particular week, even if there are shows.
A dozen or so designers, including Donna Karan and Calvin Klein,
have jumped schedule and are showing collections now instead of in
November. Good for business, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert is not impressed. Calvin sent her an invitation. She's
not going.
</P>
<P>
   She has her ideas about how fashion should be. But she pauses
and looks across her small sitting room and out at Central Park,
which is a blur to her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think geriatric advice is always looked at with disdain,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   But what the hell.
</P>
<P>
   She returns to the room wearing lipstick, earrings and blush.
She sits back in her chair and props her left foot in a crook of
the coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Fashion) shows now, they do everything on such a grand
scale,'' she says. ``There's lights and music, but no commentary.
Nobody tells you whether the fabric is wool or crepe. It's just
pretty girls walking up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert got into fashion because she thought of it as art. She
left her mother and her Indiana home and studied at the Art
Institute of Chicago. She wrote about clothing design for
newspapers to earn money to reach New York.
</P>
<P>
   She barely knew her father _ he left three months after her
birth _ but she worked like him. Henry was an advance man for the
Ringling Brothers circus and went from town to town.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert went into public relations and worked 57th Street,
finding artists to represent at $10 a week. Then designers. It grew
from there.
</P>
<P>
   She married Seymour Berkson, an executive with Hearst
newspapers, in 1936. He died in 1959. Now, from where she sits, she
cannot tell his photo on a nearby table from that of their son,
William.
</P>
<P>
   She continues.
</P>
<P>
   These days, young designers don't get enough training before
launching their own collections, she says. And shows should keep
out the designer's groupies _ ``those silly fools who yell and
scream and have nothing to do with fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   She dismisses one designer as being ``into gurus,'' and says
that while Calvin is ``an interesting fellow,'' his clothes look so
much alike.
</P>
<P>
   She even misses the pink filters on the lights that gave clothes
in fashion shows that ``glamour look.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves and comes back with a necklace and sits. She arranges
her sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today think you can just tear the clothes apart and
it's fashion,'' she says. ``It's a slapdash approach to creativity.
The problem is, there are only a dozen truly creative designers
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Beene, for one. Anna Sui. Oscar de la Renta. Bill
Blass. She still represents Blass.
</P>
<P>
   For all her ``don'ts'' and ``shouldn'ts,'' she loves fashion.
She helped launch the careers of ``Bill,'' ``Oscar,'' Yves St.
Laurent, Pierre Cardin and Valentino, introducing them to the
press. That's what her biography says.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert has been gesturing. She arranges her sleeves again. She
asks the photographer, ``Did I spoil the line?''
</P>
<P>
   She never modeled clothes. She never designed them, either. No
talent, she says.
</P>
<P>
   But she helped pick out Grace Kelly's bridal wardrobe. And she
gave good friend Judy Garland fashion advice.
</P>
<P>
   Garland's husband, Vincent Minnelli, was one of Lambert's
clients. And Lambert met Kelly at a party and offered to escort her
around Seventh Avenue boutiques for wedding clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The pantsuit Lambert is wearing today is a copy of one she
bought years ago in Palm Beach. She had it remade in gray silk. It
is a uniform of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the proper thing for old people to do,'' she says.
``You can't be utterly couture at an advanced age. People would
look at your clothes and see now, then look at your face and see
then.''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves and comes back with her black cane. Time to go to
work. Time for small talk in the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was in town yesterday. Lambert remembers
meeting Hillary Clinton. ``I'm from Indiana,'' Lambert says. ``I've
seen every corny Midwestern politician. She took my hand in hers
and said, `I've followed your career.' I knew that wasn't true.
Both of us felt silly.''
</P>
<P>
   She needs no help up the stairs to the sidewalk. She pauses
there for another photo. She waves on a passerby who pauses
politely: ``Don't let him stop you.'' She calls again for her car.
</P>
<P>
   In the car, she worries about not being helpful. She wants to
arrange another interview for her guests. She pulls a cell phone
out of its tiny Chanel bag and hands it to the photographer. ``Do
you know how to use that phone?'' She knows the number by heart.
</P>
<P>
   More small talk. She'll be in Vero Beach at Thanksgiving for one
of her clients. She's supposed to be writing an autobiography in
her spare time. She never learned to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The car stops near Bergdorf Goodman. She has sent her visitors
to meet one of her 20 or so clients. It turns out to be Joan
Helpern, the Joan of Joan &AMP; David shoes. Joan laughs. Ah, Eleanor!
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really able to unite people,'' Helpern says.

Galerie Lelong, which runs through Oct. 16. Ms. Coyne's layered
tableaux are dreamy and mystical, evoking spirituality and
afterlife. None of her work is really planned, though Ms. Coyne
tries to peer into her own mind by changing materials every few
years. ``It's like having the rug pulled out from under me,'' she
says. ``It makes me focus on what I'm trying to say.'' (Sara

 &HT;    Eleanor Lambert's tips on timeless style
 &HT;    Sidebar to FASHION-LAMBERT
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Keep two pairs of shoulder pads handy, one broad and the other
very slight. Shoulders go from natural to medium or wide from
season to season, and a well-fitting tailored suit can be updated
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   _ A good wool jersey day dress, loose enough to be belted but
smart alone, and with pockets, will take you anywhere for years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never discard a comfortable pair of gold or black satin
evening shoes. One or the other will go with anything.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are timeless period styles that come back ``in fashion''
every few years and are worth investing in for important occasions.
A beautiful example is a draped ``Greek goddess'' evening gown or a
Victorian ballgown. A Russian cossack coat, a fur toque, a Chinese
mandarin coat or an antique Spanish shawl are blue-chip acquisition
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is a wise idea to keep a bright red dress in your closet.
You never know when it will be the only right thing to wear.
</P>
<P>
   _ Military styles like the middy dress, trench coat, the anorak,
or anything with epaulettes and brass buttons always look snappy
and timeless.
</P>
<P>
   _ You may not be a ``hat person,'' but you'll always need a
pretty hat or turban occasionally. Nothing is so depressing as a
frantic last-minute scramble for required head covering.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most people today have a drawer full of kid gloves they never
wear, but the day will come. Good gloves, like an alligator
handbag, should never be discarded. That goes for fine leather
belts, Hermes scarves, beaded evening bags and heirloom fur coats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't underestimate the possibilities of a vintage Paris
original by Balenciaga, Hubert de Givenchy, Marc Bohan of Dior,
Yves St. Laurent, Pierre Cardin, etc. They turn up at auctions
often nowadays and often sell much below their original cost.
Anyway, your granddaughter will probably be wearing it a generation
hence.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timeless essentials: one black dinner dress with graceful body
lines; one jazzy cocktail dress, preferably black; and one dinner
suit with long or short skirt or pants. A blouse is optional these
days.

 &HT;    23rd century hospital worth a visit
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bloodied patients suffering from multiple compound fractures.
Harried doctors barking, ``I'm going in!'' Newborns undergoing
life-threatening surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds a lot like ER, doesn't it? Well, that's the point. Mercy
Point, to be exact. If Star Trek: Voyager and ER were ever
combined, the show would look a lot like UPN's promising new
medical drama. Mercy Point (9 p.m. Tuesday) marries all the
gee-whiz sci-fi elements (alien surgeons, for instance) with the
taut drama associated with medical shows (pregnant women battling
for their lives while sweat-drenched hubbies await the outcome).
</P>
<P>
   While the Mercy Point doctors still treat human patients in
cardiac distress (oh, they run into an alien or two, as well), they
do it hi-tech style. Well, it is the 23rd century, after all. That
means head nurses are cyborgs (and not bad looking, either) and
doctors scrub up in seconds by merely putting their hands inside a
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Point is the name of a deep-space hospital where a team of
talented doctors works to save lives and work out all their
personal problems. And, boy do those doctors have personal
problems!
</P>
<P>
   Let's see . . . there's Grote Maxwell (the always reliable Joe
Morton), the hospital's take-charge alien physiologist who hasn't
seen his family in years.
</P>
<P>
   There's Haylen Breslauer (Maria Del Mar), the intense director
of medicine who can't stand Dru (Alexandra Wilson), her half-sister
and the hospital's new intern. Finally, there's Caleb ``C.J.''
Jurado (Brian McNamara), the George Clooney wannabe who lives life
on the edge and messes up his love life a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy Point comes at you with an intense, never-let-up pace. If
subsequent episodes are as slick, stylish and well-acted as the
pilot, we won't mind frequently checking into this futuristic
hospital.

 &HT;    HEY, BABY, WHAT'S YOUR STEAM SETTING?
 &HT;    How ironing determines personality, and other pressing matters
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest wrinkle in do-it-yourself psychology ... oh, never
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say there's a new way to discover yourself, and it
has to do with your iron.
</P>
<P>
   What's an iron? Congratulations. According to a new survey, you
fall into the resisting-responsibility, dependent role. You
slacker.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by the makers of Black &AMP; Decker identifies three
other types of people. Which are you? Try question No. 2 of the
Ironing Personality Indicator (IPI):
</P>
<P>
   I do my best ironig:
</P>
<P>
   a.) On the bed or any other convenient surface that's close by.
</P>
<P>
   b.) At the ironing board where I can really focus and do it
right.
</P>
<P>
   c.) In the shower with the power of natural steam.
</P>
<P>
   d.) None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   If you picked ``a,'' you are always trying to please others.
</P>
<P>
   If ``b,'' you like to be respected and in control.
</P>
<P>
   If ``c,'' you are a trailblazer, charming and unique.
</P>
<P>
   If ``d,'' see paragraph 3. (Slacker.)
</P>
<P>
   The source of this information is New York-based psychologist
Vivien Wolsk, who researches what she calls Emotional Fitness
Training.
</P>
<P>
   Which has something to do with improving self-esteem through
chores. ``I have a good feeling about ironing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her personal emotional workout is a good round of doing dishes _
``getting rid of the dirt in my life'' _ and saying positive things
to herself in the mirror. A mantra, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   And the mantra? ``I can really improve the world around me. I'm
going to make it fit for me.'' Pretty wordy. ``Well, it's `I can
make a difference.'''
</P>
<P>
   The top stress-relieving chores, she says, are ironing,
window-cleaning, doing laundry, scrubbing floors, vacuuming and
scraping paint.
</P>
<P>
   There's something fulfilling about achieving something _ no
matter how small _ compared to pushing away at a meaningless
machine at the gym, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why she'd hand President Clinton a bucket and sponge.
``Scrubbing floors would be good for him,'' Wolsk says, ``getting
down on his hands and knees so he really comes clean.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll stop right there.

 &HT;    Lindbergh: nerves of steel, a heart to match
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it came his time to die, Charles Augustus
Lindbergh made his own arrangements. He picked out the grave on the
island of Maui where he would spend eternity. He supervised the
construction of the coffin. He chose the clothes he would be buried
in. He even specified how the shroud was to be folded.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted no embalming, he told his family. He wanted them to
bury him within hours of his death. His goal was to return to the
earth he loved as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 26, 1974, Charles Lindbergh got what he wanted. He
usually did.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh managed his death in the same exhaustively detailed
way he managed everything, completing one final act of focused
detachment, one final act that demonstrated the love and devotion
he felt for his family but could rarely verbalize. As he lay dying,
Charles Lindbergh gave Anne Morrow Lindbergh and their five
surviving children something to do besides hold down an agonizing
death watch.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing life receives its full due in A. Scott Berg's
Lindbergh (Putnam, $30), by all odds the nonfiction book of the
year. Berg's achievement is that he makes an essentially cold,
self-absorbed man continually interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh was easier to admire than to like. He was the sort of
man who found it impossible to lose himself in a movie _ it wasn't
real _ the sort of man who kept and filed every scrap of paper, the
sort of man who gave his children long lists of duties they were
expected to perform, the sort of man who even tried to control his
unknown biographer by leaving him notes.
</P>
<P>
   Rigid, anal, without anything that might be recognized as a
sense of humor, Lindbergh emerges from the pages of Berg's splendid
book as a joyless, furrowed-brow character out of Lake Wobegon,
Minn. _ earnestness gone berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was emotionally stunted,'' says Berg. ``He grew up alone,
in a cold house with mismatched parents, and he tuned it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   What Charles Lindbergh didn't perceive didn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   This is why he could triumph doing something that other men had
died attempting _ fly across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   He did this by focusing on his version of reality: the bolts,
the struts, the thin fabric that made up The Spirit of St. Louis,
the gas that filled its tanks, the fight to stay awake, the
position of the sun. Dying was not part of his equation _ therefore
it was banished from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh's passage to Le Bourget airport in May 1927 signaled
the arrival of a new order just as surely as the sinking of the
Titanic signaled the death of the old. He had sparked the modern
aviation industry and, however unwillingly, the modern age of
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in an age of instant fame,'' says Scott Berg.
``Lindbergh performed a death-defying deed, he did something no one
had done before. Beyond that, he was the first man to be stalked by
the press _ all the codes of ethics went out the window, both when
he flew to Paris and when his son was kidnapped and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chase that killed Diana started the night Lindbergh landed
in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   He never said `I was wrong'
</P>
<P>
   _ and he never cried
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lindbergh always gave the impression of a plain-spoken
farm boy with a mechanical gift. Actually, he was the son of a
Minnesota congressman, and if he wasn't exactly born with a silver
spoon, he certainly had one of finest pewter. But that was never
good enough for Lindbergh, who was determined to achieve on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1924, the 22-year-old Lindbergh enlisted in the Army
Air Service and graduated first in his class. Bored with flying
mail, he began planning to capture a prize of $25,000 for the first
aviator to fly nonstop between New York and Paris. The odds weren't
good; Lloyd's of London was offering 10 to 1 against.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh didn't care. He took off from Roosevelt Field on Long
Island at 7:54 a.m. on May 20, 1927, and landed in Paris at 10:24
p.m. the next day. More than 150,000 people greeted him. The world
adored him. He was only 25, and, along with Babe Ruth, the
personification of America.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, he married Anne Morrow, the daughter of the American
ambassador to Mexico, Dwight Morrow. Now the American prince had a
princess, and they became the First Couple of Aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh went from strength to strength, proselytizing for air
travel, helping form Pam American airlines. With the birth of the
Lindberghs' son, Charles Jr., in June of 1930, there was an heir.
</P>
<P>
   But less than two years later, on March 1, 1932, the child was
kidnapped from his second-floor nursery in the Lindbergh home in
New Jersey. A few months later, the badly decomposed body was
discovered a few miles from the house. A German carpenter from the
Bronx, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, was arrested, tried and executed
for the crime _ in a media circus every bit as sensational as the
O.J. Simpson trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Bruno Hauptmann's was the trial of the century,''
says Berg. It must have been an appalling process for someone as
deeply shy as Lindbergh, compounding the incomprehensible death of
his child. As always, Lindbergh was impossible to read publicly,
and nearly as opaque privately.
</P>
<P>
   He never cried about the death of his son, his wife's diaries
reveal, not once.
</P>
<P>
   After Hauptmann's execution, Lindbergh and his wife left America
for a time, and it's clear that his alienation fed what would
become a sad infatuation with Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in quest of law and order, peace and quiet, and he saw
those things in Germany, while overlooking the great crimes that
were being committed at the same time,'' Berg says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that he was pro-German; he saw them moving forward as
opposed to England and Russia, who weren't going anywhere. Germany
had been defeated in World War I, but now they were prosperous.
They were building airplanes!''
</P>
<P>
   So, at the end of the tumultuous '30s, Lindbergh came out as an
isolationist, quite a popular stance at the time. Europe's business
was Europe's, Hitler's was Hitler's. What did the business of a
corrupt old order have to do with America?
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh became a stalwart member of the group known as America
First _ among the other members were Sargent Shriver and Gerald
Ford _ and made a series of appearances that culminated in the
disastrous speech he gave in Des Moines in July of 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, scanning the words, you can only shake your head at
sentiments echoed today only in the tracts of white supremacists:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tolerance is a virtue that depends upon peace and strength.
History shows that it cannot survive war and devastation. A few
far-sighted Jewish people realize this, and stand opposed to
intervention. But the majority still do not. Their greatest danger
to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our
motion picture, our press, our radio and our government.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh went on to say that the English and the Jews, ``for
reasons which are understandable from their viewpoint as they are
inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American,'' were
pushing America into war.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Roosevelt took Lindbergh's speeches personally, and he
seems to have been one of the few people the president actively
disliked (Joe Kennedy was another, for more or less the same
reasons).
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt believed Lindbergh was genuinely dangerous, and he was
probably right. Had Lindbergh begun his efforts a few years
earlier, it might have been that much harder for Roosevelt to get
anywhere at all with an already isolationist Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After Pearl Harbor, Lindbergh tried to get into the Air Corps,
but Roosevelt personally put out the word that Lindbergh was not to
be allowed to serve his country.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually became a test pilot in private industry, and, late
in the war, slid into the Marines through the back door and flew
more than 25 combat bombing missions as a civilian. Aside from his
indomitable will and stamina _ before the 33 hours it took to fly
to Paris, he had been up for 23 hours getting ready _ he was a
truly superb pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of Lindbergh's alliance with, at best,
wrong-headed fools and, at worst, fascists, were catastrophic. He
never really recovered his public standing, despite a series of
excellent books _ he was a painstaking writer who never needed a
ghost _ including The Spirit of St. Louis, which won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never recanted his association with America First,
or the remarks about Jews, he carefully excised various comments
about Jews from his diaries when they were published in the early
'70s. Berg prints them. While not rabidly anti-Semitic, they
clearly show that Lindbergh regarded Jews as the seasoning in
society's stew _ lightly sprinkled, fine, but too many spoiled
everything. Cumulatively, Lindbergh's public and private remarks
demonstrate the genteel but debilitating anti-Semitism that was
pervasive in all aspects of American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindbergh had no sense of politics,'' says Berg. ``He didn't
think through repercussions. He said what he thought and it cost
him his popularity. `I told the truth,' he told his wife. `Why
didn't they listen to the whole speech? Don't the Jews realize
they'll just bring more trouble on themselves?'''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``I was wrong,'' never passed Charles Lindbergh's
lips, about America First or anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says Berg, ``you have people hanging on your every
word every day of your life after you're 25 years old. It can
promote an unhealthy certitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Anne: Shyness in common
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally, Lindbergh was a Victorian, a 19th-century man; his
wife was an archetypal 20th-century woman, with all of the
conflicts, needs and surging emotions of a woman who wants to be
more than a wife and mother.
</P>
<P>
   One on one, his will was the stronger, and she was forced to
adopt a submissive role. Yet, at the same time, he continually
pushed her toward her own destiny, her writing, which culminated in
lovely books, most prominently Gift From the Sea.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '50s, the marriage wound down to the status of
name-only, and they went their own ways _ Lindbergh on his
incessant travels in pursuit of his autodidact's education in
anthropology and conservation, Anne to her writing and a serious
affair with her internist.
</P>
<P>
   Given their vast differences, what kept the marriage going as
long as it did?
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnetism was powerful,'' says Berg. ``They were two
genuinely shy people, and they stuck together. Each of them
worshiped the other. He was drawn to her poetic nature because it
was something he completely lacked, and she was drawn to his
outdoorsiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her prose, of course, is wonderful, and her writing began with
their flying trips. He gave her life experience; he got her out of
the room. If it hadn't been for Lindbergh, she would have been
Emily Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I think they had a hot, sexual marriage. And
after a point, when he just didn't want to be around anymore, I
think she seriously considered leaving him, but there was a
problem: she always loved him. She made a vow, and she stuck to her
ows. And Anne had a hair-shirt attitude, I think; she got off on a
little pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh could always justify his frantic aversion toward
staying in one place by saying he was running toward something, not
away from anything, but Berg believes he actually spent his life in
flight from emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as the family got domestic or touchy-feely, he was out
the door. And yet, when all was said and done, those kids had two
loving parents _ it was a safe, stable home, with a great gene
pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg doesn't pretend to a bogus omniscience; although it's
almost certain that Hauptmann must have had accomplices in the
kidnapping of Charles Jr., for instance, Berg says simply that
we'll almost certainly never know who they were.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh was, as might be expected, a tough father, full of
very high expectations. There's a quietly horrifying vignette in
the book, when Lindbergh begins idly tossing a pillow at one of his
children who's just started walking. The pillow knocks the child
down. He gets up. Over and over, Lindbergh tosses the pillow at his
child, knocking him down each time. Assertiveness training or a
touch of sadism?
</P>
<P>
   Debate was never in the equation, and, when Scott, the youngest
of Lindbergh's sons _ counting Charles Jr., there were six children
in all _ defied him, they didn't speak for four years. It goes
without saying that Scott was the child most like his father.
</P>
<P>
   People who are uncomfortable with human beings often gravitate
to animals, so it is not surprising that the most emotional entry
in Lindbergh's decades of diaries concerns the death of the massive
German shepherd Thor that Lindbergh bought for protection after the
death of his child. The dog adored Anne above all others, and gave
her the protective, enveloping attention her husband never could.
</P>
<P>
   As told by Scott Berg, the story of Charles Lindbergh's life and
death is a moral tale about the the rewards and perils of being
completely focused on the external world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindbergh had a thing about balance,'' says his biographer.
``He believed that one should live a balanced life. And the
adulation he received was so extreme that I think part of him
figured that there had to be an equal and opposite reaction. There
was a price to be paid for everything he had, and he certainly paid
it.''

 &HT;    Back-seat TVs - and air bags everywhere
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tired of trying to watch the kids and the road at the same time?
Let them watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile's Silhouette Premiere minivan (about $31,000) offers
a 5.6-inch color monitor that flips down from the ceiling, facing
the rear seats. Unless you have a really long cable, you won't get
Sesame Street, but it has a video cassette player and hookups for
Nintendo and other games. Mom and Dad get their own radio/tape/CD
earphone jacks as sanity protection.
</P>
<P>
   Similar systems have been available as add-ons from electronic
stores, but this is the first one installed at the factory and
covered by the vehicle warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Boring as it may be, most other new-car gadgets and gimmicks
actually have to do with driving. Or crashing.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you're getting used to the idea of an air bag
exploding in your face, here come more of them aimed at your sides,
feet and head.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the premium price range, manufacturers like
Mercedes-Benz and BMW are touting new places, sizes and shapes for
inflatable restraints. Volvo also adds a ``whiplash protection
system'' that automatically reclines the seat-back to reduce strain
in a rear-end collision.
</P>
<P>
   Rather avoid collisions altogether?
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury Mountaineer and Ford Explorer SUVs and Ford's
restyled Windstar van offer a sonar-activated Reverse Sensing
System that beeps when the driver's within 6 feet of backing into
something (or someone). The beeps become faster, and then
continuous, as a collision gets closer. BMW's top models have a
similar Park Distance Control that warns of obstacles in either
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz, of course, wouldn't be rude enough to remind
drivers to slow down when the car could just do it for them. The
cruise control on the company's new full-size, S-class sedans
automatically keeps a safe distance from the car ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Need some help making your way around town? A computerized
navigation system is the only option on the Acura 3.2TL.
</P>
<P>
   If you can wait another year, Cadillac promises a treat on
several 2000 models for old-fashioned types who want enough
information to make their own decisions: infrared night vision.
</P>
<P>
   A glowing black-and-white image like the ones in those Desert
Storm videos will appear at the bottom of the windshield, allowing
drivers to see five times farther ahead than with headlights alone.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who want to just lean back and get comfortable,
the Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition offer power-adjustable
pedals. An electric control slides the brake and gas up to 3 inches
closer, so the driver can sit farther from the wheel.

SCHUMER SAYS CLINTON'S ACTIONS DO NOT WARRANT IMPEACHMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his first detailed remarks on the Monica
Lewinsky matter, Rep. Charles Schumer said Monday that President
Clinton's lies about his extra-marital affair were wrong and
possibly illegal but did not warrant impeachment. He called instead
for some lesser form of punishment, perhaps censure or a rebuke.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a Democrat from New York who is running for U.S.
Senate, also questioned the impartiality of Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, accusing him of having ``seriously
overreached'' in his investigation and of presenting ``flimsy
evidence'' in his voluminous report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time we move forward, and not have the Congress and the
American people endure a specter of what could be a year-long focus
on a tawdry but not impeachable affair,'' said Schumer, offering
one of the more ringing defenses of the Clinton presidency among
members of the House Judiciary Committee Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As Schumer made his comments Monday, his campaign was preparing
a major fund-raising event featuring the president in New York City
next Monday, providing further evidence that even when wounded,
Clinton remains a popular and potent political force in New York
State. The full House is scheduled to vote on whether to begin an
impeachment inquiry of the president this Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from a prepared statement, Schumer warned the committee
Monday that important issues ranging from education to health care
had been shunted aside by the powerful wake of the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world economy is in crisis and cries out for American
leadership without which worldwide turmoil is a grave
possibility,'' Schumer said. ``This investigation, now in its fifth
year, has run it's course. It's time to move on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schumer, who is known for having once theatrically waved an
assault weapon at a Judiciary Committee hearing but whose
attendance this year has been severely truncated by the rigors of
his campaign, left soon after making his statement to meet with
reporters, even as other committee members remained to listen to
their colleagues' statements.
</P>
<P>
   The president's problems have hung like a dark cloud over the
New York Senate race all year, leaving strategists for both Schumer
and the Republican incumbent, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, unsure of
who was threatened more by the storm. As a result, neither man has
said much to defend or criticize the president until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The president's problems most clearly posed a dilemma for
Schumer, who has been a strong supporter of Clinton and whose
evident desire to recruit the president's help on his campaign may
have been hamstrung by his seat on the Judiciary Committee
overseeing the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schumer said Monday that his decision to oppose
impeachment unequivocally had in a way liberated him. ``I made up
my mind yesterday and I slept like a baby last night,'' he said to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he felt that the average person would receive no
punishment for telling lies about an extra-marital affair, even
under oath. But because presidents ``should be held to a higher
standard,'' he said Clinton should receive a ``significant
punishment'' short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters Monday if there was not a conflict of
interest in his sitting in judgment on a president who was giving
him campaign assistance, Schumer emphatically said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think New Yorkers are fair and they are going to judge what
I said based on the merits,'' he said. ``We'll have to let the
chips fall where they may politically.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer's advisers clearly believe that the chips will fall
in their favor. They contend that D'Amato will now feel pressure
either to defend the president, which could anger D'Amato's
conservative base, or to defend the Republican leadership pushing
for impeachment, which could infuriate swing voters who still like
Clinton, or at least his policies.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato displayed some concern about the issue in remarks to
reporters Monday following a Manhattan campaign event where he
received an award for helping direct federal mass transit funds to
the New York metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would try to make impeachment a campaign issue,
D'Amato said no, and instead accused an unnamed adviser to Schumer
of encouraging reporters to write about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has this guy who does it continually, puts out these
nonsense rumors and things,'' D'Amato said. ``We haven't done it
and I don't intend to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter who this adviser was, D'Amato replied, ``If
you don't know, then he hasn't approached you.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-term Republican also said that he was ``not going to
be critical'' of Schumer's remarks on impeachment, adding that he
would not offer his own opinion because he may be required to vote
on whether to remove or punish the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to the Senate, then I'll act in a manner in
which the facts and times dictate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato also continued his attack on Schumer's spotty attendance
record this year, releasing a new radio ad that charges that
Schumer has missed more votes, 110, in the past 12 months than
D'Amato has missed in the past 12 years. The Senate votes much less
often than the House.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has accused D'Amato of distorting his record, noting
that his attendance for votes during 18 years is more than 90
percent.

 &HT;    Are you ready for a TV in the back seat?
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warning: Reading beyond this point could be expensive.
</P>
<P>
   You know what happens when you read about new cars: You want to
go look at them. And you know what happens then.
</P>
<P>
   No spinning watch holds the hypnotic power of deep-gloss paint
magnified by a showroom window. Are you prepared to surrender the
next 48 months of your life?
</P>
<P>
   Don't be so quick to answer. You've risked reading this far, so
you might as well take in all of what Accent's automotive spy corps
has uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Some '99s have been cruising around for months: You've probably
seen the Mazda Miata and Mercury Cougar, at least in commercials.
You'll start seeing the rest soon.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar feature: the price. Not many are going up, and
lots of models will actually cost less than last year or get
additional equipment at no charge. Interest rates are lower than
they were last fall, too.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Child, news editor of the trade journal Automotive News,
summarizes the theme for '99 as ``a return to comfort'' and he
credits the demands of aging Baby Boomers who dominate the market.
It's because of them that you'll see more:
</P>
<P>
   Luxo-trucks: Ford needed little more than a few yards of leather
to turn its brawny Expedition into the Lincoln Navigator, one of
last year's biggest hits. Look for more posh and pricey
permutations of popular SUVs and minivanscq, including the new
Cadillac Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   Luxo-cars: There's a crowd gathering on both sides of the
$30,000 entry mark, with new models from BMW, Acura, Volvo and
others. Cadillac jumped in last year with the Catera. Lincoln's LS
is due later in 1999, probably as a 2000 model.
</P>
<P>
   Power: Many models will get more, even in the face of mileage
and environmental demands.
</P>
<P>
   Pizzaz: Hard to quantify, but you know it's important when even
Volvo is trying to look stylish. The very eye-catching Mercury
Cougar will be a clue to future Ford styling, if it's a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the cars that show off these trends:
</P>
<P>
   Volvo C70: Those sensible Swedes go wild with a swoopy,
four-seat convertible. A turbo-charged 5-cylinder engine is
standard. Vroom with a view, for about $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep Grand Cherokee: The second best-selling SUV (after the Ford
Explorer) is completely restyled to look instantly familiar. Best
new feature: The spare tire's under the load floor so it doesn't
crowd cargo space. And the price is down $250. From $26,220.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac Escalade: The first Cadillac truck for people who can
still sit up is a thinly disguised GMC Denali, which is a thinly
disguised Chevrolet Tahoe sport utility vehicle. All the
road-hugging weight of a '60s DeVille but less road-hogging length.
The name means to climb with a ladder. About $47,000.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo S80: A big, front-drive replacement for the S90 comes
loaded with luxury equipment and, surprise, new safety features.
And it looks, um, different. From about $36,400.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra: You don't care about pickup
trucks? You're outnumbered. The No. 2-selling vehicles in the land
get more power, better mileage and a more carlike ride. From about
$14,000 for a basic work truck; more like $20,000-plus for a
suitable sedan substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler 300M: Trying to do with a name what Volkswagen did with
a body, Chrysler borrows an image from the 1950s, when its 300s
were big and fast. This one's actually a bit shorter than other
full-size Chryslers, but it's still quick. About $28,500.
</P>
<P>
   BMW 3-series: The favorite car of yuppies and Boca high
schoolers gets new four-door versions with more interior room and
optional rear-seat, side-impact airbags. About $27,000 for the
323i; $34,000 for the more powerful 328i.
</P>
<P>
   Acura 3.2TL: New style, more power and a much lower price. A
direct competitor to the BMW 3-series, it comes only one way:
loaded. The only option: a computerized navigation system. And it's
about $4,000 less than last year. About $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz CLK320: Can a Mercedes be a bargain? The company's
last four-seat convertible cost about $80,000. This one's a few
inches smaller, but otherwise comparable in performance and it
comes loaded with equipment for about $30,000 less. Yes, a bargain,
at $47,200.

   Pontiac Grand Am/Oldsmobile Alero: Variations on GM's midsize
theme, both promise tighter construction and more Euro feel. The
Alero is quite understated; the Grand Am GT is for people who like
the attention you'd get wearing a zoot suit. From about $17,000.

<P>
   Toyota Camry Solara: America's best-selling but possibly dullest
car gets a designer makeover and comes out looking rich. Two doors
only, but either four or six cylinders. From just under $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Mustang: The Boomers have turned their aching backs on the
pony cars that were created for them, and many expect the Camaro
and Firebird to be gone by year's end. But Ford's trying to
reignite the Mustang fire with sleeker styling and, of course, more
horsepower. From under $17,000.

 &HT;    UPN still looking for an identity _ and an audience
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a story, of three lovely networks. OK, enough of that.
Let's pretend that Fox, the WB and UPN are The Brady Bunch girls.
Since the surging Fox is the most popular of the three, it would be
Marcia. The upstart, buzz-heavy WB is young and budding with rosy
potential. That makes it Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   UPN?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I guess that leaves poor 'ol Jan. You know, the least
popular Brady girl. She's not the prettiest, nor the youngest.
In-the-middle Jan is just the one with the serious identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, that describes UPN, which rolls out its new fall shows on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When you think of the other five networks, immediate images
flash through your mind. CBS _ old. Fox _ edgy. NBC _ white,
upscale New York. WB _ hip teens. ABC _ blue-collar.
</P>
<P>
   But viewers don't really know what UPN is. All they know _ and
really care about _ is UPN airs Star Trek: Voyager and Moesha. Even
the network admits it's scrambling to cement its identity. As Tom
Nunan, UPN's entertainment president, glumly acknowledges, ``We're
struggling to find our own audience.''
</P>
<P>
   That search begins in earnest on Monday. But what does the new
schedule say about UPN? It's hard to tell, since the network
appears to be appealing to every known demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, there's a comedy about two single guys (one white,
one black) raising a precocious 6-year-old. There's a post-Civil
War, Dynasty-like soap, a sitcom about a harried transit cop, a
futuristic, ER-like drama, an action-packed adventure about time
travel and a controversial sitcom about President Lincoln's black
butler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying for an umbrella strategy,'' says Dean Valentine,
UPN's CEO and president.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: We're trying to please everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A noble ambition, yes. Possible? Not likely. But Valentine, the
former president of Walt Disney Television and Walt Disney
Television Animation, is a man with a vision unique in Hollywood.
Unlike the other networks, Valentine doesn't believe in
narrow-casting. He doesn't think it's wise for networks to target
most of their shows to a particular audience. (Can you say,
``NBC?'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any broadcast network that adopts a narrow-cast model
is ultimately doomed to failure,'' argues Valentine. ``I believe
there has to be something that brings America together.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a serious about-face from the network's ill-fated
strategy two years ago. Like Fox, UPN thought it would become the
home for black-themed shows. In September 1996, only 20 months
after its launch, UPN had Good Behavior, Sparks, Homeboys in Outer
Space, The Jamie Foxx Show and Malcolm &AMP; Eddie on its schedule.
Only Malcolm &AMP; Eddie and The Jamie Foxx Show remain.
</P>
<P>
   While Fox was able to establish itself as a serious network with
such black-oriented shows as Martin, Living Single and In Living
Color, UPN was not. When Valentine took over, one of the first
things he did was dump the shows that didn't fit his vision.
</P>
<P>
   But what UPN needs more than anything is a buzz show. It needs a
show everyone is talking about. It needs a Felicity. A Dawson's
Creek. Something. The only UPN show people are talking about is the
absurd The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer. And that's only
because it offended many black groups for poking fun at slavery.
Even hard-core Lincoln fans are complaining. That's not the kind of
attention a hit-starved network needs.
</P>
<P>
   UPN suits like making fun of their WB competitors (and its green
mascot), but that network has found a gold-mine niche and has
exploited it well. Teen girls are playing a more powerful role in
what we see _ and don't see _ on TV. Thank such WB hits as Buffy
the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek for that current trend.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for UPN, it will be forever linked with the WB
like Coke is to Pepsi, Batman to Robin and Lucy to Ricky. Both
started in 1995 and have been battling to become the undisputed
fifth network. But if this battle was a prize fight, it would've
been stopped by now. UPN is badly beaten, bloodied and on the
ropes. Not only did the WB post a higher Nielsen household rating
than UPN last season (3.1 versus 2.8), the network is more
desirable to all-important Madison Avenue execs looking to hawk
their products.
</P>
<P>
   And the perception, which is oh-so-important in Tinseltown, is
that the WB is the cool, up-and-coming network. And that perception
existed before the WB started beating UPN in household ratings.
</P>
<P>
   So, what about UPN's new shows? The network actually has several
decent offerings. 7 Days, about a buff, time-traveling hero
(Jonathan LaPaglia), looks promising. Mercy Point, a sci-fi medical
drama, could possibly be the network's next Voyager. (Tip to UPN:
Plug that show heavily, since Voyager's on the down-slide.) Legacy,
that good-looking Civil War soap, may also catch on, and if UPN is
lucky, might become its Dawson's Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an interesting sort of checkerboard schedule,'' Nunan
says. ``It's not just she-TV one night. It isn't monochromatic.
It's Technicolor. That's a way for us to change our identity and to
get people looking at UPN differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But until something clicks, I'll still think of
identity-challenged Jan when I watch identity-challenged UPN.

 &HT;    Why do these rooms cost $20 or less?
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two skiers were complaining about the high price of lift tickets
as we stood in line on the side of a mountain in the exclusive ski
town of Breckenridge, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   But I really didn't care how much the lift tickets were because
I had already saved the real money.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't staying in a $250-a-night condo.
</P>
<P>
   I was paying $15 a night at a youth hostel. And that included
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and I were bunking in clean, warm rooms with modern
shared baths. The lobby had a huge stone fireplace where we stayed
up late talking to other guests _ most of whom were not youths. All
were gregarious and most were serious skiers, including several
European pros.
</P>
<P>
   I've stayed in hostels all over the world, including one on a
historic clipper ship docked in Stockholm, Sweden; a farmhouse in
Australia; and a mountain lodge in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   And they all had cost less than $20 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The hostel experience is far removed, and in my estimation, far
superior to the Marriott experience.
</P>
<P>
   While you won't get room service and SpectraVision at a hostel,
you probably will be staying in an excellent location with a
helpful staff and a friendly assortment of fellow travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Youth'' is a misnomer. Seniors have discovered hostels _ 13
percent of members are 55 or older.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of guests are college-educated or students, who are
sophisticated and curious travelers. Authors and travel experts
Arthur Frommer and Rick Steves frequently stay in hostels.
</P>
<P>
   At Hostelling International New York, a large hostel on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, Darren Leiper, a 21-year-old
university student from Edinburgh, Scotland, was ending a tour of
the United States after staying at hostels across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cheaper than at the hotels, $24 for one night (in New
York),'' he said. ``People are sociable, everybody's traveling. You
find out about things to do, what to see.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite hostel? ``No doubt, the one in Flagstaff (Arizona)
near the Grand Canyon. That was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Tara Wheeler, 30, who owns a spinning and weaving shop in
Taylor, Texas, was staying at the Abominable Snowman Mansion hostel
in Taos, N.M., last week during a business conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inexpensive, very friendly, very homey, and a lot more
interesting than staying in a hotel,'' she said. ``Upstairs there
are a group here for mountain biking, and I met a gentleman who's
an expert in natural dyes for wool, which is what I'm interested
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate was $16 a night. ``There's a dormitory room, a women's
wing and men's wing, and communal shower. It's really nice,'' she
said. ``You can't beat it during ski season.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe especially, hostels are traditionally a place to share
information _ to find out the most scenic Swiss trains, the bank
that has the best exchange rate, where to buy French Foreign Legion
jackets, etc. _ and, of course, to get recommendations about other
hostels.
</P>
<P>
   The hostels in the nonprofit Hostelling International-American
Youth Hostels, the largest hostel organization, include a
lighthouse on the California coast, a castle in Germany, a former
one-room schoolhouse in the Australian bush, and lodges in Redwood
National Park and Cape Cod National Seashore.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1934, the organization has a network of 5,000 hostels
with 33 million overnight visits each year in more than 70
countries. Franklin D. Roosevelt was honorary president and a big
supporter of the organization in its early days.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how historic or modern the building, or whether
it's on the Left Bank in Paris or on a ski slope in Aspen, they
cost only $8 to $20 per person per night. (In New York City and at
some ski resorts, the rate can go up to $27.)
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, guests were mainly university students and
teachers, but today they're attracting families and groups. Most
hostels have family rooms with private baths (these cost more than
$20) and meeting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Hostels are popular with Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, university
groups and church groups, which all receive free memberships.
</P>
<P>
   The safety and service levels are high _ all hostels in the
organization are inspected annually, and guests are asked to fill
out comment cards, which are reviewed at the organization's
headquarters in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Guests, especially in urban areas such as New York and
Washington, must show membership cards or receipts to be admitted
in the buildings. They also restrict guests to travelers who live
at least 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Youth hostels have come a long way since the turn of the century
when Richard Schirrmann, a schoolteacher in a German coal mining
town, became concerned about his students' health and started
taking them into the countryside on weekend field trips for fresh
air and nature study.
</P>
<P>
   Schirrmann used schools, empty on weekends, for overnight
lodging. The first hostel opened in a castle in Altena, Germany, in
1909. Soon, a network of ``youth hostels'' grew rapidly in Germany
with more than 2,000 hostels recording more than 4.5 million
overnight stays each year by 1932.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Europe quickly followed and added other hostels to
the network. In 1932, the first international meeting was held in
Amsterdam and the International Youth Hostel Federation was formed.
</P>
<P>
   American teachers Isabel and Monroe Smith attended the 1933
conference and opened the first youth hostel a year later in
Northfield, Mass., which inspired other hostels throughout New
England.
</P>
<P>
   The network expanded to Asia, Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
   This European idea is still more popular in Europe than in the
U.S. More than three-fourths of new American members join before
taking a trip to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But as Frommer and Steves know, hostels can save lots of money
in the U.S., too.

 &HT;    Peace, love and palmetto bugs
 &HT;    By Cara Anna

<P>
   BRUNSWICK, Ga. _ Beep!
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, it's me. In case you never hear from me again, I am
calling from a place called The Hostel in the Forest in Brunswick,
Ga. I'm a little nervous about staying here overnight. This guy
from Germany gave me a tour of the place _ he's a little
scary-looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the closest thing to a commune I've ever seen. You sleep
in rooms on stilts in the forest, and they have composting toilets,
and they have this 10-foot-deep rainwater pool that is green as an
emerald, with ducks swimming arou ... ''
</P>
<P>
   beep!
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey! Swimming around. So the guy pointed out a bottle of
alcohol to rub in your ears to prevent ear infections. I don't
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``And there're bugs in the rooms. I asked what kind and he said
he didn't know the name but he held his fingers more than an inch
apart. Cockroaches? No. Palmetto bugs? `That's it. They can fly,'
he said. This place is about a half-mile off the road, over this
sandy, bumpy trail through the woods. You are away from absolutely
everything. It's only $12 a night, though, with dinner included. I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   beep!
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom. OK, they have regular toilets, but they put this guilt
trip on you with this sign that says `Toilet of Shame' and inside
the door is this diagram that shows how the `human nutrient cycle'
is broken when you don't use composting toilets. But the showers
are clean and have warm water after a few minutes. I'm going to
stay.''
</P>
<P>
   beep!
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, where are you? It's after midnight! I just wanted to tell
you about this place. It's wild! Every Friday night the hostel
people get together in the VW bus _ of course _ and drive down the
road a mile or two to this place called the Honeydripper. It's a
real juke joint, as the hostel manager, an Australian, called it.
It's this old wooden building just off the road with a Bud sign
blinking in the window. And inside, there are old Schlitz posters
on the walls _ a 1981 calendar! And one old booth and stools by the
wooden counter and a woman named Essie Mae tending ... ''
</P>
<P>
   beep!
</P>
<P>
   ``TENDING BAR _ I hate this machine _ with a big old TV beside
her with the sound off. All the hostel people were drinking big
bottles of Miller High Life at little dinky tables or shooting
pool. There were about six other people there. And there was a
jukebox. We kept playing Strokin', I think it's called, for this
elderly woman named Miss Louise that the hostel people pick up
every week and bring here. She loves that song. There were bare
light bulbs. There's this tiny sign way up on one of the wooden
posts that says `No Loitering' _ that was neat. Great time _ it
really beat staying in a hotel with the stupid TV. Love you!''
</P>
<P>
   beep!
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you're sleeping in? Hey, it's me. Boy, what a night. The
light and fan in my room on stilts didn't work, so I lit two
candles and looked all around at the palmetto bugs. Yuck. But it
rained during the night, and that was cozy. A great view in the
morning from the windows. I hung out a little before leaving and
read some of the guest sign-in books. Lots of praise and bad
poetry, you know. The best thing was a history of the hostel,
written ...''
</P>
<P>
   beep!
</P>
<P>
   ``Written by the guy who built it. A local hippie lawyer with
lots of travel experience started this in 1975 on 90 acres. It was
the first official hostel in the Southeast! People were suspicious
and said it was a hippie hotel, so this lawyer, Tom Dennard, had to
run around and explain it to the local business people. Oh, and the
bad road is deliberate, meant to slow you and your thoughts down.
It does something to you _ here I am eating a pancake that someone
made, just rolled it up and am eating it like a hot dog, no syrup.
I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   beep!
</P>
<P>
   The Hostel in the Forest is on U.S. 82 west of Brunswick, Ga.

 &HT;    Not all hostels are created equal; ask right questions before
you go
 &HT;    By By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hostels are cheap, usually less than $20 a night, and for that
you have to put up with a little something.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Augustine, for example, there's just one bathroom. That
means one toilet, one shower. Bring your own soap.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah's hostel could be cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   And the Key West hostel sleeps eight to 10 people in a room in
bunk beds. That's normal.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and coastal Georgia have several hostels within a day's
drive _ Clearwater Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Daytona Beach and
Florida City, for starters. Each requires a little research.
</P>
<P>
   Are hostels noisy? Do they have storage space for valuables? Are
there curfews? Each place is different. Call _ they've heard the
questions before.
</P>
<P>
   Here is our tip sheet on four places within a half-day's drive.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah
</P>
<P>
   Location: On the edge of the historic district. A supermarket is
on the next block, and everything is within walking distance (if
you don't mind walking a mile or two).
</P>
<P>
   Price: $15 (As with other hostels, you may have to pay a linen
deposit of around $2.)
</P>
<P>
   Reservations: Not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (912) 236-7744
</P>
<P>
   Ambience: Nice. The owner often hangs out in the living room
upstairs and chats. If you like his dog, he might let you walk it.
If you're really energetic, you can help with renovations on the
Victorian house.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The owner closes for a couple of months each year to do
his own traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando/Kissimmee
</P>
<P>
   Location: Five miles from Disney World, in a converted motel. A
convenience store/pharmacy is across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $19 (A $5 key deposit _ refundable _ is required.)
</P>
<P>
   Reservations: Recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (407) 396-8282
</P>
<P>
   Ambiance: Stocked. A pool and a lake with paddleboats out back,
along with a volleyball area and barbecue. Kitchen, laundry, TV
room and padlock rentals for storage. The bottom rack in the fridge
is marked ``free food'' (if you don't label your stuff, everyone
gets it). A shuttle to the nearby attractions is available at $7.75
per round trip.
</P>
<P>
   St. Augustine
</P>
<P>
   Location: In the middle of the (extremely touristy) historic
district. Everything but the beach is within walking distance. Not
a lot of night life outside the bars and the $3 movie.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $12
</P>
<P>
   Reservations: Not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (904) 808-1999
</P>
<P>
   Ambiance: Clean. Homey kitchen, sunbathing area on the roof. No
TV. They rent bikes and surfboards.
</P>
<P>
   Key West
</P>
<P>
   Location: Within spitting distance of the southernmost point (if
you can spit about 100 yards). Old Town is within walking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Price: $17 for members, $20 for non-members
</P>
<P>
   Reservations: Recommended from December through March.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (305) 296-5719.
</P>
<P>
   Ambiance: Busy. Picnic tables in the courtyard for socializing.
Dinner for $2. They also rent bikes and arrange snorkeling and
diving trips.

 &HT;    Whatever happened to Tin Pan Alley?
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Irving Berlin was in his 90s, he could still
find his way to Tin Pan Alley, or at least what remained of it.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking a cigar, he would walk into Colony Music on the first
floor of the Brill Building on Broadway and 49th Street and ask the
same question each time: ``How is Easter Parade selling?''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Turk, one of the music store's owners, would assure him
it was selling well. ``And he would say `Still selling White
Christmas?''' Turk recalls. ``And I would say `White Christmas will
always sell.'''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin died in 1989 at the age of 101, but Tin Pan Alley lives
on, in the music it produced if not in actuality.
</P>
<P>
   The new play The Tin Pan Alley Rag opens Tuesday (Oct. 6) at the
Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami, and the Tony-winning Ragtime is a
Broadway hit. Happy Birthday, George Gershwin, a tribute to the Tin
Pan Alley composer on the 100th anniversary of his birth, was
presented at Carnegie Hall and shown on PBS Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Pan Alley was not an alley or a street but a district near
the corner of Broadway and 14th Street, where new music publishers,
mostly Jewish and most of Eastern European descent, set up shop in
the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   A steady parade of composers followed.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Pan Alley was the MTV of its day, its publishers
aggressively promoting new songs. The name probably came from the
tinny sound of the pianos played by ``song pluggers,'' who played
new songs on the streets, in theaters, music shops and even the big
department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Pan Alley hits ranged from Charles K. Harris' After the
Ball, which sold nearly 5 million copies in 1892, to George M.
Cohan's Give My Regards to Broadway in 1904 to Duke Ellington's Do
Nothin' Till You Hear from Me in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bold and creative marketing of Tin Pan Alley, music
publishers in cities such as Boston and Philadelphia did not
heavily promote songwriters of the day. Stephen Foster, George Root
and Will Hays survived by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1880s, the new group of publishers promoted new
songwriters in newspapers and magazines; paid famous singers to
sing the songs, and staged musicals in theaters and the vaudeville
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   The songs were sold as sheet music until the 1920s, when the
music industry began producing recordings and promoting them on
radio. The 1930s brought movie musicals and even bigger business.
</P>
<P>
   After the turn of the century, the publishers moved uptown to
West 42nd Street, and from 1911-19, they congregated in the
vicinity of the Exchange Building at 145 West 45th St. During the
1920s, they moved to an area near 49th Street.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1930s to 1950s, the music industry was centered around
and in the Brill Building, erected in 1931 at 1619 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Pan Alley died when rock music was born, and music promoters
went elsewhere. The music publishers in the Brill Building have
been replaced by public relations firms and editing companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Tin Pan Alley's best stars, a generation of brilliant young
composers including Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers,
Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II, live on in new plays and
movies based on their music.
</P>
<P>
   Music lovers from around the world still stop by the Brill
Building and Colony Music to talk about Tin Pan Alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come from Japan, Germany, from all over, and I'm always
surprised by how knowledgeable they are,'' Turk says.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers when the Colony, celebrating its 50th anniversary,
was open all night and had a piano in the corner. Ella Fitzgerald,
Frank Sinatra and Jerry Lewis would stop in to play the piano and
sing.
</P>
<P>
   The Colony still does a brisk business in sheet music. And this
is, indeed, the place to buy Easter Parade.

 &HT;    What does heaven look like
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heaven is a safe place.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven is fun, full of color, filled with angels, a good place
to visit and the house of God.
</P>
<P>
   That's what some kids at St. Ann Roman Catholic School in West
Palm Beach think about heaven. Last week, they drew pictures of
what heaven looks like to them. Some of them have a more mature
faith than many adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven is not a place,'' said Amanda White, an eighth-grade
student from Palm Beach Gardens. ``Heaven is an image that helps us
fulfill our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Visions of heaven give us hope, remind us of the goodness of God
and help us come to terms with what happens when we die.
</P>
<P>
   We want there to be a place for us where life is full and rich,
love rules, laughter reigns and peace abounds for all. Most of us
call that heaven.
</P>
<P>
   What Dreams May Come is a just-released romantic fantasy
starring Robin Williams that takes place in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise for Williams is an oasis of stunning beauty that
mirrors scenes in his mortal life. The landscapes, fields and
flowers he once loved he finds larger than life in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollywood presents only the latest version of what heaven
might be. Artists, theologians and laity have speculated about the
place of eternal life throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   The mind's eye draws pictures rooted in religious belief. But
they are formed by human experience and shaped by our fondest
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise is a place of bliss and sensual pleasure in some
religious traditions. Muslims think of fresh figs, rivers of honey
and streams of clean, sparkling water.
</P>
<P>
   A popular image of heaven for many Floridians is endless perfect
rounds on a championship golf course.
</P>
<P>
   For others, heaven is the place of quintessential spiritual
growth and the eternal worship of God.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise _ the garden of Eden _ is a huge study hall, a place of
learning, in Judaism. People are about 30 years old, there is no
decay and nearly everyone, Jew and Gentile alike, gets in.
</P>
<P>
   Most traditions insist that, whatever it looks like, heaven
means the place where God is present. And the experience of
paradise is spiritual union with that God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know anything about heaven except that heaven is
where God is,'' said the Rev. Christopher Kelly, pastor of St.
Christopher's Episcopal Church in West Palm Beach. ``Heaven is not
a geographic place at all. It is a state of being. It is union with
God. Wherever God is, that's where heaven is.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like Robin Williams, we often visualize the eternal,
spiritual bliss of heaven using temporal, secular images.
</P>
<P>
   The Elysian field of Roman and Greek mythology was an idyllic
home for departed heroes and the blessed dead. The perfect climate
was assured by the breezes of Zephyrus.
</P>
<P>
   The Bible and the Koran draw rich and concrete illustrations of
paradise. Walls studded with sapphire and emerald, streets of gold
and the delight of the senses are used to create word pictures of
the heavenly city of God.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the faithful take the images literally. Others
understand them as poetic attempts to explain the unexplainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the limited is dealing with the unlimited, we can only
describe the infinite in finite terms,'' said the Rev. Isaiah
Clark, pastor of Union Missionary Baptist Church in West Palm
Beach. ``My mind doesn't go any further.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clark accepts the literal picture of heaven found in the
Revelation of John, the last book of the Christian Bible. John's
vision of heaven as the new Jerusalem is precise.
</P>
<P>
   The city is 1,500 miles square and has 12 gates adorned with
different gems. Streets are gold. There is no sun or moon. God is
the source of light. There will be no night, and the gates will
never be shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe John got a peek, a preview, of what heaven looks
like,'' Clark said. ``He wrote it and gave us something so that we
can be a people of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholic and Orthodox frescoes and canvas paintings of paradise
make up some of the world's finest art, but official Roman Catholic
teaching does not describe the particulars of heaven, according to
the Rev. William Mayer, pastor of St. Ann Church.
</P>
<P>
   He is delighted his school kids tried their hand at drawing what
heaven looks like, but he doubts that paradise is a place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most traditional teaching of the Church is that heaven is
a state of being in the presence of God,'' Mayer said. ``You're not
complete until you're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, material pictures help us visualize the spiritual.
Muslims imagine delightful things in paradise, according to Jamal
Badawi, an instructor in Islamic studies at St. Mary's University
in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven is like the taste of fine food, cool water, living in
palaces with a perfect climate and beautiful marriage partners, he
said. But Badawi is quick to insist that the images are not to be
taken literally. They are useful only to feel the inexplicable
pleasure and the nearness of God, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prophet said, `In paradise there are things no eye has
ever seen, no ear has ever heard and no thought could ever
conceive,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Islam has various levels of heaven that determine proximity to
God, but ``no one gets jealous,'' Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
   Mormons and Jews have levels or degrees of paradise as well.
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe
in three degrees of heaven.
</P>
<P>
   All are kingdoms of glory, said John Winfree, a local patriarch
of the Mormon church from North Palm Beach. Earth will one day
become a kingdom of glory as well, taken from its orbit and put in
the presence of God, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish tradition claims there are degrees of proximity to God in
heaven, which is called the world to come, according to Nathan
Katz, chairman of the religious studies department at Florida
International University in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how close you get to God,'' Katz said.
``Orchestra seats, mezzanine seats is sort of how it is discussed.
The closer to God's presence, the greater the righteousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jews and Gentiles are welcome, almost everyone makes it and
lives forever at their best age, about 30, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The world to come is both a garden and a place of learning. The
word for paradise means garden of Eden and rabbi's study, Katz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate visions of heaven abound in all religious traditions,
but perhaps the best story to describe heaven is an old sermon
illustration about a man and his dog.
</P>
<P>
   The man went to the doctor with his loyal beast alongside. He
left his pet in the waiting room when he entered the doctor's
office. The dog whined and scratched at the closed door that kept
him from his master.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor and patient talked of health, life and death. The patient
asked what heaven was like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what heaven looks like,'' said the doctor. ``I
don't know the color of the wallpaper or whether our fingernails
grow in heaven, but none of that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your dog doesn't know what this room looks like or what goes
on in here, but he is scratching at the door to come in. He knows
you are here, and he wants to be where his master is. That's what
heaven is like.''

AS SPENDING BILLS LAG, THE DEMOCRATS ATTACK
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With just five days until money for the new fiscal
year runs out, President Clinton and Congressional Democrats on
Monday escalated their criticism of Republican leaders for not
moving faster on the 13 spending bills needed to keep the
government running.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Congress has completed work on only four of those bills.
Congress and the president have adopted a temporary spending
measure that expires Friday night at midnight. Republicans in both
houses said Monday that they expected to complete action on three
or four other bills but would probably have to roll the remaining
legislation into one big catchall package to meet the Friday
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not meet that deadline, they could extend it,
although they would probably do so for only a day or two at a time.
If they neither met the deadline nor extended it, parts of the
government would shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., the House Democratic leader,
was particularly harsh in his criticism of the majority Republicans
Monday, five days into the 1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, this is the worst Congress that has ever sat in
the United States Capitol, that has achieved less than any Congress
that we've ever had,'' Gephardt said at the White House after
meeting with the president. ``Republicans have wasted the entire
year and have left the heavy lifting until the last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, whom much of the public held responsible for
partial government shutdowns in 1995-96, said Monday that comments
like Gephardt's were proof that congressional Democrats and the
administration were itching for a fight over the spending bills. In
fact, they said, they suspect that the Democrats would even welcome
a shutdown as a distraction from the drive on Capitol Hill to
impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said on
Sunday that he was suspicious of the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disturbed by the ability to work with this White
House,'' Lott said. ``It's a matter of trust, and I'm not sure that
as majority leader now I can trust their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the same party controls the White House and Congress,
the lawmakers usually leave the difficult negotiations over the
spending bills until the end of each session. But the atmosphere
this year is especially charged, with the impeachment process under
way just as Congress is trying to wrap up its must-do business.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating matters is that this is an election year,
and members are eager not only to leave Washington to campaign but
also to insert their pet projects into the spending bills, although
they know that the leaders will decide among themselves what the
final package contains.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The president has indicated that he could veto at least five of
the remaining bills. On Monday, in one of his most direct and
comprehensive formulations on the appropriations process, he
stepped up pressure on the Republicans to drop their notion of a
tax cut and to enact his proposals on education, the environment
and disaster relief _ the broad legislative themes that could give
him some political footing in a showdown with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton addressed several issues that Congress will be haggling
over in the next few days as House and Senate Republicans try to
resolve their own differences. He asked Congress to approve full
financing for the International Monetary Fund, sought money for
100,000 teachers and after-school programs, and said he was alert
to what he called ``unacceptable'' anti-environment provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the priorities of the American people,'' the
president said of his proposals, ``and they must be the priorities
of Congress in these last days before the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the spending bills are being held up because of disputes
among Republicans themselves. For example, conservative House
Republicans object to Clinton's request for $14 billion to shore up
the reserves of the International Monetary Fund, but many other
Republicans, in both houses, want to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt framed the impasse this way: ``Can the Republican
leadership reign in the right wing, the far right wing of the
Republican Party, so we can avoid a shutdown?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans attribute the snags to the president's request for
more than $13 billion in emergency spending that they say would
break last year's budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The four bills that Congress has finished would finance energy
and water projects, military construction, defense and the
operations of Congress. In the next couple of days, both houses are
expected to complete action on the agriculture bill, the
transportation bill, the bill financing the veterans and housing
departments and, possibly, the Treasury and Postal Service bill.
</P>
<P>
   Each house will then roll into one big package, or omnibus bill,
at least five spending measures that include elements the president
has said he will or may veto. He has threatened a veto on the
Commerce bill because of a dispute over how the census would be
conducted; the Labor bill over Republican resistance to his
proposals for education programs and fuel assistance for low-income
people; the Interior bill over several environmental provisions;
the District of Columbia bill over school vouchers and a
prohibition on homosexual couples' adopting children, and the
foreign operations bill over the International Monetary Fund and
overseas family planning.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said the real negotiations, between the House
and the Senate and then with the White House, would not start until
Wednesday or Thursday, or possibly even Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a massive, days-long conference in a tiny room with
no air,'' one top Republican aide said.
</P>
<P>
   But this aide, and others, predicted that Congress would try to
adjourn in time for members to get home by Monday to campaign in
local Columbus Day parades.

TREASURIES SURGE AS INVESTORS PUSH YIELDS TO A 31-YEAR LOW
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another big loss in stocks and fears of a further
deterioration in nearly all types of financial assets drove
investors worldwide into the relative safety of Treasury securities
Monday for the fifth consecutive day. Bond prices surged for the
biggest one-day gain in more than a year, pushing yields to another
in a series of 31-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading, yields on the Treasury's 30-year bond
had plummeted to 4.72 percent, from 4.84 percent Friday, the lowest
for long-term government debt since April 1967. Prices rose 2 and
2/32 point, or more than $20 per $1,000 in face amount, the biggest
gain since Sept. 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a continued flight to quality,'' said David
Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. ``I
don't know where the end of this process lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Further deterioration in world stock markets Monday only
reinforced the demand for Treasury securities. Although the Dow
Jones industrial average recovered from steep losses to end only
58.45 points lower, at 7,726.24, the Nasdaq stock market tumbled
78.29 points, or 4.85 percent, to 1,536.69. Most stock markets
overseas also slumped.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said there was disappointment that finance ministers
and central bankers attending the annual meeting of the World Bank
and International Monetary Fund had apparently failed to agree on a
plan to shore up the faltering international economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many went into the weekend thinking a credit package for
Brazil would be in the works and announced just after the
elections, which were held on Sunday,'' said William V. Sullivan
Jr., a senior vice president and chief money market economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the recent steep slides in interest rates ``are
divorced from underlying economic and credit market fundamentals''
in the United States. Instead, he said, ``they are based upon a
whole different attribute: a heightened preference for quality,
safety and liquidity.''
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the challenge facing policy makers and market
participants alike was underscored Monday by William McDonough, the
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions at a meeting of the Institute of
International Bankers in Washington, McDonough said the current
crisis was the most serious since World War II, adding that the
declines in world markets and economies could ``get worse because
there is a significant possibility of a credit crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the people in this room have the capacity to make sure
this doesn't happen,'' McDonough said. ``It makes sense to control
the risk aversion of `let's batten down the hatches and protect our
institution.' If every institution does that, I can assure you we
will have a very large credit crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The collapse in the price of riskier fixed-income assets
relative to Treasury securities claimed another victim Monday, as
Criimi Mae Inc., a real estate investment trust with a big
portfolio of commercial mortgage securities, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection following big losses on its investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``As all of these markets have blown up, the value of Criimi
Mae's assets plummeted,'' said Jim Callahan, executive director of
the Pentalpha Group, an investment advisory firm based in
Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Callahan said, ``a lot of people are breathing a sigh of
relief at what Criimi has done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Filing for reorganization is a better outcome than a fire sale
liquidation, like Long-Term Capital,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said Long-Term Capital Management, the formerly
high-flying hedge fund that was salvaged from near-collapse late
last month by a consortium of investment banking firms, was in the
market Monday selling mortgage-backed securities and older Treasury
securities, and buying freshly issued government notes and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was not the only maturity
that registered big price gains Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Near the close of trading in New York, the 4.5 percent two-year
notes were quoted at a price of 100 29/32, up one-quarter of a
point, to yield 4.02 percent. The price of the 5.25 percent
five-year notes rose by 17/32, to 105|, to yield 3.96 percent. And
the 5| percent 10-year notes rose a full point in price, to 111
17/32, to yield 4.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the day, yields on the government's
two-year, three-year and five-year notes were all trading below 4
percent, said Sullivan from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

INVESTMENT FUND'S CRISIS HAS WHOLE TOWN TALKING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ For the epicenter of a financial earthquake
that is roiling stock and bond markets around the globe, Greenwich
is looking remarkably tranquil these days. At first glance, even
the headquarters of John Meriwether's Long-Term Capital Management,
the giant investment pool that threatened to go bust and take
billions of dollars with it, was typically lush, leafy and
well-landscaped.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look revealed one hint of the unusual: a black
office chair sitting in the middle of the driveway leading to the
building. It turned out to belong to one of the guards whose job it
was to shoo away the curious.
</P>
<P>
   Were those boxes of documents that were being loaded into the
back of mini-vans in the parking lot?
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment _ you'll have to leave the property,'' is all the
guards would say.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the way it is _ serene on the surface, reeling
underneath _ all over Greenwich, which in recent years has become
Wall-Street-by-the-Sea. Dozens of investment firms, run by money
managers who have traded pinstripes for polo shirts, have settled
in here, above Chinese restaurants and antiques shops, in empty
office buildings and abandoned corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the firms run mutual funds, some manage money for
individual investors, some run hedge funds, which have recently
become notorious because of Long-Term Capital's near collapse. The
Federal Reserve arranged a bailout in which banks and brokerage
firms put up hundreds of millions of dollars to keep it afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of hedge funds are big, which in this world means
they have assets of $1 billion or more. ``There are 100 guys here
managing less than $50 million,'' one money manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds come in all different flavors _ risky or
conservative, global or regional, stocks or bonds, or a little bit
of everything. Some funds invest mainly in other funds, some buy
oil rigs, bankrupt companies, or real estate.
</P>
<P>
   There are three things all hedge funds have in common: They are
open only to the rich, they pay their managers a big slice of their
profits, and they are not subject to government scrutiny, on the
theory that millionaires can take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To protect their investment strategies and to avoid giving the
government the impression that they are trying to appeal to the
general public, hedge funds tend to be highly secretive. Getting a
manager to talk about a fund is next to impossible, even in the
best of times.
</P>
<P>
   And these are far from the best of times, for almost every kind
of investment fund, from the most conservative mutual fund to the
most supercharged hedge fund. The Dow Jones Industrial Average,
which measures blue chip stocks, has dropped more than 15 percent
since early July, and some foreign markets are down by almost 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Managed Account Reports, which tracks about a dozen Greenwich
hedge funds in its database of more than 1,000, reports that all
but two of the Greenwich firms suffered losses in August.
</P>
<P>
   There is perhaps a touch of schadenfreude _ or more kindly, a
feeling of ``there, but for the grace of God, go I'' _ behind the
Greenwich financial set's fascination with the meltdown of
Long-Term Capital. ``It's the talk of the town,'' said James P.
O'Shaughnessy, a money manager and author who is starting a hedge
fund of his own.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent parents' night at Greenwich Country Day School, he
said, all the adults were asking how such a mess could have
happened, and when the next shoe might drop. The rest of the time
they were bemoaning their losses in far-flung financial markets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the children in Greenwich are worried.
</P>
<P>
   Before choir practice at Christ Church, a 10-year-old girl
asked, ``Can we pray for the stock market?'' reported Kathleen
Shelton Smith, whose child sings in the choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the other children laughed, but the little girl said,
`It isn't funny,''' said Ms. Smith, a partner in Renaissance
Capital, a research and money-management firm on Greenwich Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions in Greenwich may run particularly high right now
because many people in town knew and liked Meriwether and his crew
and find it hard to believe how wrong things went at his fund.
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo Birinyi, who used to work with Meriwether at Salomon
Brothers and now has his own research and money-management firm in
Greenwich, used to visit him for lunch at Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most boring operations you've ever seen,''
Birinyi said. ``Just a bunch of guys sitting there. You weren't
even sure they were all awake. If it wasn't for CNBC on the
television, you would have thought you were in a computer lab at
Carnegie Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich has long been ``the town the bull market built.''
Since the 1920s, Wall Street wheeler-dealers have built their
mansions overlooking Long Island Sound and have commuted an hour
into Manhattan. And until recently, there were no state income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich has almost 60,000 residents, but it still looks like a
village, albeit a rich one. Many office buildings are low enough to
be hidden behind rustic stone walls and stands of trees.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, a lot of financial executives who lived in
Greenwich realized that they could work there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Much business these days is conducted over the phone or by
computer, and any meetings in Manhattan are only a short train ride
away. There was no reason anymore to take the 6:02 five dawns a
week to get to Wall Street by 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was commuting three hours a day,'' recalled William Smith, a
Wall Street refugee who is president of Renaissance Capital. The
realization that he was spending the equivalent of more than a
month a year on the train was one reason he and his partners
decided on Greenwich when, in 1991, they opened their research and
money-management firm, which specializes in new stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Lower taxes were also a lure, several investment managers said,
as were, until recently, lower real estate costs.
</P>
<P>
   Several large corporations, including American Can and United
Parcel Service, moved out of Greenwich in the late 1980s and early
1990s, leaving some big empty buildings where space could be rented
for a relative song.
</P>
<P>
   And some buildings have amenities that Manhattan just cannot
offer. Along Steamboat Road, the glass and concrete office
buildings may look a little like bunkers, but they face Greenwich
Harbor and have docks where tenants can tie up motor boats and
small yachts. The area, the original home of Long-Term Capital and
still the site of hedge funds like Ardsley Partners, grew so
popular with money managers that it became known as Hedge Alley or
Hedge Row.
</P>
<P>
   As more investment firms moved to Greenwich, more wanted to
come. ``You certainly want to be in a community with other
financial services firms,'' said Roberto Hunter, chief financial
officer of Spectrum Capital, an investment bank that moved to
Greenwich almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at just the right time,'' Hunter said. ``Now there's
practically no space _ though that could be changing as there is
some shakeout in, and fallout from, hedge funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, space is available at Long-Term Capital's own building,
called Osprey House, which the firm owns. Signs on the building say
5,000 to 32,000 square feet are available; the leasing agent did
not respond to an answering machine message asking how long the
sign had been up.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at least seven investment firms moved into Greenwich
and seven more moved to other parts of Fairfield County, according
to the Business Council of Southwestern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Stamford is most popular with large firms that need a lot of
space, while Greenwich tends to draw the smaller operations that
Wall Street calls boutiques, even if they manage hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Many are really one- or two-person operations, managing money
for themselves and a few of their friends, but a few, like
Long-Term Capital, are big enough for billion-dollar bets.
</P>
<P>
   Or were. Long-Term Capital once could borrow millions, but now,
according to some talk around town, the firm can't get sandwiches
on credit at the deli.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said David LaRusso, who owns C &AMP; D Stateline Deli on
West Putnam Avenue near Long-Term Capital's building. People from
the firm come in every day, and ``no one ever asked me for
credit,'' he said. ``I certainly would give it if they asked me. I
sure wouldn't lend them a billion dollars, but they're very nice
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And as befits a place where investment jargon is the local
lingo, LaRusso said he was sorry but not surprised by what
happened. ``It was a hedge fund, it was a gamble,'' he said. ``What
do you expect?''
</P>
<P>
   Not this financial debacle, say some of Greenwich's financial
folks, who still cannot quite believe that a crisis that government
officials say threatened world financial markets began in their
quiet corner of the world, rather than Tokyo or London or New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Killian, the third partner of Renaissance Capital, was
only half-joking when she said: ``Who realized the epicenter of the
financial disaster of the century would be here, right near the
Starbucks?''

   WASHINGTON _ Almost every member of the House Judiciary
Committee paid some tribute to the Constitution and the Founding
Fathers Monday. Many said portentously that their debates and votes
would be remembered for generations. The muse of history was
obviously working overtime.
</P>
<P>
   True, it was only the third time that presidential impeachment
has been formally considered on Capitol Hill. But only in that
limited sense was the approval of a full-scale impeachment process
historic. It was by no means decisive, no matter how much the
legislators huffed and puffed.
</P>
<P>
   This was only a first step along a rocky road whose length is
not known _ not by President Clinton, not by the public and not
even by committee members (although the chairman, Rep. Henry J.
Hyde, R-Ill., said last weekend that he hoped the House of
Representatives could finish its work before year's end).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution provides our compass,'' said Rep. Edward
Pease, R-Ind. ``I intend to follow it.'' But neither he nor his
colleagues could say for sure where it would ultimately point.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in the same room where Richard Nixon's fate was sealed a
quarter-century ago, Republicans stressed parallels to that era.
This case is about law-breaking, they said, and not about illicit
sex. To which Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the committee's
senior Democrat, retorted: ``This is not about Watergate. It is
about an extramarital affair.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the fault line, so far unbridgeable, between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
   People in Washington universally assume that the House as a
whole will vote later this week to ratify the committee's decision.
The Republicans have the votes to prevail. But if only Republicans
support the procedural plans set out by their leadership, as was
the case in the final vote Monday night, the decision will be seen
by many in the country as a purely partisan proposition.
</P>
<P>
   That next roll call will help set the tone for what lies ahead.
If only a half-dozen Democrats join the Republicans, the image of
trench warfare will be reinforced and the subsequent inquiry will
begin under something of a cloud; if 50 or 75 do so, the vote will
confer a greater degree of legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   The more the average voter thinks that the Republicans are
ganging up on the president, his strategists believe, the better
his chances of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, consensus or something approaching it may develop
later. Only well into the final stages of the committee's 1974
hearings on the impeachment of Nixon did significant numbers of
Republican members join the Democrats in concluding that Nixon had
committed impeachable offenses. The fact that they finally did led
people on both sides to judge its actions fair.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case of presidential impeachment, Andrew Johnson
survived a Senate trial because just enough members of the
opposition party broke ranks and voted to back him.
</P>
<P>
   Once this week's votes have been taken, attention will shift to
the midterm elections on Nov. 3. The conventional wisdom in
Washington has shifted rapidly in recent days, from a belief in the
days before the release of Kenneth Starr's report that changes
would be minimal, especially in the House, to a suspicion that
Democratic losses would be large, which took hold in the days
before the tape of Clinton's grand jury testimony was released.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is a growing conviction that the Republicans erred by
releasing the tape, creating a backlash that could help marginal
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Two caveats seem in order, however. While the president's
troubles seem less likely to influence Senate races, Democrats were
in big trouble in those without any drag from Washington. A number
of independent analysts see Republican gains of four to six seats.
Major losses in the House are still possible, too, perhaps 20 or
more seats if Republican voters turn out en masse and Democrats do
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Differential turnouts aren't really very common, you know,''
said a senior Republican senator on Capitol Hill. ``But this year,
Democratic voters seem to be in a sulk, and the Republicans act
like they'd turn out even if it snowed on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Big gains might embolden Republican legislators in their pursuit
of Clinton. But the political terrain is tricky. After November,
both parties will have to play to the 2000 electorate _ larger,
spread more broadly across the economic scale, and less intensely
partisan _ and that might have a tempering effect on the zeal of
the Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed terms of the case developed by the inquiry, and how
it is developed, will have an impact as well. Unshakeable as the
preconceptions of many committee members sounded Monday, experience
suggests that over a long period, some of them and some others in
the House will change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton and Monica Lewinsky are called as witnesses, their
deportment will certainly influence some representatives. How they
and their interrogators behave will influence voters as well.
Clinton is a formidable persuader, and any attempt to break down
his testimony would run the risk of alienating people who would
sense disrespect for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign crisis _ a genuine foreign crisis, as opposed to one
that the administration was suspected of inventing _ could
radically change the context of the inquiry, too. Republicans might
find themselves under fire for distracting the commander in chief
from important security responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the topics other than Ms. Lewinsky that Starr has
investigated? Hyde insisted Monday night that the independent
counsel was still pursuing the original Whitewater matter and other
controversies; one of the committee's ranking Democrats, Rep.
Barney Frank of Massachusetts, insisted that no more would be
forthcoming from Starr. Ambiguity keeps the pot boiling; wrapping
up the other cases would take some of the steam out of the House
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   All of those ideas, all of those possibilities will be in the
air as the House debates impeachment in November and December.
Depending on how they coalesce, the Republican leadership might or
might not be receptive to a compromise, either before a committee
vote or after a committee vote to approve articles of impeachment,
before ratification by the House as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   At any time, of course, Clinton could change his mind and decide
to resign. Nixon's decision to quit came after the committee had
voted. But it was motivated by the emergence of new evidence more
than the vote itself, plus the belief he could not win in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say he would rather be a second Andrew Johnson,
surviving in the Senate by a tiny margin, than a second Richard
Nixon. As things now stand, he would appear to have a good chance
of getting the 34 votes he would need (one-third of the total plus
one) to win a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not chiseled in stone, either. The Republicans could
have 60 seats by the time the case reached the Senate. In that
case, if they lost none of their own partisans, a switch of only
seven Democrats would doom Clinton. A remote possibility,
certainly, but then so much of what has happened so far in this
case seemed highly improbable until it happened.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a long day that veered from sober
constitutional discourse to bitter partisan scrapping, the House
Judiciary Committee voted along party lines on Monday night to
recommend that Congress open a formal impeachment investigation of
a president for only the third time in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the investigative counsel for the Republicans
outline 15 possible grounds for impeachment of President Clinton,
the committee, on a vote of 21 to 16, sent to the House a
resolution modeled after the language used in the Watergate
inquiry. It authorizes the committee ``to investigate fully and
completely whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of
Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach
William Jefferson Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats tried and failed, on another party line vote, to
substitute a plan for a more limited, two-phase inquiry. It would
have required the committee first to define an impeachable offense
before deciding whether to open a formal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposal put them as well as the Republicans on record in
support of further inquiry into the president. Many Democrats
sharply condemned Clinton's behavior but said it fell short of
warranting impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is set to vote on the impeachment inquiry as
early as Thursday, as one of its last acts before recessing for the
midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the committee, Rep. Henry Hyde, opened the
nearly 11 hours of deliberations by reminding everyone that on
Monday the committee was not considering the impeachment of the
president but simply deciding whether to investigate further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to pass judgment on anyone,'' the Illinois
Republican said. ``We are here to ask and answer this one single
question _ based on what we now know _ do we have a duty to look
further or to look away?''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the memories of Watergate were summoned
repeatedly as Republicans and Democrats presented sharply different
views of the severity of the president's evasions over his affair
with Monica Lewinsky in two legal forums. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,
even revived the infamous Watergate phrase about a ``cancer'' in
the presidency to describe Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In making his case for an impeachment inquiry before the final
vote, David Schippers, the chief investigative counsel for the
Republicans, told the committee that ``substantial and credible
evidence'' existed of 15 possibly impeachable offenses by Clinton,
more than the 11 such charges made by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The core of his argument concerned the sanctity of the nation's
judicial system and the president's role as the nation's chief law
enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle that every witness in every case must tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, is the foundation
of the American system of justice which is the envy of every
civilized nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If lying under oath is tolerated and when exposed, is not
visited with immediate and substantial adverse consequences,''
Schippers said, ``the integrity of this country's entire judicial
process is fatally compromised and that process will inevitably
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Schippers recast Starr's own charges somewhat. He dropped what
many lawyers considered to be Starr's two weakest accusations,
including abuse of power, stemming from claims of White House
privilege and from Clinton's refusal to voluntarily testify while
misleading potential witnesses. And on the possible charges of
perjury, Schippers chose to refer to those acts as making false
statements, which some committee members said would be easier to
prove.
</P>
<P>
   He divided some of Starr's charges and added several new ones
including a failure to disclose Ms. Lewinsky's filing of a false
affidavit and a ``conspiracy'' to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of a conspiracy, he highlighted three days of
constant phone calls to and from the White House showing Clinton
reaching out to his friend Vernon Jordan and his secretary, Betty
Currie, after he denied a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
during a deposition in the sexual harassment case of Paula Jones in
January. The calls then show Mrs. Currie trying repeatedly to find
Ms. Lewinsky, instructing her in code to ``Call Kay.''
</P>
<P>
   Ending his testimony with a touch of drama, Schippers asked to
speak not as a committee staff member, but as a citizen, a father
and a grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrasing Sir Thomas Moore in the play ``A Man of All
Seasons,'' he said, ``The laws of this country are the great
barriers that protect the citizen from the winds of evil and
tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   Lecturing the committee, the Chicago lawyer, who is a lifelong
Democrat, added, ``Fifteen generations of Americans, our fellow
Americans, many of whom are reposing in military cemeteries
throughout the world are looking down on and judging what you do
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats objected and Hyde, the committee chairman who had
selected Schippers as his counsel, had the final remarks removed
from the record.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuttal, Abbe Lowell, the counsel for the Democrats,
countered that impeachment is reserved only for high crimes against
the state and that no matter how the Republicans had recast Starr's
case, ``one basic allegation _ the president was engaged in an
improper relationship which he did not want disclosed _ is the core
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Schippers, he contested the legal significance of
Clinton's original denial of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in
the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said that Judge Susan Webber Wright of Federal District
Court in Little Rock, Ark., called evidence about Ms. Lewinsky
unessential to the sexual harassment case against the president.
Judge Wright decided, after a motion by Starr, that his criminal
investigation overrode the Jones lawyers' need to continue their
pursuit of evidence involving Ms. Lewinsky. She ultimately
dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit last April, ruling that Mrs. Jones
had not proved that she had suffered any harm after her alleged
encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge was giving the committee the ability to determine
that the president's statements, whether truthful or not, were not
of the legal importance suggested by Starr,'' Lowell said, ``let
alone grave constitutional significance to support impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   He also accused Starr of overreaching and showing bias when he
cast the president's claims of executive privilege as an abuse of
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an attempt to organize his staff to spread
misinformation about the progress of the war in Vietnam,'' Lowell
said, returning to the Watergate era. ``Or about a break-in of the
Democratic headquarters at the Watergate, or even about how funds
from arms sales in Iran were diverted to aid the Contras in
Nicaragua. This was a president repeating to his staff the same
denial of an inappropriate and extremely embarrassing relationship
that he had already denied to the public directly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The committee met in the same cavernous hearing room where
Richard Nixon's own fate was debated 24 years ago. Behind the dais
of lawmakers stared down oil paintings of Hyde and of former Rep.
Peter W. Rodino Jr., D-N.J., who presided over the Watergate
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Democrats sought to turn attention as much on
Starr as on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we want to have prosecutors with unlimited powers
accountable to no one, who will spend millions of dollars
investigating a person's sex life?'' asked Rep. John Conyers Jr. of
Michigan, the senior Democrat on the committee. ``Who then haul
before grand juries every person of the opposite sex the person has
had contact with? Who then record and release videos to the public
of the grand jury questioning of the most private aspects of one's
sex life?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, by contrast, cast Mrs. Jones as a victim who had
been denied her day in court through Clinton's evasions. ``Bill
Clinton, first as governor and then as president, using the power
entrusted to him coarsely demanded personal favors from individual
citizens,'' said Barr, a longtime critic of the president.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Jones refused, Barr said, ``Bill Clinton continued to
abuse his office to smear that citizen's name and block her access
to justice.'' He added, ``We are witnessing nothing less than the
symptoms of a cancer on the American presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   A few members of the committee departed from party lines to look
for a middle ground. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., chastised both
parties alike. Republicans, he said, have ``an obligation to
recognize that high crimes and misdemeanors has a meaning. All
felonies are not high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Democrats that they had to recognize that it was a
Democratic Congress, at the urging of Clinton, which passed the law
that allowed the naming of an independent counsel. And it was
Clinton's attorney general, Janet Reno, who approved Starr's
inquiry into the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.,
said, ``I have no idea what I am going to do yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, one of the conservative rebels who had once tried to
topple House Speaker Newt Gingrich, said, ``I don't know if censure
is appropriate. We should just drop it or we should throw him out
of office. Nobody knows yet in my opinion who has really got an
open mind about this thing. Is this Watergate or Peyton Place? I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one lawmaker drew applause on Monday, and only from the
Democratic sideof the aisle. ``The president had an affair,''
shouted Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla. ``He lied about it. He didn't
want anyone to know about it. Does anyone reasonably believe that
this amounts to a subversion of government? Does anybody reasonably
believe this amounts to subversion of government?''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's committee vote marked only the third time that Congress
has begun a formal impeachment process against a president. The
first time was against Andrew Johnson. But it is far from a
foregone conclusion that Clinton will be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   If the House votes as expected later this week to authorize an
impeachment inquiry, the Judiciary Committee then begins the
process of holding hearings and weighing the evidence against
Clinton. It then decides whether to recommend that the full House
impeach the president, the equivalent of an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   If the House impeaches, the Senate then tries the president with
the chief justice of the United States presiding. It takes a
two-thirds vote of the Senate to remove a president from office.

NBA EXHIBITION SEASON CANCELED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA hit another inauspicious milestone Monday, canceling the
entire exhibition season for the first time in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, our teams cannot possibly be ready to play any
games before November,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.
``It's sad that we have been unable to have any meaningful
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as NBA owners and players prepared to hold a bargaining
session this Thursday _ the first since Aug. 6 _ the commissioner's
office offered more bad news with the announcement that all 114
exhibition games had been killed by the three-month-old lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The league had already postponed training camps for the first
time ever.
</P>
<P>
   And even the decision by players and owners to meet again
probably won't avoid the inevitable: the cancellation of
regular-season games, scheduled to begin Nov. 3. That announcement
will probably come next week.
</P>
<P>
   Teams need a minimum three to four weeks to sign free agents and
hold training camps, and that window is about to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they could open Nov. 3 if they wanted to,''
players association spokesman Dan Wasserman said. ``If we reached a
deal Thursday, maybe they could start on time, but I think most
people are gearing up for the long haul at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik also wrote off the possibility of an imminent solution:
``There's no reason for me to think that the players are going to
say anything other than what they've said already.''
</P>
<P>
   Today should have marked the opening of all 29 teams' training
camps. Instead, players will hold press conferences in a dozen NBA
cities to state their case. Up to 15 players, possibly including
Lakers Derek Fisher and Elden Campbell, will gather at UCLA's men's
gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to get the players' point of view across. And
that it's not a strike, it's a lockout (by NBA owners),'' Wasserman
said. ``The players definitely want to play. We've been trying to
compromise,... but the league wants outright concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Players and owners remain entrenched in their original
bargaining positions. The owners want a ``hard'' salary cap and
elimination of the ``Larry Bird rule'' that allows a team to pay
any amount to re-sign its veteran free agents. The union refuses to
give up the Bird clause and won't agree to anything resembling a
hard cap.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only hope for resolution anytime soon lies with
arbitrator John Feerick. Feerick has until Oct. 19 to rule on the
union's claim that some 220 players with guaranteed contracts must
be paid during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   If Feerick rules for the players, the NBA would have little
incentive to continue the lockout; however, the league is expected
to appeal the ruling in federal court if that happens. The union
believes an appeal would fail and add another 30 to 60 days to the
stalemate.

CONGRESSIONAL NEGOTIATORS AGREE TO CREATE MORE RENT SUBSIDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate and House negotiators reached agreement
Monday on a bill that would make rent subsidies available to more
poor families and allow more home buyers to qualify for federally
backed mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which seems assured of passage by Congress and of
President Clinton's signature, would create about 90,000 Section 8
vouchers, or federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants. It
would also raise the loan limits on federally insured mortgages to
$197,621 from $170,362.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts HUD back in the housing business,'' Housing and
Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said that both the rental-subsidy provision and the higher
ceiling for mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration
would have wide impact in New York City and other metropolitan
areas, where there are long waiting lists for housing assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the creation of 90,000 rental vouchers was especially
important, because no new Section 8 vouchers have been authorized
since 1994. Nearly three million households now receive housing
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Only two months ago, HUD negotiators had thought they might
persuade lawmakers to authorize 15,000 new vouchers. Authorization
of the far higher number left housing officials ``ecstatic,'' as
one put it Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said the higher mortgage ceiling would benefit about
70,000 families, many of them members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the HUD portion passes more or less intact, the
housing agency's funds for the fiscal year that began last Thursday
would increase about $2 billion, to $26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had pushed for measures to prevent housing agencies
from separating working families from the very poor, and thus
fostering racial as well as economic segregation. Republicans had
pushed for measures to help the working poor who live in public
housing. Cuomo, saying the bill met both needs, praised negotiators
from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., chairman of the Banking Committee's
housing subcommittee, said the House Republican leadership had
eased the way for the bill by combining it with the appropriations
bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

   &UR; HOSPITAL GIANTS CHARGED WITH FILING FALSE CLAIMS &QL;

<P>
   The government sued Columbia/HCA Healthcare and Quorum Health
Group, contending that they had defrauded federal health programs
for more than 14 years through a scheme involving bogus expense
claims.
</P>
<P>
   The suit comes after an investigation into allegations of fraud

YANKS' SCOUTING BINDER ON THE INDIANS IS A THICK ONE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each Yankee position player arrived at Yankee Stadium Monday to
find a sheet of paper dropped in his locker _ a scouting report on
Jaret Wright, Cleveland's starting pitcher in the first game of the
American League Championship Series Tuesday night at the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The information is specific to right- and left-handed batters,
what Wright may throw when he is behind in the count, what he likes
to throw when he is ahead, how he uses his breaking ball. The
single pages, written in black magic marker, are brief, only four
or five sentences, simple keys for the hitters to consider.
</P>
<P>
   If they want additional information, there is plenty more. A
team of five scouts _ including Gene Michael, the Yankees' director
of major league scouting _ tracked the Indians for the last 30
days, generating chapters of information included in the thick
binder given to Manager Joe Torre and his coaches. The binder,
which has a red cover, has about 200 pages, including dozens of
pages of statistics and spray charts that show where batters tend
to hit the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The scouting report for the division series against Texas had a
blue cover and helped the Yankees to dominate the Rangers in three
games. Texas, which led the American League in batting, collected
just 1 run and 13 hits, baffled completely by the Yankees' staff.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are meaningless, Michael said Monday, unless the
players execute and use the information properly. But the Yankees'
pitchers gleaned what they needed from the binders in meetings
before the series started and then exploited the Rangers with the
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, the Texas slugger, drove in 157 runs during the
regular season. But he walked only 46 times the whole year, and
apparently the Yankees' scouts noticed that he was willing to swing
at bad pitches in an effort to drive in runs. So the Yankees threw
him mostly off-speed pitches low in the strike zone, often low and
away. ``We pitched him like the count was 0-2 at all times,'' said
Jorge Posada, the catcher, ``especially when there were runners in
scoring position.'' Gonzalez had 1 hit in 12 at-bats, a bounding
double that rolled down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte and David Wells consistently pitched ahead in the
count _ Wells went to a 2-0 count only twice _ and then threw
change-ups, fooling the aggressive Rangers. ``I've always relied on
reports,'' Wells said Monday. ``The advice is free, and it helps.
We've got videotape in the back, to give us a look at the Cleveland
hitters. It's all valuable information.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the start of each series during the regular season and
the playoffs, pitchers meet in a group with catchers to review the
scouting reports. Infielders and outfielders meet in units to go
over each opposing hitter, what his tendencies are, how he is
hitting the ball, where he is hitting the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The reports in the post-season tend to be far more detailed than
during the regular season, because teams of scouts observe the
opponent, rather than just one scout. The scouts take pages of
notes and notate every pitch, looking for trends, as if they were
breaking down a secret code.
</P>
<P>
   Every player relies on the scouting information differently.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Bush, the Yankees' pinch-runner, checks the scouting
reports for times _ the time it takes for the pitcher to deliver a
ball homeward, the time it takes for a catcher to catch and throw
to second base.
</P>
<P>
   Bush knew that when the Rangers' Ivan Rodriguez was at his best,
he needed just 1.6 seconds to catch and throw the ball to second,
and he knew that on average, Rodriguez needed 1.8 seconds. Before
Bush sprints onto the field, he rechecks all the times with a
coach, Chris Chambliss, for the catcher, the pitcher and any
pitcher warming up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill will fall back on his own experience rather than
rely solely on a scouting report when he is batting. But O'Neill
does use the spray charts to determine how he will position himself
in right field.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 World Series, the outfield coach Jose Cardenal
shifted O'Neill a couple of steps to his right with the Braves'
Luis Polonia batting, based on the scouting reports _ and O'Neill
made a running, leaning catch moving to his right, ending Game 5
and preserving the 1-0 lead. ``I've never questioned him since
then,'' O'Neill said, smiling.

CBS PRE-GAME SHOW SETTLES FOR FIELD GOALS
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
BY RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After five weeks, CBS's revived ``The NFL Today'' is a decent
show but not a memorable one. The former domain of Brent Musburger
and Greg Gumbel boasts a dandy set, zippy graphics, the old theme
song and a miniature gridiron. It is informative but not
compelling. Jim Nantz, the host, and the analysts, George Seifert,
Marcus Allen and Brent Jones, are amiable but predictable.
</P>
<P>
   The foursome does not possess a zippy chemistry, except when
Jones insults Phil Simms when he checks in from a game site. Jones
is opinionated and animated but almost too eager to prove he's a
studio star. Allen's overeagerness to be authoritative has seen him
try to say too much in too little air time.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert is too laid back but has enough smarts to grow in the
job as Joe Gibbs did at NBC. But CBS did Seifert a disservice by
axing his skillful chalkboard segments last month. Nantz is a
knowledgeable and sincere guide, but he's being relied on too much
to control the flow. If Nantz didn't ask questions of the analysts,
it seems no one would know exactly when to speak.
</P>
<P>
   That's the result of CBS hiring three analysts who require
on-the-job training and need to be guided. So it's not surprising
that the show's stars are its experienced field reporters, Bonnie
Bernstein, formerly of ESPN, and Armen Keteyian, a former ABC News
correspondent. Bernstein's profile of Oakland Coach Jon Gruden and
Keteyian's of Deion Sanders were distinguished works.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL Today'' is tame compared with ``Fox NFL Sunday.'' The
Fox program is a rude and lively brew, which has improved this
season with a toned-down but more amusing Terry Bradshaw, and the
addition of the tart Cris Collinsworth. Combined with Howie Long's
informed menace and James Brown's expanding role in fomenting
dissent, Fox offers a merry spin on the pre-game formula.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain on Sunday why Tampa Bay has disappointed him
so much, Bradshaw compared the Buccaneers to the ingratiating beau
who holds doors for his future wife and takes her to fine
restaurants while they date. ``Then you marry the clown,'' he said.
``First thing, he takes his toupee off. Then he takes his teeth
out. He doesn't shave. He belches and picks his nose.''
</P>
<P>
   A piquant analysis, but one that makes you chuckle. Bradshaw was
born verbally unbound, which makes him a focus for playful abuse
from the other Foxians, who often speak as they desire, regardless
of who else is speaking.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS foursome is too restrained to be so loose. It is still
finding its way, exhibiting signs of a tight leash from the
production side.
</P>
<P>
   The segments devoted to panel talk feel shorter on CBS than on
Fox, keeping Nantz &AMP; Co. from building better on-air
schmoozability. Jones has lots of loose-cannon potential, but his
ammunition has been of an average caliber, not as wacky, pointed or
intimidating as what emanates from Fox's studio.
</P>
<P>
   By this time in 1994, the Fox show's first season, its
personality was well defined: Bradshaw had become more antic than
he was at CBS; Long's authoritative mien was a pleasant surprise;
Jimmy Johnson opined as if he didn't care if he ever coached again,
and Brown was a stable, able foil.
</P>
<P>
   CBS need not ape Fox. But it will be compared to Fox's and
ESPN's ``NFL Countdown,'' with their boisterous verbal dust-ups and
strong personalities, from Fox's Bradshaw and Long to ESPN's Chris
Berman and Sterling Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing Fox and CBS's programs this past Sunday places a focus
on a common feature: interviews with Green Bay Coach Mike Holmgren.
CBS focused on three areas: how would his defense handle
Minnesota's receiving corps (Cris Carter, Jake Reed and the rookie
Randy Moss) in last night's game; how he would rate Brett Favre's
season; and would he leave for a general manager-coaching job?
</P>
<P>
   Fox's crew asked sharper questions that strayed from the
obvious, including a newsy one: an Internal Revenue Service
investigation into whether certain Packers did not report income
earned from autograph shows. The chat ended with a mirthful
comparison of Brown, a somewhat full-figured fellow (280 pounds,
Bradshaw claimed), and Gilbert Brown, the fuller-figured Green Bay
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   CBS did well by interviewing Mark Carrier, the Detroit Lion
safety suspended for a week after his helmet-to-helmet hit gave
Tampa Bay's Brice Hunter a concussion, then having Seifert coach
Allen and Jones in avoiding such tactics.
</P>
<P>
   One of CBS's rookie game analysts, Steve Tasker, checked in with
a bright and humorous segment on running back Craig (Ironhead)
Heyward's cross-country trek for a new job, done in the style of a
weather report.
</P>
<P>
   And CBS advanced the discussion about the future coach of the
Cleveland Browns by introducing Mike Lombardi, a former executive
with the old Browns, as its ``insider.'' Lombardi named Gary
Kubiak, Denver's offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, CBS's show is but five weeks old. With time _ and
relaxation techniques _ the analysts should learn to communicate
more comfortably. Already, ``The NFL Today'' can be compared
favorably with NBC's unadventurous old show.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it becomes as entertaining as Fox's _ or as
well-informed as ESPN's _ is CBS's choice. We are waiting _ live! _
for its evolution.

MARKET PLACE: TOUGH TIMES FOR MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Texas)  (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The managed care companies that shed 250,000 elderly Medicare
customers last week will have healthier financial statements to
show for it, starting in the first half of 1999. But many Wall
Street analysts said that dropping Medicare units in dozens of
unprofitable markets would not be enough to pull the health
maintenance organizations out of a three-year earnings slump.
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs are rising, and the HMOs cannot be sure that
big employers will fully accept the large premium increases for
next year that the companies need to turn around their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the biggest HMOs announced that they would close their
units in areas where the government payments were too low to cover
rising costs, including suburbs north of New York City, the
Washington area and rural Northern California. Some HMOs are also
leaving places where they had a relatively small presence; the
United Healthcare Corp., for example, is closing its Medicare unit
in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberta Walter, a health care analyst at Merrill Lynch, said
that those HMOs that kept a big Medicare operation would continue
to suffer, even though earnings were rising on nongovernment
business. ``It is conceivable that improvement on the commercial
side could be offset by deterioration on the Medicare side,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining Medicare units will not lose money, she said, but
they will not grow robustly. And if the HMOs raise rates and reduce
benefits, they will not sign up thousands of new members as they
did in past years, when government payments were rising 6 percent
to 10 percent a year and the companies could offer generous
benefits and still turn a handsome profit.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has placed a 2-percent-a-year ceiling on increases in
the rates the government pays, and federal officials have so far
rebuffed requests to let the industry postpone compliance with new
regulations and cut back some benefits offered to HMO members.
</P>
<P>
   HMO executives are ``livid'' with anger, said Kenneth
Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co. The Federal
Health Care Financing Administration required them to set their
benefit package for 1999 last May and then announced regulations in
June that will add to the cost of doing business. The agency
rejected a request last week from the industry to reopen the
benefits issues. ``It was a double cross,'' Abramowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials insist that they are promoting both Medicare
HMOs and traditional fee-for-service HMOs. But Abramowitz said he
thought that the federal financing agency ``regards HMOs as
competitors; it's like asking the Post Office to set rates for
Federal Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare units cost United Healthcare $120 million in reduced
earnings and cost Aetna Inc. $60 million, Abramowitz said. But he
said there would be ``money to be made next year,'' when the impact
of the pullbacks in the Medicare units becomes clear. He predicted
that United Healthcare, Aetna and the Cigna Corp. would be the
first to attract investors, after the companies report their first-
and second-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walter was more cautious. She recommends a handful of
managed care companies, largely because they do not have a big
stake in Medicare. Her picks include Wellpoint Health Networks,
Cigna and Trigon Healthcare, a publicly traded Blue Cross plan
based in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York region, even though Oxford Health Plans
announced it was dropping 26,600, or 17 percent, of its Medicare
members, Ms. Walter said she had kept a low rating, ``neutral,
neutral,'' on the stock. She said that Oxford's turnaround plan
faced ``a very tough industry environment, with costs rising,'' and
was ``predicated on a number of assumptions, most of which have to
go right for the plan to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Keaney, an analyst at Volpe, Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. in San
Francisco, said Pacificare Health Systems, which gets most of its
revenues from Medicare, ``would be a beneficiary of everybody
else's pullback.'' Although Pacificare dropped 20,000 members of
its Secure Horizons Medicare division in Northern California, it
has been adept in most places at shifting financial risks to
physician groups. The groups are typically paid a set fee for each
Medicare member, and it is up to the doctors to keep costs within
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Willard, a health care analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said some buyers were attracted by the low prices of HMO
stocks, many of which are near historic lows. Also the companies do
not have to worry immediately about problems in Asia and other
foreign countries, and they are ``perceived not to have exposure to
potential problems in the economy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders were encouraged when insiders, headed by Dr. Norman
Payson, the chief executive, recently bought Oxford stock. But Ms.
Willard agreed with analysts who said the intermediate picture was
still uncertain, especially for Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are treacherous times for the HMOs,'' said Joyce Albers,
who follows managed care companies at Deerfield Management, a
health care investment fund. ``This is certainly not an area for
widows and orphans,'' she said.

   MORONI, Comoros _ The man accused of directing the bomb attack
on the American Embassy in Kenya came of age in this impoverished
Indian Ocean archipelago, a land where gifted teen-agers leave home
to enroll in the radical Islamic academies of Libya, Sudan and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   A tightly wound, brilliant student of the Koran who was thrown
out of religious school for caning a lazy pupil hard enough to draw
blood, Abdallah Mohammed Fazul set out for Pakistan 11 years ago,
at age 15, to continue his education.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime over the next few years, American authorities assert,
he fell under the sway of terrorists waging what they call a holy
war against the United States. He was transformed into a killer who
could coolly execute a bombing that left 250 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   He is still at large after being indicted in the United States
under an alias, Haroun Fazil, which he apparently used in Kenya. As
the object of a worldwide manhunt, he has a $2 million reward on
his head.
</P>
<P>
   The stark portrait of him as a terrorist baffles his wife, his
Koran teacher and relatives in Comoros, a country with a relatively
liberal Muslim character. Even relatives who admit that he had a
darker side say his religious fervor seemed limited to mundane
things like animosity to television and threats to chase family
members into the street if he caught them drinking beer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months after the bombings of the American Embassies
in Kenya and Tanzania, a picture of those charged in the case is
slowly emerging. They lived in different countries, labored in
various professions but shared a devotion to radical Islam and a
striking ability to keep family and friends in the dark about what
American prosecutors say were their true activities.
</P>
<P>
   Comoran officials express embarrassment that Fazil has turned
the world's eyes on them. But they say he is a true product of the
forces that shaped his tropical nation _ poverty, Islam, racism and
French colonialism. He is one of thousands of young Comorans who
have been forced by the lack of higher education to leave these
strange and beautiful islands, where the world's largest volcanic
crater meets startling aquamarine waves, where huge bats flit
between the palm trees by day and the moon glows vividly at night,
especially during power blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   They study far away, in harsh desert lands where the path to
holy martyrdom and the path to a bit of cash for a suffering family
back home are the same: Join the legions of the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The indictments filed so far suggest that Fazil was no ordinary
legionnaire, but a highly intelligent, natural leader who played a
central role in the bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
   His wife's extended family lives in a yellow cinder-block
building behind a one-room Islamic school on an alley paved only
with sharp pumice. They graciously welcomed two journalists into
their threadbare rooms, offered coffee and talked for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, a first cousin who married him five years ago and
lived with him in Sudan and Kenya, called him a hard-working
computer student and said he sometimes disappeared for weeks at a
time. His big brother said he had been a gentle, sometimes boastful
child who could ``smurf-dance like Michael Jackson'' and never said
anything about hating America.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, those who knew him said in so many words that they
did not know him very well. His siblings did not see him for years
at a time, his wife does not expect a message even though he has
been gone more than a month, and his old teachers say he never
visited. Each said, ``He has no friends I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI, Fazil headed the Kenya cell of Al Qaeda,
the terror network founded by Osama bin Laden, an exiled Saudi
businessman. It says Fazil rented the room where the bomb was
assembled and drove the white pickup that guided it to the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 14, a week after the Nairobi blast, he flew here. He
visited relatives and his local mosque.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 22, Fazil took a flight to Dubai. He had a ticket onward
to Pakistan, but it went unused, and he disappeared. His family
says he left without explaining, as was his custom, and they drove
him to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by Nairobi telephone records that showed calls to a
Moroni number, investigators descended on the family home on Sept.
2. The Comoran gendarmes were accompanied by FBI agents with
pistols and radio headsets, ``just like Delta Force'' said an
uncle.
</P>
<P>
   They took his brother, Omar, as well as his wife, Halima
Badroudine Fazul, 22, and sister-in-law, Nabatte Fazul, 19, in for
questioning. They also seized two computers, diskettes, a camera,
CDs and tapes, old letters, passports and birth certificates, two
Korans, piles of old Newsweek and Time magazines and Kenyan
newspapers, rubber stamps, most of the clothing of the family's men
and some belonging to women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the search ended badly. ``The FBI behaved correctly _
they were not threatening,'' said Halima Fazul. ``But the Comoran
gendarmes tipped my father out of bed to search it, even though he
had a catheter in him.''
</P>
<P>
   They banged on the ceiling over his bed with their gun butts,
she said. On her way back from the police station that evening, she
was told that her father, who had been suffering from a bleeding
ulcer, was collapsing. She ran, stumbling in the dark. ``He took my
hand and said, `Ah, Halima, you're back,''' and died, she said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about that later, a prosecutor and a ranking gendarme
both shrugged, saying they were unaware that the older man had
heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   No complete listing of the evidence against Fazil has been
issued _ some may still be being tested by the FBI _ but threads
can be pieced together from interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil had passports or ID documents from countries that he is
not a citizen of, apparently including Kenya and France, and stamps
for forging others.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan newspapers he had kept were mostly about the bombing,
an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a list of prominent Comorans who would have to be
killed to make way for fundamentalist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found a letter he wrote in 1991, when he was
19, to his brother Omar, then 24, in which he boasted that he had
been trained to use explosives and fire machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked his reaction, Omar Fazul, an English teacher, said: ``I
was impressed _ but I considered it childish. I thought he was
boasting. I didn't believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar Fazul said he never discussed religion, politics or
military service with his brother. ``We talk only about family
problems,'' he said. ``It has never been proved to me that my
brother is an Islamist. He wears jeans and boots.''
</P>
<P>
   Fazil was born in 1973, the youngest of six, just before his
parents separated. He began Koranic studies at 4 with an uncle and
at 7 began studying with a professional teacher, Fundi Twawilou
Abdulfateh. By the age of 9, he knew the Koran by heart and was
giving religious instructions on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   He was so smart, another relative said, that he was in third
grade while his older sister was in first. He played soccer and the
flute and could do a standing flip. As a teen-ager, he showed off
with kung-fu fighting sticks and called himself James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   He also had moments of rage. He got into a fistfight with a
teacher at his French public school, and slammed younger students
down in their chairs when they failed at Koran recital.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sometimes had a strange attitude,'' Fundi Twawilou said.
``On the soccer field, he would provoke fights with bigger guys.
When that guy would go to beat him, he would run away. So Omar, his
brother, would be beaten. But Omar has crippled feet, so Abdallah
would return to fight for him.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 11, he cut another pupil's ear. Asked to leave, he
studied for two years with Fundi Mohammed Ali, an older teacher,
who remembers him as ``brilliant, respectful to others, deeply
religious and very calm.''
</P>
<P>
   At 14, he switched to a school run by Fundi Soidiki Mbapandza,
one of the leading Islamic fundamentalists here, before leaving for
Pakistan. Outside the tin walls of that school compound, girls and
young women enter through one door, carefully avoiding eye contact
with the opposite sex, while male students glower aggressively at
visitors. Fundi Soidiki, who was questioned by the police, declined
several requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The most militant strains of fundamentalism are almost unknown
in Comoros. The islands are 99 percent Sunni Muslim, and many men
wear ankle-length shirts and Arab-style caps, while almost all
women wrap scarves around their bodies, legs and heads. But the
atmosphere is relaxed _ the scarves often merely adorn Western
dresses and few women hide their faces or hair. Speaking of Fazil,
Justice Minister Mohammed Abdou Mmadi said, ``Mr. Fazul learned a
different culture abroad. It would be impossible for a Comoran who
grew up here to become a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   The islands are very poor, with a gross domestic product of $470
per person. Tourists _ mostly divers _ are few, and 80 percent of
the local people are subsistence farmers and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Because scholarships to France have dried up, many accept the
meager ones offered by religious colleges in Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan
and Libya, where they are recruited by fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of Haroun Fazils all over the world,
recruited into the foreign legion of Libya and the armies of
Iran,'' warned Said Hilali Moussa, chief of President Abdoulkarim
Taki's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Many families get only one letter from their departed sons, said
a tourism official. It says they are safe, living in a hostel.
``Then they don't hear from them for years, and they they find out
they are in the army. Lots end up fighting in Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Something like that happened to Fazil. ``When he came back from
Pakistan,'' a relative said, ``he told his mother he wanted to go
into the army. She told him, `It is up to you.'''
</P>
<P>
   After that he became more of a mystery. He was trained,
presumably in Afghanistan, and has lived in Sudan, Kenya and
perhaps in Yemen. He comes home only for short visits, never leaves
an address and calls from pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, on a brief visit, he went with his father to
Moheli Island to meet his uncle for the first time. His cousins
Halima, 17, and Nabatte, 14, were there. ``We were eating, and not
well dressed, so we were embarrassed,'' Halima Fazul recalled. ``We
ran inside to change.'' At the end of the day, he had his father
ask for her hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Fazul used to go fully veiled, with only her eyes showing,
relatives said, and neighbors in Kenya said the same thing. But
when she went out visiting in Comoros, she wore her scarf off her
face and was unfazed when her young son pulled it off in front of
male visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband used to wear the traditional long shirts but now
wears trousers and sometimes a suit. When teased about the Western
dress by his father, a relative said, he pointed at his heart and
replied: ``Proving you fear God is not in your clothes. It's in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He now has money, relatives said. He sends some home, and last
year paid half the cost for his mother to go to Paris for cancer
treatment. His wife cannot identify his boss or say exactly what he
does, except work on computers. ``He goes away at 8 and comes back
at 6,'' she said. ``I don't know what he does outside.''
</P>
<P>
   She denied having heard of bin Laden before the blast and
protested that her husband did not hate Americans. She also gave
him an alibi, saying that at 10:30 a.m. on Aug. 7, when the bomb
went off, he was with her at the Nairobi airport trying to get her
sick father on a plane home.
</P>
<P>
   There have been accusations that a fundamentalist clique within
the Comoros government might shelter terrorists. Critics note that
the ``hit list'' for local politicians found in Fazil's house
called for killing President Taki's political opponents, but not
him. And local journalists were surprised to hear that Fazil got to
the airport late but boarded the plane in only 15 minutes, as if
someone had cleared his way.
</P>
<P>
   Moussa, the president's top adviser, called the accusations
ridiculous and said they emanated from political rivals and
separatists. The government, he said, first heard from the FBI on
Aug. 29, a week after Fazil's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Fundi Twawilou said he still felt like a father to Fazil and did
not believe him guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdallah knows good from bad,'' he said. ``He knows that for
planting a bomb that kills 250 innocent people, a Muslim would go
straight to hell.''

CAN A YEAR-OLD HOMER HAUNT YANKS?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The voice came from a nearby locker, but its tone and
meaning were clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does anybody know what year this is?'' Jeff Nelson asked
stridently. ``The year is '98. Quit asking about last year. It's
'98.''
</P>
<P>
   His words were aimed at the group of reporters questioning
Mariano Rivera about the home run he gave up to Sandy Alomar Jr.
that marked the beginning of the end of the Yankees' presence in
the playoffs last year. The home run tied the fourth game of the
division series, and the Cleveland Indians went on to win that game
as well as the next.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, their World Series plans short-circuited, went
home; the Indians eventually went to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, an older, more veteran member of the Yankees' relief
corps, was trying to protect Rivera by suggesting that last year
was last year, it's over and done with and there's no reason to
recall it or dwell on it. What Alomar did to Rivera a year ago, he
was saying, has nothing to do with the American League Championship
Series that begins at Yankee Stadium Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the Yankees' clubhouse Tuesday agreed with that
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane ride home from Cleveland was an ugly flight,'' said
David Cone, the most candid player in the Yankees' clubhouse.
``Guys were as down as I've seen them, very quiet, very somber.
We're not that far removed from last year. Everybody will say that
was last year, this is this year. There's a lot of truth in that,
but I remember it. I'm sure everybody in here does.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Cone continued, ``you try to block it out, but
having lost the series, you have four months to reflect. You look
back at certain things. That's when you dwell on it. We didn't
dwell on it at that point, but in retrospect you look back and say
that was the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, Cone said, took the home run ``very hard.'' Rivera said
Monday that it shocked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The count was 2-0,'' he recalled. ``The ball wasn't in the
middle. The ball wasn't inside. The ball was up and away.'' The
pitch was Ball 3, but it looked good to Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even remember,'' Alomar said, as if he could forget.
``That was a year ago. He was behind in the count, and I saw a
fastball and I hit it. I was very fortunate that I hit it the other
way. If I had pulled it, I might have grounded out or fouled it
off. But that's old news. That's not now. It doesn't matter now.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Players talk about motivation, as if they might need some other
kind of incentive besides the promise of a World Series
championship, a ring, a nice check for their troubles. Who really
knows what motivates or pushes a player?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get caught up in things like that, you forget what
you're trying to get done,'' Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager,
said, standing on a sun-bathed field. ''There's no revenge here.
They want to beat us so they can get to the World Series. We want
to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But suppose in the weird world of professional sports, players
can summon something extra by using elements outside themselves,
the psychological boosting the physical. In this instance, the
Yankees and the Indians could have a conflict, one force butting
heads with another.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have extra incentive to beat the Indians because the
Indians knocked them out of the playoffs prematurely last year. The
Indians have extra incentive to win because they fell two outs
short of winning the World Series last year and want to get back
and win it this year.
</P>
<P>
   Which motivating factor would win out?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope ours works and theirs doesn't,'' Hargrove said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Even Cone acknowledged that it's impossible to know which
factor, if either, could have an effect on the way the teams play
and the outcome of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a wash,'' he said. ``It could all be propaganda
for stories. It's hard to quantify the type of effect, the mental
effect. Does last year carry over to this year? Maybe, maybe not. I
don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a good matchup. There's a history here, a recent
history. How that bears on this series I don't know. Good food for
thought. Good to talk about. Good for the fans. There are all sorts
of methods to try to manufacture motivation. There's plenty here on
the table to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the past makes an impact on the present, it apparently
has already affected what has led up to the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into spring training this year ready to go,'' Cone
said. ``We worked hard all year. We wanted to get back to this
point and have another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees apparently made a greater effort to gain another
chance than the Indians. Both teams enjoyed large leads and were
never really threatened in their divisions, but their seasons were
markedly different, the Yankees finishing with 114 victories, the
Indians 89. The Indians won only 43 of their final 85 games. ''I
don't know if it was because we were 11 games or 14 games up,''
Alomar said. ``Sometimes we showed up; sometimes we just went
through the motions.'' But the Yankees, Alomar was told, had an
even larger lead throughout the season and they didn't seem to turn
it off and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' the catcher said, ``it's a sign that even when they
turn it off, they're on.''

GM REPORTEDLY TO COMBINE U.S. AND FOREIGN OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The General Motors Corp. plans to combine its domestic
and international automotive operations in a shakeup to be
announced on Tuesday, Wall Street analysts and other people close
to the plan said Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The combined automotive operations will be led by G. Richard
Wagoner Jr., the 45-year-old president of North American
operations, who is expected to become GM's chief operating officer
and possibly the auto maker's president, they said. Adding GM's
empire of foreign subsidiaries to his responsibilities makes it
more likely that Wagoner will someday succeed John F. Smith Jr.,
GM's 60-year-old chairman, chief executive and president.
</P>
<P>
   Smith scheduled a news conference for Tuesday morning, but GM
officials declined to comment on what he would say.
</P>
<P>
   GM has had a succession of heirs apparent to Smith, and Wagoner
might not be the last. Wagoner was highly successful running GM's
Brazilian operations in the early 1990s, and as GM's chief
financial officer from 1992 to 1994. But he has been unable to
reverse erosion of GM's market share in North America since he took
his current job four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   GM's North American operations have avoided at least the
fractious management struggles that have wracked its foreign
operations. Louis R. Hughes, GM's 49-year-old president of
international operations, moved his base of operations back to
Detroit from Zurich this summer after months of disputes with GM's
European executives. It was not clear Monday night how Hughes' job
might change with the latest reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald L. Zarrella, GM's group vice president for sales, service
and marketing, is the leading candidate to become Wagoner's deputy
with responsibility for all North American automotive operations.
Other executives, each responsible for an overseas region, are also
expected to report to Wagoner.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, GM's foreign automotive operations have been run
almost like an independent company. GM designs a full range of cars
in Europe and manufactures them in Europe, Latin America and Asia,
with little effort made to use the same parts as in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But GM's domestic and foreign design engineers have been
collaborating for years on a new sedan design that would be
manufactured worldwide. A consolidation of management
responsibility at the top would partly reflect this new effort.
</P>
<P>
   Global auto makers are always struggling for the right balance
between central control and regional autonomy. The GM change would
undo a shift toward regional autonomy in the late 1980s, when Smith
exercised considerable independence as the head of GM's European
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be a movement toward getting a little more
centralized,'' said Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, GM's rival, the Ford Motor Co., has just
experimented with tight central control and is moving in the
opposite direction, strengthening the power of regional management
teams in Europe and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the top managements of GM's domestic and international
management would permit the elimination of some overlapping
bureaucracies and could lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   David Healy, an auto analyst at Burnham Securities, questioned
whether substantial cost savings were possible. But other analysts
said that GM's bureaucracy was so ponderous that overall costs
might drop appreciably.

USC WANTS RULING ON MATOCK INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC expects to ask for a rules interpretation from
the Pacific-10 Conference on the play defensive tackle Marc Matock
broke his ankle against Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Matock suffered the injury after being hit from behind by
Arizona State center Grey Ruegamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was an aggressive play. It was questionable,'' USC
assistant coach Ed Orgeron said. ``There's a lot of plays that are
questionable. We'll probably mention it because it was
questionable. We just want to find out the ruling on it. I wish it
wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Matock was clearly unhappy about the play after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ruegamer) came back and dove toward my ankle,'' Matock said.
</P>
<P>
   Every school submits a report to the Pac-10 after each game, and
game films are reviewed by Verle Sorgen, the conference's
coordinator of football officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Sorgen, who attended the game, said he expected to review the
reports and films later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Matock underwent surgery Sunday at USC University Hospital,
where he had a metal plate inserted in his ankle with six screws.
He is scheduled to be sidelined a minimum of two months and hopes
to return for a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   With Matock out, Ennis Davis and Aaron Williams will start at
defensive tackle, with Ryan Nielsen switching from defensive end to
add depth.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano moving up? After another strong performance Saturday,
linebacker Mark Cusano could regain his starting job this week. For
the second straight game, Cusano had more tackles than starter Zeke
Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State game set: USC's game at Washington State on
Oct. 17 will begin at 7:15 p.m. and will be televised by Fox Sports
West. It's the second consecutive time the Trojans will be forced
to play in Pullman at night.

EDITORIAL: A DEBATE ON ALLOWABLE LIES
</HEADLINE>
 (fb)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 6:
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press summary of the House Judiciary Committee
hearing on Monday was admirable for its simple, concentrated
statement of Washington's political mood and the constitutional
quandary presented by a chief executive who has squandered public
respect. ``No one _ no Republican, no Democrat _ defended Clinton's
conduct with Ms. Lewinsky or his testimony while under oath,'' the
AP said. ``The issue was whether the president's behavior
constituted events worthy of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   That issue was crisply aired in presentations by David P.
Schippers, the counsel for the Republican majority, and by Abbe
Lowell, the minority counsel. Schippers said that Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, had documented that Clinton lied under
oath. He also said that in his view Clinton had worked
energetically to obstruct justice, tamper with witnesses and
suppress evidence sought. As for the argument that he was only
lying about sexual conduct, not affairs of state, Schippers pointed
out that under his constitutional oath the president cannot pick
those legal proceedings in which his word is good and give himself
a license to lie in others. The details of the underlying case
``are of no significance whatever,'' Schippers said. ``It is the
oath itself that is sacred and must be enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell put the opposing view as cogently as possible. Congress
should regard Clinton's testimony as ``misstatements'' about a case
that came to naught. The president's testimony, ``whether truthful
or not,'' does not have the constitutional gravity that warrants
impeachment or removal. Such steps require ``a far higher
threshold'' than has been reached in falsehoods designed to cover a
sexual escapade. Starr, he asserted, had tried to ``usurp the
constitutional role of the House'' by declaring President Clinton
impeachable instead of making a neutral presentation of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   From our point of view, these arguments, taken together, show
yet again how essential it is to reach a negotiated settlement that
involves heavy censure and an unqualified admission of lying by
Clinton. It would be disruptive to remove him unless more serious
crimes emerge. But far greater damage to the American political and
legal system would ensue from adopting Lowell's argument that the
nation's chief law enforcement officer can swear to tell the truth
and then lie for political convenience, to cover affronts to the
dignity of his office or to protect his family from knowledge about
his personal conduct. All are understandable human impulses, but
the rule of law is too important for this country to grant an
exemption for presidential foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of movement toward an acceptable resolution.
Former President Gerald Ford's proposal for condemning the
president in the well of the House spurred discussion of truncating
the impeachment process. This past weekend, the White House held
back its talk-show attack squad. The House Judiciary Committee
chairman, Henry Hyde, declared a willingness to conclude his
committee's deliberations by the end of the year. Sooner would be
better, but the Democrats have to shop harder for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers' stinging recitation of the flurry of phone calls
among Clinton, Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan should have convinced
the president's lawyers that the last thing they want is
impeachment proceedings or a Senate trial on obstruction of
justice. Monday's hearing should likewise have convinced House
Democrats that the Republican majority will never buy Lowell's
theory on the acceptability of miniature lies. But they can
probably move the Republicans toward a deal that allows this
presidency to run its full if inevitably disappointing course.

EDITORIAL: THE SUPREME COURT'S DOCKET
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 6:
</P>
<P>
   As the nine justices of the Supreme Court prepared to ascend the
bench Monday, protesters outside the building were calling
attention to a collective embarrassment. Of the 34 law clerks
currently serving the justices, they complained, 22 are white men,
11 are white women and one is a Hispanic woman. There are no blacks
among the group. It was a jarring, if fitting, beginning for a new
and potentially important Supreme Court term in which issues of
race, discrimination and political power will loom large,
challenging the conservative-leaning court to reach for a new level
of wisdom and sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Race is a subtext for the term's most politically charged case _
a challenge to the use of statistical sampling techniques needed to
avoid the quadrennial undercounting of minorities and poor people
in the 2000 census. House Republicans who brought the case are
anxious to avoid increasing the political power of predominantly
Democratic areas. The court's task is to insure a fair and accurate
count.
</P>
<P>
   On the related subject of redistricting, the court has agreed to
look again at a North Carolina congressional district it struck
down two years ago as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
Although the revised district is more compact and now has a
majority of white voters, a lower court nonetheless ruled it
invalid. The court needs to provide guidance on the degree to which
legislators can take race into account in drawing district lines.
</P>
<P>
   Another closely watched civil rights case will decide whether
collective bargaining agreements that provide for arbitration of
conflicts bar individual lawsuits against an employer for
discrimination. Disallowing such suits would weaken civil rights
protection for many American workers.
</P>
<P>
   The court will also hear arguments on the validity of an
anti-loitering law enacted by Chicago to combat street gangs. The
aim is sound but, as a lower court aptly noted, applying previous
Supreme Court rulings, the law is unconstitutionally vague and
infringes on the basic freedom to be on the street and associate
with others.
</P>
<P>
   A welfare case from California raises the question whether
states can discriminate against newcomers by granting them lower
benefits. There is no reason to depart from the court's principled
1969 ruling invalidating complete denial of welfare benefits to
newcomers as violating the constitutional right to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Another California case concerns the right of a landowner to
compensation for government limits on the use of his property. The
outcome will offer a sign of how far the court's more conservative
members intend to take their crusade to elevate individual property
rights at the expense of the environment and the ability of
localities to enforce reasonable zoning rules.
</P>
<P>
   Other important cases this term will test the court's
willingness _ not strong in recent years _ to protect personal
privacy against police incursions to search vehicles or peer
through window blinds in the name of fighting crime. The court
should not hesitate to say the Constitution does not condone the
police's acting like Peeping Toms.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing an exploration of sexual harassment issues begun last
term, the court has just agreed to decide the question of a school
district's liability for harassment of a student by another
student. It is hard to see how a school can avoid liability if it
can be shown that school officials knew of the problem and refused
to intervene.

HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE VOTES TO BEGIN CLINTON IMPEACHMENT
INQUIRY 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee voted along party
lines Monday to launch only the third presidential impeachment
inquiry in the nation's history, an examination of President
Clinton's effort to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After rejecting Democrats' efforts to limit the scope and
duration of the investigation, the Republican-controlled panel
approved a resolution to begin a Watergate-style inquiry that could
go beyond independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on the White
House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was adopted 21-16, with all committee Republicans
in favor and all Democrats opposed. The resolution for an inquiry
now goes to the full House, which is expected to vote by the end of
the week to make Clinton the first president to face such an
impeachment threat since Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we will come to our senses as we move forward,'' said
committee member Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat who fought
the Republican proposal and warned that it opens a ``fishing
expedition'' aimed at embarrassing the president.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, chief Republican investigator David Schippers, whose
staff analyzed evidence from Starr's seven-month investigation of
the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, told the committee he believed Clinton
had committed 15 potentially impeachable acts, four more than
alleged by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers split some counts against Clinton and added others,
alleging that the president engaged in a conspiracy and aided the
filing of a false affidavit to keep secret his relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Schippers dropped abuse of power charges
outlined by Starr, allegations stemming from Clinton's refusal to
voluntarily testify and from administration claims of privilege
designed to keep top presidential aides, White House lawyers and
Secret Service agents from having to cooperate with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, a former federal prosecutor with a Democratic voting
history in Chicago, said his team of investigators decided the
president's sexual misbehavior was ``peripheral'' to the key issues
outlined in Starr's Sept. 9 report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assertions of presidential misconduct ... are completely
distinct and involve allegations of an ongoing series of deliberate
and direct assaults by Mr. Clinton upon the justice system of the
United States,'' the former anti-racketeering lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deplorable as the numerous sexual encounters ... may be, we
chose to emphasize the consequences of those acts as they affect
the administration of justice and the unique role the president
occupies in carrying out his oath faithfully to execute the laws of
the nation,'' Schippers told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic chief investigator Abbe Lowell criticized Schippers'
analysis, saying he was adding charges by ``subdividing'' the
existing facts and citing a ``laundry list of laws'' Clinton might
have violated.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell characterized Schippers' inquiry as little more than an
extension of the four-year, $40 million investigation by Starr.
Regardless of how Schippers and his assistants ``may hope to
strengthen their recommendation by finding new offenses to tag on,
one basic allegation _ the president was engaged in an improper
relationship which he did not want disclosed _ is the core charge
that ... triggers this grave constitutional crisis,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Nixon impeachment inquiry during the Watergate
scandal, Lowell pointed out that the Judiciary Committee in 1974
voted against citing the president for backdating income tax
returns. ``If President Nixon's alleged lies to the IRS about his
taxes were not grounds for impeachment in 1974, how then are
alleged lies about President Clinton's private sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky grounds in 1998?'' Lowell asked.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrat argued that it is impossible to separate the
allegations from the case's underlying context _ that Clinton
engaged in an extramarital affair and nothing approaching the kind
of government malfeasance warranting impeachment. ``The clothes of
Watergate do not fit the body of the conduct in this referral,''
Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton reportedly paid little attention to
what was happening 16 blocks away in Room 2141 of the Rayburn House
Office Building. ``He is not spending any time focusing on what's
going on up on the Hill today,'' said presidential spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart acknowledged that Clinton continued calling
congressional Democrats over the weekend but declined to disclose
the topics. Lockhart said talks with Democrats about impeachment
``is an ongoing, active process.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in the same room where Nixon's impeachment was debated,
Judiciary Committee members spent most of the day arguing about
whether an investigation was needed and, if so, how broad it should
be, discussions that revealed the depth of the partisan rift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to pass judgment on anyone,'' said committee
chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican. ``We are here to ask
and answer this one single question _ based on what we now know _
do we have a duty to look further or to look away?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat and the top-ranking
Democrat on the committee, decried the resolution for an open-ended
inquiry in Clinton's behavior. ``This is not Watergate,'' Conyers
said. ``It's an extramarital affair. Americans know this and want
us to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., the committee's most ardent critic of the
Clinton administration, drew on rhetoric from the Watergate
investigation when he said the nation is ``witnessing nothing less
than the symptoms of a cancer on the American presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this president is allowed to use the presidency to gratify
his personal desires ... in the same way a corrupt county or parish
boss solicits money for votes, future occupants will sadly do the
same,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that Clinton's action were ``wrong and possibly
illegal,'' Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., suggested that ``censure
or rebuke and not impeachment is the right punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to move forward, and not have the Congress and the
American people endure a specter of what could be a yearlong focus
on a tawdry but not impeachable affair,'' Schumer said, arguing in
favor of the Democratic proposal to limit the impeachment inquiry
to the Lewinsky matter and to finish by Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., voiced the ambivalence of the
public as reflected in opinion polls. ``I don't know if censure is
appropriate, we should just drop it or we should throw him out of
office,'' Graham said. ``Is this Watergate or `Peyton Place'? I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, was more certain: ``For many
individuals to say that this is nothing more ... than something
about an illicit or extramarital affair is like saying that
Watergate was about nothing more than lock-picking or that the
Boston Tea Party was about nothing more than an aversion to
caffeine.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Clinton's private attorney David
Kendall asked Attorney General Janet Reno on Monday night to turn
over information Starr used in seeking an expansion of his
Whitewater probe into Clinton's affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said in a letter to Reno that he wanted to explore
whether Starr's representations to Reno that led to the expansion
were ``both complete and truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said Starr's staff may have used Linda Tripp, Lewinsky's
former friend, to suggest a pattern of behavior to Lewinsky that
later was used to convince Reno to expand the case.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also questions previously unreported contacts by Tripp
with Paula Jones' lawyers, by Tripp through intermediaries to
Starr's staff and by lawyers working with the Jones team who were
also in contact with Starr's prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Starr dismissed Kendall's letter and said the
standard for expanding his inquiry was ``abundantly satisfied.'' &QL;

ROBERT LEE GILL, 87, BUSINESSMAN AND COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Lee Gill, a longtime member of the New York
Stock Exchange and a prominent collector of American antiques, died
on Sept. 24 at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Gill was born in South Orange, N.J., in 1911 and educated at
Choate. He joined Shields &AMP; Co. in 1932 and in the late 1940s
formed a company with three other members of the Stock Exchange,
but for most of his career he worked independently. During the
1930s and '40s, he was a prominent member of cafe society whose
friends included Barbara Hutton and Howard Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's interest in Americana began at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, where he was a weekly visitor to the American collection from
the time it opened, in 1927, until his death. In the late 1930s, he
began collecting first-edition books and Currier &AMP; Ives prints. He
also made regular visits to the Upper East Side gallery of Israel
Sack, a dealer in Americana and American antiques, eventually
becoming part of the then small world of serious collectors of
American antiques that included Henry Ford, Henry Francis duPont
and Ima Hogg.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Gill bought his first antique, a lowboy once owned by
John Hancock. Over the next few decades he formed an exceptional
collection of primarily 17th-and 18th-century Boston, Federal and
Newport furniture. He was known for his eye and the beautiful
arrangement of the collection in his apartment, which also included
a widely admired kitchen that was lined floor to ceiling with 16th-
and 17th-century Dutch tile. In the late 1980s, Gill also began
collecting Chinese porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, the U.S government purchased two pieces from his
collection _ a small painting of the White House under construction
and a late federal card table _ that are still on display in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Gill endowed a research fellow scholarship at the
Henry Francis duPont Winterthur Museum in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's first wife, Caroline Townsend Chapman Gill, whom he
married in 1939, died in 1984. He is survived by his wife, Melanie;
a son from his first marriage, Peter Gill of Bronxville, and a
stepson, Jack Chapman of Fort Pierce, Fla.

 SMALL BUSINESS: Work Absences at Record High   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Unscheduled absenteeism by American workers is at an all-time high
and small businesses are hit the hardest, according to a new
survey.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until 1994, the absenteeism rate at firms with fewer than 100
employees was below the rate for all businesses, but it now is
higher, according to CCH Inc. of Riverwoods, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The yearly absenteeism rate for small business has soared 46
percent since 1994, from 5.4 missed days per employee to eight days
in 1998, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the average absenteeism rate for
businesses of all sizes climbed only 8 percent, from about 6.6 to
7.1 missed days per year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Absenteeism means unscheduled time off for any reason,
including sudden illness.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome than the numbers are the reasons for absenteeism:
More workers are missing work because of stress and because they
feel entitled to time off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a significant increase in the cost and occurrence
of unscheduled absences, and work-life conflicts increasingly are
the reason,'' said Paul Gibson, the CCH editor who conducted the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The survey covered 400 U.S. companies, with a total of 800,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  As the rate of absenteeism for small business soars, so does
the cost. CCH figures that unscheduled absences could cost small
businesses $1,044 per employee this year, or 38 percent more than
the $757 average for all businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I've had this year _ even more than
competition from Office Depot _ is absenteeism and tardiness,''
said Clifford Waldeck, who owns Waldeck's Office Supplies with
eight employees in San Francisco. ``I've had a full crew maybe 30
percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for small business is that the problems are
expected to get worse.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In 1995, the first year CCH began tracking the reasons for
absenteeism, nearly half of all unplanned time off was attributed
to personal illness. In the latest survey, only 22 percent of those
who canceled work said they were ill.
</P>
<P>
   Family issues such as a sick child or family emergency are the
biggest reason for unscheduled absences, cited 26 percent of the
time. But that has not changed much during the years.
</P>
<P>
   Personal needs was the reason given 20 percent of the time, but
that hasn't changed much either. CCH says the fastest-growing
reasons for missing work are stress and ``entitlement mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Stress was cited 16 percent of the time (and 20 percent of the
time in small businesses) this year, compared with just 6 percent
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Another 16 percent of employees at all companies (and 19 percent
of small-company workers) felt that they were entitled to skip
work.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can take several steps to alleviate stress and
unscheduled absences. These include job sharing, flexible
scheduling, leave for school functions, emergency child care and a
compressed workweek.
</P>
<P>
   But fewer small businesses than large businesses offer these
programs. Although the CCH study suggests that programs like flex
scheduling and compressed workweeks cost very little to establish,
many small businesses say cost isn't the main issue.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``For real small businesses with four or five people, it's
pretty much impossible to be flexible,'' said Scott Hauge,
president of Cal Insurance in San Francisco and chairman of the
California Small Business Association.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``We have 28 employees and give everyone but the
receptionist every other Friday off, and it's great for employee
morale,'' he noted. ``But for the owner of a company, it's a
nightmare because we're open five days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Gibson of CCH acknowledges that ``small companies often can't
be as generous'' as big businesses. ``But they can build a culture
that understands that people need flexibility,'' he said. For
example, he suggested trying not to schedule meetings at the start
of the day if workers have particular child care or commute
problems.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage for small businesses ``is they are not entrenched
and have the ability to change quickly,'' said Lynn Ware, founder
of Integral Training Systems, a 10-person Half Moon Bay consulting
firm. She suggests that companies large and small should ``think
about employees the same as customers.'' That means finding out
about their preferences and expectations early and trying to
balance their needs with those of the company and other workers.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say one of the best ways to control unscheduled absences
is to provide employees with paid time off, a bank of hours to be
used for various purposes rather than separate accounts for
vacation, sick leave or personal time.

 SMALL BUSINESS: New Plans Ease Retirement Burden   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
In a tight labor market like the present one, small businesses will
have to offer more generous retirement benefits if they hope to
compete for workers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to the Department of Labor, only about one-fifth of
the 5 million U.S. businesses that employ no more than 100 workers
provide employee retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, roughly two-thirds of businesses with more than 100
employees offer such plans.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that small-business proprietors have generally
steered away from retirement plans because they cost thousands of
dollars to set up and because they involve more paperwork than the
proprietors can handle.
</P>
<P>
   But as Secretary of Labor Alexis M. Herman has pointed out, a
new type of retirement plan established last year by Congress
eliminates these burdens. ``Providing these plans can be easier
than many businesspeople think,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The SIMPLE Plan
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In passing the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, Congress created a
retirement plan with the acronym SIMPLE _ for Savings Incentive
Match Plan for Employees.
</P>
<P>
   The SIMPLE plan, as its name implies, is the simplest retirement
option available to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   It is as free of paperwork and other bureaucratic entanglements
as a retirement plan can be and involves minimal or no startup
costs, notes Russ Orban of the Small Business Administration's
office of advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE plans can either be self-directed Individual Retirement
Accounts _ which allow the employees to manage their own
investments _ or 401(k) plans, in which the money is managed by an
institution, such as a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   The plans are available to any business with 100 or fewer
employees that does not already have a retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   To set up a SIMPLE plan, the business proprietor only has to
approach a bank, broker, mutual-fund group or other retirement-plan
administrator and fill out a single form, to be filed with the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   The plan administrator does all the remaining paperwork, keeping
the IRS informed over the years about all contributions,
withdrawals and other financial details.
</P>
<P>
   Options, Costs
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the San Francisco discount broker,
administers SIMPLE IRAs, but not SIMPLE 401(k)s, for small
businesses, says spokesman Glen Mathison.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE 401(k)s are administered by mutual-fund groups, such as
Fidelity Investments and other plan administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab will start up a SIMPLE IRA free of charge, but it then
charges the employee a $29 annual fee for accounts that contain
less than $10,000. Once the account reaches $10,000, the fee is
waived permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The main source of income for Schwab is the commissions it
charges when participants buy or sell securities in their SIMPLE
IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   All SIMPLE plans require employers to contribute to the
retirement fund. At the employer's discretion, employees can also
contribute to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible for the plan, an employee must have earned a
total of at least $5,000 from the employer in the previous two
years.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan excludes employee contributions, the employer must
put an amount equal to 2 percent of each eligible employee's salary
into the fund _ up to a maximum of $3,200 per employee per year.
</P>
<P>
   $6,000 Annual Limit
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  In plans that include employee contributions, the employee can
contribute up to $6,000 per year _ three times the $2,000 limit for
ordinary IRAs. Usually, the employer must match the employee
contributions dollar for dollar, up to a maximum of 3 percent of
the employee's total compensation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the employer can contribute as little as 1 percent of
the employee's compensation in two years out of any five-year span.
That rule is designed to allow the employer flexibility during
periods when the business may not be flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   Both employer and employee contributions _ along with any
investment gains _ become vested immediately. That means the money
can be withdrawn from the plan at any time. But an employee who
withdraws money before reaching age 591/2 will incur a tax penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty is 25 percent of any amount withdrawn during the
first two years that the employee participates in the plan, and 10
percent thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Further details about SIMPLE plans _ or other types of
retirement plans that may be suitable for small businesses _ can be
obtained by calling the Labor Department's Pension and Welfare
Benefits Administration at (800) 998-7542.
</P>
<P>
   Information about retirement plans is also available on that
agency's Web site at  &LR; www.dol.gov/dol/pwba/public/whatsnew &LR;

ADVERTISING: A DEPARTURE FOR ABSOLUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will an unusual ad for Absolut vodka carry the headline ``How
much is that bottle in the window?''
</P>
<P>
   Not really, of course, but the ad, which will begin appearing in
November issues of magazines, does represent a departure for the
well-known campaign for Absolut, the vodka brand distilled by Vin &AMP;
Sprit AB. The eye-catching ad, by the New York office of TBWA
Chiat/Day, is presented as a store window in progress; at the
center are the heads, hands, arms and legs of mannequins assembled
in the familiar shape of the Absolut bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The actual headline for the ad will be ``Absolut Doonan'' as in
Simon Doonan, whose quirky, sometimes provocative window displays
have helped generate a fashionably hip image for the retailer
Barneys New York, where he is creative director.
</P>
<P>
   The Absolut assemblage was produced by Doonan and his display
team for the ad and photographed in a Barneys window in late
August. In addition to the dummy bottle _ or bottle of dummies _
there are tools of a window trimmer's trade like a stepladder and
staple gun; blue Barneys shopping bags, and odd touches like a
statue of a bird, plastic food and a trumpet.
</P>
<P>
   The ad reflects efforts by TBWA Chiat/Day and Seagram Americas,
which imports Absolut, to freshen the formula for the long-running
campaign by broadening the definition of who can take part in the
series of pitches devoted to artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon is certainly an artist in his own right,'' said Richard
Lewis, worldwide account director for Absolut at TBWA Chiat/Day,
part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. ``His canvas
is windows and his metier is mannequins.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists series began in 1985, four years after the start of
the Absolut campaign, with an ad depicting an Absolut bottle
painted by Andy Warhol. The Doonan ad joins unconventional art ads
that include ``Absolut Isabell,'' for the floral and party designer
Robert Isabell; short, short stories by such writers as John Irving
and Arthur Golden, and a coming redesign of the Absolut Web site
(www.absolutvodka.com) focusing on club disk jockeys like Paul
Miller, known as DJ Spooky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another innovative way that Absolut is able to reach out
to its audience,'' said Jim Schleifer, marketing director for the
brand at the Seagram Americas unit of Seagram Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using these artists, we're trying to keep the brand on the
cutting edge with the early adapters,'' he added, using the
marketing term for consumers who seek out products ahead of the
masses. Such shoppers' buying behavior is often emulated by
mainstream consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep extending the boundaries from painters and
sculptors,'' Lewis said, ``to folk artists, fashion designers,
writers, photographers, architects, interior designers _ and now
window designers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a business proposition here as well,'' he added,
``because you're talking about people who are image makers and
taste formers.''
</P>
<P>
   Doonan, who joined Barneys in 1986 and has worked diligently to
keep the windows shining through the bankruptcy of parent Barney's
Inc., demurs at being included in those ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows are a really weird form of creative expression,'' he
said. ``Because they change every bloody week, it's hard to think
of anything more ephemeral. And they're a form of free
entertainment that is disappearing as retailers cut back on
promoting their images on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolut started off with a lot of hard-core `artists,''' he
added, ``so recognizing someone with one foot planted firmly in
commerce and the other in creative makes me proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Doonan pronounced himself ``very happy with the ad'' because
``it looks and feels like a Barneys window.'' That was, however,
not without its difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us two goes to get the shoulder of the Absolut bottle
right,'' Doonan said. ``The first time it looked like an English
milk bottle.'' (He ought to know, having been born in Reading,
England.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The idea for the ad came from discussions Doonan had with
Seagram about the book tour for his humorous autobiography,
``Confessions of a Window Dresser: Tales from a Life in Fashion,''
to be published next month by Penguin Studio and Callaway Editions
Inc. He has previously participated in Absolut promotional events
that included a Barneys window co-sponsored with Vogue magazine in
1996 and a recent fund-raiser to fight AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to watch windows being pulled together,'' Doonan
said. ``The idea is that the bottle grew out of a manic session
with a lot of crazed window dressers, in whose ranks I include
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Doonan is best known for the colorful Barneys Christmas windows
that simultaneously embrace and tweak self-promotional celebrities
from Madonna and Prince to Dolly Parton and Ivana Trump. Is a man
who so loves to throw a spanner, as the British call a wrench, into
the star-making machinery now stepping through the looking glass _
or window glass _ to embrace that which he cheekily sends up?
</P>
<P>
   Those who ``think I want to end up like Cindy Adams'' are wrong,
Doonan declared, adding: ``I'm a ninth-string celebrity. I don't
have a desire to self-promote other than for God's Love to get a
lot of money.'' His reference was to God's Love We Deliver, the
charity to which he will donate his royalties from the book.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain some of the stranger objects in the ad, Doonan
laughed and replied: ``A lot of them were lying around our display
studio. We put them in because people like to look at a window and
say `I wonder what that means.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, as Doonan put it, ``Sometimes a trumpet is just
a display prop.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Absolut Doonan'' ad is to appear in the November issues of
these magazines, Lewis said: Allure, Chicago Social, In Style,
Interview, New York, Out, Paper and W. Plans call for the ad to
return in January, after the annual Absolut holiday ad, in other
titles.

 SMALL BUSINESS: Beyond Basic Training   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
San Francisco's Job Network isn't your usual welfare-to-work
program. Indeed, it claims to be the only one in the country that
trains welfare recipients specifically for jobs in small business.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Most training programs place workers and forget them,'' said
Rich Gunn, an accountant with Burr, Pilger &AMP; Mayer and chairman of
the San Francisco Small Business Network. ``But that is a recipe
for disaster for small businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical entrepreneur has neither the time nor human
resources staff to provide counseling and other services for
workers coming off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Job Network comes in. Beyond basic training, it
promises graduates ``retention services'' for a year, including
personal counseling, help with child care and a free Municipal
Railway pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part for those moving from welfare to work is not
getting the job but keeping it,'' said Job Network program director
Amy Parkhurst. ``It is not enough to place someone in a job that
pays $6 an hour. We need to help them up the ladder, so that they
can support their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Aid to Small Businesses
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Job Network also provides some unusual assistance to small
businesses. To protect employers from higher unemployment insurance
costs if their new hires do not work out, Job Network will pay the
salaries of its graduates directly during a three-month probation
period and get reimbursed by the employer. This arrangement also is
designed to protect small businesses from potential
wrongful-termination lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Network, which represents 21 business groups,
set up the Job Network 15 months ago after consulting 300 of its
20,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The network formed an alliance with two organizations that have
substantial experience training new employees. Juma Ventures, a San
Francisco nonprofit that hires at-risk youth to work at two Ben &AMP;
Jerry's franchises, was tapped to train welfare-to-work
participants who are under age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish Vocational Services, a nonprofit job-training
organization, works with those over 30.
</P>
<P>
   The first Job Network class of 18 graduated from the six-week
training course three weeks ago, and the second class of 26, mostly
single mothers, began on Thursday. The goal is to turn out about
200 new workers a year.
</P>
<P>
   Building Hard, Soft Skills
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  On the first day of the new class, &UR;  &LR; Parkhurst talked about the
importance of getting to class and work on time _ one of many
``soft skills.'' After lunch, trainees split into teams to learn
``hard skills,'' such as what to do if someone wants to return an
item but no manager is around to approve it and other customers are
piling up at the checkout counter.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of potential trainees is expanding because welfare
reform, passed two years ago, limits people who are able to work to
five years of welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And businesses can receive up to $8,500 in tax credits for
hiring an employee off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Job Network gets $1 million a year in financing from big San
Francisco businesses, foundations and government grants.
</P>
<P>
   Another joint venture that is preparing public-assistance
recipients for jobs in small businesses as well as large companies
is San Francisco Works. This alliance of the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce, United Way and a group of large employers _ called the
Committee on Jobs _ aims to move 400 San Franciscans from welfare
to work each year.

 SMALL BUSINESS: Wooing Sought-After Professionals   By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
It's hard enough for small businesses to hire good sales clerks,
receptionists or office managers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What about the kinds of people who are tough to find even for
giant Fortune 500 companies _ executives and computer
professionals?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech jobs are the hardest for small businesses to fill,'' said
Rick Pflugradt of ProTemps Professional Personnel, an Oakland firm
that does recruiting for the insurance industry. ``That's
especially true in the (technology) management area, where
companies need people with enough hands-on technical experience to
lead other people.''
</P>
<P>
   People running small businesses or nonprofit agencies may
tremble these days at the thought of having to hire a new director
of operations or computer network manager.
</P>
<P>
   But personnel experts offer some tips to help land these
hard-to-find professionals:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take a close look at your organization's actual needs before
starting the hiring search. Maybe you don't really need a full-time
computer guru: You could get by with a consultant who steps in when
your clerical staff can't solve a technical problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest mistake people make is that somebody quits and
they just grab the old job description, throw it into an ad, and
cross their fingers,'' said Matthew O'Grady, associate director of
the Management Center, a San Francisco group that does human
resource consulting for nonprofits. ``Take a pause. Use the vacancy
to rethink what's needed, so the job will be current with the needs
of your organization.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't rely simply on help-wanted ads. Do a lot of personal
networking to dig up possible candidates. ``Call up a few
individuals in the field you're trying to fill, and say, `I've got
this position, do you know anyone who might be interested,'''
O'Grady said. ``Then call up the people they mention and tell them
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Try calling local colleges _ their academic departments as well
as their job placement offices. ``I often call the head of the
computer science departments at Golden Gate University or San Jose
State and ask them if they know of recent grads who might be
available,'' said Gae Shulman, president of the Portable Personnel
Department, which provides human resources help to small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the Internet. Some help-wanted sites on the Web charge
employers to list positions. But others don't.
</P>
<P>
   Look around to find a career site &LR;   &LR; that focuses on people with
the skills you're seeking. Or use  &LR; www.dejanews.com &LR;  to find
discussion groups that attract people with those skills _ and post
a note there about your opening.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for people who bigger companies may be overlooking _ such
as older computer experts. ``There are lot of 40-plus computer
people who with a little retraining could be terrific,'' Shulman
said.
</P>
<P>
   You can post your opening with Forty Plus, a job-networking
group for older workers at (510) 430-2400. Or post it with
Experience Unlimited, a state-funded program that provides job
search help for unemployed professionals: Call (510) 563-5310 for
the number of your local office or visit  &LR; www.caljobs.ca.gov &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Another often-overlooked candidate pool includes people who want
part-time work or flexible schedules. Working Options is a San
Francisco recruiting firm that specializes in placing such people,
at salaries sometimes lower than the market rate. It can be reached
at (415) 835-9466.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider using a recruiting firm or personnel consultant to
help with your search _ especially if you have little experience in
the hiring process.
</P>
<P>
   The Management Center offers a search service that fills
top-level nonprofit jobs that pay $75,000 or less, at (415)
362-9735. Other small businesses can get referrals to recruiters
through the Northern California Human Resources Association at
(415) 291-1992.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most important, play to your strengths as a small business
when trying to woo candidates. You'll never have the hiring budget
or glamour of a Fortune 500 company, but you have other assets in
your organizational culture.
</P>
<P>
   You can offer an open management style with little bureaucracy.
You can offer a sense of adventure and entrepreneurship. You can
offer family oriented benefits such as flexible schedules,
telecommuting or extra time off. You can offer work that's
technically challenging or that allows individuals to make an
immediate difference. You may even be able to offer an actual
equity stake in the company to your key hires.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman plays up such strengths in help-wanted ads for her
clients that say things like ``Tired of working for only the
giants?''
</P>
<P>
   Other personnel managers have had success with similar
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to lure people at salaries that are 10 to 15
percent below market, provided I could offer a management style
that gave them a sense of ownership of their jobs.'' said Larry
Bienati, CEO of Consultants to Management, a Concord human
resources consulting firm.

COMMENTARY: LIFE'S TWISTS AND TURNS FOR 2 ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their seasons turn. Their teams change. Their roles reverse. But
in the middle of another New York October baseball parable, two
inescapable names, Doc and Darryl, continue to run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry, the Yankees' motivating angel.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden, the Cleveland Indians' tentative Game 4 starter
in the American League Championship Series, or potential long man
out of the bullpen Tuesday night in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   They met 15 years ago, an eternity in sports, yet much of the
abundant mail he still receives from the New York area, Gooden
said, reflects on Doc and Darryl, on a fairy tale that so many
times has been rudely interrupted by real life.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is precisely the point, the explanation for our
underlying fascination with two very public lives which have mixed
stunning success with spectacular failure. Maybe we don't mind
human frailty in our so-called heroes as much as some people think.
As long as they don't give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I ask myself about that,'' Gooden said Monday at
Yankee Stadium. ``The fans here stuck with me, and there have been
times, like 1987 and 1994, when they could have easily said,
`What's up with this guy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is exactly what was said, over and over, about
Gooden and Strawberry, those flawed former Mets bookends, who have
been impeached by the critics so many times. Late in their baseball
lives, they were welcomed back by New York's fans, whose opinions
always mattered more than the news media mob. ``I wish I could
shake every one of their hands personally,'' Gooden said.
</P>
<P>
   He is cast as the enemy this time, but a year ago, Gooden sat on
the Yankee bench in Jacobs Field, Mariano Rivera trying to protect
his one-run lead, one out in the eighth, Sandy Alomar at the plate.
Gooden, without a post-season victory to his credit, watched Alomar
smoke the ball into the right-field seats. The Yankees never got
the lead back in that series, a subject revisited so many times in
their clubhouse Monday that Paul O'Neill finally said, ``A lot of
people in here are getting tired of hearing about last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Seasons turn. Teams change. Roles reverse. ``Sandy's shown me
that tape a couple of times,'' Gooden said, able to laugh off his
new teammate's needle. ``I'm just sitting there in the dugout,
shaking my head. Sandy just had that magic all season and in the
playoffs last year.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Alomar hit .235 with 6 home runs and 44 RBIs. This
season, the magic has aligned itself with the Yankees, 117 times
and counting.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Strawberry didn't make it into the playoffs, knee
surgery taking him out in September. Gooden, a strong second-half
pitcher this season, said he had pictured the setting of their
post-season reunion: Yankee Stadium, him on the mound, Strawberry
at the plate. Then last Wednesday night, Gooden heard that
Strawberry was on his way to the hospital, ultimately to an
operating table Saturday for colon cancer surgery.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke the next night, Gooden telling Strawberry he was
praying for him and Strawberry teasing Gooden about his
first-inning ejection in Game 2 of the Indians' division series
against Boston. Gooden called New York's reaction to Strawberry's
illness touching. He said he would visit Strawberry Tuesday. They
have both fought drug abuse, and who knows what detours lie ahead,
but who would have thought a few years ago that Strawberry would
ever be a repository of so much compassion and love?
</P>
<P>
   Seasons turn. People change. For so many years, Gooden got the
benefit of doubt that Strawberry couldn't buy. When Strawberry's
agent, the late Bill Goodstein, floated the Yankees' interest in
1995, the local sports pages erupted as if George Steinbrenner had
sold the team to Saddam Hussein. President Clinton's drug czar, Lee
Brown, complained of (hah!) poor messages being sent to kids.
</P>
<P>
   The following season, Gooden signed with the Yankees, pitched a
no-hitter in May and was handed the keys to New York by its
Yankee-fawning Mayor. From that night on, right through Frank
Torre's heart transplant, you knew the Yankees had more than a
25-man roster working for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it makes it easier for Darryl to sleep when we win
games,'' Tino Martinez said Monday, wishing out loud that he could
``hit three home runs'' Tuesday night for Strawberry, before adding
that there are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   There is only a sense of things to come, a prediction of the
heart that Gooden, in a way, will be pitching against Strawberry in
this series after all.
</P>
<P>
   Seasons turn. Roles reverse. Yanks in five.

 SMALL BUSINESS: Wanted: New Hires _ Firms Find Talent
Among  Disabled, Welfare Recipients   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Clifford Waldeck used to fill openings at his office supply store
in San Francisco by hiring friends of his employees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Now they all have jobs,'' said the small-business owner, who
has hired three employees off of welfare.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Waldeck and other small-business
employers have felt the brunt of hiring pains in a tight labor
market. After all, they traditionally have provided two-thirds of
U.S. workers with their first jobs and initial training,
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. unemployment rate rose a tad in September _ to 4.6
percent from 4.5 percent the previous month. The California jobless
rate is about a point higher but is still near a seven-year low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiring has always been the bane of small business owners,''
said Rosalie Bulach, owner of Name.Finders, a San Francisco mailing
list broker. ``We are trainers to the whole world. We hire them,
and they stay just long enough to learn a skill before moving on to
larger businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the importance of finding, training and retaining
new employees, workforce development was one of 10 areas of focus
at the first San Francisco Small Business Forum that convened three
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses still tap the new crop of high school, trade
school and college graduates. They hire from friends and foes and
sometimes temp agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, they are turning to those who are on
welfare and who are physically and mentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Getting those on government assistance into the workforce has
been especially important since the passage of welfare-to-work
legislation two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans are feeling the heat to get off government
assistance. As a result, many government and private training
programs have been established to help them make the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Hill was on welfare last year when she enrolled in
Goodwill's program to learn computer skills. For the past 14
months, she has worked at Cal Insurance, a San Francisco insurance
brokerage, where she started as a receptionist and, last month, was
promoted to administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's given me an opportunity to learn about insurance and
create a career for myself,'' said Hill. ``The only real negative
is being away from my kids, who are 12 and 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal Insurance President Scott Hauge just hired another
welfare-to-work graduate from another program, Job Network, which
specifically trains new workers for small-business jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most training programs teach you the right buzzwords, how to
dress and react during an interview,'' said Bulach, who has hired
several ``people at risk'' at her 20-person firm and participated
in the city's recent forum. She said Job Network and several other
programs go the essential next step and offer their graduates a
range of support services from counseling to child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of folks on the margins of the labor market, the
main issue is not whether they can get a job, but whether they can
keep it,'' added Jed Emerson, executive director of the Roberts
Enterprise Development Fund, which is financed by George Roberts of
the leveraged buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis &AMP; Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of support is needed because excitement about the
initial placement wears off after a few weeks,'' Emerson added.
``Child care, transportation and other problems can make everything
unravel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roberts fund ( &LR; www.redf.org &LR; ) tries to provide that kind of
support to Bay Area nonprofit organizations that help provide
employment to very low-income and formerly homeless individuals.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new report from the Welfare to Work Partnership
in Washington, D.C., 300 companies that participated in its job
creation program rated former welfare recipients ``good, productive
employees'' 79 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The survey identifies nine practices that significantly help
companies retain workers hired off of welfare. In order of
importance, they are transportation, child care, high performance
standards, quality training programs, one-on-one attention (mentor
programs), medical benefits, career path opportunities, and
partnerships with community/nonprofit and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   To help ensure that their graduates make it in the work world,
an increasing number of job training programs operate their own
business incubators, where recruits can learn about business in a
controlled and monitored way.
</P>
<P>
   Training programs with in-house businesses have been designed to
train disabled as well as disadvantaged Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as many as two-thirds of the 15 million Americans
classified as disabled do not work, although many would like to.
New training programs, therapies and technology are steering many
of them into the workforce, and fewer than one in three need
special equipment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Community Vocational Enterprises of San Francisco
helps about 300 individuals with psychiatric disabilities re-enter
the workforce each year. After training, it places many of them at
its own businesses, which include cafes, janitorial and messenger
delivery services, for up to a year. Then it helps match them with
other employers.
</P>
<P>
   In the training process, CVE and other organizations are as
strict as mainstream businesses in insisting that workers show up
on time and are otherwise dependable. ``Up to 70 percent of our
people keep jobs six to nine months,'' said CVE employment
specialist Daryl Henline.
</P>
<P>
   One happy CVE graduate, who asked to be identified only as J.S.,
is taking drugs to treat schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive
disorders and, for the past three months, has worked as a cashier
at a Rite Aid pharmacy in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working at CVE cafes for a year, I learned not to be afraid of
customers or panic because of a long line,'' said J.S. ``It was a
good laboratory, and now I serve about 200 customers a day and have
never been late or missed a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who run nonprofit organizations also are turning to the
new labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to find telemarketing workers,'' said Sam
Schuchat, executive director of the California League of
Conservation Voters, a nonprofit group that needs such workers to
make phone calls to solicit money and support for its political
candidates and causes.
</P>
<P>
   He just hired Alejo Hernandez, who is visually impaired and
requires special computer and optical character recognition
software to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   But getting the equipment hasn't been a problem. Several
agencies, including San Francisco Vocational Services, Lighthouse
for the Blind and AccessAbility are providing equipment and
training for Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   After one week on the job, Hernandez said, ``It's a challenge,
but I like it.''

 SMALL BUSINESS: Banks Battle for Customers   By Sam Zuckerman  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Wells Fargo customer Celia Ruiz has gone through the disruption of
one bank merger. Now it's happening again, and Ruiz, partner of a
six-attorney law firm in San Francisco, is dreading it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Wells bought downstate rival First Interstate two years
ago, she no longer had a banker assigned to her firm's account.
When she had questions about the firm's credit line, she had to
telephone a call center where people unfamiliar with her business
fielded inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally experienced a deterioration in service,'' Ruiz
said. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Now, said Ruiz, Wells Fargo's imminent merger with Minneapolis
banking giant Norwest Corp. ``makes me even more nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank mergers can be tough on customers, especially small
businesses. As branches are closed, employees fired or moved and
computers reprogrammed, service often suffers. After a merger,
banks may adopt new polices, products and prices, which may not be
as attractive as the old offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers Not All Bad
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  That does not mean huge bank mergers are always bad for
small-business customers. In the aftermath, small businesses are
still left with the basic choice of service or price.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller banks tend to provide higher levels of service than
bigger banks, including direct communication with decisionmakers.
But bigger bankers usually offer better loan terms and a wider
variety of deposit accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping small-business customers is crucial for smaller banks,
which lack scale to compete in the corporate and mass consumer
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, mergers do not change the fact that all banks target
small businesses that are well established, profitable and large
enough to qualify for credit. Businesses not deemed creditworthy
may have to rely on alternative forms of financing or draw on the
owner's personal ability to get credit.
</P>
<P>
   Surge of Sales Calls
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  One thing small businesses can expect in the next few months
is a surge of sales calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for local banks to step forward,''
said accountant Rich Gunn, chairman of the San Francisco Small
Business Network, an umbrella organization representing 21 business
groups.
</P>
<P>
   San Rafael's Westamerica, which makes a point of knowing where
its small business prospects bank &UR; ,  &LR; is targeting customers of Bank
of America, which just completed its merger with North Carolina's
NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   The Mechanics &UR;  &LR; Bank, based in Richmond, is running radio spots
that ask whether listeners know the name of their bankers.
``There's a lot of turmoil. That's when we get our best
customers,'' said Nino Petroni, a regional vice president with the
Mechanics Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Bank of San Francisco caused a stir months ago when
it draped a banner reading ``We're Not Moving to North Carolina''
in front of its Pine Street office.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the bank mailed a newsletter to some 15,000 Bay
Area businesses appealing to them to ``keep your money in the
city'' as other banks ``merge with out-of-town institutions or move
their headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Bank is offering restaurant gift certificates to
customers who open business checking or money market accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping people have had enough of the larger banks,''
said Lynda Graham-Helwig, Commercial Bank's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America and Wells Fargo say they will fight to keep
small-business customers but would not provide details.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Wells admits that its service to its small-business customers
suffered after it bought First Interstate. ``We really learned our
lesson,'' said Wells business banking chief Michael James. ``The
most important thing we intend to do is take care of the daily
needs of our small business customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America is assigning ``relationship managers'' to work
one-on-one with its most-profitable small-business customers, says
Barbara Desoer, the bank's Northern California retail banking
chief. The managers' pay depends partly on their success in keeping
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers ``create the perception of vulnerability,'' Desoer says.
``We know the competition will try to fuel that perception.''  &LR;

 SMALL BUSINESS: Web Sites Cater to Women With Startups   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Female entrepreneurs now have a new network of sorts to get their
businesses off the ground. Small-business Web sites for women are
big on the Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are prominent home pages that offer advice and contacts on
how to jump-start a startup and keep that venture profitable. No
surprise there, industry experts point out, since nearly half of
the Net's users are women today, compared with just 10 percent a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Women own more than 8 million businesses in the United States
that employ 18.5 million people and generate $2.3 trillion in
sales, according to the National Foundation for Women Business
Owners in Silver Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The Web is particularly well suited for entrepreneurs because it
provides low-cost communication, information and networking.
</P>
<P>
   `A Great Connector'
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Because a lot of women start businesses from home, the
Internet is a great connector and equalizer,'' said Ellen Pack,
founder of San Mateo's Women.com Networks ( &LR; www.women.com &LR; ), a Web
portal that is home to six small-business sites.
</P>
<P>
   Women.com Network's properties include MoneyMode and Women's
Wire, which ``give women the tools and resources to start a
company, raise money and acquire office equipment,'' said Laurie
Kretchmar, editor-in-chief of Women's Wire.
</P>
<P>
   Another useful site is WomenConnect.com
( &LR; www.womenconnect.com &LR; ), a McLean, Va., service for female
business owners and professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Started on Prodigy in 1994, it offers tips on handling debt and
equity capital issues (most women finance startups on credit
cards), and a free directory of female business owners for
networking purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, WomenConnect.com creates Web sites for nonprofit,
membership-based professional women's business organizations,
according to Gary LaFever, senior vice president of business
development.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, iVillage.com: The Women's Network
( &LR; www.ivillage.com &LR; ), takes the approach of creating Web
communities. It pulls women together through a variety of e-mail,
chat rooms, message boards and content sections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our users want expert advice on what businesses to
start and how to finance a business,'' said iVillage producer
Shelley Pyne-Hanley. ``We point them in the right direction and
offer a nurturing online environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile New York company has received backing from
America Online, the Tribune Co. and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers, the influential Menlo Park venture-capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   Sites to Explore
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Other notable Web sites for female business owners:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Women's Work &LR;  ( &LR; wwork.com &LR;   &LR; / &LR; ) boasts plenty of resources for
job seekers, including employment opportunities, a software program
that allows people to electronically post resumes, and a listing of
women's business organizations from California to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Business Women's Network &LR; 
( &LR; www.tpag.com/BWN/publications.html &LR; ) hawks publications for the
serious female entrepreneur, ranging from the Business Women's
Network Directory 1998-1999 ($110) to the Business Women's Update
Newsletter ($18 a year), a bimonthly calendar of events.

 SMALL BUSINESS: Renting Software on the Web   By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
For Bob Curry, renting software is cheaper than buying.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curry figures he has shaved as much as 75 percent off the cost
of setting up team projects for his small Internet design and
advertising firm by renting software via the Web.
</P>
<P>
   And in the six months since Curry's firm, EmpowerNet Corp. of
Chicago, has used rental applications, business has doubled. Curry
said EmpowerNet gained customer referrals based on its success
using rental applications to quickly set up creative teams of
far-flung graphic artists and advertising representatives for a
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can just go out there and rent it and get it running in
a day, it makes more sense'' than hiring technical personnel to
design and set up a system, Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; EmpowerNet's experience illustrates what some analysts say is
an emerging trend toward the use of rentable applications by small
and medium-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
   These so-called ``rental apps'' are rented or leased for a set
period of time or specific purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Standard business software like Microsoft Office, which is
needed all the time, isn't a good candidate for renting. Programs
tailored for specific tasks like a special event planner or Year
2000 problem-checker are better suited for rent rather than for
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And rental app proponents believe smaller companies will want
the same features from the latest accounting, payroll or sales
programs used by major corporations, but not the high cost of
buying the software.
</P>
<P>
   Need to Hire Techs Reduced
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  By renting, firms can avoid the cost of hiring in-house
computer technicians to maintain the programs or of buying new
hardware to run the software.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the actual software and data are stored by a
third-party company, such as a software-maker or Internet service
provider that administers and updates the software for a fee. The
firm renting the software accesses it through the Internet. When
the rental period expires, so does an access code.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  It is similar, they say, to a driver renting a car for a trip
without worrying about paying for an oil change or tuneup down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the rental applications market is part of a rapidly
growing business trend to outsource work or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.,
predicts the market for rental apps will balloon from practically
nothing this year to $6.4 billion annually by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to make large producers of corporate software like
Oracle Corp. and PeopleSoft sit up and take notice.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft, in fact, today will announce a new strategy to
market Web-based rentable applications and other outsourcing
services to medium and small companies.
</P>
<P>
   That will be a new target for the Pleasanton company, which has
grown dramatically on the strength of its human resources and other
business software for large corporations that can afford higher
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Renting apps will let PeopleSoft ``appeal economically to a
group of buyers who would not have been interested in our
products,'' said John Haworth, PeopleSoft's director of
outsourcing.
</P>
<P>
   General Ledger Program Online
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Two weeks ago, Oracle Corp. of Redwood Shores launched a
similar pilot venture called Oracle Business OnLine, attempting to
lure smaller companies with programs like Oracle's general ledger
accounting software.
</P>
<P>
   A big company with 30 to 50 users would pay about $200,000 just
for a onetime license for that program. Annual maintenance costs
for such software typically amount to a third of the license cost,
and that is on top of hardware and tech personnel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're targeting small to medium-sized companies who we found
have as complex requirements as large companies, but less
capability of running these applications,'' said Don Haig, vice
president of Oracle Business OnLine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Netcom On-Line Communication Services of San Jose is planning
to forge partnerships with software vendors, so the Internet
service provider can host software rental services. Mike Kallet,
Netcom's senior vice president for operations engineering, said a
human resources resume-tracking program costing $150,000 would be
too much for many small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But for a rental fee of $2,500 a month, ``and you can rent it
tomorrow, it becomes somewhat of a no-brainer decision,'' said
Kallet.
</P>
<P>
   For competitive reasons, Curry wouldn't detail exactly how much
EmpowerNet has saved by renting Lotus Corp.'s Instant Teamroom.
With the program, EmpowerNet can link teams formed from its 45
staff members with some of the 400 independent contractors who are
based in far-flung time zones, including San Francisco, the
Philippines and Germany and collaborate online on one project.
</P>
<P>
   And when the project ends, Curry just ends the rental.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have time to buy hardware and try to connect
different servers,'' Curry said. ``We've made a decision that from
now on, this is the only way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A major drawback so far, though, is that there are only a few
rentable apps currently available.
</P>
<P>
   Rental Apps Web Site
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Interliant Inc., a Houston Internet services firm from whom
Curry rents Instant Teamroom, just launched a new rental apps Web
site with a catalog of five programs for rent. Those include a
program to assess a company's Year 2000 problem liabilities, one to
track and manage resumes, and one to link various parties involved
in a real estate deal.
</P>
<P>
   Interliant hopes to have as many as 50 programs from different
vendors available by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aiming at small to medium-sized businesses that desire
to escape from the hassles of setting up their own infrastructure
and then find and keep high-priced information technology staff,''
said Interreliant marketing director Mark Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Rappaport, an analyst with Zona Research of Redwood
City, said the idea of rental software is still little more than a
``marketing pitch'' from companies like Oracle and Lotus that have
catered to major corporations and are now trying to ``move down the
food chain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not seen scores and scores of businesses running out
to this market yet,'' Rappaport said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the success of rental apps will depend on what programs
are made available, whether they are useful to small and
medium-size firms, and whether those firms will rent over and over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport still questions whether small businesses will entrust
their sensitive internal data to someone else's server.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have compared this to (the question of) do you buy
or lease a car,'' Rappaport said. ``All you leave in a rental car
is some lint and the radio set to your favorite station.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a business that is very concerned about security and is
very comfortable with the notion of a firewall surrounding
everything, I don't think this is going to be the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a good idea? That isn't going to be answered next
year, it's going to be answered in the year after that,'' Rappaport
said. ``We're a year or two out before we actually see some meat on
the skeleton.''

 Alza Buying Sequus for $580 Million   By Rebecca Smith  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Alza Corp. said yesterday it will buy its neighbor Sequus
Pharmaceuticals in a $580 million stock-swap deal intended to speed
the development and deployment of powerful new cancer-fighting
drugs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Menlo Park, Calif.-based Alza, which is roughly 10 times as big
as Sequus, is paying a healthy 60 percent premium for the smaller
Palo Alto company.
</P>
<P>
   What does Sequus have that Alza wants enough to orchestrate its
first acquisition?
</P>
<P>
   It's not earnings. The company hasn't turned a quarterly profit
in its 17-year history.
</P>
<P>
   What Sequus possesses is two valuable cancer products coveted by
Alza.
</P>
<P>
   The first is Doxil, a cancer-attacking drug that garnered FDA
approval to be marketed for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's
sarcoma in November 1995. It now shows promise for treating breast
and ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The second is Sequus' Stealth drug-delivery system that enhances
the effectiveness of cancer-fighting drugs and reduces negative
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   It does so by encapsulating tumor-fighting agents in fat
globules that enter the body through intravenous drips. They remain
in the body's internal ``freeway'' system until they reach
``off-ramps'' _ the naturally leaky sites of fast-growing cancer
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Stealth system drops its payload into cancer cells,'' said
I. Craig Henderson, chief executive of Sequus and a nationally
known breast cancer physician and oncology researcher at the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Stealth system enables chemotherapy drugs to bypass
healthy tissue, patients are spared debilitating side effects such
as hair loss, nausea and heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said he believes the therapy has promise in the
treatment of infections, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Mario, chief executive of Alza, said he began talking
with Henderson two years ago about cooperating in the war against
cancer. The discussions graduated into merger talks earlier this
year when Sequus directors concluded they needed the support of a
larger, better-capitalized partner.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Sequus had cumulative losses of $180 million.
Alza, by contrast, has been generally profitable with products
focused on oncology and urology. Its sales have gone from $6
million in 1993 to roughly $50 million last year. They're expected
to more than double this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sequus has been getting close to turning the corner, and a big
company like Alza could help that,'' said Alex Zisson,
biotechnology analyst for Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in New York. ``It looks
like a good strategic fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisson expects the companies to trim sales costs by combining
sales forces. That would triple the number of salespeople marketing
Sequus products.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Doxil alone are expected to top $45 million this year.
Analysts believe the drug could generate sales of at least $100
million within a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's potentially a very important anti-cancer drug,'' said
Louis Webb, pharmaceutical analyst for Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   As a midsize pharmaceutical company with a market capitalization
of $3.7 billion, Alza has the resources Sequus needs, Henderson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years from now, Alza should be an oncology leader,'' said
Alza's Mario, a physical chemistry Ph.D. ``We are dedicated to
reaching that goal with Sequus and willing to invest heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Alza will swap 0.4 shares of its stock for each share of
Sequus stock. Based on Friday's closing price of $42.43 for Alza,
the company is paying $16.98 for each share of Sequus stock.
</P>
<P>
   Alza shares fell $2.50 yesterday to $39.94 amid concern that it
might be paying too much for a company with unproven products.
Sequus rose $3.19 to $14.06.

 Keeping Your E-Mail Address From Spammers   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Q:  I've been getting more and more junk e-mail lately. Can you 
 tell me where these spammers are getting my address, and is 
 there anything I can do to protect my privacy? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; There are several ways a Web site can get your e-mail
address. It can ask you for it as part of an information form
required to receive an online service. Or it can plant a ``cookie''
in your system that transmits your address every time you visit a
certain Web page. Unless a Web site states up front that it won't
sell your address, nothing prevents it from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   A good way to prevent dissemination of personal information is
to use an anonymous Web-surfing service such as Anonymizer
( &LR; www.anonymizer.com &LR; ) or Lucent Personal Web Assistant
( &LR; www.lpwa.com &LR; ). They act as middlemen between your browser and
the Web, replacing your e-mail address and IP address with
anonymous ones. Lucent's service is free, but Anonymizer, which has
some extra security features, costs $15 for three months. (You can
try it for free, however.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I've been thinking about getting a digital camera, mostly &LR; 
 &LR; because it would let me send photos of my kids to my parents, &LR; 
 &LR; who live on the East Coast. But the wide choice of cameras is a &LR; 
 &LR; little daunting. They run from $200 to more than $1,000, and &LR;   &LR; the
technology is bewildering. Is there a way to get advice on &LR;   &LR; buying
one? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; A good source of information on digital cameras and
computer products is  &LR; www.computershopper.com/, &LR;  a Web site run by
Ziff-Davis. There's a how-to-buy guide, plus info on different
brands of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   If you want my advice (or even if you don't), the first things
to look for in a digital camera are the level of picture resolution
and the quality of the lens. Entry-level cameras have a resolution
of 640-by-480, which isn't really enough for sharp pictures on a
computer screen and is much less than you need if you plan to print
your photos. Insist on at least 1024-by-768, which is now widely
available on cameras costing more than $500.
</P>
<P>
   The lens is equally important. Less-expensive cameras often use
plastic lenses, and even the glass lenses on some high-end models
are tiny compared with the lens on a P4''ZAN)Q%w &QC;  &QL; i}w;&AMP;W &UR; s.

IN WRIGHT, YANKEES SEE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The boyish Jaret Wright digs surfing and hip
sideburns and stands before you with the kind of pudgy cheeks that
grandmothers would take a number to pinch. This is where the
innocence ends.
</P>
<P>
   In many corners of the Yankee clubhouse, Wright is viewed as
more nasty than naive, more reckless than rambunctious. The
animosity toward him has less to do with Wright's overnight success
against the Yankees in the division series last year than with a
spring-training incident that still elicits shudders.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, the Indians' right-hander whipped a fastball
high and inside that broke Luis Sojo's left hand when he ducked.
Sojo stood in front of his locker Monday afternoon _ a day before
Wright's Game _ 1 start for the Cleveland Indians against the
Yankees in the American League Championship Series _ and knew
exactly what he would tell Wright face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `If you've got a problem with me, let's go at it,'''
Sojo said. ``You don't throw at people's heads. I think you have to
be a little cocky on the mound. You've got to intimidate because
that's the only way to be a success. But I don't think that has
anything to do with hitting people in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 22, Wright has already managed to get under the Yankees'
pinstripes. With Sojo in his memory, Paul O'Neill was inflamed by
Wright on June 19. After being hit with a pitch inside, O'Neill
berated Wright as he trotted to first base.
</P>
<P>
   Just the mention of what happened to Sojo left the Yankee
starter David Wells Monday to offer his disdain for pitchers who
``headhunt.''.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of this scorn, Wright did not try to make peace
Monday, offering only a defiant response and a shrug of his broad
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not much I can say,'' he said. ``I am out there to do
my job. I don't think we need to turn this into anything more than
it is. This is about the third time I have been asked about whether
I am hitting people or not. I am out there trying to get outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is baseball, you know; people get hit sometimes. But it is
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is something to the Yankees. Tuesday night, they will not be
staring at the same charming kid who wandered onto the mound as a
fresh-faced unknown one year ago and dismantled the Yankees with an
overpowering fastball in Games 2 and 5 of the championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Wright has had his troubles since then. Although he went 2-1
against the Yankees this season _ one of only four pitchers to beat
them twice _ Wright has not had a sterling first full year in the
majors. For a while, Wright appeared to be basking in the glow of
his playoff triumphs last year. In April, his earned run average
ballooned to 6.23. Once Bartolo Colon began to blossom, Wright,
perhaps feeling a little threatened, found a focus to go 6-1 until
hitting another slide in July.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's sluggish ending to the season carried over against
Boston in Game 1 of the division series. Wright pitched four and a
third innings, and gave up six runs in Cleveland's only loss
against Boston. In that game, Wright hit Darren Lewis on the helmet
with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaret doesn't need to give up those three-run home runs,''
Manager Mike Hargrove said. ``That would help. When he threw
against Boston, he was behind a lot and his fastball was up.''
</P>
<P>
   That drifting fastball races toward a hitter at speeds of 98
miles an hour, a fact that is at the heart of the Yankees' quarrel
with Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaret is a power pitcher,'' Hargrove said. ``For Jaret to be
effective, he has to pitch inside. I certainly don't think that we
should all get carried away in dragging out old grudges.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the swirl around his pitcher, Wright is Hargrove's only
option to start Game 1. Normally a pitcher who finished the season
12-10 with a 4.72 e.r.a. is not the first one dropped in on a
championship series. But the Indians have no ace. Time after time,
they have failed to land a No. 1 pitcher for their rotation. Randy
Johnson, Roger Clemens and Pedro Martinez have all escaped them.
</P>
<P>
   So it's up to Wright. He has stood undaunted before the Yankees
before in the playoffs, and done so again in the regular season.
Last year, he was the boyish unknown. This time, the Yankees know
him all too well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just win, and that will be the best revenge,'' Sojo said.
``Score runs, and win.'' &QL;

ON FOOTBALL: PARCELLS LIFTS THE BAR AS DEFENSE DOES JOB
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You, too? Were you thinking that Bill Parcells took two years
away from football after winning Super Bowl XXV with the Giants in
1991 with grit and defense and a running game and then watched too
much television? Heck, he was on TV. As a football analyst.
Watching the 49ers and the Bills and the West Coast offense and the
no-huddle offense. It was as if the guy discovered something in
football during that two-year television stint _ the passing game
and lots of points _ and decided, hey, I'm going to try that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   His teams in New England with Drew Bledsoe threw the ball.
Bledsoe even threw it 48 times in the Patriots' Super Bowl XXXI
loss to Green Bay. Last year, Parcells took over the Jets and ran
it 431 times and passed it 564. His defense was becoming second
fiddle to his offense. In half their games a year ago, the Jets
allowed 20 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   This season began with a 36-30 overtime loss in San Francisco.
The Jets entered the game against Miami last Sunday ranked 30th in
overall defense. There are only 30 National Football League teams.
Translation: The Jets entered dead last, the worst in allowing
offensive yards. A closer look revealed a No. 27 ranking against
the run and a No. 26 against the pass. Lots of yards does not
always mean lots of points, but be honest _ you were waiting for
that 101-100 Jets game, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, keep waiting. There is good news for the Jets that goes
beyond their 20-9 victory over the Dolphins a Giants Stadium. The
Jets showed they are quite capable of playing real defense.
Suffocating defense. Three-plays-and-a-punt defense. Run-stopping
defense. Turnover-producing defense.
</P>
<P>
   Since those 36 points by the 49ers, the Jets' defense allowed 17
in losing to Baltimore and 6 in beating Indianapolis and now 9 to
Miami. Better and better. The Jets took on a Miami challenge, a
Miami insistence that it would run the ball, and declared: No, you
will not.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets played the run first, played the pass second and stared
Dan Marino down.
</P>
<P>
   Risky business.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets made it work. The players made it work. Bill
Belichick, the defensive coordinator, made it work.
</P>
<P>
   It says something that the Jets are missing three key players _
linebackers Marvin Jones (knee), Casey Dailey (foot) and James
Farrior (knee) _ and can still play good defense. Well, maybe what
it says is that is why three of the team's current top-five
tacklers play in the secondary. Only Farrior will return this
season. And yet, the Jets have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   They swarmed to the ball against the Dolphins _ linebackers Mo
Lewis and Pepper Johnson, tackle Jason Ferguson and safety Victor
Green each made five tackles _ and they produced three Marino
sacks. Before that, the Jets had earned only three sacks in three
games. The coverage was good and the third-down defense was better,
and a team that planned to run its way to victory found that it
could gain only one rushing first down while the Jets gained eight.
</P>
<P>
   So, you look today and the Jets have leaped from 30th to 21st in
overall defense in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   They have soared from 27th against the run to 20th. From 26th
against the pass to 22nd.
</P>
<P>
   All in a day's work.
</P>
<P>
   And Parcells looks as if he were finding his way home.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he is playing with the hand he dealt himself and he
has only been on the job with the Jets for 20 games. Let's see
whether he can build a defensive gem, as he did with his teams of
old. True, there are no L.T.'s in football right now. But there are
play-making defensive players in college and among NFL free agents.
Will the Jets collect them? Will they become, truly, more
defensive-minded than offensive? And will they ultimately find a
combination of defense and offense that clicks?
</P>
<P>
   Dominating defense _ that was the identity of Parcells' earlier
teams. And that was how the Jets played Miami, with the Jets'
offense being employed in complementary fashion with 38 rushes and
32 passes. Not the 24 rushes and 58 passes the Jets used against
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick deserves credit for devising and implementing the
Jets' defensive ideas. He is crafty, hard-working. He challenges
offenses in his play-calling and he challenges his players by
putting them in positions to make game-winning or back-breaking
plays. He picks his spots. He picks his players carefully in terms
of who gets what. And he studies.
</P>
<P>
   He had two weeks to prepare for the Dolphins and he attacked
them where it hurt. He and Parcells persuaded the team to shift its
attitude to match and then surpass the Dolphins' cockiness and
confidence. And output.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are at St. Louis this weekend and then they will see
plenty of teams that can roll on offense. They will see Bledsoe's
arm with New England. Kansas City's power-running game. Steve
McNair's athleticism at quarterback and Yancey Thigpen's acrobatics
at receiver for Tennessee. Warren Moon and fleet Seattle. Miami and
Marino again. Bledsoe again.
</P>
<P>
   There will be lots of chances for the Jets _ and Parcells _ to
play defense.
</P>
<P>
   To, first, make it like it was. And then something new.

YANKEES-INDIANS MATCHUPS

<P>
   Scouting report on the American League Championship series.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: 89-73, AL Central champion
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: 114-48, AL East champion
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Yankees won 7 of 11
</P>
<P>
   They beat Texas because of their pitching, holding the Rangers
to a .141 batting average and one run in three games. Lest there be
any doubt, David Wells established himself as one of the best
big-game pitchers in baseball with his eight shutout innings in
Game 1; he is now 5-0 in the post season. Andy Pettitte, the Game 3
starter, has rebounded - he is relying more on his sinking fastball
and his breaking ball than his cut fastball - and he seems to
benefit from following Wells in the rotation. David Cone, the Game
2 starter, must work hard to keep Kenny Lofton off base, for
holding runners is the poorest aspect of Cone's approach. The
energetic Orlando Hernandez has not pitched since Sept. 25 and
might be over-eager when he starts Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the Yankees' lineup carried the attack against
Texas: Scott Brosius driving in three runs and Shane Spencer
hitting two home runs and driving in four runs, Joe Girardi
collecting three hits in seven at-bats. The first five hitters on
the Yankees' lineup generally did not produce as they usually do
(Bernie Williams seems to be having trouble handling high fastballs
once again). A scout trailing the Yankees in the last week said
Spencer is so comfortable at the plate it is only a matter of time
before a pitcher tries knocking him down.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' defense is the best in the American League, with
two question marks _ Spencer is adequate in left field but
sometimes is fooled on fly balls, and time will tell if Brosius'
sprained left ankle will affect his range at third base,
particularly on bunt plays.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar is a good catcher capable of throwing out runners,
but the Yankees should be extremely active on the basepaths in this
series, trying to go from first to third or first to home. The
Cleveland infielders who relay throws, Omar Vizquel and Joey Cora,
have poor arms.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove likes bringing in left-hander
Paul Assenmacher to face Paul O'Neill in crucial situations, and
with great success in the past: O'Neill has 3 hits in 24 times
at-bat in his career against Assenmacher, with 10 strikeouts. But
left-handed batters have hit Assenmacher hard this year, batting
.313.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' rotation is deep in bodies, but nobody really knows
how good they will be until they take the mound. Bartolo Colon, the
Game 3 starter, shut down the Yankees on June 21, but he pitched
badly in the second half of the year, the opponents' batting
average jumping from .216 to .321. Jaret Wright, the Game 1
starter, can be great, but if he can't get his curveball over, he
can get ripped. Charles Nagy pitched well down the stretch to
finish 15-10, beating the Yankees in the final week of the season.
Mike Jackson is a better closer than Jos Mesa was, and more
fearless, but the Indians' left-handed set-up man, Paul
Assenmacher, has not been dominant this year, and right-handed
set-up man Paul Shuey is prone to control trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are a lot like the Yankees _ a deep team with some
speed and many offensive weapons. Manny Ramirez slugged 45 home
runs, Kenny Lofton swiped 54 bases and scored 101 runs, David
Justice can hit any good pitcher on any given day and before Jim
Thome was hurt, he was a most valuable player candidate. In some
respects, however, the most prominent threats to the Yankees are
Omar Vizquel and Joey Cora, two pesky hitters who can drive the
offense if they find a way on base. The Indians are very, very good
in some spots, from the catcher Sandy Alomar to the center-fielder
Kenny Lofton, to the extraordinary hands of Vizquel at shortstop.
But second baseman Joey Cora is terrible and the right- fielder
Ramirez has the potential to be terrible.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians will be able to put pressure on the Yankees with
speed at the top and bottom of the lineup. Lofton swiped 54 bases,
and Vizquel 37, and they should challenge David Cone in Game 2 and
David Wells and Andy Pettitte from second base in Games 1 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians acquired the second baseman Cora because of his
great success against Yankees pitchers such as Wells (5 for 10 this
year) and Pettitte (4 for 7 this year). But Cora's defense could
kill the Indians, if he is tested. Playing him is a calculated
risk.

FROM BEACH TO BULLPEN: HOW PADRE BECAME A LEADER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMANTHA STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Trevor Hoffman wanted to be a surfer when he was
growing up in southern California, but he could not find a regular
ride to the beach, so he concentrated on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   That is a good thing for the San Diego Padres, because Hoffman's
53 regular-season saves _ tops in the majors this year _ propelled
them to the National League West division title, and his two saves
in the first round of the playoffs helped them dispatch the Houston
Astros and advance to the league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a situation where individual accomplishments come
through team success,'' Hoffman said the other day. ``Especially in
my role. Unless the team is winning and does the work prior to the
ninth inning, it's useless to have someone like me down there. I'm
the final product of a well-played game by the rest of our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed pitcher is also a candidate for the National
League Cy Young award. Others are Kevin Brown, the Padres starter;
Shane Reynolds and Randy Johnson of Houston, and John Smoltz, Tom
Glavine and Greg Maddux of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has been as good as automatic for the Padres, who play
the Braves for the National League title beginning Wednesday in
Atlanta. His 53 saves came in 54 opportunities, and he had a 1.50
earned run average. He also won four games. In 72 innings, he
allowed only 41 hits and struck out 85. Opponents batted only .167
against him.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs he had two saves, striking out the side in the
ninth inning of the Padres' Game 3 victory. He faltered in Game 2,
giving up the winning hit to Billy Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trevor is the best-prepared player,'' said Dave Stewart, the
Padres' pitching coach and the most valuable player in the 1990 and
1993 American League Championship Series. ``I think Trevor Hoffman
is an MVP candidate,'' said Stewart, arguing that Hoffman is
practically an everyday player. ``You don't grow him once in a blue
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Only four other pitchers have made the 50-save club: Bobby
Thigpen had 57 for the Chicago White Sox in 1990, Randy Meyers had
53 for the Chicago Cubs in 1993, Dennis Eckersley had 51 for the
Oakland A's in 1992, and Rod Beck had 51 for the Cubs this year.
Hoffman played shortstop and third base before switching to
reliever in 1991 at Class A Cedar Rapids, and he is accustomed to
the relief pitcher's place in the recesses of people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time we get a whole lot of scrutiny is when we don't
do our job, which is a lot of credit to our position,'' he said.
``If we do our job well, it rolls into the next game. If I don't do
my job well, it takes a win from the ball club and takes the wind
out of our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Hoffman has developed a relief pitcher's
equanimity and tough skin. ``This is a marathon,'' he said. ``Can't
get too high or too low. It's easy to be negative. But you have to
stand up for the way the game should be played and play your
hardest.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the how Hoffman has always played, since growing up the
youngest of three brothers in Anaheim, Calif. Baseball was the
family way: his father, Eddie, who died in 1995 at age 82, was
known as the Singing Usher at Anaheim Stadium, and his brother
Glenn was the interim manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers until the
Dodgers decided last week not to make him the manager. Glenn
Hoffman, still on the Dodgers' coaching staff, played as a utility
infielder for the Boston Red Sox, the Dodgers and the Anaheim
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the boys were only allowed to pitch when we were 12
years old,'' Trevor Hoffman recalled. ``My dad didn't want anyone
to abuse our arms. I had a strong family background and a lot of
competition from my older brothers. I was constantly bugging them
to let me into their games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has what teammates call a ``closer's personality.'' He
loves being a star, he is a leader in the clubhouse, and he loves
coming in with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates toss him the ball from the final out of each save,
he records the date and score in black marker, and he puts it in a
cupboard in his locker next to the pictures of his two sons, Brody
Burke Hoffman, 2, and Quinn Eddie Hoffman, 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has fun with all of this,'' said Andy Ashby, the Padre
starting pitcher. ``But he knows when it's time to come to play,
and he's unbelievable. The perfect guy to be that locked-in
mentally. The ninth inning is his time.''

N.Y. UNION LAUDS SEN. D'AMATO BUT BACKS REP. SCHUMER
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Calif., Ill., Wis., Nev., S.C.) (fb) 
By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a surprising scene three months ago when
Dennis Rivera, one of New York City's most left-leaning labor
leaders, was singing the praises of Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, president of the largest union in New York City, praised
D'Amato for persuading Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to
support legislation that financed health coverage for hundreds of
thousands of uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Rivera's politically potent union might endorse
D'Amato _ or at the very minimum stay neutral in this year's U.S.
Senate race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Rivera's 150,000-member union, 1199, the National
Health and Human Service Employees union, endorsed Rep. Charles E.
Schumer, D-N.Y., and thereby risked D'Amato's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is risky, labor leaders acknowledge, because
angering this powerful senator could make him far less responsive
to labor's needs when unions turn to him for help in the future if
he is re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may seem illogical, two words go far to explain why
Rivera's union backed Schumer: Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Largely as a result of the Lewinsky scandal, Democrats say they
suddenly fear that the Republicans will gain a filibuster-proof,
60-seat majority in the Senate, where the Republicans have 55 seats
to the Democrats' 45.
</P>
<P>
   For labor leaders like Rivera, the notion of a strong Republican
majority is a nightmare. That fear has helped push other New York
unions into Schumer's column, even though D'Amato had long courted
them. Those unions include the teamsters' joint council in New York
City and District Council 37, an umbrella group representing
120,000 municipal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders say they fear that with a filibuster-proof
Republican majority, the Senate would push through anti-union
legislation, like recently defeated Republican proposals to curb
labor's political spending and cut financing for the National Labor
Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried about legislation that will not allow the labor
movement to survive into the next century,'' Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed that the Democrats will lose Senate seats in California,
Illinois, Wisconsin, Nevada and South Carolina, Rivera's union
concluded that it was worth backing Schumer. The decision, Rivera
emphasized repeatedly, was not personal but was based on national
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the leadership of the Republican Party at the
national level in the person of Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott are
not necessarily from the same culture as the Republicans of the
Northeast,'' he said. ``They're far more conservative, far more
anti-labor, far more anti-worker, far more pro-business. We fear
that the Democratic Party faces irrelevance in the United States
Senate if we go below 41 seats.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Trying to avoid a rupture with D'Amato, Rivera praised him as
``an effective senator.''
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement could be a boon for Schumer. Rivera's union and
the teachers' union have labor's strongest political operations in
New York. In addition, Schumer will get thousands of dollars from
the local as well as use of its renowned phone banks, which can
make 50,000 political calls a day.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for D'Amato said, ``Al D'Amato's proud that he's
been endorsed by over 100 union federations and locals,
representing more that 400,000 working men and women, and he'll
continue his efforts on behalf of working middle class families.''
His labor endorsements include the New York City Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association and the New York State Building and
Construction Trades Council.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the backing of 1199, Schumer also received the
endorsement of 1199's parent union, the Service Employees
International Union, which has 350,000 members in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera _ who did not support D'Amato the last time he ran either
_ announced the endorsements during the founding convention of the
New York State Council of the service employees union. The
convention packed Town Hall, and the new group aims to make the
service employees a power to be reckoned with by bringing together
a dozen union locals to forge a common political and legislative
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, 1199 merged with the service employees, and
as part of that agreement, Rivera became head of the service
employees in New York State.

   Teri Thornton began hemorrhaging at the Bern Jazz Festival,
becoming so weak that her manager had to spoon-feed her, and when
she got back to the United States from Switzerland, the doctors
decided that the bladder cancer they had been treating with
chemotherapy and radiation required surgery. This was in June.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton's manager, Suzi Reynolds, had seen the 64-year-old
jazz singer through some tough times. When they first hooked up
three years ago, Ms. Thornton slept on her manager's couch. Her
career, in Ms. Reynolds' word, was ``zero.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Ms. Thornton's cancer surgery at Englewood Hospital in
New Jersey, Ms. Reynolds saw her ``really down'' for the first
time. Desperate to give her client a reason to fight, Ms. Reynolds
told Ms. Thornton she was entering her in the Thelonious Monk
Institute of Jazz vocal competition _ three months away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really angry with me,'' Ms. Reynolds recalled this
week. ``She said she'd never be ready. I went out in the hallway
and broke into tears. And while I was out there, sobbing, I heard''
_ here Ms. Reynolds sang scales _ `` `Aahhh-aaahhh-aahhh-aahhh.'
She was vocalizing with tubes in her throat!''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ms. Thornton, who has not released a recording since
1963, won the Monk competition in Washington with an emotional
performance that left her accompanist, Norman Simmons, weeping.
</P>
<P>
   Now the recording offers are flooding in, and in a small sun
room at the Actors' Fund Home in Englewood, where she has been
living while receiving medical treatment, Ms. Thornton talked about
her life.
</P>
<P>
   If you need a reminder of how fleeting fame and health can be,
the Actors' Home is a good place. A half dozen elderly actors and
musicians, many in poor health, one in a wheelchair, stop by to
congratulate Ms. Thornton and, occasionally, to remind a reporter
who they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton, who gives no indication of the exhaustion she
suffers from her illnesses (she is now cancer-free), brings her own
reminders: a scrapbook of newspaper clippings, from her rising-star
days in the '60s, when she had a hit called ``Somewhere in the
Night'' and was reported to be ``winging'' to tour Australia with
Frank Sinatra. There was also the odd story from the '80s, in which
Ms. Thornton said she had taken time out to raise three children.
</P>
<P>
   But who ever gets the full story?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton did not tour Australia with Sinatra _ a corrupt
manager delayed getting her a ticket for so long that by the time
she got there, Sinatra had departed.
</P>
<P>
   She took time off from her career not to raise her children, but
because for a long time, she did not have a career. She had three
husbands and three children, one of whom was born out of wedlock.
She was involved in a custody battle in which she kidnapped her
youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people who knew Teri Thornton in music knew the other parts
of my life,'' Ms. Thornton says, but only after almost three hours
have passed. ``That I drove a cab, that I saw the inside of a
jail...''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who think that given the choice of a jazz singer
or an alley cat for a mother, you're better off with the cat _ they
stick around longer. Teri Thornton's mother seemed to share that
view. ``Warriors'' is what Ms. Thornton calls her mother and
grandmother, when she first starts talking, setting up a picture of
a loving, tightly knit family in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton's father was a Pullman porter. Her mother, Burnieze
Crews, was an actress, published author, poet, playwright,
schoolteacher, civic leader and star of her own radio show, in
which she sang pop standards. Ms. Thornton's grandmother was an
evangelist. When Ms. Thornton was young, she, her mother and
grandmother had a gospel group.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, the darker side of the story emerges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started drinking from an early age,'' Ms. Thornton says.
``Frustration with family problems. It eased the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   She talks of being a divorced mother of two at 19, living in her
mother's home. The resentment of her children and her mother when
she left her children in her mother's care because she had got
work. Her mother's contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always the slut,'' Ms. Thornton says. ``Even after being
on national TV, it was, `What's your next move, moron?'''
</P>
<P>
   She talks about relying more and more on drink until one night,
in the '80s, when the smell of alcohol was so strong on her pillow,
Ms. Thornton felt she was being asphyxiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I opened my mouth and no sound came out,'' Ms. Thornton says.
``I knew if I didn't stop I would die. I would die if I couldn't
sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Thornton gave up a lot for jazz, she is told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I think about it, I did,'' Ms. Thornton says. ``What
was I going to do? Be miserable to my children because I wasn't
doing what I had to do?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a piano in the room. Ms. Thornton sits down and plays
the music the way she remembers it. Suddenly, ``Billy Boy,'' a
tired old folk song, has bounce and spirit. ``Billy Boy'' is hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``See? Whatever beat you want to put, wherever you want to put
it,'' she says. ``No limit on how far you can take a melody, no
governor on how much you can put between two beats as long as you
leave a little space.''
</P>
<P>
   A thought that seems to apply to the singer as well as the song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space is just as important as the notes it fills.''

FOR NOW, NHL MEANS NOT HIP LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We're less than 15 months from the end of the millennium and the
National Hockey League still isn't the sport of the year, the
decade, the century or even the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite glowing predictions, glowing hopes for a marketing
bounce from the Winter Olympics and even glowing pucks, the NHL
remains fourth among the major team spectator sports played in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that happened in the summer months is likely to change
that anytime soon, but it doesn't mean the offseason was all bad.
Along with a few other odds and ends, here's a look at some of
what's happened off the ice since the Detroit Red Wings skated off
with their second consecutive Stanley Cup five months ago:
</P>
<P>
   Cashing in: Despite its puny and declining Nielsen ratings, the
NHL capitalized on the grudge match between Disney and Fox with a
five-year, $600-million television rights deal that will put games
on ABC beginning next season.
</P>
<P>
   It's better than anything the league previously had, but
trifling by the standards set by baseball, the NBA and,
particularly, the NFL. With the average NHL salary well above $1
million and 30 teams dividing the loot within a couple of years,
it's easy to see $600 million doesn't buy what it used to.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon: The $600-million loge ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving soon (thankfully): Fox's glowing vulcanized rubber disk.
</P>
<P>
   Sad farewell: The sport lost Pat LaFontaine, whose outstanding
15-year career was halted this summer by post-concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   What a waste. At 33, LaFontaine should have had a few good years
remaining. The collision with a teammate that ended his career
could not be avoided. The cheap shot by Pittsburgh defenseman
Francois Leroux that began LaFontaine's problems could and should
have been.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey cannot afford to prematurely lose players such as
LaFontaine and Mario Lemieux, who retired a year ago at 31.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Mighty Ducks star Paul Kariya _ hockey's most
exciting player _ didn't call it quits after his concussion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Launching pad: Spurred into action because the man it is
honoring has stomach cancer, the NHL announced in June it will
issue the Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard Award to this year's leading
goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Had the league issued the award last season, it would have been
shared by Teemu Selanne of the Ducks and Washington's Peter Bondra,
who each scored 52 goals. Selanne or Kariya may well win it this
year, putting a Disney imprint on an award named after a hallowed
member of the Montreal Canadiens, hockey's New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign of the times, and for hockey purists, one more small
step away from the good old days of the six-team league.
</P>
<P>
   Remember these names: The new coaches this year are Craig
Hartsburg (Ducks), Dirk Graham (Chicago), Bob Hartley (Colorado),
Terry Murray (Florida), Barry Trotz (expansion Nashville), ex-Kings
coach Robbie Ftorek (New Jersey) and ex-Kings coach Pat Quinn
(Toronto).
</P>
<P>
   After Detroit's Scotty Bowman and Edmonton's Ron Low, the Kings'
Larry Robinson is third in tenure with his current team, and he's
only entering his fourth year.
</P>
<P>
   Best story: The return of Tampa Bay center John Cullen after a
bout with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After lengthy chemotherapy, he's
been deemed cancer-free. Even if he doesn't play in another game,
call this comeback a success.
</P>
<P>
   Pettiest story: Would it have killed the Ducks to give leukemia
survivor Milos Holan one measly shift in an exhibition game before
letting him go?
</P>
<P>
   Rules of the game: The NHL has tested the two-referee system
during the exhibition season, and each team will play 20 games with
two referees during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   If exhibitions have been any indication, it appears to be a
change for the better, with nonsensical behind-the-play mischief
now under much closer scrutiny. The much-feared procession to the
penalty box has yet to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in an effort to open up the game offensively, the goal
line has been moved two feet further from the end boards to 13,
adding more maneuvering room; the size of the neutral zone has been
accordingly reduced, and the league is cracking down on oversized
goalie equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Will all the changes add up to a dramatic increase in scoring?
Probably not. But that doesn't mean the changes aren't worth a try,
and too much scoring would be just as unattractive as not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Old faces, new places: The biggest name to change uniforms
during the summer was right wing Brett Hull, who left St. Louis to
sign as a free agent with Dallas. Chicago, rumored to be pursuing
Hull, instead added New Jersey's Doug Gilmour and Philadelphia's
Paul Coffey. Toronto added goalie Curtis Joseph and Philadelphia
signed goalie John Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   But a move with the potential to have as big an impact as any
may have been made by the Kings. If defenseman Steve Duchesne has
the desired effect on the Kings' often lifeless power play, they
should be improved. If they had a better power play a year ago,
they might have won their division.
</P>
<P>
   Same old story: The Red Wings remain the class of the league.
They may not win the regular-season crown, but when it matters in
April, May and June, they'll be the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Even the occasionally shaky goaltending of Chris Osgood couldn't
derail the Red Wings last season. No team can match the depth of
their skill.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings should make it three Stanley Cups in a row. In a
hockey era of short-lived powers, they look like a dynasty. &QL;

IMPEACHMENT PROCESS OFF TO A PARTISAN START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee on Monday took the
first step toward the third presidential impeachment inquiry in
American history, voting along party lines to recommend that the
full House of Representatives approve a formal investigation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 21-16 more than 10 hours after the hearing began,
the committee adopted an impeachment resolution that allowed a more
open-ended inquiry of President Clinton. It came after several
failed attempts by the Democrats to narrow the focus on both the
timetable and the subject matter to just his affair with Monica
Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to vote on the resolution by Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans now will be allowed to consider other issues
that have dogged the president, including Whitewater, the travel
office firings, the White House's gathering of FBI files on
Republicans, campaign finance and missile sales to China. Except
for the missile sales, Congress already has examined all of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to decide whether or not to impeach Mr.
Clinton,'' Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican,
said as he opened the hearing. ``We are here to ask and answer this
one simple question: Based on what we know now, do we have a duty
to look further, or to look away?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation to the committee, David Schippers, the
Republican majority's chief counsel, alleged 15 offenses by
Clinton. A lifelong Democrat, Schippers spoke for an hour in
outlining charges that ranged from obstruction of justice to
witness-tampering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff and I have made a deliberate effort to discount the
political aspects of our examination and to ignore any partisan
tactics and strategy,'' he told the committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schippers dropped the abuse of power allegation in the 11-count
report to Congress by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. He added
others, including several that had to do with making false
statements and another alleging that Clinton had concealed a felony
concerning his knowledge of Lewinsky's false affidavit in the Paula
Jones sexual-harassment case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the Democratic counsel, emphasized a point repeated
by several committee Democrats: that by beginning the inquiry
without first setting the bar for impeachable offenses was like ``a
ship's captain leaving on a difficult, uncharted voyage hoping to
find his or her compass somewhere along the way.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the daylong debate, Republicans and Democrats on the
committee took note of the historical significance of the hearing,
even while they differed starkly on the need to conduct an
impeachment inquiry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They drew upon the Bible, the Constitution and the Federalist
Papers as guideposts for their deliberations. Overshadowing it all
was Watergate, the scandal that triggered the last impeachment
inquiry and led to the resignation of President Nixon in 1974. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Watergate,'' said Rep. John Conyers of Michigan,
the senior Democrat, sounding a running argument of his party. ``It
is an extramarital affair.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, meanwhile, echoed what has been the crux of the
division over the Lewinsky investigation _ that it was not about
sex, but about breaking the law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate is not about the fact that President Clinton had
an affair with Monica Lewinsky and then lied about it,'' said Rep.
James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican. ``It is about Judge
Starr's finding that the president violated his oath to the tell
the truth.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they had taken pains to follow the path laid in
1974 by Peter Rodino, Hyde's predecessor as Judiciary chairman and
a Democrat who steered the Nixon impeachment investigation. His
portrait loomed over the hearing room. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even so, at least one Republican, though he voted for the formal
inquiry into Clinton's possible impeachment, said he was still
uncertain whether the president's alleged actions amounted to the
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that the founders had envisioned. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this Watergate or Peyton Place?'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham,
a South Carolina Republican with a history of bucking his party
leadership. ``I don't know. If I followed the polls, I know what I
would do. Eighty-two percent of the people in one part of my
district want him thrown out of office. I want to be a good
congressman who 30 years from now, not just 30 days from now,
people thought did the right thing.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, various Democrats spoke of their
disappointment in the president but said they considered
impeachment too severe a punishment . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not proud of the personal conduct of the president that
has cheapened our national discourse'' said Rep. Robert Wexler, a
Florida Democrat. But he added: ``Impeachment is not about
adultery. The president had an affair. He lied about it. Does
anyone reasonably believe that this amounts to subversion of
government? Does anyone reasonably believe that this is what the
Founding Fathers were talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   The committee sought an even-handed tone, and the debate had
little of the razor-sharp partisan rhetoric of recent weeks. But
for all the historical drama, the proceedings were largely
anti-climactic because, with a five-vote Republican majority, the
outcome was never in doubt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the White House could claim some measure of victory, despite
Clinton's lasting blemish of becoming just the third president to
face a possible impeachment vote. Besides Nixon, who would have
faced an impeachment vote had he not resigned, Andrew Johnson
survived a vote of impeachment in the Senate in 1868 by one vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, his supporters know they may lose the votes
of some Democratic members, particularly those in close re-election
races, when the resolution is brought up for a vote Friday in the
full House. But they successfully avoided any Democratic defections
in the committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart repeated
Monday: ``We don't believe there is anything here that rises to the
level of an impeachable offense.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters have tried to paint Starr as an
overzealous prosecutor who set out to get Clinton and to portray
his report to the committee, and the committee's work itself, as
partisan efforts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same line of attack was evident in the presentation by
Lowell, who spoke of Starr's ``prosecutorial excess'' by detaining
Lewinsky for 10 hours, ``despite her asking for a lawyer,'' and his
summoning of her mother, ``who was brought to tears by their
conduct.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said Schippers, by eliminating, revising and increasing the
offenses alleged of Clinton in Starr's report, engaged in a
``prosecutor's strategy which courts routinely disapprove by which
they divide what they believe to be a single offense into many
different charges. They do this to make the case look more serious
or foreboding.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schippers offered a catalog of alleged offenses that said
Clinton and Lewinsky might have been part of conspiracy to obstruct
justice in the Paula Jones case by giving false testimony and
withholding evidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end, he offered what he called a brief personal
statement, one as ``a citizen of the United States who happens to
be a father and a grandfather'' in which he paraphrased lines from
a play about St. Thomas More: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The laws of this country are the great barriers that protect
the citizens from the winds of evil and tyranny. If we permit one
of those laws to fall, who will be able to stand in the winds that
follow? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen generations of Americans, our fellow Americans, many
of whom are reposing in military cemeteries throughout the world,
are looking down on you and judging what you do today.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats protested the allowing of such personal comments, and
they were stricken from the record until Rep. Bob Barr, a Georgia
Republican, volunteered to have the statement appear under his
name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has said he hopes to finish the impeachment inquiry by Jan.
1. But the no-limits nature of the impeachment inquiry resolution
worried Democrats, who saw it as a ``fishing expedition'' that
could continue interminably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, citing Rodino's concerns about time limits during
Watergate, said they were an ``invitation to delay'' and caused
``more stress and strain trying to get the job done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ask you,'' the chairman said, ``to accept on faith that
we want to move this along.'' &QL;

VERITAS SOFTWARE TO ACQUIRE SEAGATE UNIT IN STOCK SWAP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Veritas Software Corp. said Monday that it
had agreed to acquire a unit of Seagate Software Inc., a
majority-owned subsidiary of Seagate Technology Inc., in a stock
swap valued at $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Veritas, based in Mountain View, Calif., will acquire Seagate
Software's Network and Storage Management Group. Veritas produces
software that manages data storage on large corporate networks,
performing tasks such as backup and recovery of lost information.
Seagate, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., will own about 35 percent
of Veritas after the deal. Seagate, the world's largest maker of
disk drives, will retain a software unit specializing in business
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The companies announced the deal after markets had closed.
Shares of Seagate closed down $1.4375, to $23; Veritas closed down
$$2.875, to $45.375. Seagate shares have languished all year as the
company struggles to generate profits amid deep price cuts for disk
drives. Veritas shares are also trading well below their 52-week
high despite strong earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen J. Luczo, Seagate's president and chief executive, said
the merger of his company's software business with Veritas was an
alternative to taking the unit public. ``Even in a going-public
scenario, Seagate's share would have dropped to about 60 percent,''
he said. ``This gives us a smaller stake in a much stronger entity
because the merged company will have a much stronger position than
either company had on its own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Luczo, a former investment banker with Bear, Stearns, succeeded
Alan Shugart, Seagate's founder, in July. Luczo said that the idea
of building a software business independent of the disk-drive
franchise was ``Al's vision, my strategy.'' The software unit was
intended to benefit from the growth of so-called client-server
technology, which spreads software applications and data across
multiple computers on a network.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting company will have 2,300 employees in 16 countries
and projected 1998 revenue of more than $350 million. Mark Leslie,
the president and chief executive of Veritas, will be chairman and
chief executive; Terry Cunningham, the president and chief
operating officer of Seagate Software, will be president and chief
operating officer. Luczo and Greg Kerfoot, chief strategic officer
of Seagate Software, will join the board of Veritas.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``will form a company with an unprecedented range of
products and immediate market leadership,'' Leslie said in a
statement. ``The merger creates a company with the industry
stature, focus and technology base to lead the storage industry.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Seagate Software's strength in work-group and desktop
computing, and its distribution agreements with the Microsoft
Corp., would complement Veritas' focus on larger information
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock
Letter, said that the price was attractive but that the deal was
risky because it left Seagate more vulnerable than ever to the
cutthroat pricing of the disk-drive industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve clearly has decided he doesn't need the software
business to get better margins,'' he said. ``If the disk-drive
business is going to stage a brilliant recovery, he will look
brilliant; otherwise you have to wonder what the future of this
company is.''

OLOWOKANDI'S CAREER GEAR STUCK IN IDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Who says there's no news emanating from the idle
NBA? Here it is, the day training camps were supposed to open and
the No.1 overall pick in the June draft hasn't acquired that most
standard of status symbols, the boombox on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Presses have been stopped for smaller wonders. Of course,
Michael Olowokandi has a practical reason for not purchasing an
automobile, luxury or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi can't drive.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind his implausible journey in just three years' time
from a Nigerian diplomat's son to the NBA's hottest property. To
anybody in the car-conceived sprawl that is L.A., the more amazing
thing is that as soon as the lockout ends the Clippers are going to
hand over the keys to their franchise to a player who has never had
a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   With a work stoppage applying the brakes to a basketball career
that has accelerated more quickly than a Lamborghini, Olowokandi is
looking into taking driving lessons. Judging by the stalled labor
negotiations, he's liable to have his learner's permit before the
league has a new collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That's one silver lining for Olowokandi, 23, and one dark cloud
for the NBA, which sorely could use the good vibrations the
7-foot-1 center oozes without so much as breaking a sweat. He's
everything your average boorish, selfish insolent
superstar-in-training is not.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine someone with Sammy Sosa's passion, James Bonds' diction,
Kenneth Starr's tenacity, Ronaldo's nimble feet, Emily Post's
manners and Harvey Keitel's edge. It's obvious why Madison Avenue
already is mad about Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   Nike is slashing its spending on endorsements by $100 million,
but that didn't stop the shoe giant from inking a deal with
Olowokandi. The only thing keeping the Kandi Man from being the
nation's newest sweetheart is Olowokandi himself.
</P>
<P>
   He has turned down numerous television appearances because the
exposure strikes him as out of place, like putting the points on
the scoreboard before the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Some No. 1 draft picks feel entitled to whatever perks come with
the prize. Olowokandi, bless his soles, actually wants to earn his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep that all low key,'' Olowokandi said,
``because I still have to go out and be an NBA player. I haven't
established that I can do that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not in any actual arenas. It might be January of 1999 at
the earliest before he gets that chance. The welcome news for the
Clippers is that in simulated settings he has more than held his
own, winning many admirers with his shot-blocking, his ambidextrous
jump hook, his agility and his coachability.
</P>
<P>
   In August he shelled out $2,500 to return to Pete Newell's Big
Man Camp in Hawaii. He banged elbows with the likes of veteran
center Andrew Lang, who told Sports Illustrated afterward: ``He's
got some of the quickest feet I've seen. And he learns in a hurry.
And with that body... he's going to be an All-Star for a long, long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for an ex-soccer player whose basketball resume is
thinner than Manute Bol. The sum total of Olowokandi's experience
is the three years he spent at the University of the Pacific upon
alighting from Brunel University in England.
</P>
<P>
   Having traversed an ocean to climb this mountain, Olowokandi
wisely sought out a Sherpa with impeccable credentials to guide
him. Lakers Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar has been working
one-on-one with Olowokandi three times a week at an L.A. health
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he speaks, you listen,'' Olowokandi said. ``He doesn't
just explain things, he actually shows you. He's so passionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi is no stranger to hard work, but he had never seen
the likes of the conditioning program Abdul-Jabbar has introduced
to him. Most days he barely has enough energy left to dial for the
taxi or open the passenger-side car door of his personal assistant,
Deidre Arrington, who sometimes doubles as his driver.
</P>
<P>
   He could hire a car if he cared to. Companies have called him up
offering their services. But Olowokandi doesn't see himself as big
enough for a stretch limousine, even if the leg room is a little
tight in Arrington's Nissan Altima.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever teaches him to drive,'' Arrington said, ``needs a
utility vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever car Olowokandi eventually ends up buying, you can bet
it'll have ample room for passengers. He already has struck up a
friendship with the kids in his Manhattan Beach neighborhood. It's
easy to imagine a lot of ice cream runs in his future.
</P>
<P>
   There probably also will be a flight or two to Northern
California so Olowokandi can cheer on the 5-year-old soccer-playing
son of his agent Bill Duffy. Olowokandi already has requested a
schedule of Treaven Duffy's matches. So far, Treaven's sports
docket looks a lot busier than Michael's.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi said he was ``dispirited'' when the lockout was
imposed on July 1. When it will end is anybody's guess, though the
Clippers hiring a head coach might be like a groundhog sighting,
signaling that the end of a long, cold spell is near.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been kind of nice to have training camp begin as
scheduled,'' Olowokandi said. ``But it's out of my control. I'm
going to hang in tight and be patient. The way I'm looking at it is
this is an ample opportunity for me to further harness my
development.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason to believe that whenever the season gets
under way, the opposition will have a hard time restraining him. &QL;

LAWSUIT ACCUSES BROKERAGE FIRM OF DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Williams, a broker at Josephthal &AMP; Co.'s Washington office
who is black, said when he arrived at work in 1996 he often found
3-by-5 index cards with crude racist cartoons on his desk. Harolyn
Duerr, the receptionist and only woman among 25 people in the
office, said that in late 1995 her computer screen saver was
changed to a picture of two women having sex.
</P>
<P>
   The Equal Opportunity Employment Commission said Monday that it
filed suit Oct. 1 in federal court in Washington against
Josephthal, a small regional brokerage firm, seeking punitive
damages for what the commission called ``malicious'' conduct at
Josephthal's Washington office, which was open from late 1994 until
January.
</P>
<P>
   Tulia L. Diaz, the commission's Washington field office
director, described the case as ``phenomenal'' because ``each
individual employee was subjected to harassment custom-designed to
taunt and humiliate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Josephthal, in a statement, said it has written policies
prohibiting discrimination, but that none of the four workers named
in the lawsuit complained to senior management until after it
closed its Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Slowinski, who was manager of the Josephthal office and
now works for Spencer Trask Securities in Rockville, Md., said it
would be inappropriate for him to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Former employees, in affidavits given to the commission, said
that Asians, blacks, Hispanics, Jews and women who worked there
were routinely addressed with slurs instead of their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man would walk around with his hand down his pants with
his finger sticking out of his zipper,'' Ms. Duerr said. ``This was
my first office job and I thought you had to put up with this,''
she said, explaining why she saw no point in seeking other
employment. Ms. Duerr said she quit after a colleague told her that
such conduct was not tolerated at most offices.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Rice-Brown, the commission lawyer who filed the lawsuit,
said Josephthal management included ``an equal opportunity
harasser'' who routinely and openly denigrated each worker who was
not a white male.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 400 cartoons depicting rape and bestiality,
suggesting Jews be put in microwave ovens and comparing the male
genitals of some Asian brokers to rice kernels were distributed,
said Aaron Blight, a commission investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Duerr, Stevens and others gave the commission affidavits in
which they said that most of the cartoons were drawn by Fred
Stucker, the assistant manager. Stucker, now a broker with Merrill
Lynch in Washington, did not return four calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that he had to restrain a colleague who wanted to
hit Stucker one day after hearing him speak disparagingly with
Slowinski about ``the darker races.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said that at the seven other securities firms where he
has worked since 1992, ``I never encountered this.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It was horrible. And everyone was subjected to it
who was not a white male.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, in its lawsuit, says that Josephthal allowed
such a hostile environment that while Ms. Duerr and Williams
resigned they were ``constructively discharged'' and should receive
damages for wrongful termination.
</P>
<P>
   It also seeks damages for harassment of two other brokers,
Donald S. Han and John Blalock.
</P>
<P>
   Josephthal, founded in 1910, has about 1,000 brokers in offices
in eight states and Israel.

NEW LEADER FOR A NEW GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Although only a week has gone by since Germany's voters ended
Helmut Kohl's 16-year tenure as Germany's leader, some things are
already apparent. The voting reflected Germany's metamorphosis into
a more self-confident, tolerant and liberal state. The government
of the next Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, will have a new tone,
one fitting a country that seems increasingly comfortable with the
new political and cultural diversity brought by unification and
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, 54, and the leaders of the Green Party, his likely
coalition partner, bring the first truly postwar generation into
the German leadership. He came of age when Germany was already an
economic wonder, no longer dependent on American care packages. His
generation is also more distant from the shame of the Nazi past,
freer to focus on the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democratic victory also reflects a geographic shift,
away from Kohl's base in the conservative Rhineland surrounding
Bonn to the new Eastern states. Fittingly, the new government will
leave Bonn next year and re-establish the capital in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The election showed that the great majority of Germans accept
that theirs is not a homogeneous nation. Anti-foreigner, right-wing
parties did extremely poorly, and the Schroeder government promises
to display more good will toward foreign residents than did Kohl,
who was slow to condemn racist violence. This may be one of the few
clear policy shifts under Schroeder, who has promised to ease
access to citizenship for foreigners. Citizenship is now granted to
those with German blood and is very difficult for nonethnic
Germans, even those born in Germany, to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's campaign left many skeptical that he could reduce
Germany's 10 percent unemployment rate. He had promised to restore
the few cuts Kohl made in workers' generous benefits, and his
finance minister is likely to be his party's leader, Oskar
Lafontaine, who is close to Germany's unions. But there are signs
that Schroeder may induce the unions to moderate their demands. He
has also announced a huge job-training program.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's foreign policy team is expected to include leaders
of the Greens, a party that once called for the abolition of
Germany's army. But the Greens, known for their pacifist and
environmental stands, have moderated. Joschka Fischer, the Green
leader mentioned for foreign minister, is a respected pragmatist
who recently blocked the party from calling for Germany to leave
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   While both Schroeder and Fischer are pro-American, they are
likely to be less deferential to Washington and closer to Britain
and France than was the older Kohl. Schroeder visited France three
days after his election. Unlike his predecessor, Schroeder is not
suspected of dreaming about the euro at night. But he has
emphasized that he will continue Kohl's policies of European
integration.

McNOWN NEEDS BETTER SHOWING 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the Bruins to defeat 10th-ranked Arizona on
Saturday, a slew of players must improve upon recent performances,
including quarterback Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Especially(end ital) quarterback Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very average,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``He's
directed the offense well, and he's made big plays. But he's out of
sync.''
</P>
<P>
   After a super start to his Heisman Trophy campaign against
Texas, McNown has been McMediocre.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 52.5 percent of his passes in the Houston and
Washington State games, with three touchdowns and three
interceptions. Saturday, he underthrew several receivers as his
ball uncharacteristically fluttered through the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some throws I wish I had back, and I've made some
mistakes,'' McNown said. ``I don't feel like I ever got in the
groove.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, McNown's play proves the theory he and Toledo
proposed during training camp: He'd be a better quarterback this
season than last, but his numbers wouldn't reflect it.
</P>
<P>
   McNown's performance depends on every facet of the offense. The
line must protect him; the running backs must accumulate yards to
keep defenses guessing; the receivers must run correct routes and
catch the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the problem. Danny Farmer is the Bruins' only
experienced receiver, hence his team-leading 13 catches and
21.6-yard average. But Brad Melsby hasn't played in two years,
Brian Poli-Dixon is a sophomore and Jon Dubravac a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Even Freddie Mitchell, for all his big-play ability, has just
begun to learn the offense, read the defense and adjust his routes
when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone, Jim McElroy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys are not where they're supposed to be, and it
hurts,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Against Washington State, for example, Poli-Dixon twice ran the
wrong route, Dubravac dropped a sideline pass and tight end Ryan
Neufeld dropped one in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The receivers ultimately decide what sort of quarterback
you'll be,'' McNown said. ``Everybody has to play at their full
potential for your numbers to look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, including the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned: UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis will decide
whether to reschedule the Miami game within a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes have left no doubt: They want to play Dec. 5, the
only date available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my decision, and I'm sure it'll disappoint people one way
or the other,'' Dalis said. ``I've gotten an incredibly mixed
reaction from our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the league's athletic directors vote otherwise, the
cancellation will cost UCLA $507,032 in television revenue. Even if
the game is rescheduled, it's not expected to be televised. CBS has
Army-Navy and a college basketball game that day.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Defensive end Kenyon Coleman (knee) will not
return this week. Defensive end Steve Sua (shoulder) and two
linebackers, Ramogi Huma (hip) and Mike Wiley (ankle), are
questionable. Cornerback Jason Bell (ankle) is probable.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Center Shawn Stuart, cornerback Ryan Roques and
the punt coverage unit were named players/unit of the week. . . .
Offensive tackle Kris Farris and linebacker Tony White will join
the regulars, Larry Atkins and McNown, as captains this week. . . .
Kickoff for the UCLA-Oregon game on Oct. 17 is 12:30 p.m. at the
Rose Bowl. It will be televised regionally by ABC. . . . Several
starters, including McNown, will appear at the UCLA Medical Center
today at noon to make smoothies for kids in the pediatric ward.

AT CONNECTICUT GUBERNATORIAL DEBATE, CIVILITY PREVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ U.S. Rep. Barbara Kennelly used the opening
debate of the Connecticut gubernatorial race to go after Gov. John
Rowland with a stick rather than a sword Monday, setting a
dignified tone for the closing month of a campaign in which polls
show the governor holding a huge lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland had to answer for some of the less rosy parts of his
record, including what Mrs. Kennelly considers laxness in the
enforcement of environmental and child-protection laws. But her
criticism was limited mostly to asides as she described her plans
to bolster public education and give new rights to patients insured
by health maintenance organizations. He, too, seemed to be pulling
punches, barely mentioning his differences with her eight-term
record in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland was so confident that during his standard nod of
appreciation to the sponsors at the close of the hourlong debate,
he even thanked Mrs. Kennelly for coming. He said he would focus in
his next term on spreading prosperity to the downtowns of the
state's largest cities but proposed no new plans. ``I think Mrs.
Kennelly sees Connecticut's glass as half-empty,'' he said. ``I see
Connecticut's glass as half-full.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you look ahead, the question becomes, `Why would you
run again?''' he continued. He said that after talking to his wife,
Patricia, ``We decided that the real future of Connecticut is how
we turn our cities around.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to an audience of 500 business leaders from prosperous
Fairfield County, Mrs. Kennelly suggested that much of the
governor's political fortune stemmed from the economy rather than
his policies. ``The years leading to the new millennium are too
crucial to waste by complacency or political posturing _ too
crucial to spend patting yourself on the back about accomplishments
that you didn't have much to do with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Castigating Rowland over his record of enforcing environmental
laws, she said, ``A scandal a month is not good enough for the
state of Connecticut, especially since so many of your companies
came here because of the quality of our life.'' Mrs. Kennelly
accused the governor of an election-year conversion on the
regulation of health insurers, saying of a Connecticut law creating
an appeals process against HMOs, ``You signed it because it was
veto-proof by the time it passed the Legislature, but I am glad
that you did sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Courtney, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant
governor and Mrs. Kennelly's running mate, explained her strategy
after Monday's debate, the first of four. ``The voters are not
going to respond positively to a hammer-and-tong attack,'' Courtney
said. ``The way we win this election is to draw the contrast
between her message and the governor's message.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates' contrasting styles were shown most sharply
when they were asked whether the state's death penalty law should
be rewritten to be tougher and more workable. Connecticut last
executed someone three decades ago. The candidates both said
``yes,'' but in very different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly, a Democrat, 62, said the law should be tougher
and clearer, adding, ``Once again, I think we have to get those
lawyers in the room and make sure that we write a law that works.''
Rowland, a Republican, 41, drew laughter when he responded: ``The
last thing I want is lawyers in a room figuring this thing out.
That's why we've got this mess. If anything, get the lawyers out of
the room. Then we can get down to brass tacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Mrs. Kennelly represents the Hartford area in Congress,
Monday's debate served as her introduction to many of the audience
members and television viewers from the New York City suburbs. The
debate was broadcast live over radio and cable television. The
questioners were newspaper editors, and the sponsor was an
association based in Stamford, the Business Council of Southwestern
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates differed most markedly on tax cuts. Rowland, who
years ago abandoned his 1994 campaign promise to end the state
income tax, was asked whether he planned to phase out the tax in a
second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always that possibility and that opportunity,'' he
said, pausing for laughter from the crowd, which realized the idea
was long dead. Rowland then acknowledged there was little appetite
for it in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said taxes had been cut $1.7 billion during his term,
including reductions or credits for the income, gas, property and
inheritance taxes. ``We plan to do it over the next four years as
well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly has proposed a 10 percent reduction in property
taxes, which she would accomplish with a state rebate to the cities
and towns that impose and collect the tax. ``I would hope that the
governor would say Monday that he would forget that promise that he
keeps making and never, never does it _ that he says get rid of the
income tax,'' she said. Rowland denounced Mrs. Kennelly's proposal
as ``nothing more than a spending plan, a shell game.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue that has dogged Rowland most consistently concerns the
killings of children who were being monitored by the state's
Department of Children and Families. Mrs. Kennelly said: ``It
really is very tragic when a child has to be taken out of his birth
home because of neglect and abuse. But it's more than tragic when a
child under the care of the state has something happen to them.''
She said workers were inadequately trained and social workers'
caseloads too large.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said he had increased spending, staffing and training
for the department. ``With all due respect, Mrs. Kennelly's facts
are entirely wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon's one reference to President Clinton's
troubles, the candidates were asked to what extent a governor was
entitled to a private life. Mrs. Kennelly signaled for the first
time that she planned to vote against impeachment, saying that the
overwhelming response of constituents since the broadcasting of
Clinton's grand jury testimony had been: ```Censor him. Punish him.
But for heaven's sake, Barbara, don't vote for impeachment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said people wanted Congress to act and move on. ``Lets
get it over with,'' he said. ``Let's have finality. And, by the
way, all people should have a private life, including politicians
and including candidates.''

 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Dee Miller's eyes bulged when told Ohio State
has fumbled 16 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was that many,'' the wide receiver from
Springfield said Monday, as the Buckeyes began to prepare for
Saturday's game at Illinois (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   Miller was buoyed when informed that the Buckeyes had lost just
five of those fumbles to opponents but admitted, ``that's something
we definitely have to crack down on.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU coach John Cooper has been trying to crack down on fumbles
all season, regularly chasing his players around at practice trying
to pop the ball loose. Despite his efforts, fumbles continue to
plague the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   They had five against West Virginia in their season opener,
three per game vs. Toledo and Missouri and five more against Penn
State last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, players and coaches said, luck has been on their
side. Only one of those fumbles resulted in a touchdown and none
cost the Buckeyes the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely the ball is bouncing our way a little,'' said
quarterback Joe Germaine, who recovered two of his three fumbles
vs. Penn State. ``But fumbles are something we need to nip in the
bud.''
</P>
<P>
   Interceptions have been much less of a problem. Germaine has
thrown just one this season, although it led to the Nittany Lions'
only touchdown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says each week he stresses the importance of ball
security to his team. Quarterbacks' coach Tim Salem even played the
game film of one of Germaine's fumbles _ the one poked out from
behind by a Penn State linebacker _ in slow motion for the OSU
quarterback for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kind of told me when you run with the ball you need to
keep your elbow closer to your body,'' Germaine said.
</P>
<P>
   OSU cornerback Ahmed Plummer had the Buckeyes' only interception
of the game vs. Penn State and led the team with three pass
break-ups, yet still got some ribbing from his teammates afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teased Ahmed all weekend,'' strong safety Damon Moore said.
``We said he should've had three or four interceptions. He didn't
get it done, but he made plenty of nice plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Germaine took a couple of hard hits Saturday and said he felt
the after-effects the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up a little stiff in the neck and the ribs on Sunday
morning,'' he said. ``But that's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper worries about his quarterback taking too many hits,
especially since Germaine prides himself on being tough and
``sometimes acts like he doesn't mind taking a shot.'' Germaine
said Cooper need not worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely understand that it's not good to get hit quite
often,'' Germaine said. ``But I'm not going to stand back there and
be afraid of anyone that's going to come in and try to take shots
at me.''

 &HT;    Safety Bell ready to face old team
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ Bengals safety Myron Bell knew the day would
come when he'd face his former teammates _ the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   The time is now.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, a star at Michigan State before Pittsburgh took him in the
fifth round of the 1994 draft, started 21of 63 games for the
Steelers before bolting as an unrestricted free agent in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``My move was a principle-type thing,'' Bell said. ``I wanted to
go somewhere where I could compete for a starting job. With Carnell
Lake being there, I didn't think that was possible any time soon.
So it was best for me to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 1-3, so whoever we play this week would be a big game.
It just happens to be the Steelers. Yeah, it's special. We want to
come out with a win and get this thing rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh whipped the Bengals twice in 1997 _ 26-10 here and
20-3 there. Bell remembers all the Steelers fans waving gold
``Terrible Towels'' as the final seconds ticked off the clock at
Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (the Steelers) called it another home game,'' Bell said.
``That's ridiculous when you have a visiting team come in and have
more fans than the actual home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm on the other side, it's motivating to me. Because
when you travel, you have to carry a different mentality. It so
happens that we're home, but I have to take that mentality with me
out there on Sunday like it's an away game because I'm sure there
will be a lot of Steeler fans there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell said both teams view the AFC Central Division game
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pittsburgh didn't really push it as a rivalry,'' he said.
``Here, I'm seeing a different side of it. I'll really be able to
tell Wednesday when we go out to practice and see the guys flying
around. I'm going to be out there trying to mix it up a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever it takes to get our practices up-tempo and
get these guys ready to go. Because I'm going to be ready. We need
to start winning some games.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11, 203-pound Bell has a reputation as a hitter. Now
he gets a chance to tackle Pittsburgh's 250-pound tailback, Jerome
``The Bus'' Bettis, who runs behind a line anchored by perennial
Pro Bowl center Dermontti Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret about it,'' Bell said. ``They're coming in
and trying to run The Bus left and right behind Dermontti. You've
got to wrap him up because he's a load. We have to gang-tackle this
guy and get after him from play one.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he calls Steelers head coach Bill Cowher ``a cocky guy
who believes his way is the right way,'' Bell was careful not to
provide any bulletin board ammunition for his former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Cowher will read the papers,'' Bell said. ``I don't
want to get them more pumped up than they're already going to be.
We need every little edge we can get.''

 &HT;    Ranking Crip clings to hope for a new life
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Azikiwe Devaughn Daniels' journey into gangs
started like most others.
</P>
<P>
   He joined at 13, not because he wanted to be a criminal, but, as
he explains it, ``because all my childhood friends were in the
Crips. I didn't want to be left out.''
</P>
<P>
   So after rejecting gang membership for a year, the lanky kid
from Houston's South Park neighborhood, a kid who had played Little
League baseball and later would be a promising wide receiver on his
high school football team, signed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sense of belonging,'' says Daniels, now 23. ``It was
like family.''
</P>
<P>
   His gang _ known as 52nd Street Hoover, a neighborhood group of
Crips called a set _ soon became his identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hung with them all the time,'' he said. ``We got into it
with other Crips. There was fighting, drive-bys (shootings), all
that. The bad side of it was not knowing what to expect next.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in that world of drug deals and street crime, Daniels
said, he developed ``a thing for pistols,'' an attraction that
would prove fatal to his freedom in 1992, when he was convicted of
murdering a street rival and sentenced to 26 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The man he shot?
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl. I can't remember his name. He was an older dude, about
30,'' Daniels said. ``He wasn't anything. It all started out behind
the drug trade. He was shorting my money. He was working with me. .
. . Then he shot up my house, and so I shot him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas prison system, Daniels said, he faced a new world,
a world where racial and ethnic tensions are a stark reality. ``I
see myself as more aggressive now. I have more animosity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some days, Daniels said, he vented that aggression toward other
convicts whom he assaulted or toward prison guards when he refused
work assignments. He continued to wear his gang ID proudly, last
year gaining a promotion to YG _ Young Gangster in the Crips'
hierarchy, a step above BG (baby gangster), a soldier-level rank at
which all members enter the gang. He is now a step below the
revered leadership title of OG (old gangster).
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Daniels is a ranking Crip in the Estelle prison
unit, where he is incarcerated. Even so, he says, he eventually
wants out of the gang life.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he has a son, 7, and a daughter, 6, whom he does not
want to join a gang _ ``not if I can help it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he eventually gets out of prison, Daniels said, he wants to
go into the music business _ and stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't advise it to anyone,'' he says of gang life. ``The
love you're looking for is not there. . . . This life is not what
I'm looking for.''

 &HT;    NCR touts program that gives consumers peek at files
 &HT;    By Jim Dillon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ NCR Corp., which has made millions of dollars
helping big corporations gather huge amounts of personal data about
consumers, is now touting ways for the public to control how that
information is used.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new privacy initiative that NCR unveiled on Monday,
consumers may be able to access corporate databases that contain
information about them and control who else may see it. But it's up
to NCR's customers to actually extend that ability to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Such large retailers as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co.
use NCR's Teradata software and the company's large computer
systems to build so-called data warehouses. Companies use these big
computer systems to track consumer purchases and preferences and
develop their marketing and advertising campaigns, among other
things, based on the information.
</P>
<P>
   With the new privacy safeguards, consumers could obtain reports
detailing the amount and type of information a company has gathered
on them, govern how the information can be distributed, and correct
any inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   NCR believes it is the first data warehouse provider to offer
such safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining consumer privacy has become a major concern
worldwide as more businesses gather and share information about
their customers. Companies like NCR are on the firing line because
their large systems make it possible to catalog and manage huge
amounts of information gathered from consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses such as NCR are eager to develop and adopt their own
privacy safeguards before governments do it for them. Privacy
safeguards also could boost electronic commerce because consumers
would be more willing to do business electronically if they knew
their privacy was protected.
</P>
<P>
   NCR officials said they took action because of privacy
regulations in Europe that take effect later this month, coupled
with lawmakers' desire to boost consumer privacy laws in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that these are coming forth, and . . . we see
ways to help our customers'' comply with the new regulations as
well, said Robert Henderson, vice president of scalable data
warehouse program management for NCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we're the first company to step up and bring
consumer privacy to data warehousing,'' said Chris Hankin, director
of government affairs for NCR. ``The biggest driver is the need for
corporations to maintain and build consumers' trust in electronic
commerce, and this is the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Hendricks, editor of the Washington, D.C.-based Privacy
Times Newsletter, called NCR's new initiative a ``good first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Data warehousing raises many privacy concerns about companies
gathering information on individuals without their knowledge and
consent,'' Hendricks said. ``So if NCR is developing software (that
offers more privacy), that's good news.

 &HT;    Wright to hit batters: 'too bad'
 &HT;    By Tom Withers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jaret Wright likes to pitch inside _ high and inside.
And if his 95 mph fastball happens to thump a batter on the arm or
the hand or in the head, that's just too bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am out there trying to get outs,'' he said Monday. ``I am
out there trying to keep my team in the ballgame, and you know, it
is baseball, people get hit sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright's tendency to hit people _ notably ones wearing Yankee
pinstripes _ has earned him the reputation as a head hunter, a
label he says is unfair and one serving as a major subplot as the
Cleveland Indians prepare to face New York in the AL championship
series.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who will start Game 1 against David Wells, and the
Yankees have a history. A history and some bad blood.
</P>
<P>
   As a self-assured 21-year-old rookie last October, Wright helped
end the Yankees' season by beating them twice in the division
series. With the world watching and the Bronx breathing down his
neck, he showed poise beyond his years in winning Game 2 in Yankee
Stadium. He followed that by winning the decisive fifth game at
Jacobs Field to move the Indians into their second World Series in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Wright admits he grew up a little bit on the walk from the
Indians' bullpen to the center stage in New York that night. It's a
walk that has unnerved the steadiest veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the mound for the first time in the first inning I
remembered how loud it was, and how much the crowd is into it here
on every pitch and how much they don't like the opposition,'' he
said. ``But it was a great experience for me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was Cleveland's postseason poster boy, a fresh-faced
California kid who could charm a room full of reporters as easily
as he could fire a fastball at nearly 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, however, think they know a different Jaret Wright.
They identify him as the punk who intentionally hit Luis Sojo
during spring training, breaking the infielder's hand, and the one
who threw at Paul O'Neill in a June 19 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, no doubt,'' Sojo said Monday when asked if he thought
Wright was aiming at him last March in Winter Haven, Fla. ``If I
didn't lift my hand up, it would have hit me in the head. That's
why I was so upset. You can't be a head hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two words led to some testiness and verbal brushbacks on
Monday as both teams worked out at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming names, Wells insinuated that Wright head hunted
and New York manager Joe Torre said the right-hander ``throws . . .
uses both sides of the plate. . . . He is very aggressive, very
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wells' comments were relayed to Cleveland manager Mike
Hargrove, he defended his young pitching star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to get into a word battle with David Wells,''
he said. ``David Wells is very good at what he does. He is a very
good pitcher. He needs to stick with that. . . . Jaret is not a
head hunter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright tried to defuse any controversy about his relationship
with the Yankees, choosing instead to focus on the job ahead. He
wouldn't elaborate on the Sojo incident or the one with O'Neill in
Cleveland when the two stared at each other while plate umpire John
Shulock escorted the Yankees outfielder to first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not much I can say about that,'' he said when asked if
he thought the Yankees held a personal vendetta against him. ``I
don't think we need to turn this thing into anything more than it
is. It's about the third time I have been asked about whether I'm
hitting people or not. . . . But it's nothing, it's not a revenge
factor or anything like that. I don't think.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright went 12-10 during the regular season, 2-1 vs. New York.
He lost his only start here on June 14, allowing six hits and three
runs in six innings. Last week, he didn't think he would have a
chance to face the Yankees or anyone else after lasting just 4 1-3
innings in an 11-3 loss to the Red Sox in Game 1 of the division
series.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indians rallied to win the series, and Tuesday night
Wright will again take the mound at Yankee Stadium and attempt to
beat baseball's best team. Every eye will carefully follow every
pitch. Especially the ones on the inside corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, inside is part of my game, and I am not trying to hurt
anybody or hit anybody,'' he said. ``This is just the way I was
taught to pitch. Hopefully I can get a couple of outs, you know,
pitching inside.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes people get hit.

DODGERS GET OK TO SPEAK TO ALOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers finally received permission Monday to
speak to Montreal manager Felipe Alou after the province of Quebec
rejected the Expos' request for $150 million to help build a new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone waited almost a week to
hear back from Expos president Claude Brochu about Alou, who is
expected to replace Glenn Hoffman as manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to speak with Felipe soon and meet with him
in the next couple of days and see if we can move forward,'' Malone
said. ``He is the leading candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, 63, is in his native Dominican Republic assessing the
damage of last week's Hurricane Georges, which hit his home.
Malone, the former Montreal GM, will fly there on Wednesday for
face-to-face discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand his position with the Expos, but I feel he can be
an integral part of baseball in Los Angeles,'' said Malone, who
knows Alou's wife and in-laws are from Montreal. ``He would bring a
tremendous amount of stability, leadership and optimism. I am
encouraged by who he is and what he represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal was hoping to get better news Monday on a proposed
downtown stadium when Brochu and baseball commissioner Bud Selig
met with Quebec's prime minister Lucien Bouchard. They were seeking
$75 million from the provincial government and $75 million from the
federal government to build a complex considered essential for the
Expos' survival in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   When Brochu learned the money wasn't coming, he called Malone.
Brochu offered Alou a contract extension last week and could have
said no to the Dodgers since Alou has one year and $600,000 left on
his Expos deal.
</P>
<P>
   Until this season, Montreal had remained competitive despite a
payroll consistently below $15 million. Under Malone and Alou in
1994, Montreal had the best record in baseball (74-40) when labor
strife shut down the sport and canceled the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Expos tried to develop some stability by
signing young players Vladimir Guerrero (five years, $28 million)
and Ugueth Urbina (four years, $15 million) to long-term contracts.
But the future in Montreal is believed to hinge on the club getting
the new stadium, which now appears unlikely. There is a good chance
the club will be sold and moved.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, with an expected 1999 payroll of $70-75 million,
have their own problems. Their payroll is loaded with multi-year
contracts, limiting Malone's flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   After he hires a manager, Malone must decide what he can do with
third baseman Bobby Bonilla, who was unproductive after coming over
from Florida in the May 15 Mike Piazza trade. Bonilla, 35, has two
years left on his contract worth $11.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   But for now the top priority is hiring a manager and coaching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he spoke twice to Jim Leyland _ who was hired to
manage the Colorado Rockies Monday, a week after resigning as
manager of the Florida Marlins. But Malone knew Leyland was not
keen on coming to Los Angeles, since his family, which lives
outside Pittsburgh, thought even Miami was too far a commute.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he will not speak to any other candidates until he
gets an answer from Alou.

CUNNINGHAM AND VIKINGS PICK THE PACKERS APART IN THE RAIN

   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ It is time to start talking about how the
offense of the Minnesota Vikings may be one of the best of all
time.
</P>
<P>
   After the Vikings pounded the Green Bay Packers Monday night on
national television, much of America got to see what the rest of
the National Football League has suspected for months _ that
Minnesota, behind an awesome offensive attack, is the favorite to
represent the National Football Conference in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That is what a 37-24 victory against the top-ranked defense in
the league before 59,849 at Lambeau Field _ where the Packers had
won 29 straight games _ will do. By sending the Packers to their
first loss of the season, the Vikings, at 5-0, are now the only
undefeated team in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Randall Cunningham, who quarterbacked the best game of
his career, the Vikings amassed more than 500 yards of offense,
with Cunningham going to wide receivers Cris Carter, Jake Reed and
the rookie-of-the-year lock, Randy Moss. Cunningham hit those three
for six passes of at least 30 yards. The Vikings had big catches
for 56 yards (a Reed touchdown), 52 yards (a Moss touchdown), 41
yards (Moss), 33 yards (Carter), 46 yards (Moss) and 44 yards
(another Moss touchdown). Moss finished with five catches for 190
yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who threw for four touchdowns, completed 20 of 31
passes for 442 yards _ the most ever against the Packers. The last
person to throw for more than 400 yards against Green Bay was Joe
Montana in 1990, when he passed for 411.
</P>
<P>
   What about that supposedly suspect Minnesota defense? Green
Bay's offense did not score a touchdown until the game was out of
hand. Brett Favre, who came into this game as maybe the hottest
quarterback in the NFL, was just 13 of 23 for 114 yards and three
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of those shocking, possible season-changing games.
If the Packers aren't careful, this loss could hurt the rest of
their season. The Vikings could use the victory to propel them to a
special year.
</P>
<P>
   While many fans and members of the news media focused on the
Vikings' impressive arsenal _ Carter, Reed and Moss as well as
running back Robert Smith _ the Packers' defensive staff, one of
the best in the league, quietly focused all week on Cunningham, the
man who would be throwing the ball to those players.
</P>
<P>
   Older and wiser, Cunningham, 35, has become more patient in the
pocket. Still, the Packers felt they could confuse Cunningham with
a variety of zone coverages. If those did not work, then they
planned to blitz Cunningham up the middle, because the Packers felt
he still did not respond well to pressure and would get rid of the
football as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers wanted to make Cunningham read all sorts of
coverages. If he figured them out, so be it. But Green Bay was
betting he would not, which would mean interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's first drive was indicative of what would go on all
game. The Packers indeed did a variety of things to try to confuse
Cunningham. They played defensive end Reggie White at nose tackle
to get pressure up the middle. They blitzed a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham was not fazed, however, and the Vikings showed why
they have the most deadly offense in the game. They often went to
four wide receivers. They used screen passes to Smith, threw bombs
to Moss and used reverses by the speedy running back David Palmer.
Cunningham would be surrounded by defenders, then calmly take two
steps into the pocket and deliver a strike. The Packers' blitzers
did not get near Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's first drive went 65 yards in 14 plays and ate seven
minutes off the clock. It ended with a 33-yard field goal by Gary
Anderson as the Vikings elected to put points on the board rather
than go for the first down on fourth-and-1. Green Bay then tied the
score with a 40-yard field goal by Ryan Longwell.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, getting more protection than a Brinks armored car,
dealt what to most teams would have been a demoralizing blow,
throwing a 56-yard bomb to Reed, who had spun cornerback Craig
Newsome like a top. But the Packers rarely get rattled, as they
demonstrated on the kickoff return when Roell Preston, behind a
wall of blockers, scampered 101 yards to tie the score at 10-10. It
was his second 100-yard kick return for a touchdown this year, the
other going for 100 yards against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the Packers were right back in the game, but the
Vikings' offense was too powerful. They responded with three
incredible plays. The first was another bomb to Moss, this one for
a touchdown of 52 yards. On another drive, Cunningham threw a
41-yard pass to Moss as he outjumped double coverage and gave
Minnesota the ball at the Green Bay 24-yard line. Two plays later,
Smith scored on a 24-yard screen pass to give Minnesota a 24-10
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that play, thunderstorms rolled through the area,
turning the field into a mess.
