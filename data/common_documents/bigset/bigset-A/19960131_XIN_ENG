<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council decided today to deploy 100 military observers
for a period of six months in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and
Western Sirmium of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
According to a resolution adopted unanimously this morning, the
council decided to authorize the deployment of the military
observers as part of the United Nations Transitional
Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium
(UNTAES).
</P>
<P>
On January 15, 1996, the Security Council adopted a resolution
to establish UNTAES with the military component of 5,000 troops in
the initial period.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the Security Council on January
26, Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and his military staff
recommended deployment of 100 U.N. military observers for period
of six months in order to enable UNTAES to supervise and
facilitate the demilitarization process.

The military observers would identify the units and equipment
to be demilitarized and monitor and verify the implementation of
the demilitarization undertaken by the parties. They would also
report on any developments relevant to the maintenance of peace
and security in the region, according to the secretary-general.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Parliament Endorses 1996 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 31 (Xinhua) -- After six days of debate, noisy
quarrels and even personal attacks, the Lebanese parliament
endorsed today the 1996 budget, the largest budget in the
country's history, which amounts to 6,450 billion Lebanese pounds
(four billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In his story dispatched from the Parliament Building, a
correspondent of the state-run National News Agency described
today's session of the country's unicameral house as "the most
heated and witnessing violent confrontations between some deputies
and the government on problems, some of which are related to the
budget, most far away from it."
</P>
<P>
Members of the parliament voted the budget item by item, with
the opposition by several deputies, and a call by two members for
a return of the budget to the government for "its
unconstitutionality and incorrectness."
</P>
<P>
On the last day of the 128-seat parliament's first general
assembly in 1996, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri and
three key ministers in his government made responses over
questions raised by dozens of deputies in the previous days on
the budget and on the government's policies.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers closely following the parliamentary
affairs said that today's session was characterized by "hot
arguments going several times beyond a framework of the interior
system of the Council of Deputies."
</P>
<P>
They reported that the hottest discussions were on two
points. One was raised by Justice Minister Bahij Tabbara, who was
under fire with charges of corruption in the judicial corps and
allegations of human rights violations including an extensive
utilization of torturing means by the police. The other was raised
by Information Minister Farid Mkari, who has become a target of
public criticism because of a controversial broadcast media law.
</P>
<P>
Mkari's speech instigated a chaos in the Parliament Hall and
Deputy Fouad As-Saad asked a retraction of the speech and met an
agreement of the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
And "very heated' discussions between Justice Minister Tabbara
and Deputy Najah Wakim, a sharp critic of Rafik Al Hariri's
government, led to a "surprising" hand-in of an oral resignation
of the angry MP, the first dramatic interlude in 24 years,
according to the political observers.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hot scenes witnessed in the Parliament Building in
the past five days, the observers commonly had predicted in
advance a pass to be given by the house to the budget.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hariri's government argued that the budget is
"the first and important step in the process of ending an increase
of the public debt" which the government considers as a "heavy
burden" to carry on Hariri's ambitious reconstruction plan.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating an increasing income, the government promises in
the new budget to reduce in the coming fiscal year the deficit to
37 percent from the present level of 47 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador Predicts No Breakthrough in Christopher Shuttle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Israel
Martin Indyk said today that no breakthrough should be expected
from a shuttle mission between Israel and Syria next week by
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv,
Indyk revealed that the current negotiations between Israel and
Syria at Wye Plantation, Maryland have been "extensive" and
"intensive."
</P>
<P>
Serious discussion is underway and it will be unrealistic to
expect a quick solution to the Israeli-Syrian peace track, he
added. "It takes time and patience," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the legacy of the late Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin for the Middle East peace cause, Indyk noted the
reality that Rabin's assassin has come from Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
Yigal Amir, a 25-year-old law student from the university,
shot dead Rabin on November 4, 1995 in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Ambassador revealed that one week before he was
assassinated, Rabin called on the U.S. administration to prepare
for a paper on security arrangements on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Indyk said the U.S. government will be ready to consider this
possibility when both Israel and Syria so decide. However, he
said that "the time has not yet come to table such a paper and
we should continue the discussion."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called for a summit meeting between Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
"We had realized in fact in the first days of our
administration that a meeting between President al-Assad and Prime
Minister Rabin, or Prime Minister Peres, was absolutely critical
to the achievement of an agreement between them, and we will
continue to press on al-Assad (for such a summit)," said Indyk.
</P>
<P>
"He (al-Assad) has responded positively to us. He understands
that the leaders must meet, but it needs to be done at an
appropriate time. He does not want to have any meeting that does
not have a positive result because that will be destructive to
the peace process," he added.

<HEADLINE> Study: Military Strength Imbalanced in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- There is a great military
imbalance in Cyprus between the Republic's National Guard in
the southern government-controlled areas and the Turkish forces in
the northern part of the island, according to a study by a Greek
Cypriot military expert.
</P>
<P>
The study was contained in a book titled "Greece, Turkey
and Cyprus -- The Military Balance 1995/96 Arms, Doctrines and
Disarmament", written by Aristos Aristotelous, President of
the Cyprus Center for Strategic Studies. The book was made
available to the public here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study says the comparison between the Cyprus National
Guard and the Turkish forces shows "a clear Turkish superiority both
in military personnel as well as military equipment".
</P>
<P>
"But recent improvement in military equipment in the National
Guard and the expected assistance from Greece, as well as
the creation of further bases which will enhance Greek naval
and air support, will strengthen Cyprus' military capabilities,"
the study added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
the Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of northern third of the island following a
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup aimed at seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, Turkey maintains around 32,000 troops
in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Turkish troops had about 300 improved main battle
tanks, mainly type M-48A5 of U.S. origin. They also had 200
armored personnel vehicles of type M-113 and M-59, about 10
armored infantry fighting vehicles, artillery, mortars, anti-tank
and anti-aircraft weapons, eight aircraft units and 12
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Because of the proximity of Cyprus to Turkey, the Turkish
military forces in the northern part of the island have full
coverage and support from the naval and air force bases of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The study estimated the expenditure of the Turkish forces
during 1994 at about 510 million dollars, which represents seven
percent of the total defense expenditure of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot forces are estimated to be about 4,400.
They have seven infantry battalions with very light equipment
and three patrol crafts. The Turkish Cypriot reservists, who
serve until the age of 50, numbered around 26,000 of which
11,000 are for the front line.
</P>
<P>
In the southern government-controlled area, according to the
study, during the 1995-96 period, the strength of the
Republic's armed forces, the National Guard, was about
10,000-13,000, including female staff.
</P>
<P>
The island's military personnel serving in the National Guard
was 1.5 percent of a total population of 644,100. There are 55
National Guards men per kilometer along the dividing line (183
kilometers).
</P>
<P>
The total number of Greek Cypriot reservists is between
85,000-90,000, of whom only 45,000 attend regular training
programs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the National Guard has 52 main battle tanks of
AMX-30B-2 type and 52 more AMX-30'S are expected to be added in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot forces have nothing significant to show
as regards the navy or the air force besides two patrol
craft and two training aircraft as well as a small fleet of
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the defense expenditure, the study
says that the 1995 defense expenditure of the Cyprus Republic
was estimated to be about 490 million dollars or 5.4 percent of
the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but actual expenditure was
expected to be around 4 per cent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The Republic's 1996 defense budget is estimated to be
around 410 million dollars or 4.5 percent of the GDP. The per
capita expenditure for defense in Cyprus last year was 509
dollars compared to 609 dollars in 1994 and 713 dollars in
1993.

The index, based on a survey of 5,000 households nationwide,
stood at the 110.1 average of the final four months of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Respondents also showed no much confidence in the future,
projecting economic conditions six to nine months down the road.
</P>
<P>
Consumers were dampened by a number of events. They included
the snowstorm on the East Coast, the lengthy shutdown of the
government, the prolonged battle over a balanced budget, and
recent lay off announcements by big companies such as AT and T
Corp. and Apple Computer Inc., according to the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales, including autos, rose just 0.3 percent in
December to 198.6 billion U.S. dollars, up 3.4 percent from a year
ago, according to statistics of the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts had expected sales to rise at least 0.5 percent
or 0.7 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The latest economic data comes as the Federal Reserve begins a
two-day meeting to consider cutting interest rates for the second
time in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
These enhanced the expectations of analysts and investors for
an interest cutting by the Fed later today and sent share prices
on the New York stock exchange to record highs yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Economists believed that the reduce of interest rates will cut
the cost of investment and consequently help boost national
economy, which is now on the path to slow growth.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said that retail industry, which
supports at least half of the U.S. economy, is not expected to
rebound in the very near future.

<HEADLINE> Afrikaans Not Under Threat, Says Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today went out of his way to quell fears that
Afrikaans would disappear or be downgraded.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Afrikaan women's organizations at his Pretoria
official residence, Mandela denied that the African National
Congress (ANC) wanted to do away with Afrikaans in schools and
universities.
</P>
<P>
"Reports in this regard are a scandalous distortion," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told the women he also objected to a recent
parliamentary committee instruction that Afrikaans were no longer
used in the South African National Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 14 Afrikaan women's organizations were
invited to raise their concerns with Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"We all know there are schools in predominantly
Afrikaan-speaking areas," Mandela said, adding it was logical for
Afrikaans to be the dominant medium of instruction in such
schools.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the ANC did not object to Afrikaan-speaking
students being instructed in their own language.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is a multi-lingual country, with 11 official
languages including English and Afrikaan spoken by the residents
in different areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela assured the women that government funds had to be
used as effectively as possible to ensure that all students from
all language groups were treated in a just way.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- With a standoff about the current fiscal year's budget
continuing, the White House is merely submitting an outline of its
spending plan for the 1997 fiscal year rather than the normal
2,000-page document.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has tried to help cool Aegean anger
between Turkey and Greece, both NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
__ The U.S. economy entered the new year on a dismal note as
the holiday shopping season was even worse for retailers than most
Wall Street economists had expected and consumers' confidence in
the economy sank to the lowest level in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Adm. Joseph Prueher has won Senate confirmation to
command U.S. forces in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac says that the time has come
to revamp the Atlantic alliance and create a more equal
partnership with the United States in which a uniting Europe will
assume greater responsibility for its own security.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street:
</P>
<P>
-- Stock prices jumped again on continued optimism that the
U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates today to prod the
economy.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. General Motor Corp., buoyed by cost-cutting in its
North American auto operations and by an unusually low tax rate,
reported higher-than expected fourth-quarter earnings.

<HEADLINE> Iran's FM Breaks with President's Camp (by Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati today broke rank with the President's camp by
announcing that he opposed the publication of a list of candidates
proposed by other ministers for parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Velayati's statement was carried in evening newspaper
Kayhan. In the statement, he said he was against the publication
of the list because it would create the appearance of
impropriety.
</P>
<P>
Velayati is the first minister in President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani's cabinet to voice his objection to a
proposed list of candidates by four vice-presidents, 10 ministers
and two other top officials known as G-16 on January 18.
</P>
<P>
"Their list of candidates would lead to the suspicion that
these are ministers with financial resources and necessary clout
who have all the resources to peddle their influence," he said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
"Right from the beginning, I believed that as ministers and
the members of the Executive Branch we should not propose a
list (of candidates) like others who are free from executive
responsibilities," he added.
</P>
<P>
Even though the list was never made public, it drew much
criticism by conservative rightists, who control the parliament,
to the effect of fueling the worst possible political feud ever
since the death of religious leader Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The conflict reached its apex point last week when a member of
parliament belonging to the influential Society of Combatant
Clergy (SCC) threatened to impeach the president for his lack of
competence to keep the ministers in check.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei intervened Sunday calling
for calmness before the elections, adding that a statement
earlier by the G-16 did not constitute any insult to the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that a Tuesday night banquet given by
Rafsanjani in honor of the MP's served as only a show of unity of
a fragile unity between Iran's moderate president and the
ultra-conservative Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
In a related development today, the G-16 issued a second
statement saying that obliging the orders given by Khamenei, the
government ministers would not field candidates for the
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
They added that they had received the permission from
Khamenei that from now on only the vice-presidents and other
officials, excluding the ministers, would put forward their list of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
"With the permission of His Eminence [Khamenei] the G-16
candidates would be presented with the approval of the vice-
presidents and other officials who are not holding any
ministerial position," the statement read.
</P>
<P>
An MP from Neishabour today said that Khamenei was opposed
to the ministers' releasing of a list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
Hossein Sobhani-Niya said in Iran News, an English daily, that
Khamenei had said "I am basically opposed to the ministers
releasing a list of candidates."
</P>
<P>
"It is totally illogical for the ministers to introduce
candidates. It is as though the ministers would want to appoint
the president," Khamenei added, according to Sobhani-Niya.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that revelation today by Velayati, who
is said to be a Khamenei protege, has made it clear
why other ministers did not sign the G-16 first and second
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Only 10 out of 22 in Rafsanjani's cabinet signed the
joint statement. This shows that his cabinet is divided in
their loyalties. Half of them support Rafsanjani and the other
half Support Khamenei," one observer said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here maintain that the differences have flared up within
the ruling factions and the focal point of the power struggle
is to win the majority of the 270-seat Parliament and then
the presidential post in June 1997.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Minister Disputes With Court Ruling On  Pay Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Ninister Ronald
Penza today described the Industrial Relations Court's
clarification on the 45 percent pay increment for civil servants
as an irresponsible judgement.
</P>
<P>
The disputed judgement will throw the current economic
adjustment program into doldrums since the government has no
money to meet the pay increase.
</P>
<P>
The government will not go out to print money to pay the civil
servants, Penza stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Relations Court clarified on Monday that its
ruling on the 45 percent salary increase for the public service
workers last November is separated from the 30 percent pay
increment which the government awarded to civil servants in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It means that the government has to increase salary and wage
of the public workers by 75 percent from the 1994 level.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the government argued that the 30 percent pay
increment effected in January 1994 should be included in the 45
percent increase ruled by the court last November.

<P>
Kirui also said that the KWS through the community wildlife
service program is striving to reduce human/wildlife conflicts by
putting up electric fences in wildlife invested areas.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is highly commended for its protection of distinct
animals. Meanwhile residents in rural areas suffer a lot from

<HEADLINE> More Damage in Qinghai Blizzard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIEGU, Qinghai Province, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Prolonged low
temperatures and gale-force winds have continued to cause damage
in the Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in northwest China's
Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The number of livestock dead or injured, and the number of
herdsmen suffering from frostbite or lack of food has risen
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds halted traffic between Jiegu, capital of the
prefecture, and Zado and Zhido counties for several days. For more
than two months, the snowstorm has blocked highways between the
two counties and four townships, where more than 17,000 herdsmen
have lost contact with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, temperatures in 19 of the heaviest-hit
townships have dropped to minus 40 centigrade or lower.
</P>
<P>
By January 29, 442,600 head of livestock had died, causing 170
million yuan in losses; 14,690 people in 2,795 families had used
up food supplies; and 13,282 people were suffering from snow
blindness and frostbite.
</P>
<P>
To rescue those stranded by the blizzard, which has lasted
since October, the local government has organized several groups
to clear roads to Zado, Zhido, and four remote townships.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been hampered, however, resulting in slow going,
as the storm continues to cover roads that have just been opened.
</P>
<P>
The disaster has attracted wide-spread attention. Vice-premier
Jiang Chunyun has called to ask about the effects of the disaster
and military aircraft have been sent to drop supplies.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life in Qinghai have donated money and
other items to help the victims, and more relief supplies are on
their way to the disaster-stricken area.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
planning to conduct random raids against corporate users of
pirated software in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Ron Eckstrom, vice president of the Business Software Alliance
(BSA), a Washington-based organization representing leading
software publishers, said today that among the culprits are some
banks, insurance companies and public relations firms.
</P>
<P>
He said that BSA has submitted "compelling evidence" against
several Philippine firms to the National Bureau of Investigation,
which will conduct the raids.
</P>
<P>
Despite a sustained crackdown, he said, "the level of illegal
software sold in the Philippines continues at an unacceptably high
rate."
</P>
<P>
Last year, complaints against the Philippines by the
International Intellectual Property Alliance derailed Manila's
request to be removed from Washington's list of copyright
violators.
</P>
<P>
This prompted Philippine President Fidel Ramos to order all
government agencies to "purchase legitimate software."

BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Trade between the European

</P>
<P>
The EU-Russia Interim Trade Agreement, due to come into effect
February 1, is the trade-related part of a broader pact, the
Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed in Corfu, Greece in
June 1994.
</P>
<P>
"This Interim Agreement will create a better and more
predictable environment for business and it will foster the
development of trade and investment links between the EU and
Russia," the European Commission spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will give the EU better access to the Russian
market for such products as cars and alcoholic beverages. Russia
will readjust a whole range of quantitative import restrictions
and provide more effective protection of the EU's intellectual,
industrial and commercial property rights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian exports to the EU will be facilitated by the
abolition of several quantitative restrictions. The scope of
certain qualitative measures, such as anti-dumping and safety
rules, will also be reduced substantially.
</P>
<P>
The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement is undergoing
ratification procedures in some EU national parliaments as well as
in the Russian Duma.

BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- National player Hu Weidong's 11
three-pointers failed to prevent the visiting Jiangsu team from
losing its 15th round game against the August First in the Chinese
Basketball League on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hu scored a game high 43 points in the match in Shanghai,
almost half of Zhejiang's 89 against 128 for the August First, the
only team remained unbeaten in the league.
</P>
<P>
The August First, with superior skills, led the halftime 69-38.
</P>
<P>
But Wang Fei, head coach of the August First, was not satisfied
with the defence of their players. "We should have laid our
emphasis of defence on Hu," Wang said. Hu had nine successive
nine pointers in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's head coach Ma Dehua adimited the gap between the two
teams. "Our aim is to learn from our opponents, which are much
stronger than us in skill and tactics," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
In Hangzhou, the Shenyang Army and Zhejiang played a

Shenyang came from behind to take the lead at halftime with

<P>
CAIRO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian security authorities
have arrested 45 terrorists on charges of plotting to carry out
terrorist acts during the Lesser Bairam holidays, the Middle East
News Agency (MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted a security source at the Ministry of Interior as
saying that all of the terrorists were arrested in northern
Egypt, with 11 of them in Alexandria, 24 in Port Said and the
other 10 in the governorate of Qalyubia.
</P>
<P>
The arrested are also accused of trying to revive the Jihad
(Holy War) group which killed President Anwar Sadat in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the state security authorities made the
arrests after gathering information about "an attempt by the
terrorist Jihad organization to reorganize some terrorist groups
to undertake acts of sabotage during the Lesser Bairam holidays,"
according to MENA.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said last Thursday that the
security forces were winning a battle against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The government refer Islamic militants as terrorists, who have
launched a violent campaign since 1992 in a bid to topple the
secular government and replace it with strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people, most of them policemen and militants, have
been killed. The government's fierce crackdown on militants have
largely reduced their attacks to remote governorates.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Minister of
Agriculture D. M. Jayaratne today urged people to be calm and
quiet after a huge bomb blast destroyed the building of the
Central Bank in the capital, killing about 100 people and injuring
some 1,400 others.
</P>
<P>
Jayaratne, who is also secretary general of the ruling People's
Alliance, appealed to the people not to harm the Tamil community
as today's bomb blast has been blamed on rebels of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
In an official statement, he reaffirmed the government's pledge
to find a political solution to the country's ethnic problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Colombo-based anti-LTTE Tamil parties issued a
joint statement, accusing the LTTE of renewing violent attacks on
civilians.

SHANGHAI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Customs officials at

</P>
<P>
This is the first recorded incident of someone attempting to

The man was travelling on a Chinese passport and had bought the

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. producer prices rose
0.5 percent in December, matching November's increase, the Labor
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The advance was led by a 3.3 percent surge in energy prices,
the largest since a 7.5 percent jump in October 1990. Until
December, energy costs had fallen for six straight months.
</P>
<P>
Food prices, on the other hand, inched up just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile food and energy component, the so-called
core rate of wholesale inflation rose a tiny 0.1 percent, down
from 0.4 percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
For the year, prices of finished goods at the wholesale level
were up 2.2 percent, slightly more than the 1.7 percent gain in

<HEADLINE> China to Be Biggest Supplier of Rare Earth Magnets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- An agreement between China and
the US to develop rare earth magnets was reached here on January
30, with China being expected to become the world's biggest
supplier.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the Electric Vehicle Group, the
REPTECH, the China National Nuclear Corporation, and the China
National Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation will
produce the magnets and electric vehicles jointly,
</P>
<P>
Scientists have discovered that when rare earth is added to
permanent magnets it can increase their efficiency as much as
ten-fold.
</P>
<P>
Electric vehicles are the biggest users of permanent magnets,
and by the year 2000, trade in electric vehicles will surpass one
trillion US dollars and that of permanent magnets, 100 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
China has 80 percent of the world's rare earth resources. When
this is combined with western technology, China will play an
important role in the field.
</P>
<P>
The United States has shipped 9,000 kg of rare earth powder to
China to be converted into finished products for marketing in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The US Naval Research Lab was granted a patent recently in this
field and the US will invite Chinese scientists and technicians to
work with scientists at the Naval Research Lab at the University
of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
The Electric Vehicle Group comprises more than 20 American
companies, universities and research institutions, including Ford

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Rushing for Foodstuff As Prices Plummet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Iraqis, who have been
accustomed to price hikes for years, are drawn by drastic
decreases of prices and rushing to local markets for badly needed
foodstuff, which were beyond their reach only a few days ago
because of exorbitantly high prices.
</P>
<P>
To the relief of the Iraqis who have suffered enormously due to
a 5-year-old international economic sanction, prices of foodstuff
have plummeted for the past week.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Baghdad's main markets were swarmed with
crowds of cheerful Iraqis, old and young. In Shorja market,
situated in central Baghdad, people from all walks of life are
seen jostling one another to purchase what they think are in
urgent need. Blaring cars and other vehicles are not allowed to
enter the market in order to allow a free movement of the shoppers.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, price for a tray of 30-eggs dropped to
2,500 Iraiq dinars from 6,000 dinars several days ago, a kilogram of
sugar was sold at 500 dinars, down from 1,700 dinars, and a
kilogram of rice from 1500 dinars to 500 dinars, a dramatic
decrease.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi dinar's value against the dollar has
appreciated at an astonishing rate. The exchange rate between
Iraqi dinar and the dollar has been nosediving from more than 2,800
dinars to one dollar only a week ago to today's lowest level of
700 Iraqi dinars to one.
</P>
<P>
This has been the sharpest drop of prices since the
U.N. imposed trade embargo on Iraq to punish it for its 1990
invasion of neighboring Kuwait. Commodity prices in the market
used to go up steadily and the essential foodstuff has gradually
turned into a luxury for ordinary Iraqis, whose average monthly
salary is only 6,000 dinars. Many of them were forced to
moonlight for extra income to support their family, make the two
ends meet and tie over the year.
</P>
<P>
The prices of foodstuff began to drop drastically day by day
shortly after President Saddam Hussein made an announcement
following a meeting with high ranking army officers and senior
government officials. In the announcement, the president said that
his country would respond positively to U.N. Secretary General
Butros Butros-Ghali's proposal for talks with Iraq on a partial
oil sale so as to facilitate Iraq's purchase of foodstuff and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Exhilarated Iraqis celebrated Saddam's decision by firing
intermittent gun-shots into the night sky almost immediately after
the encouraging news was broadcast on state-run TV around midnight
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Ghali has sent Iraq an invitation to enter talks with
the U.N. on implementing U.N. resolution 986, which allows Iraq a
limited quantity of oil sale in exchange for badly needed
foodstuff and medicine.
</P>
<P>
In a swift response, Iraqi deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
extended on January 19 to the U.N. chief Iraq's agreement to enter
the oil-for-food talks with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
Iraqis, now as happy as on a honeymoon, are anxious for a
positive outcome from the first round of the talks between the
U.N. and Iraq, slated to start on February 6.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted, however, that it is still unpredictable
for any progress to be made in the talks unless Iraq makes some
concessions. The U.N. is unlikely to offer any amendment to
resolution 986, which allows Iraq to sell two billion dollars
worth of oil over a span of six months for humanitarian purposes.
</P>
<P>
Ever since U.N. resolution 986 was adopted last April, Iraq has
insisted that the resolution violate its sovereignty and Iraq
could get little from the allowed oil sale for its suffering
people. And finally, the Iraqis became willing to hold the talks.
</P>
<P>
Although Iraq has claimed that it will hold the talks with the
U.N. without prerequisites, any possible switch in Iraq's stance
towards the resolution remains to be seen.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- This leading industrial city in
north China has improved 40 percent of existing large and
mid-sized state-owned enterprises in various ways.
</P>
<P>
One has been the use of large amounts of foreign
investment. The city has used two billion US dollars in upgrading
54 enterprises, or 40 percent of the number improved.
</P>
<P>
The city's industrial sector in 1995 used 780 million US
dollars in foreign contracts.
</P>
<P>
An official with the city's economic working committee said
that foreign investment has helped sharpen the competitive edge of
companies manufacturing telecommunications equipment, integrated
circuits, color TV sets, video recorders, motorcycles, elevators,
automobiles, and automotive spare parts.
</P>
<P>
The transformation drive has dramatically changed state-owned
enterprises. By the end of last year, their production had
increased 10 percent, sales, 20 percent, and pre-tax profits, 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to finish the improvement work in eight years,
to turn the city into a modern industrial production base. To do
so, it has organized 23 enterprise groups, focusing on four pillar
industries: automobiles and machinery, electronics, metallurgy,
and chemicals.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China launched a crackdown on
trademark infringement nationwide during the fourth quarter of
last year, in order to improve protection of trademarks.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhongqiang, vice-director of China's Trademark Bureau, told
a press conference here today that the country's commercial and
industrial administrative offices handled 14,776 cases of
trademark infringement from September through December. Some 40
million yuan in fines and confiscated materials were reported,
with violators having to cover economic losses totaling 3.1
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The government also seized 1,513 "underground mills" which made
and sold fake brand names, confiscated 384 million fake
trademarks, and handed over 180 infringement cases to criminal
courts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the three-month investigation the
country checked on 128,000 stores, 20,000 retailers and wholesale
outlets, 52,000 trademark printing houses, and more than 90,000
manufacturing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a comprehensive investigation was carried out in
the trademark printing sector, which is a major source of the fake
trademarks found on the domestic market. During the investigation,
the trademark printing right of more than 400 printing houses was
revoked.
</P>
<P>
Cao said that the investigation has contributed to the
re-establishment of the market order in the country.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the commercial and industrial administrative
offices will continue to take stern measures against trademark
infringement this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- India's Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) and the Janata Party (JD) Tuesday demanded the
resignation of Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to pave the way
for a fair trial of the hawala case, according to the Times of
India today.
</P>
<P>
Both the two opposition parties made the request in light of
the supreme court's order in the hawala case that every accusation
should be probed expeditiously irrespective of the status and
position of the person concerned.
</P>
<P>
The BJP, the largest opposition party in India, said in a
statement that the supreme court has expressed no confidence in
the government and the CBI and has forbidden the CBI from closing
the investigation against any person without the approval of the
supreme court.
</P>
<P>
Srikant Jena, Janata Dal parliamentary party leader, also said
Tuesday that Rao's resignation had become necessary to enable the
CBI to conduct the probe in an impartial manner as it now
functioned directly under the control of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a four-page order issued on Tuesday, the supreme court said
that no one was above the law and the CBI and other government
agencies should fairly, properly and fully investigate into every
accusation against every person in the hawala case.

withdraw their naval units from around a disputed island in the
eastern Aegean at 6:00 a.m. local time, Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos and Defence Minister Gerassimos Arsenis
announced today.
</P>
<P>
After night-long negotiations brokered by the United States,
the two sides decided to withdraw their forces to defuse tensions.

During the night, Greek Prime Minister Constantine Simitis
exchanged views with U.S. President Bill Clinton in a telephone

with their American counterparts on the phone.
</P>
<P>
Arsenis said "we are returning to the status quo" and the
conflict "has ended without harm to Greece's sovereign rights."
</P>
<P>
The standoff between the two traditionally hostile
countries started last weekend, when three Turkish journalists
landed on the deserted rock island of Imia by helicopter, took

<HEADLINE> China Dealing with Foreign Trademark Infringement Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration for
Commerce and Industry (SAIC) today revealed 10 cases of trademark
infringement uncovered in the last quarter of 1995, seven of which
involved foreign trademarks.
</P>
<P>
In October, the Bureau of Commerce and Industry of Zhongshan
City, Guangdong Province, raided an underground factory and
discovered 5,700 boxes of fake ESSO and Shell oil, and 54,000
empty containers.
</P>
<P>
Acting in accordance with the trade mark law, the bureau seized
the fake products and fined the factory 286,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Early in September, acting on complaints of Exxon in the United
States, authorities in Guangdong seized 7,000-some boxes of fake
ESSO and Mobil oil in a motorcycle parts company in Sanshui
City. The case was turned over to the local procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
In November, the Bureau of Commerce and Industry of Wuxi City
in Jiangsu Province investigated a local telecommunication factory
and found that it had produced 836 walkie-talkie cases using the
Motorola trademark and had sold 798 of them, since July 1994.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with provisions of the trademark law, the bureau
ordered the factory to stop its illegal actions and remove the
Motorola name from cases still in stock, and fined it 60,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In October, Beijing's Municipal Bureau of Commerce and Industry
raided two garment and cloth markets and confiscated 1.81 million
fake zippers using the trademark of Japan's YKK Company.
</P>
<P>
Other cases include illegal use of the following
trademarks: the Singer Company, by the Jiangsu New Times Industry
and Trade Company; "Crocodile" of France's Lacoste, by two
Shanghai companies; and Toshiba, Marlboro, "555", and other
foreign trademarks, by the Wuzhou Printing House in Shantou City
of Guangdong Province. All the violators have been dealt with in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Cao Zhongqiang, vice-director of the Trademark Bureau of SAIC
said at a press conference here today that China will continue its
efforts to protect foreign trademark owners.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer with YKK said that the action by SAIC in Beijing shows
the Chinese government's determination to protect intellectual
property rights and would help improve China's investment
environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A newly selected Hong Kong
rugby team will clash with a South Korean side here next week in
hopes to warm up for this year's Asian Championships, the Hong
Kong Rugby Football Union (HKRFU) announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will play two matches on February 4 and 8, and
the two-day event, with a prelude between a Hong Kong developing
players' side and the South Koreans, is the first event this year
for Hong Kong, said Stuart Leckie, chairman of the HKRFU.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong team is facing what Leckie described as a "very
serious program" this year.
</P>
<P>
After the invitationals here, the Hong Kong team will take a
competition trip to Fiji in March and participate in the Catty
Pacific Hong Kong Bank Sevens, a highlight of the sport this year
in Hong Kong, at the last weekend of March.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong team will compete in the Japan Sevens in Tokyo in
April and May, which will feature eight countries and regions
around the Pacific Rim -- Canada, the United States, Argentina,
Japan, Hong Kong, Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa, Leckie said.
</P>
<P>
And then will come the Asian Championships in October in
Taipei, and the Taipei Sevens in November.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong players will be clad with a brand new uniform,

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Not to Inject Resources into Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
would try not to inject any resources into the United Bank Limited
(UBL), which is in the process of privatization, said a senior
official here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a technical presentation, Naveed Qamar, chairman of
Privatization Commission (PC), said it was a principle to try not
to restructure units to be privatized and to sell them as they
are.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the reason to privatize national assets is to
ask private sectors to tackle the problems faced by these units.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government does not have the resources to inject
into these units, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government failed to meet the deadline set by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to privatize the UBL, the second
largest national commercial bank in the country.
</P>
<P>
The IMF asked the Pakistan government to privatize the bank by
January 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, two bidders from the Middle East, short-listed as
qualified bidders from eight companies interested in the bank, did
not show up in the final bidding held here on Monday to buy 26
percent of the shares of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the bidders not to participate in the
bidding is believed to be the bad debts of the bank.
</P>
<P>
One of the bidders asked the government to deposit 20 billion
rupees (584 million US dollars) with the UBL for a period of five
years after its privatization.
</P>
<P>
"We want the bank to stand on its own feet," the chairman said
when explaining the government's stand.
</P>
<P>
However, he said if the government failed to privatize the bank
after several bidding attempts, it might have to make some
restructuring in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has embarked on privatization process since the 1980s.
Two commercial banks have already been privatized so far.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Official: Election Process To Go Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's Interim
National Electoral Commission (INEC) was "going ahead full speed
with the election on February 26," which had been pledged by
former Head of State Captain Valentine Strasser to end the
five-year-old rebel war in the country, INEC said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, INEC Chairman James Jonah said
INEC was keeping its office on a 24-hour operation as from
Wednesday (January 31) as the countdown to the elections had
begun.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to postpone elections now will be received
negatively by the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which launched its
revolt in 1991, on January 23 declared a week-long ceasefire to
assess "how serious the new Sierra Leonean military leadership is
about peace".
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's new Head of State Brigadier Julius Maada Bio,
after ousting his predecessor Strasser in a bloodless coup, made
an offer of dialogue to the RUF on January 17.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebel group has indicated that it wants the
elections to be put off "so that we can have time to restore
peace in the country". It has also indicated that it is prepared
to hold talks with the government, their first unconditional
offer of negotiations since the beginning of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The civil war has wrecked Sierra Leone's mining-based economy
and driven more than one-third of the country's four million
people from their home.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Jonah posed what he called "five key"
questions to be answered by the RUF "if elections are to be
postponed".
</P>
<P>
He detailed the questions as follows: "Is the RUF committed to
the electoral process as a means for Sierra Leoneans to choose
their leaders?" "If the RUF is committed to the electoral
process, do they want to participate in it ?" "For how long does
the RUF want to defer the election?" "Who governs Sierra Leone in
the interim?" and "Does the RUF want to commit itself to the
peace process permanently?"
</P>
<P>
On the voter registration exercise which ends later Wednesday,
Jonah said it had "gone successfully" and gave a projected figure
of 1.6 million Sierra Leoneans who would cast their votes in the
election.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and a number of western countries were
calling for the elections to go ahead "simultaneously with any
possible peace talks".

<HEADLINE> China, US to Further Cooperation in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and US officials agreed
here today to expand their cooperation in the field of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
During talks between Chinese Minister of Agriculture Liu Jiang
and Dan Glickman, US secretary of agriculture, this afternoon in
the Great Hall of the People, the two ministers agreed to properly
handle their difference in plant quarantine.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that it is a common task for China and the United
States to promote their agricultural cooperation and exchanges,
which have been going well for many years.
</P>
<P>
He said that as to the technical issues concerning plant
quarantine, the concerned departments and experts from the two
countries should properly handle them on the basis of respecting
science and through friendly consultation.
</P>
<P>
China's regulations on plant quarantine are in line with the
international practice and norms, Liu added.
</P>
<P>
Glickman said that a sound cooperation in agriculture may be
beneficial to promoting bilateral relations in other fields, and
the difference in plant quarantine can be settled on the basis of
science and international norms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today Chinese Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun also met with
Glickman and Jiang told him that both China and the US are among
the major agricultural nations in the world and have respective
advantages. He noted that it is important for the two countries
to strengthen cooperation in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"To further strengthen Sino-US cooperation in agriculture is
the common wish of the two sides and is in the interests of the
two peoples," the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Glickman, who arrived here yesterday at the invitation of the
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture, praised China for its achievement
in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Glickman also met with Chinese trade
officials and discussed with them on trade of agricultural
products, technical cooperation in agriculture and plant
quarantine. End

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia qualified for the
next stage of the Atlanta Olympic soccer qualifying tournament
despite a 0-1 home loss to New Zealand in Adelaide on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Simon Elliott scored the only goal for New Zealand in the 55th
minute.
</P>
<P>
Both New Zealand and Australia had two losses after Australia's
4-0 win over Solomon Islands was judged a 2-0 loss by FIFA ruling
that they had played an ineligible substitute.
</P>
<P>
But Australia won the five-nation regional tournament on goal
difference.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand needed to beat Australia 14-0 to atop the standings
as the Australians had won their earlier encounter 5-0.
</P>
<P>
Australia will now face a team from the Central/North America
zone to qualify for the Olympic finals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
In the day's another match, Vanuatu scored their first and last
win in the tournament after beating Fiji 1-0.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Japanese Symposium to Improve Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
expressed hope here today that China will have more Japanese
tourists to increase friendly exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the '96 Sino-Japanese Tourism Symposium, Liao Hui,
director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the State
Council, said that tourism serves as an important bridge for
friendly ties between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, China's tourism is affected by Japan's attitude
towards its invasion of China several decades ago, Liao pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has had more than one million tourists
annually from Japan, Li Baolin, chairman of the China Travel
Service Group noted, adding that his travel agency will develop
the Japanese tourist market to increase exchanges between the
Chinese and Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the meeting exchanged views on maintaining the
tourist market, improving travel agencies' services, regulating
travel agencies' fees, and diversifying tourism.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Says no Agreement between Ankara and Athens on Imia (Kardark) Islet Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz
Baykal said today that there was no written or oral agreement on
the disputed Imia (Kardak) rock islands in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Baykal stressed that Turkish military forces were in the
region to realize the withdrawal of Greece and recalled the
target that Turkish troops will not be needed if Greece troops
withdraw from the region.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said Greek fait accompli proved vain and Turkey reached
its aim.
</P>
<P>
"As you know, from the beginning we have laid down our national
targets which were to put an end to Greek occupation in Kardak and
to provide their withdrawal," said Baykal.
</P>
<P>
"We had to take necessary precautions and send our soldiers as
Greece claimed that Kardak rock islands belonged to them," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister welcomed Greece's withdrawal from
the region.
</P>
<P>
Turkish caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller also said the
Greek flag was taken down, adding she wished such an incident
would not happen again.
</P>
<P>
Ciller said she told Turkish people that "this country does not
have a piece of stone to cede to other countries."
</P>
<P>
She said Turkey favored peace and the disputes could be solved
by means of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A crisis which erupted in Imia rock islands ended when Turkish
and Greek forces withdrew from the region this morning.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had placed its soldiers on one of the rock islets at
01:40 local time this morning in retaliation for Greece doing the
same on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said Turkey had sent its soldiers to the region upon
negative attitude of Greece and hoisted Turkish flag on a rock
island, adding Turkish soldiers would not have opened gunfire
unless a counter attack happened.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton phoned Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel and Greek Prime Minister Kostas Imitis on Imia rock
islands crisis and wanted them to find a diplomatic solution to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Greek helicopter crashed because of bad weather
conditions and due to a mechanical failure, its three-member crew
are reported to be lost.
</P>
<P>
Turkey calls the islet Kardak; Greece calls it Imia.
</P>
<P>
The escalation in tension between the two NATO members
surfaced a week ago, when a Turkish ship crashed into the twin
rock group with a total area of four hectares, which is 3.8
nautical miles away from the Turkish shore and 11 nautical miles
from he Greek island of Kalimons.
</P>
<P>
It grew worse through the remarks of Greece's new Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos who said that Turkey had "claimed
Greek land for the first time."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey nearly went to war in 1987 in a dispute over
mineral rights in the Aegean. They argued last year over whether
Athens has the right to extend its territorial waters in the
Aegean to 12 miles from six miles.

<HEADLINE> Three South Korean Lawmakers Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution
today arrested three incumbent members of the National Assembly,
on charges of insurrection and military suppression of the
pro-democracy movement in Kwangju in May of 1980.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution charges Chung Ho-yang, special warfare forces
commander at the time of the Kwangju crackdown, with ordering his
paratroopers to get tough with the demonstrators during their stay
in Kwangju, capital of South Cholla Province, in defiance of the
normal chain of command.
</P>
<P>
Hur Sam-soo, then personnel director of the Defense Security
Command (DSC), and Hur Hwa-pyung, then chief secretary to the
Defense Security Commander Chun Doo-hwan, are charged with deep
involvement in Chun's plot to seize the presidency, engineering
the arrest of prominent politicians and disbanding of the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Although the arrests of the three incumbent lawmakers were
delayed as the National Assembly was in session until last
weekend, they will just about conclude the legal actions to be
brought against Chun and his aides in the Kwangju incident, which
took place on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, six key aides to Chun, including former anti-espionage
chief of the DSC Lee Hak-bong, former Third Army Commander Yoo
Hak-seong, former Army Chief of Staff Lee Hui-sung and former
Deputy Army Chief of Staff Hwang Hung-si, were indicted on
insurrection charges.
</P>
<P>
The charge of insurrection was added to the indictment of Chun,
who was previously charged with graft and military mutiny only, on
January 23.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also added insurrection to former President Roh
Tae-woo's graft and military revolt indictment. The two
ex-presidents were arrested on November 16 and December 3 last
year respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the army strongman after the 1979
military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the
nation until February 1988.
</P>
<P>
He was followed by Roh, who gave way in February 1993 to Kim
Young-sam, the first civilian president in South Korea in 32
years.

DAMASCUS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A unit of Japanese troops will
soon arrive in Syria to participate for the first time in the
U.N. peace-keeping forces stationed in the Israeli-occupied Golan
Heights, the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
SANA quoted a spokesman for Japan's Defense Agency as saying
that 14 members of the Self-Defense Force, together with two
civilians, left Japan today for Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Golan Heights is a strategic plateau occupied by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Another 29-personnel unit of the Self-defense Force will leave
Japan for the Golan Heights on February 7.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese contingent will replace a Canadian one and will
give logistic support to the UN peace-keeping forces in the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Japan had approved in December last year a plan for dispatching
a Japanese peace-keeping force to the Golan Heights on a mission
to last a couple of years.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier on China's Future in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen said here today that China will become a leading tourist
attraction by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
"As one of the fastest growing sectors, China's tourism
industry, which began only a dozen years ago, by now has enough
experience to help it develop even more", Qian told a national
tourism working conference today.
</P>
<P>
"The favorable domestic and international situation and the
development trend will sustain the sector's rapid and sound
development", the vice-premier noted.
</P>
<P>
The number of overseas tourists reached about 46.4 million in
1995, putting the country fifth in the world. It expects to
receive some 54 to 55 million overseas tourists in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
With its rich tourist resources, increasing number of hotels,
improved traffic conditions, and rising standard of living,
China's overseas and domestic tourism are both booming. Income
from tourism as a part of GNP, however, is still behind that of
the developed countries, giving the sector room for development,
Qian pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a market-oriented industry, tourism is
conducive to national economic development, further opening-up,
and attracting overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier asked governments at all levels to attach
greater importance to tourism and to treat it as a pioneer
industry for opening-up and attracting investment.
</P>
<P>
He also urged tourism departments to adopt more measures in
maintaining order in the tourist business.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Disappointed By IOC's European TV Rights Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Sydney expressed its
disappointment in the International Olympic Committee's (IOC)
decision to sell the European TV broadcasting rights for the 2000
Games to a lesser bidder.
</P>
<P>
But the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games
(SOCOG) expressed that the decision would not affect the budget of
the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
IOC announced in Lausanne in Switzerland today that the
European Broadcasting Union (EBU) won the bid for the TV rights of
five Olympic Games at the price of 1.442 billion U.S. dollars,
less than the two billion U.S. dollars offered by the
Australia-based News Corp.
</P>
<P>
EBU will pay SOCOG 350 million U.S. dollars for the coverage of
the 2000 Games in Europe, comparing with the proposed offer of 500
million U.S. dollars by the News Corp. This means SOCOG will earn
130 million Australian dollars (96.2 million U.S. dollars) less
after the IOC's share is taken out.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think we've got the optimum deal. I don't think the
IOC has taken the optimum deal but we'll have to live with it,"
New South Wales state Olympics Minister Michael Knight said.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG chairman Gary Pemberton said that New Corp proposed an
audiance reach much larger than EBU did in Barcelona and much more
coverage hours than in previous Games.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the Sydney organiser would not be affected by
the European deal.
</P>
<P>
He said that SOCOG had already achieved its budget by 100
percent after deals of TV rights for the United States, Australia,
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG has sold the television coverage rights for the United
States to American giant NBC at a record price of 715 million
U.S. dollars. The deal enabled SOCOG to easily fulfil its target
of earning two billion Australian dollars (1.48 billion U.S.
dollars) through TV rights.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG is sure to earn more because it has yet to sell the TV
rights for Japan and Canada. It also expects to earn another one
billion Australian dollars (740 million U.S. dollars) from other
sources such as sponsorship and tickets.
</P>
<P>
"There is no danger to Sydney being short of money," Knight
said.
</P>
<P>
Pemberton said that 130 million Australian dollars was "only a
fraction" of SOCOG's two-billion-Australian-dollar budget.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe this is an issue which will affect Sydney
longer term or the relationship (between IOC and SOCOG) longer
term," he said.
</P>
<P>
EBU has been the designated broadcaster of the Olympics in
Europe since the 1960 Rome Games.

<HEADLINE> Canada Accuses Indians of Match-fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Hockey
Federation (IHF) said here on Wednesday it will investigate the
case that Canada accused India of cheating in the Atlanta Olympic
qualifying tournament last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Canada claimed that India had fixed the match against Malaysia,
losing it intentionally.
</P>
<P>
IHF president Etienne Glichtich said that match-fixing was
unheard of in hockey.
</P>
<P>
"The Canadians claimed the game in Barcelona last Sunday was
not competitive and they said they will submit a formal protest,
which we will, of course, examine," Glichtich said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the qualifying tournament was run by
experienced umpires and officials and nothing amiss has so far
been reported.
</P>
<P>
An official of Field Hockey Canada said the Indian team should
not have lost the match because they had some of the most
wonderful players in the world.
</P>
<P>
The official said India advanced into the Malaysia half just
twice in the first half and never in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Canada lost 2-1 to both India and Malaysia during the
qualifying tournament, finishing a point behind Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The top five countries in the round robin tournament, Spain,
India, the Netherland, Great Britain and Malaysia, qualified for
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian added: "There's also the television evidence. At
one time when India had the ball, eight of 10 field players were
walking and dragging their sticks. At this level you expect
people to be running hard all the time."

<HEADLINE> British Track Officials Support Christie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The British Athletic Federation
have given their support to Linford Christie who has been accused
of feigning injury in last year's World Championships.
</P>
<P>
They rejected Canadian Donovan Bailey's claim that Christie was
fit when he started and finished the 100m final in Gothenburg.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who succeeded sixth-placed Christie as champion, poured
scorn on the hamstring injury which the British team captain has
always insisted cost him the title.
</P>
<P>
"A hamstring injury that healed the following day?" queried
Bailey. "A fit Linford Christie ran that race. Absolutely no-one
was injured in it. He was ready to run the relay if needed.
</P>
<P>
"A short time after the championships he did 10.03 at a meeting
in Zurich. That answers the question."
</P>
<P>
But Tony Ward, spokesman for the BAF, said: "These comments are
not credible. They reflect unfairly on Linford's efforts to
defend the title and on our own medical team who treated him.
</P>
<P>
"He received treatment for the injury after the semi-finals and
final, then flew to see a specialist in Switzerland."
</P>
<P>
Sue Barrett, Christie's agent, said: "The allegations are
totally unfounded. It was a genuine injury. Donovan wants to be
careful about what he is saying."

<HEADLINE> HK News Media Stress "One China" Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Some of the newspapers in
Hong Kong stressed the "one China" principle in recent days in
their review of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's eight propositions
on the peaceful reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po's editorial said that Jiang Zemin's propositions
published at the end of last January serve as a guideline for
settling the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
As the Chinese government's basic policy toward Taiwan issue,
the propositions have shown the determination and sincerity of the
Chinese government on the issue of reunification of China, the
editorial said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that conducts by the Taiwan authorities in the past
year, which resulted in a tense situation across the Taiwan
Straits, have shown that they were actually against China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Taiwan authorities to take a positive attitude
towards President Jiang's propositions and put an end to their
separatist conducts which are undermining the peaceful
reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Ta Kung Pao also carried a commentary entitled "One China
Principle Unshakable", claiming that Jiang Zemin's eight
propositions reflect the common will of all nationalities in
China.
</P>
<P>
It noted that no matter what happened in the world, China's
reunification is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the "one China" principle is the precondition and
basis for promoting relations across the Taiwan Straits and the
reunification of the country, adding that the principle is also
the precondition and basis for China to develop relations with
other countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily's editorial said that the Chinese
government is determined to solve the Taiwan issue and any
attempts at "Taiwan Independence" and "two Chinas" will be doomed
to failure.
</P>
<P>
It said that Jiang Zemin's eight point propositions have taken
Taiwan's interests into consideration and refusal by the Taiwan
authorities to accept the reasonable propositions for China's
peaceful reunification would just expose their separatist stance.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania To Revive Sisal Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye said in Dodoma, central Tanzania, on
Tuesday that the government was determined to revive and develop
the country's sisal industry.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that privatisation of some state-owned
farms was among the strategies to revive the industry, according
to a report reaching here today from Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar attended by members of parliament coming
from sisal growing regions, Sumaye said the demand for the crop
had gone up as people increasingly prefer natural fibres to
synthetics.
</P>
<P>
He told participants in the seminar organised by the Tanzania Sisal
Authority (TSA) that Tanzanians should capitalise on the trend by
increasing production.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said sisal production had dropped for 230,000
tonnes in 1964 to the present 25,000 tonnes.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said that the nation could earn much from sisal if farms
were properly nursed and more efforts were directed at exporting
processed products.
</P>
<P>
He added he understood that there was a good market for value
added items like twine, cordage and carpets, but surprisingly TSA
concentrated on export of raw sisal only.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its fibres, the crop could be utilised in several other
ways, including electricity generation and manufacture of paper,
alcohol, medicine and animal feed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister further said that TSA could manufacture some
of these sisal by-products.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Over 100 Killed in Colombo Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 people were
killed and several hundred others injured when a truck loaded with
explosives ran into the building of the Central Bank in the
capital and caused a powerful blast today, police said.
</P>
<P>
The building of the bank, located in the heart of the
commercial center and is only about 100 meters from the
Presidential House and the Foreign Office, was reduced to rubble
by the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Ceylinco Building, which is close to the Central Bank, was
set ablaze and kept burning for several hours. Some people
trapped on the roof top were rescued by fire brigades, but many
more are believed to be still trapped inside the building.
</P>
<P>
Windows of the nearby two five-star hotels -- the
Inter-Continental Hotel and the Galadari Hotel -- were shattered,
and some guests inside the hotels were injured.
</P>
<P>
All roads near the blast scene were cordoned off and commercial
activities came virtually to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources, the Central Bank alone housed
several hundred employees. Many are believed to be lying dead
below rubble. Rescue operations are going on and several hundred
injured were rushed to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The government has called on doctors on leave to return to
hospitals to render medical services to the injured.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion. But
police sources said they believed the blast was the work of the
Tamil rebels who are fighting for a separate Tamil state.

<HEADLINE> Rroundup: Zambia Resuscitates Agricultural Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Qiu Xiaoyi
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 31 (Xinhua)-- The recent debt relief of 29.6
million US dollars for some 220 small-scale farmers in the
drought- stricken areas in Zambia is the latest effort taken by
the Zambian government to resuscitate the country's agricultural
sector, which has been ravaged by successive drought.
</P>
<P>
The southern african country had experienced three severe
droughts in the past four years, which had caused continuous crop
failures. It is estimated that Zambia only produced about 900,000
tons of grain in 1995, leaving a shortage of 400,000 tons for the
1995-96 farming year.
</P>
<P>
To revitalize the farming sector, Zambia introduced the
Agricultural Sector Investment Program (ASIP) late last year. The
government will allocate some 30 million dollars for ASIP while
international donors have pledged to contribute 59 million
dollars to the program this year. The first funds have already
been released.
</P>
<P>
ASIP is aimed at harmonizing investment in the agricultural
sector to optimize the use of resources in order to achieve
several sectoral objectives, such as improvement of national and
household food security, increase of farming production and
agricultural exports, strengthening of services to the
agriculture and support for private investment in crops
marketing.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zambia National Farmers Union Ben Kapita has
described ASIP as "the first ever positive step the government
has taken towards agricultural development".
</P>
<P>
As the rainfall is most likely normal in the current rainy
season covering from last November to April this year, the
government is taking more measures to ensure a good harvest in
1996.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, about 900,000 tons of
imported fertilizer, a large quantity of crop seeds and other
agricultural inputs worth 35.7 million dollars are being
distributed to the farmers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 sale companies based in various provinces and
districts have been appointed as the government agents to
facilitate an easy access of the inputs by both large commercial
and small peasant farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries has
embarked on a crop diversifaication scheme in 31 drought-prone
districts at the cost of three million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the government is providing small farmers
with seeds of cotton, maize and sorghum to help them diversify
crops in line with different conditions of soils and climate in
their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
Further more, an ambitious plan on shift of the traditional
maize belt from the drought-prone southern part of the country to
the rainy northern Zambia is in process of development.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investment in the agricultural sector is
Zambia's another major measure to revamp the economic sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Zambia Investment Centre issued 50 licences to
foreign investors to allow them to set up enterprises in
agriculture with an investment value of 49.4 million dollars. The
investment in the agriculture topped the list of foreign
investment during the year, according to the official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Given the climatic and soil conditions, Zambia has immense
potential in agriculture. The government has been striving to
rebuild the productive capacity of the sector, so as to raise the
efficiency of production, reduce the nation's susceptibility to
drought, enhance food security and expand exports of agricultural
products.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is a focal point of Zambia's development not only
from the point of view of ensuring the nation's food security,
but also promoting the agro-based industry. Its improvement will
have various beneficial effects in the national economy, as
President Frederick Chiluba recently put. enditem

or 20 percent, while the United Kingdom and Germany each sent
about 218,000, some 10 percent each. About 175,000 came from
France (8 percent) and there were 112,000 from the former Soviet
Union (5 percent).

<P>
The Hotel Association also had a record of 16 million bed
nights, a growth of 13 percent compared with 1994. Income from
the hotel branch amounted to 3 billion shekels, of which some
55 percent was foreign currency, or 600 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Average room occupancy throughout the country was 68 percent,
compared with 65 percent in 1994, with 78 percent occupancy in
Eilat, 76 percent at the Dead Sea, 75 percent in Tel Aviv, 72
percent in Jerusalem, 65 percent in Tiberias, 63 percent in
Netanya and 59 percent in Haifa.
</P>
<P>
Israel's total number of hotel rooms by the end of the year
was 35,000, with 7,700 in Jerusalem, 7,000 in Eilat, 4,800 in Tel
Aviv, 3,900 in Tiberias, 1,900 in Netanya, 1,600 at the Dead Sea,

<HEADLINE> HK Deposits Rebound in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Total deposits rebounded in
December 1995, while total loans and advances grew moderately,
according to statistics published today by the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
Total deposits increased by 1.6 percent in December, compared
with the 0.1 percent decline in November.
</P>
<P>
An HKMA spokesman said that the increase was due to a 2.5
percent growth in HK dollar deposits and a 0.7 percent increase in
foreign currency deposits.
</P>
<P>
He said that within HK dollar deposits, demand deposits fell by
1.1 percent, while savings deposits rose by 4.1 percent. HK
dollar time deposits grew by 2.4 percent in the month, reversing
the fall of 2.6 percent in November.
</P>
<P>
The rise in foreign currency deposits was attributable to a 1.3
percent increase in US dollar deposits during the month, as
non-US dollar foreign currency deposits barely grew.
</P>
<P>
He said that total outstanding loans and advances rose by 0.2
percent in December, after a one percent increase in November.
</P>
<P>
HK dollar loans rose by 0.3 percent in December, while foreign
currency loans rose by 0.1 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Syria, Lebanon to Discuss Shares in Assi River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Experts on water resources from
both Lebanon and Syria are to meet in Damascus today to discuss a
division of their water shares of Nahr Assi (Oronte) River, which
rises in Lebanon and flows into Homs Lake in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian daily, As-Safir, reported today that the
Syrian-Lebanese Joint Water Committee is to hold a meeting in the
Syrian capital today at "a level of technical experts."
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted its sources as saying that the obstacle
hindering a full agreement on the division of the Assi water is
conflicting data between the two countries on the total drainage
area of the river.
</P>
<P>
"Experts at today's meeting of the Joint Water Committee will
work out a final solution on this problem," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad has agreed to a demand of the
Lebanese side to review a previous agreement "in spite of an
opposition by some Syrian high-ranking officials," the report
quoted a governmental source as disclosing.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of Lebanon and Syria to review the
agreement to make it more equivalent to confront the Israeli
ambition (in Lebanon's water resources)," the same sources
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that Lebanon and Syria signed the
agreement on September 28, 1994, on the division of the Assi
water. Under the accord, Lebanon is allocated with a share of 20
percent, or 80 million cubic meters one year.

corruption and ordered the police to intensify their
investigations at the KPA.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Urges to Speed Up GCC Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain's Minister of
Commerce Ali Saleh al Saleh has urged greater economic integration
among the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Gulf News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the minister as saying Tuesday that it is
necessary for economic integration within the GCC countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the market in Bahrain is small but through the
GCC, a Gulf-wide market is being created and thereby giving
Bahrain traders the opportunity to expand their operations Gulf
wide.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it has now become more important for
Bahrain and other Gulf countries to become members of a larger
trading group to compete on an equal footing with the expanded
Europe as well as other major trading blocks such as NAFTA (North
American Free Trade Area).
</P>
<P>
Established in 1981, the GCC for a long time has proposed
to unify their economy, but there are still some difficulties
for the integration, specially in the customs union among
the six member countries.

<HEADLINE> Dispute over Imia (Kardak) Islet in Aegean Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today announced that its
troops began to withdraw from the 450-square-meter Imia (Kardak)
island in the Aegean Sea early this morning, showing that the
dispute between Ankara and Athens over the rocky islet came to an
end.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and Greece took off their national flags on the
twin rocks, 3.8 miles from the Turkish shoreline of Bodrum, and
began to withdraw their forces.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece agreed to end the dispute over the two rocks
through the mediation of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Turkey started its "yunus-1" operation in the Aegean in the
midnight and 12 commandos hoisted the Turkish flag on the one rock
of the Imia island after Greece, Turkey's NATO ally, hoisted its
flag on the other rocky islet.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel has said that "the war with
Turkey will not be beneficial for Greece. But it is up to them."
</P>
<P>
Clinton started a phone diplomacy between Turkey and Greece to
mediate the dispute over the sovereignty of the Imia island
between the two NATO allies. Turkey calls the islet Kardak; Greece
calls it Imia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said: "We are
determined on the Kardak issue as we are determined on every
issue. We will not permit any fait accompli concerning Kardak
(Imia) island. No other flag could stream on the Turkish soil
besides the Turkish one."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's three frigates, one destroyer and two assault boats
and Greece's two frigates, one destroyer and three assault boats
confronted near the Imia island in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The escalation in tension between the two NATO members
surfaced a week ago, when a Turkish ship crashed into the twin
rock group with a total area of four hectares, which is 3.8
nautical miles away from the Turkish shore and 11 nautical miles
from he Greek island of Kalimons.
</P>
<P>
It grew worse through the remarks of Greece's new Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos who said that Turkey had "claimed
Greek land for the first time."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey nearly went to war in 1987 in a dispute over
mineral rights in the Aegean. They argued last year over whether
Athens has the right to extend its territorial waters in the
Aegean to 12 miles from six miles.

LANZHOU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
discovered for the first time primeval cosmic gas underneath the
earth which may possibly be commercially mined.
</P>
<P>
Unlike petroleum and gas which are known to be products of
ancient living things, the newly-found gas is hydrocarbon-type gas
from the primeval sun nebula, which, under some special
circumstances, may become natural gas with commercial mining value.
</P>
<P>
Samples have been taken by scientists from wells in northwest
and southwest China.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, the new discovery will open a new
energy resource.
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted by experts from the Lanzhou
Institute of Geology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Daqing
Oil Administrative Bureau and other relevant institutions.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianbin, a research fellow from the Lanzhou institute, who
is in charge of the research program, said that they are going to
continue their research in a bid to determine if the gas has
commercial mining value.

<HEADLINE> Australian Housing Industry Still Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Australia's housing industry
was still in the trough as activities in the sector continued to
drop.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
building approvals, the number of house construction and
renovation contracts approved by the authorities, fell 0.4 percent
to 10,342 units on a seasonally-adjusted basis in December over
the previous month.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures also showed that in trend terms, building approvals
were 0.6 percent less in December than in November and 29.8
percent less than one year ago.
</P>
<P>
The figures confirmed that the Australian housing industry was
still weak. Local economists predicted that the housing market
would remain subdued due to relatively high interest rates,
housing stockpiles and slack demand.
</P>
<P>
The housing industry, known as the engine of the economy, lost
its steam after the Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest
rates three times in the latter half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures indicated that the economy is still slowing
down.

<HEADLINE> Tight Monetary Policy Here To Stay: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A central bank spokesman here
today ruled out the possibility of relaxing monetary control and
reiterated that the appropriately tight monetary policy will be
kept firmly in place this year.
</P>
<P>
Ma Delun, spokesman for the People's Bank of China (PBC), told
a press conference that the broad money supply is still high and
price increases have kept a two-digit pace.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the price rise will fall to around 10 percent or
even lower. Therefore there is no doubt that the central bank will
resolutely implement an appropriately tight monetary policy," Ma
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the broad money (cash in
circulation plus deposits of all categories) amounted to 6074.9
billion yuan by the end of 1995, up 29.5 percent over the previous
year and also 4.5 percentage points higher than the government
control target for 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ma noted that the central bank hopes to contain the growth of
narrow money supply and broad money supply to some 18 percent and
25 percent, respectively, this year.
</P>
<P>
Last year the state banks extended loans totalling 638.7
billion yuan. "The state bank loans will be sure to increase this
year, though we have to keep the overall amount at a proper
level," Ma added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, lending priority this year includes the
agricultural sector and state major construction projects. Working
capital for enterprises with good management and marketable
products will also be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
China will reform its interest rate system, the spokesman
said. As the first step, he noted, a unified interbank lending
market was set up in Shanghai at the beginning of this year, whose
rate will gradually be determined by market forces.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage, the country will put into place an
interest rate system, which will be based on the interbank rate but
be guided by the central bank's rate to financial institutions. By
then the central bank will set the ceiling and bottom line of the
rate and allow the commercial banks to float their own rates within
a given range.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a reporter's question on the impact on the Renminbi
yuan's exchange rate by the tariff cuts at the beginning of this
year, Li Fuxiang, deputy director of the State Administration of
Exchange Control, said that the cuts will not affect the exchange
rate too much because China terminated the tax reductions and
exemptions on imported equipment and raw materials of
foreign-funded firms at the same time.
</P>
<P>
"The cuts will be conducive to the country's balance of payments
performance and further improve the situation of demand and supply
in foreign exchange," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Hard currency supply has exceeded demand ever since 1994, and
the tariff cuts will help somewhat ease the pressure on the
appreciation of the yuan," Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Workers Enjoying Working in Foreign-funded Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Song Shucheng, an employee of
a Sino-American enterprise here, was overjoyed that his proposal
for reforming the No.7 signaling network had been accepted and put
into practice.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipment Manufacturing Co., Ltd.,
where Song is working, has appointed him to take charge of the
project, and increased his wages.
</P>
<P>
"All our rational and useful suggestions and views arouse the
enthusiasm and interest of the general manager and officials because
the development of the enterprise is linked to the interests of
every employee," the 34-year-old Song said.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 600,000 Chinese personnel are working at
over 12,000 foreign-funded enterprises from 77 countries and
regions in this, China's largest economic center.
</P>
<P>
Although some overseas-funded enterprises have dismissed
workers, almost no employees feel threatened, but instead, agree
with "strict management", which can ensure the healthy development
of a modern enterprise.
</P>
<P>
A worker at the cotton yarn workshop of the Shanghai Linglan
Company accidentally changed the mix-up of cotton pulp, almost
causing the enterprise to suffer a heavy economic loss.
</P>
<P>
According to the enterprise stipulation, she should have been
fired. However, after making a thorough survey and consulting with
the people concerned and technicians, the foreign manager found
that she was very conscientious in her work, and that this was an
accident.
</P>
<P>
He did not punish her but instead sent her to Japan for
technical training. The worker is now one of the leading
technicians in the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
In another case, a female employee who also worked at the
Shanghai Linglan Company was fired just because of long absence
from her post, pretending sickness.
</P>
<P>
Many employees in foreign-funded enterprises who used to work
in state-owned enterprises agreed that the system of "eating out
of the same big pot" in their previous enterprises has spoiled
some people, who underwork but still receive the same pay as
others.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign-funded enterprises differ from the enterprises owned
by the state, and they have linked the interests of enterprises
with those of employees, rewarding those who work assiduously and
punishing those who do not work hard," said Jin Zhongming, a young
worker at the Garden Hotel, which is funded solely by Japanese
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The young man has been shifted to several work posts over the
past two years, and he promoted rapidly and earned more for his
diligent altitude.
</P>
<P>
As part of its effort to better train its employees, the
Shanghai Bell Telephone Equipment Manufacturing Co., Ltd. has sent
more than 1,000 of them to study modern management in the United
States, Belgium, Singapore, Germany, Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign investors show concern for the wellbeing of their
employees and try to help them solve problems and make friends
with them.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Municipal Trade Union Organization,
the common goal of both foreign bosses and Chinese employees is to
run their enterprise well. Though they come from different
countries with different political systems and cultural
backgrounds, they do understand, support and respect each other.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
firmer against the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar rose to 74.51 US cents from 74.23 US
cents on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was pushed up by the news of a surprising
fall of the current account deficit in December last year.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) today, the current account deficit dropped by 12
percent to 1.628 billion Australian dollars (1.205 billion US
dollars) in December over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
But local economic forecasters used to expect the current
account deficit to rise above 2 billion Australian dollars (1.48
billion US dollars) in December.
</P>
<P>
Today's figures boosted the confidence of investors and pushed
the local dollar to its 32-month high in exchange rate against the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar surged to 80.1 yen against the Japanese
yen before closed at 79.92 yen today, compared with the close of
79.12 yen yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It was also firmer against the German mark, ending at 1.1085
marks from 1.0988 marks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local currency brokers said that the Australian dollar had
entered a bullish phase and might test higher levels if the United
States cuts interest rates this week.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves 8th National Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved
the country's eighth five-year national development plan, which
projects an eight percent annual economic growth between 1997 and
2001, as against the 8.4 percent target during the current five
years.
</P>
<P>
The eighth national economic and social development plan
stresses quality and stability in order to sustain human
development.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet agreed Tuesday that the country should not
concentrate just on economic growth as it has done in the past
because it had produced social and environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
Under the new scheme, Thailand would not be geared to a high
growth rate but rather stability which could result in sustainable
development for society, especially in manpower.
</P>
<P>
There are four main strategies in the new plan, drafted by the
National Economic and Social Development Board, namely, human and
social development to enable more learning; economic stability and
efficiency to sustain human development for sustainable growth;
rural and natural resource development for sustainable growth; and
cooperation between the private and public sectors, as well as all
economic and social groups.
</P>
<P>
During the eighth five-year plan period, which starts on
October 1 this year, export growth rate is to be reduced from 17.7
percent for the current plan to 16 percent, and annual inflation
rate is to drop from the current goal of 4.7 percent to 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Annual average current account deficit is aimed at 4.8 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP) as against the current goal of 6.1
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
On the social development front, compulsory education will be
extended from six to nine years. There will be a 15 percent
annual increase in the number of graduates in engineering and pure
sciences to address the country's desperate shortage of skilled
labor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile work will continue to bridge the income gap between
the urban rich and the rural poor. The proportion of people
considered poor is expected to be reduced from 13.7 percent in
1992 to less than 10 percent by 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The donors to Bangladesh at a
mid-term review meeting held here Tuesday expressed serious
concern at the countries' stale reform programs and asked the
government to speed up the process to get the aid flow going.
</P>
<P>
At talks with Finance Minister Saifur Rahman, Donors'
representatives expressed their disappointment at the government's
failure to promote privatization, improve public sector management
and implement the agreed reforms in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Some of the donors, including the US, UK and Japan, regarded
the "lack of political will and bureaucratic resistance" as major
factors behind the slow down.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, one of the poorest countries in the world, received
financial aids annually from an aid club formed by some western
countries, the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank group.
</P>
<P>
The donors' representatives agreed that the aid consortium will
meet in Paris in July to decide the amount of aid for Bangladesh
for the 1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The commitment for aid in last year's meeting was 1.95 billion
US dollars as against 2.1 billion dollars in 1994, and it is
apprehended that the amount may fall further in the backdrop of
the political uncertainty in the country.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Begin Commercial Hot-Air Balloon Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
granted permission to a private company for operating commercial
hot-air balloon flights with the aim to attract more tourists to
the country.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first time that commercial hot-air balloon
flights are operated in Nepal with government permission.
</P>
<P>
The Balloon Sunrise Pvt. Ltd., a joint venture between the
Sunrise Balloon Company of Australia and a Nepalese private
company, will begin its first commercial flight in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Before receiving the permission for commercial flights from the
Civil Aviation Authorities, the company had successfully
conducted more than 50 test flights, most of them in the Kathmandu
Valley, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Balloon Sunrise, it would operate regular
sightseeing flights in the Kathmandu Valley and provide special
services like wildlife observation flights in other parts of the
country if tourists asked.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the new balloon flight services would
attract an additional number of 3,000 to 4,000 foreign tourists to
Nepal especially for this adventurous program.
</P>
<P>
Nepal attracts some 300,000 foreign tourists every year. With
its annual earnings at more than 80 million US dollars, the
tourism industry is considered one of Nepal's major sources of
national revenue as well as foreign exchange.

<HEADLINE> Australian External Balance Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian current account
deficit shrank sharply in December last year to the surprise of
most local economic analysts.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit fell to 1.628 billion Australian
dollars (1.205 billion US dollars) in December from 1.858 million
Australian dollars (1.375 billion US dollars) in November, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of Australia's external balance proved to be a
surprise to most of local economic forecasters, who expected the
current account deficit to rise above two billion Australian
dollars (1.48 billion US dollars) in December.
</P>
<P>
It is a good news for the local financial market. The
Australian dollar is expected to strengthen against major
currencies.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures indicated that the narrowing of the external
deficit was due to an increase in exports and a decrease in
foreign debt payment.
</P>
<P>
The growth of exports outpaced imports in December. Exports
increased by 555 million Australian dollars (411 million US
dollars) to 6.357 billion Australian dollars (4.704 billion US
dollars). At the same time, imports grew 288 million Australian
dollars (213 million US dollars) to 6.59 billion Australian
dollars (4.88 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that domestic demand was losing steam during
a slack Christmas season, thus the inflow of goods slowed down.
In the mean time, improvement of world commodity prices helped to
boost the country's earnings in exports.
</P>
<P>
Today's current account figures also proved to be a good news
for the Labor Government, which is facing a federal election on
March 2.
</P>
<P>
Budget balance has been among the top debate issues in the
election campaign, with both the Labor party and the Opposition
pledging to bring the budget back into a "genuine" surplus.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Government has so far managed to secure a modest
budget surplus for the year 1995-96. But the surplus was mainly
from "one-off" factors, such as sales of government-owned assets
and reception of debt repayments. If these factors were excluded,
the budget will still be in a substantial deficit.
</P>
<P>
The underlying budget deficit means that the government could
not get enough revenue to cover its expenditure from domestic
resources. It had to borrow from overseas. The payment of
foreign debts and dividends paid to overseas shareholders fed into
the country's current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
So the fall of the current account deficit in December is
likely to be interpreted by the government as a sign of
improvement in budget balance. It will strengthen the
government's claim that it will bring the budget into a
substantial surplus in the next fiscal year.

<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The nation's 200 million
primary school and middle school students should have a pleasant
and safe winter vacation, a senior official from the State
Education Commission (SEC) urged here today.
</P>
<P>
Making up lessons or teaching new lessons are forbidden during
the winter vacation, the official said, adding that local
education departments must halt such activities once they are
found out.
</P>
<P>
Teachers may not assign extra homework to students. "Vacations
are holidays for both teachers and students," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on schools and local governments to offer students
interesting activities and continue to organize them to watch
patriotic movies or TV films, and read good books.
</P>
<P>
The official reminded schools to always bear "safety first" in
mind. Teachers should tell students how to avoid accidents such as
fire, gas poisoning, traffic accidents, as well as drowning, which
might happen when students skate on ice-covered lakes or river.
</P>
<P>
He asked schools to check classrooms and equipment during the
winter vacation to avoid possible accidents.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 200 million students in primary

TIANJIN, January 31 (Xinhua)-- More Taiwan-backed enterprises
will be opening in Tianjin, the biggest port city in north China,
this year, as the culmination of a a northward trend in Taiwanese
investment.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Mingyu, president of the Taiwan-funded
Enterprises Association in Tianjin, the amount of investment from
Taiwan in 1995 rose by more than six times over that of 1994, and
most Taiwan-backed enterprises in Tianjin have made big profits.
</P>
<P>
Analysts cite the lower prices, low labor costs, cheap land,
abundant resources, and high growth potential as major reasons for
overseas investors to shift their investment destination.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the time is ripe for Taiwanese investors to
come to the mainland. Many Taiwan-funded enterprises have expanded
their production scale and increased investment, and many large
enterprises with annual sales of more than one billion yuan are
expected to settle there.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Tianjin overtook Shenzhen in amount of overseas
investment, another aspect of the trend.

<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
here today with visiting Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni,
and both had a cordial and friendly talk.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his pleasure at meeting again with Museveni, who
visited China in 1989, and said that the two presidents had
discussed in depth furthering bilateral relations during the
friendly talks yesterday and reached extensive agreement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of Uganda's efforts to explore ways for
development in accordance with its own conditions, Li noted that
Uganda, an important country in East Africa, has scored remarkable
achievements in safeguarding social stability and national unity,
and restoring and revitalizing its economy, under the leadership
of President Museveni in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
On international situations, Li said, the world is still not
peaceful after the Cold War with some regional conflicts, and the
development of multi-polarization is conducive to checking
hegemonism and power politics, and safeguarding world peace and
stability, as well as the common development of all countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and African countries share the same
historical experiences and are facing the common task of
development, adding that a lesson can be drawn from China's
experience, that is, economic construction and political stability
are the top priorities after national independence, and political
stability is the guarantee of smooth economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Admitting the universality of human rights, Li pointed out that
what is more important is to admit the different emphases among
various countries at different stages of development and with
different social, historical and cultural backgrounds, denying the
practice of imposing the Western mode on developing countries in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
For developing countries, Li noted, citizen's rights to
subsistence and development should be given priority while
ensuring their political rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the human rights issue can be discussed
internationally, but the discussions should be held on the
principle of equality, friendship, mutual respect and enhancing
understanding.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, said the premier, China and Uganda share
extensive common ground, and should strengthen co-operation and
support.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the long-term support from the Chinese
government and people for the just cause of Uganda and the African
people at large, and China's position on the independent
development of various countries, Museveni said that Africa has
been freed from colonialism and racism, and is making efforts for
integration.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this is the choice of Africa, and Africa
must strengthen regional economic co-operation and change the
disintegrating situations on the African continent, so as to
promote common development.

<P>
Museveni and his party were scheduled to leave here this
afternoon by plane for Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Diaoyutai
Film Center, China's Hollywood in Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, is
now nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
The center, the largest of its kind in northwest China, is
surrounded by mountains on all sides and near an expressway which

</P>
<P>
It is being built on a 200-ha plot at a total cost of 450
million yuan, according to Wang Pingyin, general manager of the

<HEADLINE> Sydney Disappointed by IOC-EBU TV Rights Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Sydney 2000 Olympic Games
organizers said in Sydney on Wednesday they were disappointed by a
decision of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to sell
television rights to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).
</P>
<P>
Gary Pemberton, who heads the Sydney organising committee, told
a news conference that IOC's decision would potentially cause the
2000 Olympic Games spending exceeds planned budget of 130 million
Australian dollars (96.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Pemberton said he had informed the IOC of the organizing
committee's disappointment.
</P>
<P>
The IOC announced on Tuesday it had sold television rights for
the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2008 to the EBU for more than
1.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A consortium formed by media tycoon Rupert Murdoch's News
Corp. had reportedly offered higher bid for the rights, but a
joint statement by the IOC and the EBU said the IOC would rather
continue to co-operate with the EBU.
</P>
<P>
The EBU, which represents many European broadcasters, has
claimed the European TV rights to all the Olympic Games since
1960.

<HEADLINE> Plastic Sheeting Provides More Vegetables to Tibetans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Instead of idleness during the
highland winter months, farmers in Nagru Village near this capital
of the Tibet Autonomous Region, have been busy taking care of
vegetables cultivated under plastic sheeting.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1994 some 66 vegetable gardens covering more than
two ha were put into use in the village, at a cost of 1.42 million
yuan (about 170,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Over the past year the village has provided 185,000 kg of fresh
vegetables to Lhasa's markets.
</P>
<P>
Up until very recently vegetables were rare on this plateau,
and had to be brought from outside at considerable expense.
</P>
<P>
Last year the village set up another 70 greenhouses using
plastic sheeting with an investment of 1.5 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The shelters have helped meet the demand for vegetables in
Lhasa and helped surplus farm labor find employment, as well as
raised farmers' incomes. Last year all the villagers shrugged off
poverty by earning more than 1,900 yuan each.
</P>
<P>
The region has been putting emphasis on establishing a large
vegetable production base along the middle reaches of the Yarlung
Zangbo, Lhasa and Nyang rivers.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years the region has spent a total of 12.3
million yuan cultivating 38 ha of vegetable fields, which are able
to turn out 2.35 million kg of vegetables each year.

This time the passenger peak is to last for 50 days, and will
see a much larger passenger volume and worse weather than in the
same period of 1995, according to an official of the Zhejiang
Province's Aviation Bureau, the administrative body of Zhejiang
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,800 passengers take off and land every day at the
Hangzhou Airport, the major airport of the province.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the increase of passenger volume to be
handled by China's airlines this spring will be around 20 percent,
compared with that of the corresponding period of last
year. During the season, six million people will travel by plane.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zhejiang Airlines will adopt a package of
measures, including adding flights, opening charter-flight
services, extending booking times and strengthening daily
maintenance, to ensure a smooth operation during the peak period.

<P>
TAIYUAN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province,
center of the country's coal industry, has launched an extensive
inspection on the enforcement of the Agriculture Law, in an
attempt to enhance the basic role of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The inspection, co-sponsored by people's congresses and
administrative organs at and below the provincial level, found
that 11 counties in the central part of the province had diverted
as much as 15 million yuan (about two million US dollars) of
agricultural funds for other purposes during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
In addition to 1.5 million yuan of new input into agriculture,
eight million yuan was recovered for agricultural use shortly
after the inspection.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection 30,000 cases of unlawful occupation of
land were handled. So far, 310 ha of land has been returned to the
government and 116 ha has been reclaimed for farming.
</P>
<P>
A batch of cases in connection with substandard fertilizers and
pesticides have been dealt with, in a bid to safeguard the rights
and interests of farmers.
</P>
<P>
Improved agricultural input has promoted the construction of
agricultural infrastructure, raising its capacity to withstand
natural calamities and laying a sound foundation for bumper
harvests.
</P>
<P>
Though suffering from severe natural disasters, Shanxi
harvested 9.17 million tons of grain last year, the third-highest
amount in the province's history, with the per capita net income
of farmers reaching 1,200 yuan.

SHENYANG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, one of the country's major industrial bases, has
attracted a total of 85 million US dollars from the World Bank to
boost its weak agricultural sector in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said that over 20 million US dollars of
the amount has been utilized to help reclaim wasteland and improve
the quality of low-yielding farmland covering more than 6,750 ha.
</P>
<P>
The money has also helped to increase the area for raising
aquatic products by 10,000 ha.
</P>

The official said that the World Bank committed over 80 million
US dollars for developing the Liaohe Plain and its adjacent areas
in 1994, making the project the single largest in the agricultural
sector financed by overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
In Fuxin and Zhangwu regions in the western part of the

<HEADLINE> U.S. Paper Discloses Child Neglect in America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Neglect of duty and
indifference are found to be the cause of the death of 25 children
in New York City alone, a U.S. newspaper reported recently.
</P>
<P>
Calling the details "appalling," the New York-based Downtown
Express said in its January 23 issue: "In an 18-month period in
1994 and 1995, 25 children in New York City died while the city's
Child Welfare Administration did not do its job, according to a
detailed study released by Public Advocate Mark J. Green.
</P>
<P>
"Staffers at the agency either failed to act or acted
ineffectively despite warnings or obvious signs that the children
were in peril."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported that there were other shocking
facts in the Green study which reviewed the cases of 74 children
who were known to the welfare administration and who died during
the period in question.
</P>
<P>
One of the shocking facts, according to the newspaper, is that
29 of the 74 children died of AIDS and that in 14 cases there was
"profound failure" by the welfare agency to deal with obvious
abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
In nine other cases the Child Welfare Administration was
accused of failing to provide "critical services" which could have
averted tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited a Brooklyn family as an example of neglect
of duty.
</P>
<P>
The family had dealings with the welfare agency for nine years
during which time there had been at least five substantiated
reports of abuse or neglect of children.
</P>
<P>
But the agency had not visited the home and provided little
help until a two-year-old girl of the family was fatally scalded
when left in a bathtub by an aunt.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the child welfare agency is not the only
target of criticism.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the New York State Department of Social Services
also came in for sharp criticism, especially its failure in
running the state's child abuse emergency telephone service.

<P>
SANTIAGO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier
Zhu Rongji today discussed with Chilean President Eduardo Frei
trade and economic cooperation between their countries and other
matters of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting in the presidential palace, the Chilean
president emphasized that Chile attaches great importance to the
development of relations with China in various aspects.
</P>
<P>
He said his state visit to China not long ago left Chilean
officials and businessmen with a good impression of the enormous
economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Zhu said that after the establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and Chile 25 years ago,
bilateral relations in various aspects have been developing
satisfactorily and trade between the two countries reached some
740 million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, it represents only a small portion of China's foreign
trade, and therefore there are broad prospects for increasing
trade between the two countries, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China imports more than 300,000 tons of copper every
year and will increase its copper imports in the years to come as
China's national economy grows.
</P>
<P>
He also said China is interested in making investments in the
production of copper in Chile, the world's largest copper producer.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhu expressed appreciation over Chile's
one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Zhu met President of the Chamber of Deputies
Jaime Estevez and Chief Justice Servando Jordan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Zhu had working conversations with Foreign
Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, Minister of Economy Alvaro Garcia,
acting Finance Minister Manuel Marfan, and other government
ministers.

The National People's Congress, China's top law-making body,
has made several examinations of the enforcement of the law and
concluded that it has been well implemented.
</P>
<P>
However, lawmakers also found that some new questions have
cropped up that are beyond the scope of the law.
</P>
<P>
The experts will consider the following issues when helping
revise the law, according to Shen:
</P>
<P>
-- Should the law protect more copyright items?
</P>
<P>
-- Should it protect more authors' rights?
</P>
<P>
-- Should computer software be protected by a general copyright
law, or should a separate software copyright law be drawn up for
the genre?
</P>
<P>
-- Should folk literature and arts be protected by the law?
</P>
<P>
-- How should authors' rights be protected when the multi-media
and info-highway systems are introduced?
</P>
<P>
"The revision will embody the Chinese government's resolution
and it is a concrete step in improving our copyright protection
system," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
In other countries there is also a tradition of continual
revision of copyright laws to meet changing situations, Shen
explained.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Money Funneled to Reproductive Health Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A series of foreign-funded
projects will commence soon around the country to spread knowledge
of reproductive health and to teach farmers new skills to improve
their quality of life, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
China expects to expand international co-operation in this
field to encourage more people to practise family planning
voluntarily, the paper quoted Ye Huan, director of the foreign
affairs department of the China Family Planning Association
(CFPA), as saying.
</P>
<P>
The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), which
has funded the country's family planning program for four years,
plans to grant CFPA one million US dollars this year to carry out
grassroots family planning publicity and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
IPPF, which is the major sponsor of mass involvement in family
planning work, has donated more than 11 million US dollars to CFPA
since the two sides started co-operation in 1981, according to Ye.
</P>
<P>
The United States' Ford Foundation will donate 260,000 US
dollars over 1996-98 for a reproductive health education program
in Shijiazhuang, capital city of Hebei Province, and for carrying
out an "integrated program "in three counties of the province."
</P>
<P>
The integrated program combines family planning with
improvement of women's health care and the enhancement of women's
social and economic status.
</P>
<P>
Successful joint pilot programs with the Ford Foundation have
been implemented in Beijing and Yunnan Province over the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
A consultation center for reproductive health has been set up
in Beijing's Zhongshan Park. The center answers inquiries from the
public and spreads knowledge through symposiums and exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Another one-year program that will involve 10 provinces in
southeast China is supported by the US's Public Media Center.
</P>
<P>
The center will put in one million yuan (117,000 US dollars) to
carry out various family planning promotion activities in
accordance with the needs of specific localities in these
provinces.
</P>
<P>
CFPA has so far established co-operation with many world
organizations, including the United Nations Population Fund,
United Nations Development Program, World Health Organization and
IPPF, as well as foreign countries such as the United States,
Japan and Korea.

<HEADLINE> Living Buddha Presents 10,000 Yuan Award to Agronomists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Rinqing Cering, a Living Buddha
in northwest China's Qinghai Province, has offered a 10,000 yuan
award to agronomists who have helped a poor village get rid of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Qinghai Provincial Association of Science
and Technology, the Living Buddha commended members of the
association for their efforts to turn poverty-stricken Xiasaiba
Village in Chindu County into a rich one when he offered the
donation.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the five-year efforts of the commended members,
including He Yucheng, leader of a science and technology promotion
team organized by the provincial association, the remote mountain
village's per capita share of grain has increased to about 500 kg,
sufficient for the consumption of the villagers.
</P>
<P>
Before the agronomists came to the village, the Tibetan
villagers used to ask the monks to make farming plans in a
religious way and use primitive farming techniques. The per ha
grain yield was less than 1,500 kg, and in some years what they
harvested was less than what was sown.
</P>
<P>
In July 1990 the Living Buddha, who was concerned about the
village's poor harvests and general poverty, met He Yucheng by
chance and asked him to give courses on farming and raising
livestock to the villagers.
</P>
<P>
The Living Buddha then came to this provincial capital and
signed an agreement with the association on training and poverty
relief.
</P>
<P>
The next year the team arrived at the village with 20,000 kg of
improved varieties of highland barley, potatoes and rape, as well
as 10 tons of chemical fertilizers and farm chemicals.
</P>
<P>
In the same year the village's per ha yield of highland barley
and potatoes jumped to 5,115 kg and 15,000 kg, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Filled with admiration for the power of science and technology,
the Living Buddha called on 40,000 people participating at a
temple fair to learn science and technology.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the team, most of the villagers, both monks
and laymen, attended courses on farming and livestock production.
</P>
<P>
The village produced 250,000 kg of grain last year, or 595 kg
per head, higher than the national average per-capita share.
</P>
<P>
The villagers, who used to be too poor to buy bicycles, have
bought 23 tractors and even some motorcycles.

<HEADLINE> Oceanic Authorities Making Ambitious Plan for Next Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Six major projects for the
sustainable management and development of marine resources will be
carried out by China's State Oceanic Administration (SOA) over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, all targets for the effective and
comprehensive management of coastal waters should be achieved,
today's "China Daily" quoted SOA's director Zhang Dengyi as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's marine industries aim to double their output value
within five years. In 1994, the total output value of the
industries was 158.4 billion yuan, and it is estimated to exceed
180 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
The six projects include a new State law on managing the seas
and the setting up of a special group of personnel to enforce the
law, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
A sea color satellite will be launched for the first time in
China to monitor natural aquatic resources and environmental
quality in oceans with visible light wave band. Basic data about
topography, and aquatic, mineral and fishery resources on the
continental shelf will be collected.
</P>
<P>
As 1998 has been designated by the United Nations as an
international ocean year, the SOA will take the opportunity to
spread information about how to develop and protect oceanic
resources.

<HEADLINE> Largest Inland Freshwater Lake Recovering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- China's largest inland
freshwater lake, Bosten Lake in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, is expected to recover from salt pollution
within the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
A special project has been launched in the region to control
the salt content of the lake to not more than one g per liter
within three years and to reduce the content to below 0.6 g per
liter by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to the environment monitoring department of the
region, the lake contained less than 0.4 g of mineral matter per
liter in 1958, and these were mainly common ones such as
magnesium, sodium and calcium. Later, the content increased by
0.06 g per liter annually. At present, the lake contains 1.53 g of
mineral matter per liter, which also include such heavy pollutants
as sulphur and chlorine.
</P>
<P>
Bosten Lake, covering an area of over 900 sq km, is China's
major reed production base and Xinjiang's largest aquatic
production base. It also provides water for irrigating land and
generating electricity.
</P>
<P>
Environment experts say that the major cause of the lake being
polluted with salt was the discharge of both industrial and
agricultural waste water.
</P>
<P>
The salt-control project will introduce advanced irrigation
technologies to reduce the discharge of water from farmland while
restricting the industrial development scale in the area and
enhancing treatment of industrial waste water.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of the regional Environmental Protection
Bureau, the project has won support from both the regional
government and the National Environmental Protection Agency. He
also said he hoped to get support from international environmental
protection organizations.

CHANGSHA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Victims of disasters in
central China's Hunan Province have been able to meet their basic
needs so far this winter, thanks to disaster relief funds
allocated by governments at all levels and donations from other
areas.
</P>
<P>
In the summer and autumn of 1995 some counties in Hunan
suffered from severe flooding and drought, causing direct losses
of 24.2 billion yuan (about three billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have since allocated 130 million yuan
to help 1.73 million people, and the provincial department of
civil affairs has helped set up 300,000 temporary shelters in
which 1.18 million victims of disasters have been resettled.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year 240,000 families had been rehoused with
the help of the provincial government, accounting for 95 percent
of the total households which had housing difficulties owing to
disasters.
</P>
<P>
In December 1995 the province allocated 134,000 tons of grain
to people in disaster-stricken areas, in a bid to ensure that
enough food is available for them.

HOHHOT, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Starting almost from scratch,
township enterprises have recorded massive growth during recent
years in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the output value of township
enterprises in the region hit 68.58 billion yuan last year, more
than double the 1994 figure. An additional 35.56 billion yuan was
earned from sales, with 5.05 billion yuan paid in taxes and
profits.
</P>
<P>
The booming of township enterprises has contributed to local
economic growth and a rise in the living standards of the 22
million people in Inner Mongolia, a vast but sparsely populated
region.
</P>
<P>
To speed up the development of township enterprises, the
regional government has adopted a series of preferential policies

<HEADLINE> Beijing Welcomes More Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital will allow
more overseas financial institutions to set up operations here
this year, according to a senior banker.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will step up its efforts to open its financial sector
further in 1996, said Lu Xueyong, president of the Beijing branch
of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"We'll strive to increase the number of overseas financial
institutions operating here this year," Lu told a municipal
meeting on finance.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Bank of Tokyo, Citibank of the United States and the
Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corporation became the first
overseas banks to establish operational branches here last year.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that financial supervision will also be beefed up this
year, and urged state-owned commercial banks to "actively
participate in and support mergers and bankruptcies of
enterprises".
</P>
<P>
Official sources have said that Beijing will this year become
one of the 50 Chinese cities where mergers and bankruptcies of
enterprises are allowed on an experimental basis.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that over 10 percent of the added lending volume of
Beijing's commercial banks will be directed to agriculture and
agriculture-related industries.
</P>
<P>
Lending priority will also be given to large state-owned
enterprises and enterprise groups, especially to those in such
sectors as the automobile, electronics, machinery, metallurgy,
petrochemicals, energy, housing and construction materials,
according to Lu.

<HEADLINE> Almost Half Europeans See No Benefit from EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Forty-eight percent of the
Europeans believed that their countries have not benefited from
the European Union (EU), an EU poll shows.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, conducted in November and December last
year by a subsidiary of the EU and published by the EU Commission
today, the number of people who regard their countries' entry into
the EU as "a good thing" dropped one percentage point from
November to 57 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The results were based on a survey of citizens in the 15 EU
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Among Austria, Sweden and Finland, which all joined the EU in
January last year, only Finland saw the number of EU supporters
increase a little from September last year, while the Swiss gave
the EU fairly weak support and the Austrians offered a level of
support which was lower than the average of 15 EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
In Germany and France, the number of citizens in favor of the
EU also decreased last December, and that of people who regard
entry into the EU as a good thing went down to 40 percent and 50
percent respectively, one and 1.5 percentage points lower than
last November.
</P>
<P>
In Britain, Spain, Italy and Denmark, however, EU supporters
increased somewhat last December.
</P>
<P>
Results of the poll also show that last November only 44
percent of the European citizens felt the EU was operated in a
democratic way, lower than the 48 percent registered last
September.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, only 21 percent of the surveyed said they
had heard of the EU's 1996 inter-governmental work meeting.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 70 percent of the surveyed said that on
issues such as scientific research, anti-drug campaign, diplomacy,
sex equality, environmental protection and cooperation with the
Third World, policies should be made by the EU instead of the
governments of the member countries.

CARACAS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is trying to pay off its
debts to Venezuela with medical products, it was revealed today.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's national bank is currently in negotiations with the
Venezuelan central bank for new commercial debt loans. But the
country already owes 47 million U.S. dollars to Venezuela and is
now offering to sell medical products to the Venezuelan government
at market prices to pay off part of the debt.
</P>
<P>
Diana Fernandez, director of Cuba's national bank, refused to
divulge what percentage of the debt she's offering to swap for the
medical products, saying it was a matter for negotiation, but said
that the reactivation of new loans with Venezuela is more
important than paying the 47 million dollar debt.

<HEADLINE> Germany Unveils Economic Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The German government Tuesday
unveiled a 50-point plan aimed at stimulating economic development
and halving its unemployment from the current 4 million by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government proposals include tax cuts, reduction in social
welfare, cuts in public spending, as well as cuts in the federal
workforce and accelerated privatization of state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
Tax cuts in the plan include the abolition of the local tax on
corporate capital, an unspecified cut in the local tax on profits,
the reduction of the solidarity tax, which was levied to help pay
for rebuilding eastern Germany, to 5.5 percent from the current
7.5 percent, and the cut in the income tax rate.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, pension, health insurance and
unemployment insurance costs are to be cut to 40 percent of the
wages by the year 2000 from 41 percent now.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the German government will encourage the
establishment of private businesses and promote job training in
order to create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
While denying that the plan was a spending program, German
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told a news conference that the
action program is like a "multi-vitamin shot" that strengthens the
body's functions and energy.
</P>
<P>
The plan was aimed at improving conditions for investment and
creating new jobs, Rexrodt said.
</P>
<P>
The plan comes amid growing doubts about Germany's ability to
meet the Maastricht criteria for European economic and monetary
union.
</P>
<P>
The German government's annual economic report released Tuesday
predicted a 1.5 percent growth in the gross domestic product (GDP)
for 1996 against 1.9 percent in 1995. It forecast that the number
of people out of work will reach 3.9 million and the price index
will remain at 2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The German economic program also calls for continued
privatization of government holdings in the Lufthansa national
airline, in Germany's telecommunications system and in the post
office savings bank, among other enterprises, as part of
commitments to roll back the state sector.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Government to Study Adjustment Plan Without IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government is
studying an alternative adjustment program without the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), said an official of the ruling
National Convergence Party.
</P>
<P>
The official said Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar made
the proposal during a meeting with the parliamentary group of the
party that does not have a majority in congress.
</P>
<P>
The party official was quoted by a local economic newspaper as
saying today that government representatives has told IMF
negotiators that Venezuela would not accept any shock program or
forced increase in gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
If no agreement is reached with the IMF, the revenues from
privatization would enable him to lift the exchange controls
imposed two years ago, Matos was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper commented that Matos's proposal for an adjustment
without the IMF is a big contradiction because an agreement with
the financial organization is essential since its guarantee is
required before talks with its international creditors can begin.
</P>
<P>
Matos told the Convergence party members that an increase in
fuel prices is a matter of time and the IMF and the neo-liberals
in the country "have wanted to convert it into an issue of
ideology."
</P>
<P>
The minister asked the Convergence legislative fraction to back
congressional approval of a foreign and internal debt rescue fund.
</P>
<P>
A 7.5 billion-dollar bond issue guaranteed by petroleum
revenues is expected to be offered over the next few months which
will be used to amortize capital and pay interests to foreign
creditors, he said.
</P>
<P>
An agreement is urgently needed with the Paris Club in the near
future to defer payments because there is not enough money to
service the debts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that it is impossible to consider
opening the economy more at this time, "because there is no market
in Venezuela."

<HEADLINE> Formula One Cars to Have "Black Boxes" in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Black boxes similar to those in
aviation will be installed in all Formula One racing cars from the
start of the 1997 season, International Motoring Federation (FIA)
said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
FIA president Max Mosley said the device could be introduced on
an experimental basis as early as this season.
</P>
<P>
He said the design work had been commissioned to an American
company, which will cost 1.0 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the fee will be split between all competing teams, he added.
</P>
<P>
The data recorded in the black box would only be used to help
the FIA to analyze an accident and would not be used in the cases
of minor collisions or controversies, Mosley said.

<HEADLINE> Xie Jun Wins Opener of World Chess Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAEN, Spain, January 30 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Women's world chess
champion Xie Jun of China won the opener of the world championship
against Hungarian challenger Zsuzsa Polgar here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Xie, who played the blacks, made 60 moves before forcing Polgar
to concede her loss.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Xie spent two hours and one minute to seal her
first win, while Polgar took 53 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first game where both of us played cautiously and
tentatively," said Xie after the game. "Polgar squandered a chance
to force draw in the ending and I took advantage of her error to
win the game."
</P>
<P>
Xie's coach Ye Jiangchuan said Polgar placed a dangerous 11th
move in the opening stage, possibly in an attempt to form a group
of pawns in the center which eventually reduced the power along
the king.
</P>
<P>
Ye added Polgar's time trouble in the ending stage, where at a
time she spent 40 minutes more than Xie, also contributed to her
first defeat in the 16-game championship.
</P>
<P>
Each win scores one point and a draw 0.5 point. While
title-holder Xie needs only eight points to keep her crown,
challenger Polgar has to score 8.5 points to wrest the title.
</P>
<P>
Xie dethroned Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia to take the world
title in 1991 and beat another Georgian Nana Ioseliani to retain
her crown in 1993.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Mexico has lodged a protest
with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against a U.S. bill to
block Mexican tomato export to its market, official sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican delegation to the WTO said the bill is clearly
incompatible with the commitments made by the United States in
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The bill, drafted by lawmakers from Florida, is to be
debated on in the U.S. Congress today.
</P>
<P>
The International Trade Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives accused Mexico of dumping its tomatoes on the
U.S. market and pressed for a blockade.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has rallied support from Canada, Chile, Australia,
Argentina, New Zealand, Guatemala, Brazil, Peru, Malaysia and
Colombia, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Confederation of Agricultural Associations for
Sinaloa, the biggest tomato exporters group in Mexico, asked
President Ernesto Zedillo to contact his U.S. counterpart, Bill
Clinton, to find a solution to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
About 1.2 million people are engaged in the production of
vegetables in Mexico.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji today discussed with Chilean President Eduardo Frei trade
and economic cooperation between their countries and other matters
of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting in the presidential palace, the Chilean
president emphasized that Chile attaches great importance to the
development of relations with China in various aspects.
</P>
<P>
He said his state visit to China not long ago left Chilean
officials and businessmen with a good impression of the enormous
economic development in China.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Zhu said that after the establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and Chile 25 years ago,
bilateral relations in various aspects have been developing
satisfactorily and trade between the two countries reached some
740 million U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, it represents only a small portion of China's foreign
trade, and therefore there are broad prospects for increasing
trade between the two countries, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China imports more than 300,000 tons of copper every
year and will increase its copper imports in the years to come as
China's national economy grows.
</P>
<P>
He also said China is interested in making investments in the
production of copper in Chile, the world's largest copper producer.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhu expressed appreciation over Chile's
one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Zhu met President of the Chamber of Deputies
Jaime Estevez and Chief Justice Servando Jordan respectively.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Zhu had working conversations with Foreign
Minister Jose Miguel Insulza, Minister of Economy Alvaro Garcia,
acting Finance Minister Manuel Marfan, and other government
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived in Chile from Argentina yesterday. He will also
visit Uruguay and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Allow Private Operators in Railway Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Poland's men in the street will
soon be able to get their fingers in the pie of the country's
train network as the government approved a draft law to privatize
the railways.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Boguslaw Liberadzki hailed the government
approval as having paved the way for privatization in the railway
sector.
</P>
<P>
Poland's railway network of more than 26,200 kilometers needs
massive domestic and overseas investment for substantial
modernization such as electrification and changing track gauges
from narrow to wide format.
</P>
<P>
The minister said private owners can start with freight
transport and gradually move into the realms of passenger
transport.
</P>
<P>
The new railway law, once implemented, will encourage the
formation of a multi-ownership national railway network which
allows individuals and groups to jointly run the network on a
lease basis.
</P>
<P>
The existing railway law was passed in December 1960 and is
deemed as incompatible with the needs of Poland's current
market-driven economy.

PARIS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- France hoped that the United
States would continue to carry out its obligations and maintain
its military presence in Europe, Presidential Spokeswoman
Catherine Colonna said here today.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac will voice this wish during his visit
to the United States beginning Wednesday, the first by a French
president for 12 years, she told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Trans-Atlantic relations in the fields of security and defense
as well as bilateral economic cooperation will be focused during
this visit.
</P>
<P>
France believed that threats have not vanished in spite of
changes in the international situation and asserted the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will "continue to guarantee
the security of Europe," Colonna said.
</P>
<P>
But she said NATO, founded in the era of East-West
confrontation, must speed up reform and adapt itself to the new
situation. She cited the NATO peace mission in Bosnia as an
obvious example that she said has gone beyond the objectives set
at the time of its founding.

<P>
KIEV, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
said today that the government is to negotiate with coal miners on
their strikes and work out regulations on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma made this announcement when meeting with Alexandr
Stoyan, chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of 1995, coal miners in eastern Ukraine held
a series of warning strikes to demand their pay in arrears and
improvement of their living conditions. On January 26, 1996, the
miners announced that they would go on an indefinite strike and
stop coal supplies to consumers from February.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said that during the meeting, Stoyan called
on the president and the government to pay the miners as soon as
possible in order to ease the mounting tension between the
government and the workers.
</P>
<P>
Stoyan also suggested that new policies on finance, tax and
loan be made to create a better environment for the development of
state-run enterprises.

KIEV, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The prime ministers of Romania and
Ukraine will meet and sign a series of agreements on
transportation, education and opening of transit posts in an
effort to strengthen the ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Ambassador to Romania Alexander Chaliy told a news
briefing here today that his country also offered to hold a sixth
round of talks with Romania in February on a basic political
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Citing Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melscanu, Chaliy said
signing such a treaty by the two countries takes precedence in
Romania's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
On the disputed Zmeinyy island, the ambassador said his country
will not accept any territorial claims by other countries on its
islands and continental shelves.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the Zmeinyy island, he pointed out, could be
discussed after a political treaty is signed by the two countries
to demarcate their continental shelves and economic zones.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over the island has obstructed the signing of the
political treaty by the two countries, whose trade ties however
have improved.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two states, which amounted to 250
million U.S. dollars in 1995, is expected to reach 330 million
dollars in 1996.

Arafat said here today that Sweden will mediate in the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks on the future status of Jerusalem.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia's parliament today
approved the formation of a new central government and a new prime
minister to rebuild the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Parliament elected Hasan Muratovic as prime minister of the new
cabinet, replacing Haris Silajdzic who resigned last week, and
endorsed his program.
</P>
<P>
Other cabinet members include Foreign Minister Jadranko Prlic,
Finance Minister Mirsad Kikanovic, Justice Minister Hilmo Pasic,
Minister in Charge of Refugees and Emigration Nudzeim Recica,
Foreign Trade Minister Neven Tomic and Minister Without Portfolio
Dragoljub Stojanov.
</P>
<P>
The government, which currently has three Muslim and three
Croat ministers, will be expanded by three Serb ministers after
national elections in September.
</P>
<P>
The new government, formed under the terms of the Dayton peace
accord, will be in charge of foreign policy, foreign trade and
monetary policy for the whole of Bosnia. Defense will be run by a
three-member presidency consisting of a Croat, a Muslim and a
representative of the Serb entity.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan, the central government will head a dual
state -- a Muslim-Croat federation, controlling 51 per cent of the
country and a Serb Republic controlling 49 per cent. A new
government of the federation is expected to be appointed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic previously served as minister without portfolio in
charge of liaison with the NATO-led multinational peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister told parliament the most important task
for his cabinet is to reconstruct the war-torn country and grapple
with unemployment.
</P>
<P>
He said his government will work for a speedy admittance of
Bosnia-Herzegovina to the European Union and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization though the country is believed to give
priority to developing relations with neighboring Croatia and
Yugoslavia.

"I think a two-month ban for a first offence and a longer
suspension for a second offence, along with the withdrawal of
certain aid, would be adequate," said Drut.

Cannabis is on the IOC list of banned substances, but is

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The chief U.N.
representative in Haiti recommended on Tuesday the Security
Council continue its mission in Haiti after February 29.
</P>
<P>
Lakhdar Brahimi told reporters after briefing the council on
the situation of Haiti that Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali was waiting for a request from President-elect Rene
Preval after he takes office early next month.
</P>
<P>
He said the continuing stay of the U.N. peacekeeping force in
Haiti would be helpful to Rene Preval in his early days in office.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomat sources, Brahimi made the recommendation
during his briefing to the Security Council.

<P>
They said that Boutros-Ghali was likely to recommend to the
Security Council that a reduced force of about 1,800 peacekeepers
plus about 300 civilian police stay in Haiti for six months after
the current mandate expires at the end of February.
</P>
<P>
The original force level of U.N. mission in Haiti was some

<HEADLINE> Most Refugees in Yugoslavia Choose to Remain: UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A UNHCR official said here
today as much as 70 percent of the refugees sheltering in
Yugoslavia would choose to remain where they were at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Belgrade-based office of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR), Margaret O'Keefe, said at a press conference
that it was therefore necessary to adopt program for a permanent
accommodation of refugees as well as to secure conditions for
their integration into local communities. Yugoslav government
claims that there are around 650,000 refugees in its country.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, UNHCR will ask 16 non-governmental humanitarian
organizations to provide food and basic furnishings, and to carry
out programs for rebuilding water and power supply-systems, she
said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR will ask donor countries to secure 300 million U.S.
dollars for the former Yugoslavia, of which 60 million dollars for
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 35 million for Croatia and 200
million for Bosnia-Herzegovina, she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnia peace agreement, the basic principle
concerning refugees is to encourage them to return home or at
least to the area near where they had lived before fleeing during
the war. Two conditions -- a safe return and the respect of their
rights -- must be secured for the refugees who plan to go back
home.
</P>
<P>
But if those refugees who do not want to return or have no
place to return to, UNHCR will help them integrate into local
communities, O'Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 3 million refugees from the former Yugoslavia,
half of them in the Balkan region and half in other European
countries.

<HEADLINE> World PC Sales Expand in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The 1995 world-wide sales of
personal computers jumped by nearly a quarter to 59.7 million, in
comparison to the 1994 volume.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by "Dataquest," a computer market
research firm stationed in California, the Compaq Computer
Corporation of the U.S. retained its top position as the world's
leading marketer of PC last year. It is followed by IBM, Apple,
Packard Bell and NEC.
</P>
<P>
Among the five largest sellers, NEC from Japan registered the
biggest increase of 48 percent in the 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the industry has consolidated around the producers of
the key PC technologies -- Intel's chip, and Microsoft's operating
system, according to the researchers.
</P>
<P>
The market got a boost after Intel produced faster chips and
Microsoft released Windows 95' in August.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard, a leading manufacturer of laser printers,
managed to more than doubled its PC products and edged its
position on the U.S. market to No. 7, after it sold more than 1
million units.
</P>
<P>
Multi-media products and connections to internet also helped
boost the PC market, experts said. In the United States, a market
which is more matures and took up 21 percent of the world market,
more users have their computered upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the devaluation of U.S. dollar earlier
last year, greatly benefited PC exporters of the country.

WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called on both Turkey and Greece to exercise restraint and
caution in their dispute over an uninhabited islet in the eastern
Aegean sea.
</P>
<P>
Clinton issued appeal to the leaders of Greece and Turkey, both
NATO allies, during separate telephone calls, a senior American
official who asked not to be identified told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the two nations "are not on the verge of
war but are on the edge of military action which would create
significant tensions in the eastern Mediterranean."
</P>
<P>
The official declined to describe the U.S. role as formally
mediating between the two NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, which came close to war in March 1987 over
mineral rights in the Aegean sea, claim the barren little rock
known as Imia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have urged each other to withdraw their
warships near the tiny islet between the Turkish coast and the
Greek island of Kalymnos, but neither has showed signs of giving
in.

<P>
The index of blue chip companies is now only about 20 points
shy of 5,400, having cracked the 5,300 mark for the first time on

</P>

Analysts said it showed that economic weakness of the country
heightened expectations the Federal Reserve would cut interest

At today's session, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by
more than 2 to 1, with 1,678 up, 774 down and 661 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 464.33 million shares, up from 362.87

Broad-market indexes also rose, with the New York Stock
Exchange composite index and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list both
climbing from record marks set a day earlier.

This morning, the Commerce Department reported that retail
sales edged up a disappointing 0.3 percent in December. Also this
morning, a private research group reported that consumer
confidence sank in January to its lowest level in nearly two years

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Pullback of Greek, Turkish Warships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali on Tuesday urged Greece and Turkey
to withdraw its naval vessels and other forces from the vicinity
of Imia, a disputed Aegean island.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the both sides to avoid statements that might
encourage further incidents, and to resolve their differences
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general is concerned by the sudden outbreak of
tension between Greece and Turkey as a result of incidents in the
neighborhood of the uninhabited islet of Imia in the Aegean sea,"
a statement issued by his spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said on the instruction of Boutros-Ghali, the
under-secretary-general for political affairs, Marrack Goulding,
had met separately with the Charges d'Affaires of the Permanent
Missions of Greece and Turkey and urged that both governments
exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
Imia is an uninhabited islet between the Turkish coast and
the Greek island of Kalymmos.
</P>
<P>
Citizens from both countries in recent days have planted
their flags on the islet and ripped down the other side's flags.
Greek and Turkish warships have headed for the area.
</P>
<P>
Athens says that the island was ceded to Greece by Italy in
1947 along with the main islands of the Dodecannese off the
Turkish coast, while Turkey says that the islet and many other
similar rocks were not covered by two treaties in 1923 and 1947
under which Italy ceded the Dodecannese Islands to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey have turn sour because of
disputes over mineral rights in the Aegean, Cyprus and minority
rights in Greece's western Thrace region.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Confident of Russia's Reform Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today expressed his belief that Russia led by President Boris
Yeltsin is "firmly moving forward" on the economic reform path.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before meeting with Russian Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at the White House, Clinton said that
his belief was based on his telephone conversation with Yeltsin
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the 40-minute call, the Russian leader reportedly
assured Clinton that Russia will continue the policy of reforms
despite recent major personnel changes in the government.
</P>
<P>
"I personally am convinced by the assurance that I received
from President Yeltsin in our phone call last week...that Russia
is firmly moving forward on reform," Clinton stressed.
</P>
<P>
He praised Russia for its achievement yielded from the economic
reforms in the past year.
</P>
<P>
"They had a good year in 1995. They had inflation down,
production was stable, the ruble was stronger. I think they're
seeing some real economic growth there and it's a record they can
be proud of," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin came to Washington late Sunday largely for a
two-day meeting of the Joint U.S.-Russia Economic and
Technological Cooperation Commission.
</P>
<P>
He is also going to have discussions with leaders of the
International Moneytary Fund (IMF) on the Fund's new three-year
loan of 90 billion U.S. dollars to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton voiced his backing to the loan although some American
officials have expressed their concern that the fund might cancel
the loan because of recent personnel changes in the Russian
government.

LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major failed to break the impasse in the peace process in Northern
Ireland after his talks here tonight with John Hume, leader of the
Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the largest Catholic

<P>
According to reports here, Major had hoped to persuade Hume to
accept his elections notion as a valid way of starting all-party
negotiations on the future of Northern Ireland.

But after 90-minute "intensive" talks, Hume said his attitude
to elections in Ulster remained unchanged, and he and his SDLP
strongly opposed the government's plans for elections in the
province.

He said he now believed that his party and Major were involved

approach to a comprehensive negotiated peace settlement" of the

<HEADLINE> 5 killed in Clash in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Three policemen and two Kurdish
rebels were killed today in a clash between security forces and
illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) militants in southeastern
Turkish town of Nusaybin.
</P>
<P>
The clash punctuated the quiet prevailing in the area since the
PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire last December, although a bus
attack killed 11 civilians earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Today's clash occurred when security forces began conducting
house searching in two neighborhoods on a tip-off that the PKK
militants were sheltering in the town, the Anatolia News Agency
said.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been waging a war for self-rule in southeastern
Turkey since 1984 and the fighting has so far claimed over 20,000
lives, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, believed to reside in Syrian
capital of Damascus despite Syrian official denials, announced
the ceasefire on December 15 in hopes of drawing Turkey into
negotiations for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Turkey snubbed the call, saying it "refuses to talk with
terrorists," and continued military operations for cracking down
on PKK militants.
</P>
<P>
Turkey believes that the PKK is trying to gain time and rebuild
its forces which were badly mauled in clashes with Turkish
security forces.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Launches Diplomatic Offensive on Kardak Rocks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today briefed the
European Union (EU) and NATO envoys on its own views on the legal
standing of Kardak (Imia) rocks.
</P>
<P>
Ankara signaled to the Western envoys, who came to the
Foreign Ministry for a briefing, that it was ready to take up the
matter with Greece at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish briefing has taken place against the backdrop of
conflicting messages from both Ankara and Athens on whether the
two sides will "contain" the conflict or choose to escalate it.
</P>
<P>
Officials in both capitals held meeting after meeting today,
working on scenarios, but, at least in their public statements,
they carefully refrained from using "armed conflict" as an option.
</P>
<P>
They have also called on each other to "back off" their
military forces from the disputed region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Nurettin Nurkan said, "We certainly
do not hope for any shooting around the Kardak rocks. We hope
that common sense will prevail in Athens, without any escalation
of the conflict. We hope that this problem will be solved through
dialogue."
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who also signaled
Turkey's preference for dialogue, maintained nevertheless that
Ankara "did not have a single pebble to give away."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Ciller met with President Suleyman Demirel
and demanded once again that Greece remove the flag it has hung in
the Kardak rocks, which the Greeks call Imia, and withdraw its
forces. "The Turkish state is right and it will do what is
necessary," Ciller added.
</P>
<P>
However, Greece has denied that it has troops on the island,
saying that the 12 people called Greek troops by the Turkish
Foreign Ministry were in fact "divers" affiliated to the Greek
naval forces.
</P>

The atmosphere in Ankara became tense with speculation that a
Greek frigate was heading toward the island. "Turkey will not
accept this. I hope that the Greek government will act in a
cool-headed manner," Foreign Minister Deniz Baykal said this
morning at his party group meeting.
</P>
<P>
Greek ambassador to Ankara Dimitrios Nezeritis paid a second
visit to the Turkish Foreign Ministry today and met with under-
secretary Onur Oymen. According to a statement by the Turkish
Foreign Ministry, Nezeritis asked Turkey to withdraw its
battleships from the Kardak rocks, which the ambassador said
belonged to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Oymen repeated to Nezeritis that Turkey would not accept any
fait accompli on the island and the rocks belonged to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The islet, which comprises two barren rocks with a total area
of 4 hectares, is about 11 nautical miles from the Greek island if
Kalimnos and less than four miles off the Turkish coast.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Cuts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
today decided to cut two key short-term interest rates by a
quarter percentage point, in a bid to bolster the softening
economy and guard against a recession.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement at the end of a two-day closed meeting, the
central bank's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said it was
cutting its target for the federal funds rate, the interest that
banks charge on overnight loans, from 5.5 percent down to 5.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
The FOMC also said it was cutting the discount rate from 5.25
percent to 5 percent. The discount rate is what the central bank
charges for direct loans to banks.
</P>
<P>
In explaining its action, the Fed said, "Moderating economic
expansion in recent months has reduced potential inflationary
pressures going forward. With price and cost trends already
subdued, a slight easing of monetary policy is consistent with
contained inflation and sustainable growth."
</P>
<P>
A cut in the funds rate normally triggers an almost immediate
reduction in commercial banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark
rate for many business and consumer loans.
</P>
<P>
After signs of a sluggish economy emerged early last year, the
FOMC first nudged the funds rate down a quarter percentage point
from 6 percent to 5.75 percent in July and then to 5.5 percent
last December.
</P>
<P>
Today's move followed various reports of a slowing economy,
including anemic consumer spending, sluggish manufacturing and a
flat housing market.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that gross domestic product growth
slowed to around 2 percent rate in the October-December quarter
and has slowed even further in the January-March quarter.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the central bank is clearly more worried about
the slowing economy than inflation.
