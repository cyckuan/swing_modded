Biggio catches fire; Astros, NL catch on
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ He plays the game the way we all would like to think
we would play it if we had such skill and talent.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio steps to the plate in the bottom of the eighth with
his team down 2-0. He's facing a young, talented Tigers pitcher
that looks untouchable. He hops in the batter's box, his bat
smudged with pine tar and the moment dripping with tension.
</P>
<P>
   He's done this a thousand times, but Biggio shows all the
enthusiasm and hope of a kid at the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   He stares down rookie Dave Borkowski and slams the second pitch
deep into the left-field seats. The homer sparked a game-tying
rally that turned the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, he dives headlong across the AstroTurf and
snags a line drive off the bat of Juan Encarnacion, a potential
one-out hit that might have been huge, considering two singles
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio leads off the bottom of the 10th and slams a single up
the middle, starting another rally, which leads to a bases-loaded
walk to Derek Bell. He scores the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never have to worry about Bidge,'' said Astros coach Harry
Spilman, who has played a significant role in what has become a
nearly unstoppable hitting streak for Biggio of late. ``Every day,
you know he's going to come ready to play. He just makes good
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Take advantage of the break
</P>
<P>
   Thus, leave it to Biggio to turn even a questionable All-Star
Game snub into a priceless moment.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't priceless in a baseball sense, like sitting there
among other All-Stars when Mark McGwire whacked 13 balls over the
fence in the Home Run Derby, or gathering around Ted Williams in a
pre-game tribute to maybe the greatest hitter the game has known.
</P>
<P>
   It was a quiet and personal moment, but priceless nonetheless.
What did Biggio do during his first midseason break in six years?
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught my son to ride a two-wheeler,'' he said. ``We took
the training wheels off and got him to ride. You can't beat that.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again _ to paraphrase one of Biggio's favorite expressions
_ it's the little things that mean so much.
</P>
<P>
   When Biggio learned of the All-Star snub, he talked about
feeling happy for his teammates that made the NL team, and being
happy for those who would experience their first All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   But since the snub, Biggio has responded the way we would all
like to think we would respond in the same situation. He has
trained the focus even more. He has come up with maybe his best
stretch of hitting of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He has batted .435, with three home runs and five doubles. He
had the game-winning hit Friday night against the Tigers. He
followed Saturday with the leadoff eighth-inning home run, which
was followed by the game-tying homer by Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   He got the 10th-inning single, then scrambled to third on
singles by Bill Spiers and Bagwell, then scored the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant when he gets on base to start an inning,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``When he gets on to start an
inning, we usually score.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence the Astros have won six straight.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell called Biggio's tear: ``Africa hot Houston hot Real
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   All-Star snub a factor?
</P>
<P>
   Biggio says the All-Star snub has nothing to do with it. He says
working on his hitting with Spilman has been the biggest factor.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker agreed, saying: ``He's the kind of guy that will do
that. He's going to hit over .400 for a week or two several times
during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere in Biggio's subconscious, not making the All-Star
team must be some kind of factor. He's too intense, too prideful,
not to react the way we would all like to think we would react to
such a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the snub, Biggio led off a game against the
Arizona Diamondbacks with a home run. Before the snub, he was 1 for
his last 13. Since the All-Star rosters were released, he's
17-for-39. Before the snub, he was batting .277. Since the snub,
he's raised his average to .296.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask any hitter _ they just want to feel comfortable at the
plate,'' Biggio said. ``That's half the battle right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But with Biggio responding for whatever reason and
Bagwell continuing his season-long Most Valuable Player-type
numbers, the Astros again are in first place, again are winning the
close games and again are looking like one of the league's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time around here, it's been Biggio and Bagwell and
a cast of thousands,'' Dierker said. ``Players have come and gone,
but the constant has been those two guys. When one gets hot, we
have a chance to win. When both get hot we can go on a real tear.''
</P>
<P>
   Both are hot. Africa hot. The Astros are on a real tear, their
best winning streak of the season. Maybe Biggio didn't make the
All-Star team, but that might prove to be a good thing.

MILLER EJECTED AGAIN, BUT MERCURY WINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Cheryl Miller says the WNBA and its officials have a
vendetta against her. Orlando Woolridge plans to formally protest
the game because of a 30-13 foul discrepancy against his team.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yes, the Mercury finally won a second consecutive game,
84-76, over the Los Angeles Sparks on Saturday at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheryl got kicked out of the game, come and talk to the
players,'' Bridget Pettis urged reporters. But until team officials
squashed Miller's venting about her second ejection in four games,
third of the season and fifth of her pro coaching career, that
wasn't possible.
</P>
<P>
   Well beyond anything she previously said publicly about
officiating, Miller, 35, is assured of surpassing her league record
fine of $2,500 for comments after an overtime loss late last season
at New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that I need to control my emotions, because it is
more obvious that they're looking for me,'' Miller said. ``The
league and the officials are looking for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know now whatever I do . . . I can't smile wrong, I can't
wave off, I can't say ridiculous, I can't say anything because now
I know more than anything now that the league is looking for me.
Now I have to go to the next level emotionally and draw it in.''
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back technicals, bringing Miller's three-year
regular season and playoff total to 27, were called by Jason
Phillips with 12:23 remaining as she barked about the lack of a
foul on 6-foot-5 Lisa Leslie's tip-in over 5-5 Kristi Harrower.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the thumbing, although she had been complaining
throughout the game, Miller did not go lightly to the locker room.
As La'Keshia Frett made a pair of technical free throws at the
other end of the arena, Miller waved the season-high crowd of
13,483 to its feet in protest.
</P>
<P>
   She threw one of her crutches _ necessary because of recent
Achilles' tendon surgery _ en route to the locker room, suffering a
cut on her hand, and phoned in a message to a team representative
at the officials table with 3:08 remaining and her players early
into a 12-2 clinching run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really proud of my team fighting,'' Miller said. ``This
was the first game where we played 40 minutes, 11 players played
like a team. That was Mercury basketball, and the scariest thing is
we can get a whole lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Phoenix (5-10) still shot 38.7 percent, barely up from
its league worst 38.2; made just 2 of 12 three-pointers; and was
without All-Star point guard Michele Timms for all but eight
minutes because of weakness from the flu. She collapsed in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   But Timms' backup, Harrower, had the best game of her two-year
WNBA career: 20 points, including a team record 12 for 12 from the
foul line, six rebounds, five assists and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing was we did it as a team,'' Harrower said.
``Numbers don't mean anything to me. The thing that makes me happy
about my game is I did it for the team, that's the special part
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first of Harrower's two three-pointers helped the Mercury,
which trailed, 13-2, at the outset, climb to 33-32 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (10-6) went back ahead, 53-48, after Miller's
ejection but could not put away a third win over Phoenix in 11
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set ourselves up,'' said Woolridge, who said he will send
game film to league supervisor of officials Don Rutledge as part of
his protest. ``We put ourselves in a position for this to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play smarter when we get big leads. We've got to
do a better job of utilizing the clock when we get big leads. But
the main thing is we've got to box people out. That's what killed.
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury had a 36-25 rebounding advantage, 15-7 on the
offensive boards, and shot 41 free throws vs. eight for Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge picked up a technical with 7:10 remaining for what he
thought was a charging call on Mwadi Mabika when Mercury defender
Lisa Harrison was not set. The foul actually was assessed to
Gordana Grubin against Phoenix's Marlies Askamp.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed, 70-69, with 4:49 left when the Mercury went
on its 12-2 run, eight of those points by Harrower, to move within
a half-game of Utah (5-9) for fifth in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix will bid for a third straight win Monday against
two-time league champion Houston (14-2) at 5 p.m. The Comets, who
edged the Mercury, 71-70, on July 9, are at Los Angeles today. &QL;

Van de Velde widens lead to five strokes
<TEXT>
<P>
   By EDDIE SEFKO
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Wild and crazy Frenchman Jean Van de
Velde has shown he can manhandle the 7,361 yards of misery known as
Carnoustie better than anybody else at the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Now the obscure 33-year-old must prove he can handle golf's most
feared hazard _ those six inches between the ears.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde will commence the final 18 holes today with a
five-stroke advantage on the field after shooting a 1-under-par 70
Saturday and steadily pulling away from an international mix of
more notable players.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody was ready to concede anything. Having never been
in a situation of contending in a major championship _ and with
only one professional win on his resume _ Van de Velde could be
susceptible to the nerves and tension that envelop these events.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's what his chasers are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know quite a bit of Jean Van de Velde, and he's very
good,'' Colin Montgomerie said. ``The one thing we don't know, and
he doesn't know until he has been there, is how he can cope with
the situation now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is not about swinging the golf club for Jean. It's nothing
to do with technique, and it's nothing to do with golf. It's all
about what's in his head right now. And if he can cope with the
situation, he can remain up there. He'll learn an awful lot about
himself, and we'll learn an awful lot about Jean Van de Velde.''
</P>
<P>
   What we already know is that Montgomerie and others were playing
some serious mind games after falling so far in arrears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has a lead like this has to sleep on it,'' Tiger
Woods said. ``That's not easy to do. I remember when I won the
Masters in '97, it wasn't exactly an easy night's sleep. And I had
a nine-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anything can happen, and he knows this golf course is very
penal and he has to come out and play a solid round of golf
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange, but Van de Velde didn't sound like a guy whose insides
were churning with nervousness or fear of what will come today. His
wit and carefree nature have been refreshing since he burst into
the lead in the second round, and he continued to take the French
approach to things _ nothing seems to bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot better players than me who have had even more
commanding leads than this and lost,'' Van de Velde said. ``I'm
just going to go out and try to give the course a hard time before
it gives me a hard time. I've got about 24 hours to wait for it,
which is about 20 too many.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to go out there, do my best and enjoy it. What
kind of pressure can you get here? It's the biggest tournament ever
in the world, and I'm in there a bit ahead of everybody. So what
can happen? I can lose it. That's the only (bad) thing that can
happen. And the other thing is, I can win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So either way, I'm going to have a good time. That's the main
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde seems to be the only player genuinely enjoying
himself at Carnoustie, which softened slightly for the second day
in a row as players needed an average of 75.6 shots to get around,
nearly three shots lower than the average opening round and 1{
better than Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde started his round shakily, overcoming bogeys on the
second and fourth holes with birdies at the third and seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He has been particularly sharp down the stretch. He played the
last five holes in 2 under par Saturday after covering the last
four in 2 under Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the toughest (finishing holes) in the world,'' he
said. ``If you make four pars on those last four holes, I'm pretty
sure you pick up half a shot or a shot or even a shot-and-a-half on
everyone. If you do that, you know you're doing something good.''
</P>
<P>
   The key Saturday came at the 14th. Van de Velde had bogeyed the
tough 12th and missed a makable birdie putt on the par-3 13th. If
ever he was going to stumble, this appeared to be the time. His
drive on the short par-5 14th hit a bunker on the left. He laid up
short of more fairway bunkers and tried to hit a pitch shot but
watched it skitter to the back of the double green, about 70 feet
from the hole. Three putts were a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   But he holed the monster putt, then saved two pars out of the
sand and finished his round with a 25-foot birdie putt at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   That left him at even-par 213 for the tournament. And what he
has done to lap the field borders on amazing. Consider that Woods,
Greg Norman, Craig Parry, Justin Leonard, David Frost and Andrew
Coltart _ some of the world's best-rated golfers _ could not stay
within striking range Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde started the day with a one-stroke lead over
Argentina's Angel Cabrera, who shot a respectable 77. Only
Australia's Parry, whose 67 was the low round of the tournament,
made up ground on Van de Velde among the leaders. Parry is tied
with Dallas' Leonard (71) at 218. Woods (74), South African Frost
(71) and Sweden's Coltart (72) are at 7-over 220. Cabrera (77) and
Australia's Norman (75) are at 221.
</P>
<P>
   While his pursuers have to hope Van de Velde buckles today, he
is planning on attacking things the same way he has the past two
days, over which he is a combined 4 under par. Nobody else in the
tournament has fashioned consecutive under-par rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, I am surprised to be five ahead,'' he said. ``But
I'm not surprised with myself. You know, if you believe you can
make it through, then you know it might happen. If you don't, then
it will never happen. There's always a first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that even if I bring 90 (today), I'm going
to enjoy it. Maybe people will say, `Oh, he blew it.' Or whatever.
Maybe I'm not going to blow it. It's the first time I've ever been
there. What do you expect? You know, I'm not No. 1 in the world.
Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm No. 150-something. Playing Carnoustie, if it's blowing
like a Euro-cane like it is for three days, leading by five _ my
knees are going to be touching on the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm going to enjoy it. I'm going to force myself to enjoy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the attitude that probably has the rest of the British
Open field worried.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland - You gaze toward the gabled hotel that
rises behind the 18th green, a sailor sighting land after four days
in a storm on golf's high seas.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement. Expectation. Gratitude. Relief.
</P>
<P>
   Steady now.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost over.
</P>
<P>
   You are leading the British Open. ``One'' more hole.
</P>
<P>
   The west wind at your back, you look homeward. From the tee, the
target on the par-4 finishing hole appears miles away, so small
it's as if you're looking at it through the wrong end of a
telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Another chilly gust comes up, 30 mph, tugging at your cap. Pants
legs flap and ripple like the pin flag _ 487 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The seacoast breeze beats on you like a sparring partner. The
only relief from the buffeting wind is a small, nondescript
building near the clubhouse. Dog tired at the end of each round,
you enter the safe haven and close the yellow door. In the quiet
calm, you add your score. Sign your card.
</P>
<P>
   Later, you relate the day's adventure in the media tent,
detailing ``beyer-dees and boh-gees and seeves.'' The interviewer,
Stewart McDougal, is as Scottish as tartan plaid.
</P>
<P>
   If you finish first, they will present you with the silver
trophy and call you champion. Carnoustie, of course, already has
won this Open. What you can proudly say _ which is saying a lot _
is that you never lost patience. Never surrendered. Staying the
course, you endured.
</P>
<P>
   Other golfers couldn't. From the start, some complained bitterly
about the course. The fairways are too narrow for the golfers to
use drivers. Players groused about the unfairness of the penalizing
rough, waist high in places.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tournament is over for me,'' Colin Montgomerie announced
after the second round, waving the white flag. ``Over?'' Monty was
only 7 shots back.
</P>
<P>
   At the British Open, par is a good score. Tiger Woods called
every hole ``a potential bogey.'' Double bogeys are as plentiful as
single-malt scotch. Attitude is everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players talk themselves into playing bad,'' said Butch
Harmon, Woods' coach. ``They get so upset with the golf course that
when things get a little off, they lose concentration. They make
double bogey and think, `See, I told you this (expletive) place is
awful.' They convince themselves they can't win. You can't do that
in a major championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the game's best shotmakers put up embarrassing numbers.
They said this wasn't ``fun.'' They called the setup unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is fair?'' Justin Leonard asked in rebuttal. ``There is
no boundary on that. The course isn't going to change. You have to
go out there and deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Sunday, and you are leading the British Open with one hole
to go. Standing on the tee, you gaze homeward, hopefully, wondering
what fate awaits, heart beating fast.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th is a monster. Jean Van de Velde somehow birdied it
Friday and Saturday _ one reason he went into today's last round as
the only player at par, holding a 5-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   The strip of fairway is a small target. Three bunkers on the
right. A creek that the Scots call a ``burn'' meanders from the
right side across the fairway and loops back up the left side and
cuts in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   As a train rumbles past, only a few feet from the tee, you study
the flags flying above the grandstands. They are whipping,
flapping, splashes of bright color against the gray. What club to
hit? Three wood, maybe. Or 1-iron.
</P>
<P>
   A wild slice and the ball could vanish into the rough or
ricochet off a fish-and-chips stand.
</P>
<P>
   Settling into your stance, you pick out a target point _ a
chimney on the right corner of the hotel. A clicking sound. All
eyes turn to the sky, tracking the ball's downwind flight.
</P>
<P>
   It's nearly over now. You're almost home. You are a Frenchman or
an American or an Australian or a South African, the British Open
champion.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Last man standing. &QL;

U.S. staves off elimination
<TEXT>
<P>
   After doubles win, Sampras may yet play singles match
</P>
<P>
   By JODY GOLDSTEIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What will it be? A strained shoulder perhaps? Possibly
a chronic elbow acting up? Or maybe Todd Martin will simply sprain
his ankle getting out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the only way the Americans can get Pete Sampras to
participate in singles action today, but with a 2-1 deficit in this
Davis Cup tie against Australia, they're going to try everything
they can to ensure Sampras is on the court rather than the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule it out,'' United States captain Tom Gullikson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Sampras and Amarillo native Alex O'Brien, today's
matches matter. The duo, who had never before teamed up, squeezed
past Mark Woodforde and Sandon Stolle 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3 on
Saturday at the Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies need to win only one of the two singles matches
today to advance to the Davis Cup semifinals against the winner of
the Russia-Slovakia tie (Russia leads 2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Barring some mystery ailment hitting the American team tonight,
Martin will face Aussie ace Patrick Rafter in the first singles
match at noon. Jim Courier will then take on 18-year-old Aussie
Lleyton Hewitt. Sampras will be back on the bench in his role as
cheerleader, unless Martin or Courier suffers a freak injury.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson refused to elaborate on his comment that Sampras could
be back in action, but Davis Cup rules explicitly state that a
singles substitution can be made only for a medical reason. And a
doctor's certification is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When Aussie captain John Newcombe was informed of Gullikson's
comment, he looked livid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised,'' Newcombe said, ``because the rules say you
have to have a doctor's report. I didn't think Todd was injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin reported he was feeling fine when he left his postmatch
news conference Friday, despite the fact that on-court temperatures
were measured as high as 126 degrees during his match against
Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion? That seemed to be what Gullikson was implying
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd struggled on Friday certainly against Lleyton, and he was
really feeling (the heat),'' Gullikson said. ``Some of the players
aren't 100 percent fit right now. That's all I'll say right now. We
know the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, however, seemed the last to know he was in poor health.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not injured. I'm fine,'' said Martin, who was on his
way to the practice courts when stopped by an Australian reporter
immediately following Gullikson's news conference. ``Oh, I haven't
spoken to Gully. I don't want to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras fueled the speculation when asked if he suddenly had a
change of heart about playing singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be honest,'' Sampras said. ``Our back is against the
wall at the moment. We are going to talk about it tonight a little
bit and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   If Sampras is to be a surprise entry, it only seems logical that
it be in place of Martin. Courier, who has never played Hewitt, has
a better chance of beating the teen-age Davis Cup rookie than
Martin has of beating future No. 1 Rafter (he'll take over that
spot from Andre Agassi on July 26).
</P>
<P>
   Martin hasn't beaten Rafter on a hard court since the 1994 U.S.
Open, and the Aussie has won five of their last six meetings. They
played twice on hard courts last year, with Rafter winning both
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   They met most recently in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, and
Rafter won then as well. Sampras leads Rafter 8-4 in head-to-heads,
though Rafter has won the last three meetings (two on hard courts).
</P>
<P>
   More significant is the fact Martin and Rafter are due on court
first. If Martin loses that match, Sampras' presence becomes a moot
point.
</P>
<P>
   This only became an issue thanks to Sampras' somewhat surprising
doubles prowess. He is ranked only 778th in the world in doubles
thanks to a 2-5 record over the past two seasons, and it was
expected he would struggle against doubles ace Woodforde and
partner Stolle. And though Sampras didn't exactly dazzle at the
net, he used his big serve to offset any lack of finesse.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of tense moments _ Sampras and O'Brien
nearly got entangled going for an overhead in the final game _ but
Sampras had three aces in the final set and a 79 percent success
rate overall on his first serve.
</P>
<P>
   Serving for the fifth set, the Americans faced a break point
after Sampras broke a string while serving at 30-all. He then
raised his game a notch, nailing an overhead to get to deuce. The
ball never crossed back into the Americans' court. Sampras drilled
an ace to earn a match point, followed by a service winner to
extend the tie another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had some tennis in the last half hour that was as
good as you are ever going to see,'' Newcombe said. ``Those rallies
are unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies can at least take heart in having made Sampras stay
on the court longer than expected. The Americans won the first two
sets, but Stolle and Woodforde took the next two, extending the
match to five sets, which lasted 3 hours and 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left is to get Martin on the same page, or at least
better informed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Todd says he's 100 percent ready to go, he'll probably
play,'' Gullikson said. ``But if he's dehydrated, or if there's
something wrong with his elbow, we'll have to look at it.''
</P>

BIG MAC STIRS BUSCH STADIUM BLEACHERS EARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Conversations stopped in mid-sentence. It was the
end of a feverish wait.
</P>
<P>
   Children snapped to attention. Mighty Mac was at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The left-field bleachers in the upper deck came alive with
chatter. ``Up here Marky baby,'' one wee boy screamed at the
batter.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the bottom of the ninth, the Cardinals two outs from
being done. Mark McGwire was not at bat against the Chicago White
Sox representing the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the scenario later, but five hours before, the
home-run king stepped to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   Fans started filing into Busch Stadium at quarter past five.
They converged on the bleachers like bees to a hive.
</P>
<P>
   They came from Chicago, they came from Champaign. They paid $13
to see baseballs fall like rain.
</P>
<P>
   A man named Jim said he drove nearly four hours, to get a closer
look at McGwire's awesome power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely the place to be,'' he said of his seat. It
might as well have been a tanning bed, so intense was the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was 88 degrees in the shade, but up in ``Big Mac
Land'' not a grievance was made.
</P>
<P>
   There are 128 seats in this particular section, so named because
McGwire's bat showers it with affection.
</P>
<P>
   He hit so many of his home runs there in his record-setting
year, plastic yellow hard hats are considered essential gear.
</P>
<P>
   Ushers hand them out in the middle of the first. Though free,
they can fetch enough to quench a mighty thirst.
</P>
<P>
   One woman saw the hat and so wished to have it, she offered $10
for the souvenir trinket.
</P>
<P>
   Another fan said before the game began, ``You're sitting there?
You get a hard hat. You're so lucky, man.''
</P>
<P>
   It did seem a bargain, at less than 20 dollars, to be right in
the thick of all the whoops and the hollers.
</P>
<P>
   It first got loud at about half past five. McGwire stepped into
the batting cage and hit a few line drives.
</P>
<P>
   His third visit to the cage, he hit a screaming missile, sending
it into the upper deck in center field like an urgent epistle.
</P>
<P>
   It went 500 feet if it went an inch; watching its arc, it was
hard not to flinch.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing roar, like the goose pimples on your arms, was
impossible to ignore. No way could the one fan be blamed, for
saying batting practice ``is more fun than the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, batting practice would make a few curtain calls; the
ensuing nine innings producing four long balls.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire batted in the first with two runners on base. The fans
rose as one and rocked the place.
</P>
<P>
   When he sent the first pitch over the left-field wall, a few
people in ``Big Mac Land'' jeered. What gall!
</P>
<P>
   (They obviously wanted McGwire to hit the ball to them or not
out at all).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were just hungry. If a McGwire ball lands in Section
383, the ticket stubs may be redeemed for a certain hamburger
patty.
</P>
<P>
   One unhappy camper in ``Big Mac Land'' was 7-year-old Travis, a
huge McGwire fan. When his mother told him they were going to see
McGwire play, Travis thought that meant up close, not some 500 feet
away.
</P>
<P>
   But Travis, his mom chided him, can't you see, what fun people
are having in Section 383?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was hardly boring, what with people doing the wave
and spraying cans of silly string.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were anything but feckless when McGwire was on deck.
They clapped and chanted and gave the poor pitcher heck (especially
if he dared throw McGwire not strikes but balls; that about sent
people over the wall!).
</P>
<P>
   McGwire walked in the third and next time he flied out. But on a
2-2 pitch in the seventh there was not even a doubt. The ball
sailed over the center-field fence _ No. 31 for the season, for
point of reference.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, McGwire had a chance to do it all again, and this
time maybe deliver a tie or set up a win. There was a runner on
second when he stepped to the plate. For the White Sox, there
seemed no crueller fate.
</P>
<P>
   He grounded out and the runner moved to third. Two batters
later, the Cardinals were cooked birds.
</P>
<P>
   They were done, beaten by a single run.
</P>
<P>
   Only then did the fans file out of the park. They had seen
Mighty Mac's brilliance, but now it was dark.
</P>

DREAM TEAM DUNKS ANOTHER, BUT 1 SHOT STEALS SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ In Argentina, it may be known someday as
``El Donkeo.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one basket from the team on the losing end of a
103-72 score, but it was the shot that everybody at Roberto
Clemente Coliseum was talking about _ including the USA Dream Team
that won the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who close out preliminary round play in the
Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament today against Cuba, have put
on a high-flying basketball show while running their record to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Andres Nocioni, a 19-year-old Argentinian forward,
who provided the highlight of the tournament so far.
</P>
<P>
   Nocioni, who did not even play in the first half, drove past
U.S. forward Kevin Garnett, turned sideways while airborne and _
arm fully extended a la Julius Erving _ threw down a vicious
reverse dunk over Garnett and Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   It had no impact on the outcome, but the crowd of 5,000 roared,
and the applause grew to a standing ovation during a timeout that
followed the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about what I did,'' Nocioni said. ``I went
sideways, and I'm astonished I made it. I'll remember it always as
a beautiful experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, so will Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the art of dunking,'' Garnett said. ``Dunk or get
dunked on. Sometimes you get that. It will probably be on posters
and all that down there. It was good for basketball. It got the
crowd and both teams into the game, even though it was a blowout.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I told him if he did that again I'd break his wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Nocioni had no idea what Garnett was trash talking
about. He doesn't speak English.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-foot-7 forward with remarkably long arms and explosive
leaping ability from the province and city of Sante Fe speaks hoop
fluently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches warned us he could jump,'' said Tom Gugliotta of
the Suns, who sat out the game because of pain from his fractured
nose. ``I guess we weren't listening to them. He got two of our
best shot blockers at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, U.S. Coach Larry Brown pulled a roster out of
his pocket outside the Dream Team locker room and, pointing to the
sheet of paper, asked some Argentinian players to tell him about
No. 7 _ Nocioni.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was teasing (assistant coaches) Tubby Smith and Gene Keady
about recruiting the 19-year-old kid,'' Brown said. ``He's a very
athletic young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Nocioni, who began playing in Argentina's first division as a
professional when he was 16 years old, plans to play in Europe next
season, probably with a team in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett admitted to being at least a little impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he'll make the NBA off of that one dunk, who knows?''
Garnett said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   At least maybe he'll get to play in the first half of his team's
next game against Uruguay. Argentinian Coach Julio Lamas attributed
Nocioni's first-half absence to ``adjustments.'' The crowd adopted
Nocioni after that play, cheering him whenever he touched the ball.
No surprise to Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn Kemp has always been my man when it comes to dunking,''
Garnett said. ``If I saw him throw it down like that on someone, I
was like, `Whoa!' It's entertainment. You have to remember that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great Charles Barkley said the fans pay a lot of money. I
don't know how much they pay here; it's good money. It's just a
form of entertainment. Dunk. No dunk. I'm all for the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what made it such a special moment.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the field in this tournament is badly overmatched by
the Dream Team. While Garnett and his teammates have given the
Puerto Rican crowds plenty of highlight reel material, the underdog
still sells.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett has been the dunker far more often than the dunkee, but
he still made sure Nocioni didn't get away with another. At the end
of the game, the Argentinian took the ball up in a swooping, Connie
Hawkins-like move, only to have Garnett reject the shot _ and
commit a foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no body, all ball,'' Garnett said. ``I couldn't
believe they called that.''

HEADACHES BENCH GUGLIOTTA FOR GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _  &UR; Tom Gugliotta's Dream Team experience
is turning into a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns forward was scratched from the USA lineup for
Saturday's game against Argentina because of continuing headaches
that resulted from a fractured nose he suffered in the team's final
practice before play began.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it was teammate  &UR; Jason  &UR; Kidd whose elbow delivered the
blow.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning,  &UR; Dr.  &UR; Glenn Perry, the Charlotte Hornets
physician who is acting as team doctor for the USA, told Gugliotta
he would not let him play.
</P>
<P>
   According to Perry, blood and swelling from the nose fracture
has caused drainage that is resulting in symptoms similar to ``a
very severe sinus headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta complained of blurred vision and headaches Friday, and
Perry took him to a San Juan specialist,  &UR; Manuel Miranda, Saturday.
Miranda determined that Gugliotta's vision is fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a little blurred vision, but that was from some gunk in
his eyes,'' Perry said. ``The ophthalmologist checked his eyes and
said everything is normal.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the swelling has caused pressure on nerves, causing the
pain, and when Gugliotta plays, the rise in blood pressure makes it
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I run or even walk, it really beats in my head,''
Gugliotta said. ``They think it may just be that the anesthetic was
wearing off. It's frustrating because the guys are having so much
fun out there, and even when I play I have to wear that mask.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said Gugliotta would receive injections either late
Saturday or early today. A pain reliever allowed by FIBA rules will
be injected into the nerves beneath each eye, which should relieve
the pain within 24 hours, according to Perry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my call,'' Perry said of not allowing Gugliotta to
play. ``He was just so sore (Saturday) morning, I said, `Tom, you
can't play.' As soon as the pain is gone, I'll let him play.''
</P>
<P>
   But Perry said he'll remain insistent about Gugliotta wearing
the protective mask he's had for the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably have to wear it through the whole tournament,''
Perry said. &QL; 
Never changed &QL; 
Purdue Coach  &UR; Gene Keady, an assistant for USA Coach  &UR; Larry Brown
here, is a longtime friend of Suns senior executive vice president
and former Coach  &UR; Cotton Fitzsimmons. In fact, Keady has known
Fitzsimmons so long, he watched him play in junior college.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just as cocky then as he is now,'' Keady said. ``But he
could play.'' &QL; 
Nash rambles &QL; 
Former Suns guard  &UR; Steve Nash had his best game of the tournament
Saturday, scoring 21 points to lead Canada to an 80-62 victory over
Uruguay. Nash scored eight straight points in a 10-0 second-half
run that broke the game open.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians, who are off today, improved to 3-1 in Pool A
action and will finish behind only the U.S. in that pool after
preliminary play. &QL; 
What's ahead &QL; 
The USA will play today against Cuba to close out the preliminary
round. The Cubans, who won the Caribbean qualifier and figured to
be a contender for second place here, are 0-3 and have already been
eliminated from advancing out of the preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
   After the preliminaries are complete, one team from each pool
will be eliminated. The remaining teams will be seeded for a second
round-robin series of four games. The top four teams after the
second round will advance to the semifinals. &QL;

SEAT ON SIDELINE FEELS STRANGE TO TEAM'S EXPECTANT FORWARD

<P>
   PHOENIX - After a 19-hour trip from Australia while 6{ months
pregnant, Michelle Griffiths didn't feel like much of a good-luck
charm.
</P>
<P>
   It even seemed odd being in the Mercury locker room when she
couldn't put on a uniform and join her teammates in turning around
a season gone bad partly because of her absence.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6-foot-1 forward, due to deliver her first child in late
September, was pleased to be hugging teammate Jennifer Gillom as
they compared how their shapes have changed since they last saw
each other during the 1998 WNBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks so good,'' said Gillom, who dropped 20 pounds in the
off-season. ``We both looked at each other like, `Oh, my God.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected her to be a little bit bigger so late in her
pregnancy, but she looks great. I wouldn't know she was pregnant if
it wasn't for her stomach. At least she won't have to worry about
losing a lot of weight after the baby gets here. She'll be ready to
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths returned the compliment: ``She (Gillom) looks
fantastic. She's got to give me that protein diet for when I come
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put up the (weight of) the baby and what you're supposed
to put on in a normal pregnancy. I've just lost the tone, that's
all. It's hard to keep some sort of tone when the baby makes you
tired. I'm doing a lot of swimming.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths is here for a two-week visit during which she'll make
promotional appearances for the team. She expects to play next
season as preparation for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Flying coach with stops in New Zealand and Los Angeles,
Griffiths traveled alone because of work commitments of her
husband, Steve.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury guard Bridget Pettis rubbed Griffiths' stomach before
the game and declared herself lucky. She scored 11 points in an
84-76 win over Los Angeles as Phoenix won a second consecutive game
for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I can go into the change room, but I sort of don't
want to,'' said Griffiths, who sat on the bench. ``I don't want to

   ``It's fine being here really early, and we sort of had a bit of
a chat and all the smiles and laughs came out. Then it's, for them,
down to business, and for me, I feel I've got to take a step back
away because I don't want to be a distraction.''

   Griffiths started 28 regular-season games in 1998, averaging 9.2
points and 4.4 rebounds. Those statistics rose during the WNBA
playoffs to 12.3 points and 6.5 boards, and she scored 24 points in
Game 3 of the Finals vs. Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not last year, you can't get it back,'' Griffiths said.
``I'm not the be-all and end-all. I think that I would make a
difference to the team, but I'm not there, so deal with it.'' &QL;

STOTTLEMYRE TARGETS AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre is eligible to
come off the disabled list today, but that's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a startling revelation. Neither Stottlemyre nor the
Diamondbacks expects him to return from a partially torn rotator
cuff and labrum until next month. The most important thing to them
is that he continues to make progress.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, 4-1 in nine starts before being injured, threw 40
pitches off the mound Friday and will throw 50 in Seattle on Monday
and between 50 and 60 in Houston on Thursday. During that session,
he is expected to mix in some breaking pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of this month, I'm going to be real close,''
Stottlemyre said Saturday. ``I don't see any reason why I can't
pitch in August.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he continues to throw without soreness or stiffness. The
key, he said, is maintaining his mental focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely been a test of my patience,'' Stottlemyre
said. ``It's the ultimate challenge.'' &QL; 
Another homecoming &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander  &UR; Randy Johnson isn't the only Diamondback with ties
to the Seattle area who will make a return to the Emerald City
today.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman  &UR; Travis Lee lived much of his early life in the
area and graduated from Capital High School in nearby Olympia,
Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen my family in a while, so it will be good to see
them, but it's basically another ballgame to me,'' he said of the
match-up against the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am interested in the new park (Safeco Field). I think it
would be cool to get a couple of hits there.'' &QL; 
Patience and more patience &QL; 
Lee would like to get a hit in Seattle's new park, but can he?
</P>
<P>
   He was hitting .176 on the road entering Saturday's game and
.254 overall. The line drives that were his trademark as a rookie
in 1998 have come few and far between this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be all right. He's going to be a good player,'' Manager
 &UR; Buck Showalter said. ``He's tried to make some adjustments himself,
and we've worked with him on some. The thing you don't want to do
is overload him where he's thinking (about the adjustment) on every
pitch.'' &QL;

SALMON RETURNS TO ANGELS LINEUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Tim Salmon is back, but Jim Edmonds is not as
close to returning as the Anaheim Angels had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Team medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum, manager Terry Collins,
general manager Bill Bavasi, trainer Ned Bergert and hitting coach
Rod Carew will meet with Edmunds today to get a better
understanding of Edmonds' status.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds admittedly has been trying to hurry his return, but the
word is his surgically repaired right shoulder is not ready. The
Angels had hoped Edmonds could begin a rehab assignment early this
week, but Collins said that is at least a week away.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds did not take batting practice Saturday because his
shoulder felt tired.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon admitted he was surprised Collins asked him if he could
play for the Angels Saturday after just one game at Single-A Lake
Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we talked we were saying I'd be there at least
through Sunday,'' said Salmon, who sprained his left wrist May 3
trying to make a sliding catch. ``Going 3 for 5 might have helped.
If I went 0 for 4, it might have been a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon talked with Collins on the phone late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `What do you think?,' and I said, `What do you mean?'
'' Salmon said of Collins. ``He said, `Can you come here and
play?,' I said, `From a timing standpoint I'm probably not ready,
but from a physical standpoint, I'm fine.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Collins waited until Saturday morning to make his decision,
calling Salmon to make sure the wrist was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rolled out of bed and grabbed a bat,'' Salmon said. ``It was
a little achy and sore but nothing I wouldn't expect. I would have
been playing at High Desert, so why not here?''
</P>
<P>
   Collins listened to what Barry Bonds told him when the Angels
were in San Francisco and Bonds was returning from an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was physically ready to play, he just needed
at-bats and needed rehab, so he might as well do it up here,''
Collins said. ``Tim was a little different case because we weren't
sure his wrist was fine. But after (Friday) night, we were
convinced.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Lost, not found: Todd Greene was sent to Triple-A Edmonton
July 6 to ``find his stroke,'' but he is apparently still searching
for it. In his first four games, Greene is hitting .143 (2 for 14)
with one homer and three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   __ Settling in: Mo Vaughn took advantage of the All-Star break
to get better acquainted with the surroundings near his new home in
Newport Beach. He said he went to the beach one day, but he won't
go in the water.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why not, Vaughn said: ``Sharks.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Packed houses: The three-game series between the Angels and
Dodgers drew 127,446 fans, an Edison Field record.

OUT AT THE PLATE  
 RESIGNING UMPS WON'T BEAT OWNERS' TAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the umpires union is planning to play hardball with Major
League Baseball officials. Umpires believe some vast conspiracy is
under way, one to take away any chance they have of regaining the
upper hand in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   News flash: No such conspiracy exists. It never has, no matter
how much umpires union chief  &UR; Richie Phillips wants to believe it.
If the umpires thought their threat to resign en masse Sept. 2 was
going to send baseball officials scurrying, then they badly
miscalculated their goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is either a threat to be ignored or an offer to be
accepted,'' said  &UR; Sandy Alderson, vice president of baseball
operations, upon learning of the umpires' decision.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since spring training, umpires have played into the
hands of Alderson, brought in by Commissioner  &UR; Bud Selig to gain
control of the umpires. What baseball wants is to have final say
over its umpires. Currently, baseball is the only professional
sport that does not train its own officials.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires do not want to be reviewed by anyone who has not been a
major league umpire. Well, in all walks of life, people are
reviewed by those who have never walked in their shoes. Alderson, a
longtime general manager in Oakland, never played professional
baseball, yet was considered one of the brightest at his job.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of us has ever been president of the United States, yet
we all get to criticize and review the office. Outspoken veteran
umpire
 &UR; Bruce Froemming's biggest contention is that Alderson has never
been behind the plate. So what?
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' image and reputation has never been lower than in
the last 10 years. Some within the umpires' inner circle believe
that the resignations, which would mean baseball paying out $15
million in termination pay, might scare the owners.
</P>
<P>
   Are they kidding themselves? If it costs each owner $500,000 to
start fixing the umpire mess, they all will consider it the best
money they ever spent. The umpires are up against it on this one.
They have no support from the league, its players or the fans, who
loudly booed the umpires during pre-game introductions Thursday
night at many parks.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips believes he can gain support by contacting the minor
league umps and having them fall in line with their big league
brethren. The problem is that in the 21 years since Phillips took
over as union chief, this is the first time he's been serious about
the problems of the minor league umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Minor league umps, who are under contract not to cross a picket
line, would not be faced with that problem if the umpires resign.
There would be no strike. For those who believe that potential
missed calls by amateur umpires or minor league umps would result
in bigger problems, forget it. Already, baseball officials are
lining up replacement umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if umpires start splintering away from their
own union within weeks, if not days. The umpires are currently
being led to their employment death by the equivalent of a cult
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who believes managers and players won't fall in line on
this issue is dead wrong. The umpires are playing a deadly game of
chicken, and they're the ones who look like they'll be barbecued on
this one. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
Seattle's  &UR; Jeff Fassero has allowed 28 home runs this season,
setting the pace in that category. Who holds the major league
record for home runs allowed in a career? &QL; 
One giant leap &QL; 
For the 10th time since the Giants left the Polo Grounds and moved
to San Francisco in 1958, they went into the All-Star break in
first place. Of the previous nine times, though, the Giants managed
to make it into postseason play only four times.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two seasons, the Giants, who have been in first
place in the NL West in 66 of 100 days since Opening Day, faded
quickly after the All-Star break, only to rebound in September and
make a run for the playoffs in 1997 and finish in a dead heat for
the wild-card spot last season, when they lost a one-game playoff
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   They lost seven of their first 10 after the break in 1997 and 11
of 13 last year. San Francisco General Manager  &UR; Brian Sabean, who,
despite published reports, never contacted Florida about  &UR; Matt
Mantei, has shown a penchant for making a dramatic trade in time
for the stretch drive.
</P>
<P>
   He acquired  &UR; Roberto Hernandez and  &UR; Wilson Alvarez from the
White Sox in '97 and  &UR; Ellis Burks,  &UR; Jose Mesa and  &UR; Joe Carter last
year. Sabean appears content to keep this roster intact for the
stretch drive, but don't discount a shake-up from the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start the second half like we have in the past, God
forbid, we might have more necessity,'' Sabean said. ``We're all
hoping we don't have to make any moves, and if we do, it'd be a
tweak here and there.'' &QL; 
Birds dropping &QL; 
Baltimore Orioles owner  &UR; Peter Angelos, who orchestrated this $80
million train wreck, appears set to finally let General Manager
 &UR; Frank &UR; Wren do his job.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between Angelos and Wren, who was hired over the
winter, appears to have finally been settled, and Wren seems set in
finally putting the plodding Orioles on some sort of course for the
future, which will probably include acquiring speed.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be an easy task trying to put a rudder on baseball's
oldest club. A half-dozen players have multiyear contracts. The
task began when Wren started soliciting interest in some of his
veterans last week while all of baseball gathered in Boston for the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be very difficult for us to compete this
year,'' Wren said. ``I do think we can improve our team with some
small moves if we want to, but you have to look at the short-term
vs. the long-term gains of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   It all points to a major overhaul of the Orioles, who watched
veterans  &UR; Rafael Palmeiro,  &UR; Roberto Alomar,  &UR; Eric Davis and  &UR; Alan
Mills leave as free agents after the season, receiving only draft
picks in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   First on the block are catcher  &UR; Lenny Webster, who was
designated Friday, and pitcher  &UR; Juan Guzman. Those who may not be
far behind include pitchers  &UR; Scott Erickson,  &UR; Arthur Rhodes and
 &UR; Jesse Orosco, as well as outfielders  &UR; B.J. Surhoff and  &UR; Brady
Anderson, designated hitter
 &UR; Harold Baines and shortstop  &UR; Mike Bordick. &QL; 
The white flag &QL; 
The one disturbing piece of news that came from the Mantei trade
was Florida General Manager  &UR; Dave Dombrowski's admission that the
Marlins aren't about to be a championship club before 2001 at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make you feel good to hear him say that,'' said
outfielder  &UR; Cliff Floyd, who is under contract with the Marlins for
another three years. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Hall of Fame member  &UR; Robin Roberts allowed 505 career home runs
during his 19-year career, spent mostly with the Philadelphia
Phillies, for the major league record. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; A true case of all or nothing if there ever was one: St. Louis
first baseman  &UR; Mark McGwire scored the 1,000th run of his career
last weekend. More astonishing is the fact that 485 of those were
scored off his own home runs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; We'll reserve judgment on that
 &UR; one: Cincinnati pitcher  &UR; Ron Villone, who was desperate to prove
himself to his former club, the Cleveland Indians, was so upset
after not getting through five innings that he punched a wall
inside the visitors' clubhouse and cut his hand badly. Of course,
it was not his pitching hand. ``I'm not stupid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Moose Haas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; We've heard of green pitchers before, but this
 &UR; doesn't quite fit the bill: It was discovered last week that
Detroit reliever  &UR; Matt Anderson was busted last year during the
Arizona Fall League on charges of possession of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Matt Williams is probably too far gone to enter: Atlanta
teammates  &UR; John Smoltz and  &UR; Walt Weiss, each follicly challenged,
joined a charity challenge sponsored by Propecia. The two, and five
other big leaguers, will take the hair-growth enhancer for a year.
The one with the best results will have a $50,000 check presented
to his favorite charity. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
The New York Mets played a bit of gamesmanship with their
cross-town rival Yankees during the final game of their series.
With &UR; Hideki Irabu on the mound for the Yanks, the radar gun readout
at Shea Stadium continuously read Irabu's fastballs around 86 mph.
Irabu was easily reaching 93 mph on other radar guns behind the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Smoltz needs to show a healthy elbow today or Monday
before the Braves will think of activating him from the disabled
list. Smoltz had a pair of rehabilitation assignments Thursday and
Saturday. If all is well, he will start Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles right fielder  &UR; Raul Mondesi, who broke out of the
gates in a fury during the first week of the season, has 19 home
runs but only one since June 1. He had not hit a home run in 102
consecutive at-bats entering Friday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati reliever  &UR; Danny Graves has been called on to enter
games with the bases loaded seven times this season. In six of
those appearances, the opponent has not scored. ``If it's all the
same with my teammates, I'd rather skip the bases-loaded
situations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Devil Rays appear doomed to regress offensively
now that  &UR; Jose Canseco may be out for the season after back
surgery. The Devil Rays averaged 5.1 runs per game this season,
with Canseco providing the punch. They averaged 3.6 runs last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame third baseman  &UR; Mike Schmidt, one of only 15 players
to blast more than 500 home runs during his career, intends to
attempt to qualify for the Senior PGA Tour once he reaches his 50th
birthday later this fall. Schmidt's 548 home runs are seventh on
the all-time list. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
The Milwaukee Brewers have offered a multiyear contract extension
to their best starter,  &UR; Hideo Nomo. It includes a guarantee for
2000 and club options for the following two seasons. Don't expect
Nomo, who knows what he will command if he repeats his first half,
to jump at the offer.
</P>
<P>
   It now looks as though Kansas City's front office is ready to
intensify its efforts to trade pitcher  &UR; Kevin Appier. A deal could
be struck fairly quickly, with Boston, St. Louis and San Francisco
having shown the most interest. The Royals are holding a hard line
and want a top-notch prospect in return.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets and Philadelphia appear to be the most
interested parties in trading for Seattle left-handed starter
 &UR; Jeff Fassero, whom the Mariners are privately making available. The
Mets are also interested in Florida's  &UR; Livan Hernandez or Oakland's
 &UR; Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they've had time to digest it all, Cleveland appears
set on leaving  &UR; Jim Thome at first base and will seek, in a trade,
a third baseman to replace injured  &UR; Travis Fryman. At the top of
the Indians' list is Pittsburgh's  &UR; Ed Sprague, who is under
contract just for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Marlins have let it be known to other clubs that
just about everything on the stock racks is now available,
including pitchers  &UR; Alex Fernandez, Hernandez,  &UR; Vic Darensbourg and
 &UR; Dennis Springer, infielder  &UR; Kevin Orie and catcher  &UR; Jorge Fabregas.
They may even be willing to part with mascot  &UR; Billy the Marlin.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's an impressive player, the Chicago White Sox
aren't ready to anoint  &UR; Mike Caruso their shortstop for the next
six years just yet. Unless Caruso brings up his .278 on-base
percentage,  &UR; Craig Wilson may get a crack at the job. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandIs  &UR; Dwight Gooden headed out of town in the near
future?  &QL; 
2. AtlantaThere were 11 players not with the club at the break a
year ago.  &QL; 
3. NY Yankees &UR; Roger Clemens in a Yanks cap at Fenway; who woulda
thunk it?  &QL; 
4. CincinnatiWas 14-18 on May 14, the day it all changed for the
Reds.  &QL; 
5. HoustonNow that  &UR; Larry Dierker's back, this club may be on an
emotional ride.  &QL; 
6. NY MetsPlayed the Yankees like it was the World Series.  &QL; 
7. San Francisco &UR; Barry Bonds keeps a walkin' and the Giants keep a
winnin'.  &QL; 
8. BostonSox are a quality outfielder away from making the Yanks
very nervous.  &QL; 
9. TexasCloser  &UR; John Wetteland entered Friday with four blown saves
in his past 10. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. FloridaSeem to own the AL clubs; maybe they'll volunteer to
switch leagues.  &QL; 
29. MinnesotaVictims of the system or not, the Twins are not very
good.  &QL; 
28. MontrealExpos entered Friday with a 13-36 record when they
didn't score first.  &QL; 
27. Detroit &UR; Dean Palmer's 26th home run will set a new Tigers
record at third base.  &QL; 
26. BaltimoreWith trades in the works, the Orioles will take on a
different look soon.  &QL; 
25. Kansas CityThe Royals' youth movement will soon be in full
effect.  &QL; 
24. Tampa Bay &UR; Jose Canseco is thinking of retiring; where would
that leave the Rays?  &QL; 
23. AnaheimThere's hope: Outfielders  &UR; Tim Salmon and  &UR; Jim Edmonds
may be back soon.  &QL; 
22. Los AngelesFour wins before the break and a brawl have LA
thinking comeback. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; San Diego Padres: The glow of the 14-game winning streak is gone
and now the Padres are left to fend for themselves, with nothing
other than pride as a rally point. With the return of  &UR; Tony Gwynn
on Thursday and  &UR; Andy Ashby and  &UR; Sterling Hitchcock pitching as
though they are consistent winners, San Diego strongly believes it
can make a run in the second half. It's extremely early, but rookie
catcher  &UR; Ben Davis already looks like the real thing and looks like
the first everyday farmhand to come from the system since  &UR; Dave
Hollins (1992) and  &UR; Carlos
 &UR; Baerga (1990). &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Pittsburgh Pirates: The Pirates have been treading water all
season, never showing serious signs of going up or down in the
tightly bunched NL Central. ``There have been good signs, but we
haven't played with the consistency you expect from a good club,''
General Manager  &UR; Cam Bonifay said. ``I think we could have had a
little bit better record going into the break with a little more
consistency.'' Their season appears perilously close to sinking now
that catcher and heart of the club  &UR; Jason Kendall is out for the
remainder because of a broken ankle. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
 &QL; 
As one of the 100 greatest players of the century, Hall of
Famer &UR; Reggie Jackson was invited to participate in the on-field
activities at Boston's Fenway Park last week during the All-Star
Game festivities. Using today's standards, Jackson was asked what
kind of numbers he might be able to produce: ``I would probably hit
about .240 with about 18 home runs. . . . I'm 53-years-old,
brother.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
He's been the Dodgers' staple at third base for more than half a
season and it appears  &UR; Adrian Beltre is here for good. In his first
full season, Beltre is one of the redeeming qualities the Dodgers
have to show for their disappointing first half. His 27 extra-base
hits before the break indicate he is capable of putting up bigger
numbers once he learns the pitchers. Beltre has earned respect
throughout the league and handled the defensive side of the game
with above-average skills. He may be the best third baseman the
Dodgers have had since &UR; Ron Cey. &QL;

   The NFL isn't ready for the Super Bowl quarterbacks to be
 &UR; Randall
 &UR; Cunningham of the Vikings against  &UR; Vinny Testaverde of the Jets.
Their comebacks are warm and fuzzy stories, but, as players,
they've always been flawed.
</P>
<P>
   You could say the same thing about Elway's replacement.  &UR; Bubby
 &UR; Brister, who'll turn 37 next month, is a Steelers, Jets and Eagles
castoff, but the Broncos don't need him to be great for them to win
their third consecutive title, which would be an NFL first.
</P>
<P>
   They have the league's best player in running back  &UR; Terrell
Davis and smartest coach in  &UR; Mike Shanahan, which is why a
three-peat is predicted.
</P>
<P>
   As the first training camps open this week, here are some other
things to look for this season:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC division champions: Jets in East, Jacksonville in Central
and Broncos in West.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wild-card teams: Dolphins, Bills and Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC division champions: Giants by default in East, Vikings in
Central and Falcons in West.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wild-card teams: Packers, 49ers and Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC champion: Broncos will break Dolphins quarterback  &UR; Dan
 &UR; Marino's heart in title game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC champion: Vikings won't need Coach  &UR; Dennis Green, 2-6 in
the playoffs, to skip town to beat Packers for NFC crown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFL Most Valuable Player: Broncos' Davis, who will rush for
2,000 yards for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC Offensive Player of the Year: Vikings' Moss, the rookie
sensation of a year ago who is the best wide receiver to enter the
league since  &UR; Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC Offensive Player of the Year: Jets running back
 &UR; Curtis Martin, who infuriates Patriots fans every time he touches
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coach of the Year: Seahawks'  &UR; Mike Holmgren, who will end the
NFL's longest playoff drought in his first season there after
winning a Super Bowl with the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; First coach to be fired: Redskins'  &UR; Norv Turner. New owner
 &UR; Daniel Snyder, 34, is impatient. Snyder fired about two dozen
employees on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Next in line: Bengals'  &UR; Bruce  &UR; Coslet, Patriots'  &UR; Pete
 &UR; Carroll, Titans'  &UR; Jeff Fisher, Lions'  &UR; Bobby Ross and Rams'  &UR; Dick
Vermeil also could be gone by the end of the year. Saints'  &UR; Mike
Ditka won't get fired but will walk away on his own if they don't
have a winning season.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the Cardinals will finish 7-9, a game out of the
playoffs. They've had a rough off-season, losing their best
offensive lineman ( &UR; Lomas Brown), top tackler (linebacker  &UR; Jamir
Miller) and all-time leading receiver (fullback  &UR; Larry Centers) in
free agency. In addition, they play one of the league's toughest
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC East is so weak, they still could contend for the
division crown. Four teams _ Cowboys, Cardinals, Giants and
Redskins _ think they are good enough to win it.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Cardinals is they don't need a closer.
They've got one in quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer, &UR; who led them to a
league-record 7-1 mark in games decided by three points or less,
including three victories that were decided in the final two
seconds and another in overtime. &QL; 
Forget about it
</P>
<P>
   The Lions are not going to trade All-Pro running back  &UR; Barry
Sanders to the Redskins or any team. They cannot afford to make
that move. Any deal would count $7.3 million against their salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that the Redskins would like to trade for him.
Snyder, who spent $800 million to buy the team earlier this month,
wants to make dramatic moves, and the Redskins have three
first-round draft picks next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we can continue to improve our team,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   The guess is that Sanders, upset that the Lions didn't spend
their top pick in April's draft on a left offensive tackle,
eventually will report to training camp. He won't be a happy
camper, however.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't talked to Lions officials since the end of last
season. He was the only veteran to skip the mandatory minicamp in
May and again was a no-show for voluntary workouts in June.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who needs 1,457 yards to break  &UR; Walter Payton's NFL
career rushing record, also has refused to return phone calls from
Ross. &QL; 
Interest waning
</P>
<P>
   Early last week,  &UR; Lawrence Phillips thought he would be able to
pick among the following teams _ Baltimore, Washington, San
Francisco, Green Bay and Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens and Redskins have dropped out of the Phillips
sweepstakes, and the 49ers have caught a lot of public criticism
for their pursuit of the troubled running back, who was the top
offensive player in the recently completed NFL Europe season.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Coach  &UR; Brian Billick acknowledged that the team had
reservations about signing Phillips, who in 19 months with the Rams
was arrested three times, fined about 50 times and spent 23 days in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips then signed with the Dolphins, who cut him after only
two games. Last summer, he pleaded no contest to striking a woman
at a Miami nightclub and was sentenced to six months probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at the total picture _ the off-the-field incidents,
where he is now, what he would bring to this team now, what he
could do for us after playing 10 games (in Europe),'' Billick said.
``This decision is not about `Is he a good guy or a bad guy?' I'm
not in a position to determine if this guy has whipped his
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the sum total just doesn't fit for us. . . . We're
not in a position to absorb a Lawrence Phillips right now, not with
where the (rest of the) players are right now and with their focus
coming into camp. We're better served in moving on without him.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are expected to try to sign Phillips despite the media
criticism. They want him as protection in case former Cardinals
running back  &UR; Garrison Hearst (ankle) can't return.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay and Buffalo are also still after him and a decision
from Phillips could come early this week. &QL; 
Cold cuts &QL; 
 &UR; Phyllis Hayes, a secretary in the Redskins' public relations
department, has worked for the team since 1976. It didn't stop her
from being among the 25 fired by Snyder last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jeff Klein, Jack Kent Cooke Stadium manager, also didn't
survive. He was one of 15 members of the stadium staff dumped.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's fate probably was sealed when Snyder said he was
dissatisfied with the traffic flow to the stadium and the access to
the parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, the NFL's youngest owner, is known for his ruthlessness.
He reportedly fired one employee at his communications firm for
making a typographical error and tried to have a waitress asking
for drink orders during an airport lounge meeting fired for
interrupting him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another example of how far the Redskins have fallen
is that their ``Welcome Home Luncheon'' has been canceled for the
second straight year because of financial problems. The kickoff
luncheon had been held every year since the late 1950s. &QL; 
Surprise, surprise &QL; 
When Elway showed up at his Cherry Hills, Colo., home last weekend,
he was greeted by 300 of his closest friends at a surprise party
billed as ``Happy Graduation, John.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway said at his May retirement announcement that he was
``graduating'' from the NFL after 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't cooperate leading up to the party. His wife,  &UR; Janet,
had asked him to grab the family dog, which was wandering around
the neighborhood, on his way home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the kids are for,'' Elway told her, not realizing
that his wife was just stalling for time before the party began. &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
How much more are the San Diego Chargers going to put up with from
quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf? They are pleased he apologized for any
damage he caused to his room at a Bigfork, Mont., resort, but they
are tiring of all of the off-the-field incidents in his year with
the team. Leaf also has offered to make restitution for the damage
he caused during his stay at the resort over the Fourth of July
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Just what Plummer needed _ more money and another Cadillac.
Plummer won the $65,000 first prize and the use of a Cadillac for a
year by winning the NFL Quarterback Challenge, which was televised
by CBS last weekend. Plummer signed a four-year, $29.7 million
extension in the off-season,including a $15 million signing bonus.
He already owned a Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the days when any Cardinals home game except the
Cowboys was a tough sell? Some fans began standing in line at 10
p.m. Friday at the team's Tempe training facility for single-game
tickets, which didn't go on sale until 9 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When Broncos offensive tackle  &UR; Mark Schlereth had bone chips
removed from his left elbow in the off-season, he underwent a
league-record 25th surgery since 1983. Seventeen of the surgeries
have been performed on his knees.

PRESEASON HYPE TARGETS WILDCATS  
 TOMEY'S, ASU'S ADVICE: DON'T BELIEVE IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're here. Actually, they're everywhere. They are at the
bookstores, grocery stores and newsstands. The shelves are
groaning. Come to think of it, so are a lot of college football
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The season to speculate has landed with a giant, unabridged
thud. The football magazines are arriving. And arriving. There are
more polls out there than porno, and ``Playboy's'' version hasn't
even hit the stands yet.
</P>
<P>
   Does Arizona have a chance at the national title? Any votes for
Arizona State?
</P>
<P>
   Who's No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a lot of people do. If they didn't, this magazine
madness wouldn't be such a midsummer rite. It might be the only
time of the year when football gets almost as much attention as the
foldout.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of reasons not to take any of this stuff
seriously. Preseason polls are the big tease. In July, there are no
losers. Even Vanderbilt _ the school, not the jeans _ is unbeaten.
Nonetheless, all this fantasy is pretty tempting and downright
dangerous for teams with a lofty ranking.
</P>
<P>
   To wit: ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Sun Devils were a consensus top five pick. There
wasn't a publication this side of ``Popular Science'' that didn't
say they would be in the hunt for a national title validated by a
newly minted formula, the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). As it
turned out, you can delete the C from BCS and get a fair summation
of the ASU season. Whooooa Nellie, the Sun Devils fell from
contender to pretender faster than it took broadcaster Keith
Jackson to come out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   It was almost as if the Sun Devils sank to 5-6 and fifth in the
Pacific-10 Conference beneath magazine-imposed predictions that
quickly became a crushing burden of expectation. College football
players are still kids, and kids often believe what they read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought nobody could block me because the magazines said I
was this and that,'' ASU defensive end Erik Flowers said of last
season, his first in the Pac-10 after two years at junior college.
</P>
<P>
   From Flowers' perspective, last season was sobering, yet
significant. He believes ASU can use the experience as a
springboard to success, very little of which is predicted in 1999.
The Suns Devils are 18th in one publication, ``The Sporting News,''
and 26th in two more, ``Athlon'' and ``Lindy's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The preseason rankings literally destroyed us last year,''
Flowers said. ``We came in so overconfident. We were Arizona State,
and we were just going to run through everybody. We learned a
valuable lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, did the University of Arizona pay attention?
The expectations are on the other foot.
</P>
<P>
   In an intriguing reversal, the Wildcats find themselves in
almost the same spot in which the Sun Devils found themselves a
year ago. After last season's 12-1 surprise and No. 4 finish in the
final polls, the Wildcats have emerged as a darling of the
midsummer pulp machine.
</P>
<P>
   Six publications have the Wildcats ranked from No. 3 to No. 5.
Nobody is saying they will win the national title, but everybody
agrees that they have a real chance.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Street &AMP; Smith,'' Arizona is ranked first among three teams
on the rise. Says the magazine: ``Arizona Coach Dick Tomey has not
so quietly stockpiled enough talent to contend for a national
title. Is this his year?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Preview Sports,'' part of a headline asks, ``(I)s there a
championship in the making in the desert?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Lindy's,'' there's a cartoon figure of the Arizona mascot,
Wilbur the Wildcat, with a suitcase that bears a ``New Orleans Or
Bust!'' sticker. New Orleans, home of the 2000 Sugar Bowl, is the
site of the next national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Mention all of this to Tomey, and the Arizona coach probably
feels as if he'd rather be living in another millennium, a
poll-proof era. Tomey already is on record as saying that polls
shouldn't be published until late October.
</P>
<P>
   Other than banning the publications anywhere south of Picacho
Peak, there's not much that Tomey can do about the polls. He only
can combat them by reminding his players that they are meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``These magazines are fun to look at,'' said Arizona senior
quarterback Keith Smith, who is the cover boy for ``The Sporting''
``News''' Western edition. ``There are a lot of nice pictures and
all that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what can a magazine really say? I mean, a magazine isn't
going to be floating around on the field and playing the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ones who have to go out there and get it done. It's
cool to be ranked that high. But I'm glad most of the magazines are
out now. I just think we need to stay focused on these first couple
of games. If we don't, those games can bite us in the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year's soft beginning at Hawaii and Stanford,
Arizona faces one of its toughest season openers ever. On Aug. 28
in the Pigskin Classic, the Wildcats are at Penn State, ranked No.
1 by ``The'' ``Sporting News.'' Eight days later, they are at Texas
Christian, a team that beat Southern California in the Sun Bowl and
is predicted to improve on that.
</P>
<P>
   The first two games set Arizona up for a fall in much the same
way that ASU's schedule did last year. The Sun Devils tumbled from
Publication Peak with season-opening losses to Washington and
Brigham Young. They never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   None of the potential pitfalls is new to Tomey. Arizona hasn't
lived up to the most optimistic preseason predictions. Then again,
what school does? Or can? The highest expectations only leave room
for disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Wildcats were ``Sports Illustrated's'' No. 1 pick.
They graced ``S''I's cover like a swimsuit model. The nation's eyes
were on a defensive-oriented team nicknamed Desert Swarm. But Swarm
turned to scorn during an 8-4 season that ended with a loss to Utah
in the Freedom Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``SI'' has yet to publish its 1999 preseason poll. Nevertheless,
there are hints that the magazine likes Arizona all over again. It
featured the Wildcats in its back pages a few months ago. No. 1?
Maybe not. But another ranking among the top five looks to be
cinch.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 starters returning from last year, Tomey only can hope
his team has the leadership and smarts to know the difference
between pulp fiction and Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the incoming guys, I think they are going to get caught up
in it,'' Smith said. ``But I know the junior and senior guys
understand how hard it was to win 12 games last year. We were in
some tight games. We just happened to come out with a two-point or
a three-point victory.''
</P>
<P>
   At Arizona's preseason camp at Cochise College near Douglas next
month, Smith promises that veteran players will be looking for any
sign that younger players have been spending more time with the
polls than the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get on the younger guys,'' Smith said. ``If they're not
giving a good enough effort, we'll tell them we don't want them to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in the end, the real task might be in whether they believe
what they read.
</P>
<P>
   Don't, ASU's Flowers advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to hear what they say, but I learned not to believe
them anymore, 'cause you to have prove it on the field,'' said
Flowers, who discovered that proof and polls are as different as
fact and fantasy. &QL;

GAILEY IS MOLDING COWBOYS IN HIS OWN IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Face it, it's not easy trying to find something
on Cowboys coach Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Probably his three greatest flaws heading into his second season
with the Cowboys are perceptional: Gailey, as reported by a
national publication several weeks ago, was the second lowest-paid
head coach in the NFL at $600,000 per year; Gailey's beloved
offense has yet to hit its stride, and Gailey almost certainly will
never make the cover of GQ magazine any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you give the man ample time _ 6 1/2 months _ to come
up with a tidy laundry list of excuses for the Cowboys' home-field
knockout in the playoffs in January, he chooses instead to hold up
the 20-7 loss to the Arizona Cardinals as a reminder to his players
of what needs to be done in the 1999 season, not an alibi for what
happened at the end of the '98 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the organization has a bitter taste in his mouth
over the way we finished up last year ... that's behind us now,''
Gailey said. ``But I also don't want us to forget that feeling,
either. I don't want us to forget how we all felt in that locker
room when the \RNFC wild-card\S game was over.''
</P>
<P>
   That moment epitomized the final month of the Cowboys' season
and the work that needed to be done in '99. Four of the Cowboys'
five feeblest games offensively came in the last five games of the
season, including 260 yards total offense against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't go off the beaten path too much in playing that
ballgame, but there were some circumstances \R17-0 deficit less
than two minutes into the second half\S that we couldn't
overcome,'' Gailey said. ``But what these things become are
excuses. I don't like to make excuses. I'm not that kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Chan Gailey makes a lousy spin doctor.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Chan Gailey doesn't have Jimmy Johnson's salesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Chan Gailey doesn't have Barry Switzer's bunker mentality
with the media.
</P>
<P>
   What Gailey does have is an unwavering faith in his offensive
system, that his X's can beat your O's, that he doesn't need a
``savior'' _ his word _ to make his offense click. And in Year 2 of
the Chan Gailey era, it's a message that seems to have hit everyone
on the team, Michael Irvin included.
</P>
<P>
   The old NFL adage that a team takes on the personality of its
coach has never been truer than it is right here, right now, with
what Gailey will be trying to achieve with the Cowboys when
training camp opens July 26 in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a better team than we were last year at this
time, if for no other reason than the players know the system,''
said Gailey, apparently making his real point. ``We want to
incorporate everyone in the offense and keep everyone in the game.
We're not interested in the `he-is-the-savior' aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked specifically about Irvin, Gailey simply replied, ``He
was at minicamp. He worked. I'm hoping he's ready. If he's ready,
he'll have a major impact on our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys are to return to NFL elite status during the
Gailey regime, they will have to do it Gailey's way because he has
the unmitigated support and backing of Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want our fans to confuse what Chan is all about
with his demeanor,'' Jones said. ``Everything he does is directed
toward winning. He's an example that you don't have to compromise
your personal life in order to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hired him, I knew of his imaginative approach to
offensive football. That's all been proven by the adjustments that
he made for us during games last season. But what Chan also has is
the ability to pay close attention to detail and coordinate all
aspects of a football team, plus he has this imaginative and
artistic approach to the game. That's an unusual combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very satisfied with the job that Chan Gailey has done for
the Dallas Cowboys after one season.''
</P>
<P>
   So why was he the second-lowest paid coach in the NFL, according
to 1998 base-salary figures published by USA Today last month?
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, that list was inaccurate,'' Jones said
emphatically. ``People have underestimated where Chan is
\Rsalary-wise\S ever since we hired him. He's not at the top, but
he's not at the bottom. I don't want to get into the details ...
but Chan's overall package is bumping $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to back down to anybody \Rregarding Gailey's
contract\S, and Chan shouldn't, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 31 NFL coaches earn less than $1 million, based on
1998 figures, according to the published report. The lowest is San
Diego rookie head coach Mike Riley at $550,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jones' comments, Gailey apparently is more in the
neighborhood of published salaries of Buffalo's Wade Phillips
($900,000), New York Giants' Jim Fassel ($800,000), Arizona's Vince
Tobin ($800,000) and Tennessee's Jeff Fisher ($700,000). Among this
group, only Gailey has had as little as one year of NFL
head-coaching experience going into the '99 season.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was asked how he felt about seeing his salary listed in
print, accurate or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of the business. For one thing, it's not
necessarily accurate,'' Gailey said. ``I'm happy where I am right
now. I signed a contract. I'm going to fulfill that contract. I
would never ask my players to do something I wasn't willing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Chan Gailey. And that's also the Cowboys. d nn

SMOOTH PLAYER TAKES MEETING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It might indeed be Super Sunday for trainer
Bob Baffert and owners John and Betty Mabee, who expect General
Challenge to win the Swaps Stakes, highlight of today's rich
Hollywood Park card.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be a super weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and the Mabees sent Excellent Meeting and Kent
Desormeaux into the $150,000 Hollywood Oaks at 2-5 odds on Saturday
only to watch them get outrun by 13-1 long shot Smooth Player and
jockey Eddie Delahoussaye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day can't be Christmas,'' Baffert said after the
second-place finish by California's top 3-year-old filly _
frustrating because she was boxed in the middle of the five-horse
field for most of the 1[-mile race and because she seemed to have
both the room and the time in the stretch to overcome the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have five horses like that, you're always going to
have (traffic) problems,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert didn't place the blame on Desormeaux, though a few vocal
fans sounded as if they did.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside starting stall, Desormeaux took Excellent
Meeting back to last and swung her toward the rail in the first
turn, saving ground but allowing Alex Solis (aboard Dianehill) and
Corey Nakatani (aboard Colorado Song) to trap the favorite behind
pacesetters Smooth Player and Nany's Sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Although Desormeaux found daylight in the stretch, Excellent
Meeting was able to mount only a steady rally against Smooth
Player, who held on to win by a half-length and pay $29.80, giving
Delahoussaye his fourth Oaks victory, trainer Dan Hendricks and
owners John Spohler and Marty and Pam Wygod their first.
</P>
<P>
   Was it Desormeaux's fault or Excellent Meeting's?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a quarter-mile to make up a length,'' the rider said,
although the deficit might have been more than that. ``She came up
empty.''
</P>
<P>
   He speculated that Excellent Meeting's hard-fought victory over
Colorado Song in last month's Princess Stakes took something out of
her. After a brilliant win, she has lost three of four starts,
including a strong fourth in the Kentucky Derby and a
did-not-finish in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Three colts who ran against Excellent Meeting in the Derby will
be in the $500,000 Swaps _ Cat Thief (third), General Challenge
(11th) and Desert Hero (13th). There's only one other entrant _
1-for-10 Walk That Walk.
</P>
<P>
   The four-horse field for the 1\-mile event could produce another
tactical race, like the four-horse Hollywood Gold Cup, won last
month by Baffert-trained Real Quiet after a hair-raising trip, and
the five-horse Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   But Baffert said Saturday, ``I'm not worried about (General
Challenge). David (Flores) will get him around there all right.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge regained his Santa Anita Derby-winning form in
last month's Affirmed Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Now Baffert and the Mabees think he can use a Swaps victory as a
springboard to winning the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar.
Best Pal, another California-bred gelding owned by the Mabees, did
that in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge is 4-5 on the morning line against 2-1 Desert
Hero (Jerry Bailey), trying to build on an encouraging second in
the Affirmed, and 5-2 Cat Thief (Pat Day), trying to end a
nine-month stretch of solid but winless efforts in major stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The Swaps accounts for most of the nearly $1 million in stakes
purses on the so-called Super Sunday program. Also on the card: the
$250,000 Sunset Handicap on turf, the $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile
Championship for 2-year-olds, and the $100,000 Answer Do for
Cal-bred sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Tuzla lived up to trainer Julio Canani's claim that
she's the nation's best female miler by rallying at the rail with
Corey Nakatani to win the Royal Heroine Stakes early on the
Hollywood Park card. It was the fourth stakes victory in a row for
the 5-year-old owned by TV producer David Milch. . . . The lone
perfect pick-six ticket paid $173,846. . . . D. Wayne Lukas-trained
3-year-old Yes It's True and Jerry Bailey beat Good and Tough by
three-quarters of a length in Laurel Park's De Francis Memorial
Dash, one of the year's major sprints. That's 10 stakes already for
Yes It's True. . . . Showgun, in the Hollywood nightcap, gave Emile
Ramsammy his first victory since returning Thursday from a
collarbone fracture. . . . Laffit Pincay, 68 away from Bill
Shoemaker's record 8,833 wins, took a rare day off because of a
toothache. . . . Belmont Park jockey Richard Migliore will need
surgery to repair a compound fracture of his right arm after an
accident in which Ariel Smith also fell but escaped injury.
Migliore, 35, whose comeback from a neck injury a decade ago was
documented on ``Rescue 911,'' went down Saturday when J Carson had
a fatal breakdown. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

IRVIN SITUATION COULD TURN DISRUPTIVE AS SEASON DRAWS NEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Little has been heard from the Cowboys' Valley
Ranch headquarters since the June minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the quiet before the Falls, considering that the start
of training camp in Wichita Falls is only eight days away.
</P>
<P>
   But don't mistake the hush for complete tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey and the rest of the coaching staff have been
on vacation for the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They return to work tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for their arrival is the ongoing situation involving
receiver Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's under contract for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is still the possibility that he won't be on the
roster for the Sept. 12 season opener against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is confident that Irvin will accept
whatever role the Cowboys want him to play this season _ including
catching fewer passes and getting fewer snaps.
</P>
<P>
   However, the situation isn't quite that simple.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, this isn't about Jones and Irvin. This is
about Gailey and Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin didn't endear himself to the new coach last season with
the scissors incident at training camp. It also didn't help that
Irvin never completely learned the offense last season, which
hampered his effectiveness and that of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   And considering that Irvin _ though still clearly the best
receiver on the team _ is not the player he used to be, it comes as
no surprise that Irvin became the subject of trade talk in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cowboys even have discussed the possibility of cutting
Irvin if they believe that his attitude will be detrimental to the
team.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is the Cowboys have no plans of making any
long-term commitment to the team's all-time leading receiver.
Irvin, who is in the last year of his contract, would like a
contract extension that would allow him to end his career with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, however, plan to evaluate his future after the
season and only on a year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
   Since Irvin will get more money and the security of a multiyear
deal as a free agent on the open market after the season, odds are
against the 12-year veteran returning in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As far as 1999 is concerned, Irvin is finally saying and doing
all the right things.
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes him. But this will be Gailey's call, as it has
been since the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   How Irvin reacts to the changes in training camp will determine
whether the quiet will give way to peace in the Falls.
\Nsubheds:Summer of love Cornerback Terry Billups continued a
romantic trend of late for the Cowboys when he and his fiancee,
Monica, were married Thursday at the Plano church Deion Sanders
attends. Cowboys strength coach Charlie Biggurs, an ordained
minister, officiated.
</P>
<P>
   Billups is the fourth player from last season's squad to get
married this off-season, joining Sanders, center Clay Shiver and
receiver Patrick Jeffers. Shiver (Broncos) and Jeffers (Panthers)
are with new teams. Getting engaged this off-season were
quarterback Troy Aikman and running back Emmitt Smith.
\Nsubheds:Last year in Wichita Falls? One of the bigger questions
heading into training camp is where the Cowboys will train next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors abound in Wichita Falls that the Cowboys won't be back at
Midwestern State Universitythe Cowboys and their fans this year].
</P>
<P>
   But while the Cowboys are admittedly searching for a
training-camp site for 2000 _ Austin and San Antonio top the list _
they are not opposed to returning to Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Team vice president Charlotte Anderson said the Cowboys are
going to stay put until they find a better situation than they have
at Midwestern State.
</P>
<P>
   So far they haven't. \Nsubheds:Inside the locker room Several
Cowboys were recently timed in the 40-yard dash, and cornerback
Kevin Mathis claimed the title as the fastest player, clocking a
blistering time of 4.23 seconds. For those who don't believe it,
the Cowboys' training staff has it on video _ frame by frame.
Mathis' time was slower than his 4.19 clocking as a rookie, but
more impressive because he is 13 pounds heavier. Rookie wide
receiver MarTay Jenkins was next at 4.27.

LANCE ARMSTRONG CARRYING A BANNER THAT SAYS CANCER CAN BE BEATEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A cyclist must go to the mountains to become a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts are confronted, and conquered, in the mountains.
Statements are made in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong is a week away from joining Greg LeMond as the
only Americans ever to win the Tour de France, the world's biggest
bicycle race, because of the mountains. Armstrong, a 27-year-old
Texan, seized control of the Tour last week by conquering the Alps.
He destroyed the field in a grueling, 134-mile climb up four
summits on Tuesday to take a commanding six-minute lead, which at 7
minutes, 44 seconds after yesterday's 13th stage.
</P>
<P>
   If he holds the lead in the Pyrenees this week, Armstrong can
triumphantly ride down the Champs-Elysees in Paris next Sunday as
the champion.
</P>
<P>
   And make a statement that cancer can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   In taming the mountains, Armstrong conquered the testicular
cancer that threatened to take his life almost three years ago, and
the doubts that almost made him give up the sport he loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this is all about,'' said Bill Stapleton,
Armstrong's Austin-based agent. ``It's to prove to himself he can
do it and in doing that be a symbol for people facing any obstacle.
If you put your mind to it, you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong not only can become the second American to win one of
the most demanding, exhausting events in the world of sports _
2,286 miles in 20 stages _ he can become the second to do it after
overcoming tremendous obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   LeMond, the 1986 winner, nearly was killed when he was shot in a
hunting accident in 1987, but came back to win in 1989 and '90.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Roll, who rode in the Tour when Lemond won it in 1990
and is a close friend of Armstrong's, said this comeback is even
more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your cells don't function correctly, that's an entirely
different type of trauma,'' Roll said. ``Can you imagine the fear
and the doubt and second-guessing your body all the time? Can you
only imagine what that would be like, to live that way, and then to
try to be a top professional road racer? And then to decide to win
the Tour de France? It takes what LeMond did, which was quite
remarkable, and adds another dimension to it. It's not just the
convalescence of the body, but it's the convalescence of the spirit
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's remarkable comeback story is not just a story about
becoming the champion of the Tour de France. It's also about
becoming a champion for others stricken with his disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lives, in large part, for cancer survivors like himself,''
said Karl Haussmann, director of the Lance Armstrong Foundation,
the organization Armstrong formed to promote research and awareness
of testicular cancer. ``He believes those people were the ones who
supported him unconditionally when he was sick and believed in him.
He doesn't feel that the professional cycling community supported
him in the same way. They were quick to forget him.''
Beating cancer, doubt It was almost a given within the cycling
community that Armstrong, one of the sport's brightest young stars,
would one day contend for the championship of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong announced that he had been diagnosed with
testicular cancer on Oct. 9, 1996. Doctors discovered it had spread
to his abdomen, his lungs and his brain. He was given a 50-50
chance of surviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the course of two weeks it went from this is really bad
news, you've got cancer, to the doctors saying you may not survive
this,'' said Chris Carmichael, Armstrong's coach since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   His cycling career faced even longer odds.
</P>
<P>
   He survived surgery at Indiana Medical Center where doctors
removed tumors from his brain and lungs. In the process, the man
who was closing in on the elite cyclists in the world lost almost
all of his strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``He struggled to ride 10 to 15 miles,'' Carmichael said.
``That's how far down he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong began to train while undergoing chemotherapy
throughout the next year, but, in the fall of 1997 when he decided
to return to cycling, he found that no one wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an announcement that he was going to ride again and
that we were going to seek a new team deal for him,'' Stapleton
said. ``It was a very humiliating experience for all of us, because
nobody was interested. On a daily basis he and I were having
conversations about this team doesn't want you and that team
doesn't want you.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong eventually signed with the U.S. Postal Service team
for $200,000, about one-sixth of what he was making before on his
contract with Cofidis, a prestigious French team.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, less than two years after being given a
diagnosis of cancer, Armstrong returned to Europe to race. He
didn't, however, race well. He dropped out after the second stage
of the eight-day Paris-to-Nice race and returned home to Austin. He
was ready to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `I don't want to do this anymore,' '' Stapleton said.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, the athlete and his fiance, Kristin Richard, talked
it over. Armstrong realized his legacy might be that of a quitter
if he never rode again, and the trio formulated a plan that would
allow him to retire gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the same month he married Kristin, he would compete in
the Ride For The Roses, the Austin fund-raiser for the Lance
Armstrong Foundation. Then would come the U.S. Championships in
June.
</P>
<P>
   And that would be that. Flood of memories Before Armstrong could
call it a career he returned to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered that dreams are rekindled, and careers are
resurrected, in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to embarrass himself in his final two races, he
began training with Carmichael.
</P>
<P>
   The coach wasn't ready to give up on Armstrong, so he picked the
site carefully: the mountains around Boone, N.C., where Armstrong
won the now defunct Tour DuPont in '95 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has real fond memories of that race; it really helped
establish him as a premier cyclist internationally,'' Carmichael
said. ``I thought it would be valuable to get him on those roads,
and he'd be reflecting on those memories and what it meant to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   That was half of the equation. The other was his training
partner, Roll, the former road racer turned mountain biker.
</P>
<P>
   While Carmichael followed in the chase vehicle the two friends
rode together, side by side, hour after hour, talking. When they
stopped for the night, they talked some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went over every single thing in both of our lives, since we
were children,'' Roll said. ``It gave him a chance to think about
what he wanted to do. It was hard training, and it was more than
that. It was a hashing over of old grievances and understanding the
adventures that could come.''
</P>
<P>
   They rode in cold, windy weather, the worst North Carolina has
to offer. Roll loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lance and I were just riding down the road, no traffic, no
other people, in the pouring rain, for 10 days, eight hours a
day,'' Roll said. ``It could have been really, really grisly, but I
was so happy to be riding with Lance, I just really enjoyed it. It
was one of the best times I've had as a bike racer.''
</P>
<P>
   Roll's affection for the sport proved infectious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened was Lance saw my perspective of just how
important it is and how good he is at it, and there was no real
reason, once his health was cleared away, not to pursue the thing
that he does best in the world,'' Roll said. ``I've been a pro for
17 years, and I still love it as much or more than ever. Maybe that
feeling kind of rekindled in him his own love for cycling.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong admitted as much after the training session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was more psychological, more mental than
physical,'' he said. ``Even in that terrible weather I was enjoying
it, and that says something.'' Champion's coronation Armstrong
decided to keep racing. Gradually, he regained his place among the
best in the world. He finished fourth in the Tour of Spain last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael realized Armstrong was better than he was before the
cancer and thought he was ready to win the Tour de France, even
though he had finished only once in four previous tries, when he
was 36th in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done some tests beforehand that indicated he was in the
best shape he's ever been in,'' Carmichael said. ``People were
saying, `Is Lance going to hold up in the mountains?' and I said
when they get to the mountains no one is going to be able to hold
Lance's wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the mountains, where champions are made, the cancer
survivor made a definitive statement to those who doubted him, to
those who said he was finished, to those who didn't want him.
</P>
<P>
   He already held the yellow jersey after a stunning performance
during a time trial in the eighth stage. It is customary for the
leader to ride defensively, to protect his advantage. But not
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked in the Alps, winning the ninth stage, and put more
than six minutes between himself and his closest pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has attacked the Peleton while in the yellow jersey to
win a stage like that and just creamed everybody,'' Roll said.
``You have to go all the way back to the late '60s and early '70s
when Eddy Merckx used to do that. Nowadays, you have to conserve
your strength. Guys that win the Tour know how to meter out just
the right amount of power each stage to kind of maintain the lead.
But Lance didn't race like that. He looked at all of his rivals and
said, `I am going to kill you today.' And then he left them, in the
yellow jersey. It's just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains, the cancer survivor proved he is a champion.

TEST18 (Phoenix) _ They're important. They're powerful. They're
national in scope. Now, the task facing Arizona parents is to make
sense of them. Stanford 9 test scores are set for release Monday in
an annual ritual that features boasting and blame among educators
and, officials say, a lot of misunderstanding among parents. ``It's
a major indicator (of the schools' standings), and I think it's
important that we put it out there,'' said Billie Orr, associate
superintendent of the state Department of Education. ``I think it's
very powerful,'' she said, ``but it's only one indicator.'' This
year, 593,872 students in Grades 2 through 11 took the
state-mandated, timed test, at a cost of $1,619,668. The test
compares a child's marks in reading, mathematics and language
against those of students in the same grade across the nation. &QL;

MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) Last week I went to clear the trash out of

years. Now that they're gone, it was finally getting done. It was
junk. Refuse. Garbage. I was sure of it. At least until the middle
of the night, when I caught someone going through it, and
threatened to kill him. By E.J. MONTINI Story will move in the
``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL;

LOAIZA UPSET AS RANGERS PICK GLYNN TO START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander Esteban Loaiza expressed his
frustration yesterday regarding the Rangers' lack of trust in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not showing any confidence in me at all,'' said
Loaiza. ``It's bad to say that, but that's what it is if you look
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Loaiza's interpretation of manager Johnny Oates'
decision to recall right-hander Ryan Glynn from Triple-A Oklahoma
and start the 24-year-old rookie tomorrow against the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Oates based his decision on the fact that Glynn ``would have the
best chance of giving me six or seven innings,'' the manager said.
The Rangers likely will option reserve outfielder Scarborough Green
to Oklahoma to make room on the 25-man roster for Glynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy,'' Loaiza said. ``I'm mad, but it's not my
decision. Why can't they just give me an opportunity?''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza entered camp in February as the Rangers' fifth starter,
but the inconsistent right-hander pitched himself out of the
rotation with a horrendous spring.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza (0-1, 7.14) made his only start May 11 against the
Chicago White Sox for right-hander Aaron Sele, who fell ill with a
respiratory virus. Loaiza's remaining 14 appearances this season
have occurred in relief, and opponents have hit .328 against him
during his 29 innings. He got the final two outs yesterday but was
victimized when left fielder Rusty Greer lost a fly ball in the sun
that allowed Arizona to score the winning runs in the 10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn went 2-3 with a 6.95 earned-run average during his 11
appearances, which included nine starts, before being optioned July
9 to Oklahoma in favor of an extra position player for the Rangers'
final three games before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' decision to leave Loaiza in the bullpen could be to
prevent his value from diminishing before the July 31 trade
deadline through a series of poor outings.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin continues to search for pitching
help, and any potential trade partner likely would seek pitching in
return. This spring, the Rangers included Loaiza in their trade
proposal to the Toronto Blue Jays for right-hander Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza might not be pleased with his role, but he understands
that it must be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all trying to win something,'' Loaiza said. ``We're all
trying to get somewhere.''

EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Eric Karros' name has popped up in trade
rumors involving the Anaheim Angels recently and he certainly
didn't hurt his stock in the eyes of Angels general manager Bill
Bavasi on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Angels were excited about the return of Tim
Salmon to the lineup, they watched with envy as Karros slammed two
home runs and drove in five to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a
13-3 thumping of Anaheim before 39,808 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Pena hit a three-run homer and Raul Mondesi added a
two-run blast in support of starter Chan Ho Park (6-7), who gave up
two runs and five hits in 61/3 innings to earn the victory, only
his second in his past eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the win, the Dodgers remain nine games behind the Giants
in the NL West. The Angels remain 7{ games behind the Rangers in
the AL West. The Angels, though, fell back into last place,
one-half game behind the third-place Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' three-run homer off a Steve Sparks' (4-6) knuckleball in
the fourth inning turned a 4-1 game into 7-1 and paved the way for
the Dodgers' fourth win in six games vs. the Angels this season,
including two of three in Anaheim. The Dodgers have won five of six
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, though, wasn't trying to impress anybody in the other
dugout. If anything, he's giving Dodgers management good reason not
to deal him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be one thing if I wasn't producing, but I'm making a
contribution,'' said Karros, who is hitting .292 with 19 homers and
54 RBI. ``If you could get (Rafael) Palmeiro or (Jeff) Bagwell, I'd
say sure, but I don't think they are available. Sure, it's
frustrating, but it happens every year.''
</P>
<P>
   If Karros were traded to the Angels, he would be the designated
hitter. Saturday, they had Salmon in that spot. It was Salmon's
first game since he sprained his left wrist May 3, and the long
layoff was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon went 0 for 5, including a strikeout and a double-play
grounder that ended the game. However, he drove in the Angels'
first run with a fielder's- choice grounder off Park in the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I wanted to step in there and win the game, it's
not going to happen,'' Salmon said. ``My thought's there, my
approach is there, but my timing's not. There's nothing I can do
other than keep taking at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My eyes see something, but my hands don't quite get there. But
that's to be expected. The main thing is I'm in the lineup. Maybe
that affects how pitchers will throw to somebody else. That's just
the way it is until I get my swing going.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi got his home run swing back for the first time since
June 8. His second-inning homer off a slider from Sparks ended a
homerless drought of 112 at-bats. It was his team-leading 20th of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't have a good feel for my knuckleball,'' said
Sparks, who lasted only 32/3 innings and gave up seven runs and
nine hits. ``It was ball one, ball two, then I had to throw other
pitches to try to get back in the count.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best news of all for the Dodgers was the performance
of Park, who had his best outing in two months. Park, who allowed
22 runs in 122/3 innings in his previous three starts, didn't
retire the side in order in any inning but never was in serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Angels got to revenge on Park for his kick of
pitcher Tim Belcher in a fight on June 5 was Troy Glaus' liner up
the middle in the fourth inning. Park stuck his right leg out,
deflected the ball up in the air and caught it.
</P>
<P>
   Park said last month's incident never entered his mind on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about it at all,'' Park said. ``I went over to
see Belcher on Friday and waited to apologize. It was important for
me to do that and move on. After that, everything was good. All the
problems from the past were gone.

SCHRADER DOING DOUBLE DUTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ This is a hectic day for Jeff Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serving his regular duties as Irwindale
Speedway's director of competition and head of race control,
Schrader also will be crew chief for Kelly Tanner in the NASCAR
Winston West Coors Light 200 at Monroe, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it will be a long weekend,'' said Schrader, who will
take a 5:20 a.m. flight to be ready when practice for the 200-lap
race begins at 10:45 a.m. ``But it will be a lot of fun to go
racing again and see if we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Schrader and Tanner have proven in the past they can do
that.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner, who also raced in Saturday night's Northwest Series 200
event, won the Northwest Series championship in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, who gave up 17 years of being a crew chief when he
agreed to sign on at Irwindale, tuned Winston West regular Sean
Woodside to a victory at Monroe last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good car,'' Schrader said. ``It's a former Winston
Cup car. We did go test it, so as for coming up with a setup, I'm
pretty confident that we will have a good race car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't go on one of my days off, get no sleep, and turn
wrenches on a car if I didn't think we had a shot to win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schrader is also quick to point out that it won't be easy.
Neither he nor Tanner have tried to do this since last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a one-race deal,'' Schrader said. ``(Tanner) raced
the series last year and this year decided to come back and race
one race. He asked me if I would crew chief his car. I said OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be difficult, but more for him and the team because he
hasn't driven a car in eight or nine months and the team hasn't
been doing pit stops on a weekly basis like the other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Qualifying: Mission Viejo's Tim Enoch qualified on the pole
in the Star Mazda Formula Series with a quick lap of 17.401
seconds. It was the sixth fastest lap on the half-mile this year.
Las Vegas' Davey Hamilton had the quickest overall lap at the
inaugural track with a 15.655 circuit in a WSRMA Supermodified car
during opening night March 27.
</P>
<P>
   Enoch's average speed of 103.45 ranked between Bryan Germone's
103.5 mph in a NASCAR Southwest Series car and Butch Gilliland's
100.9 in a Winston West car.

STANFORD 9 SCORES CHALLENGE PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA BIGGS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ They're important. They're powerful. They're national
in scope.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the task facing Arizona parents is to make sense of them.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford 9 test scores are set for release Monday in an annual
ritual that features boasting and blame among educators and,
officials say, a lot of misunderstanding among parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major indicator (of the schools' standings), and I
think it's important that we put it out there,'' said Billie Orr,
associate superintendent of the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very powerful,'' she said, ``but it's only one
indicator.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, 593,872 students in Grades 2 through 11 took the
state-mandated, timed test, at a cost of $1,619,668. The test
compares a child's marks in reading, mathematics and language
against those of students in the same grade across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The information being released this week is a compilation of
scores by grade level, school and district, and thus becomes a
quick measure &UR; of scholastic achievement throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, they're a good indication of a system's
growth,'' said Paul Young, an education program specialist for the
state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Orr said, ``I think it's important that the data gets out and
people talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But to talk about it, much less use it correctly, parents need
to understand such terms as Stanine scores, Normal Curve
Equivalent, Grade Equivalent and National Percentile Rank.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should have seen these terms on individual score sheets
sent home in the past few weeks. But seeing isn't always
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not very clear; they're not precise,'' said Marianne
Stoneman, whose son and daughter took the state-mandated test at
Arcadia Neighborhood Learning Center this April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they give a very clear understanding of what the
test shows you,'' she said. ``I had to call several different
people to have clarity on it.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials are sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The home report included explanations of what the scores
measure, but even the explanations could use some translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most misleading is Grade Equivalent,'' state Testing
Director Kelly Powell said. ``That is a funky score.''
</P>
<P>
   And understanding the numbers is just the beginning; the real
trick is knowing how to make sense of the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to know the parameter for concern,'' said Anita
Landy, an adjunct faculty member at Ottawa University who teaches
educational testing and measurement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to know when to worry.''
</P>
<P>
   Landy said that a child's scores should be fairly consistent
among the subjects and that parents should track the tests yearly
to discern patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a discrepancy between reading and math, there could
be a learning factor there that they need to work on,'' Landy said.
</P>
<P>
   And some scores are more critical than others, Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the reading score is very low at the end of second grade,''
she said, ``I would have a flag going up'' because future learning
may depend on the student's ability to read.
</P>
<P>
   She also stresses that parents should watch for the year-to-year
trend in their child's scores. This is the third year Arizona has
used the Stanford 9. If parents haven't kept their children's test
results, they can ask their school for copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the child's trends,'' Orr said. ``Are the scores
picking up?''
</P>
<P>
   If a student does poorly in an area, a good first step would be
to contact the teacher for further insight into the child's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Legislature mandates that the test be given in
April, so by the time scores are compiled, the information often
doesn't reach parents until the school year has ended.
</P>
<P>
   But parents should know before summer whether a child is
struggling in school: Report cards, progress reports and
parent-teacher conferences all are designed to relay that
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIMS will be one (indicator),'' Orr said, referring to the new
state test called Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards.
``Daily work, weekly quizzes, like spelling, any kind of classroom
work. Stanford 9 is a single indicator.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such disclaimers, however, officials say standard test
scores have been misused for years. Most notably, real estate
agents have used color-coded maps of school districts' scores to
tempt buyers, something clearly not intended by the tests'
designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really would prefer that real estate agents would not do
that,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the fast-food mentality. We want a number; we've got to
have a number. This school's a 62; this one's a 67, it must be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials encourage parents to read the school report cards,
also published yearly by the state, to help them decide on the
right school for their child.
</P>
<P>
   With this year's arrival of AIMS, some parents may question the
continued need for the Stanford 9. But educators say the purposes
of the two tests are decidedly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to know that the AIMS is criterion-referenced,
and that the Stanford 9 is norm-referenced,'' Landy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm-referenced is when you compare your child to other
children across the nation. Criterion-referenced is when you
compare your child to standards the state has chosen for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Once parents have their child's Stanford 9 scores in hand, they
can compare them within their school district, and with districts
throughout the state. For help in choosing a school, parents can
visit the Department of Education's Web site at www.ade.state.az.us
and click on AZ School Report Cards.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the school chosen, if a child is struggling, the
next step is to find out what help is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the child is not learning, it's the school's responsibility
to remediate,'' Landy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of work for them, but in hindsight, it's
improvement,'' she says. ``And isn't that what they're after?'' &QL;

PATH TO YELLOW QUITE A RIDE FOR ARMSTRONG 
</HEADLINE>
 DE FRANCE-ARMSTRONG-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBI, France _ Chris Carmichael was sitting at home in Colorado
Springs, Colo., last Sunday morning, when he got a phone call from
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   It was his friend and protege Lance Armstrong, who had just won
the individual time trial in the Tour de France to take over the
lead. He told Carmichael, ``I'm the yellow, more to go,'' and hung
up.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Carmichael turned on the TV to see for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him on the podium in that yellow jersey, I cried,''
he said. ``Just seeing how hard he's worked, it's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   And almost unbelievable, even to Carmichael, the former coach of
the US national team who has worked with Armstrong since the latter
was 18 years old and new to racing.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Armstrong won the world championships, the US
professional championship in Philadelphia, and a stage in the Tour
de France. In the next three years, his victories included another
Tour de France stage, the Tour DuPont, the KMart Classic, the
Thrift Drug Classic, and a stage in the Paris-Nice race.
</P>
<P>
   Now he holds more than a 7-minute lead in the Tour de France and
is in good position to become the second American to win the race.
Everyone from Rosie O'Donnell to Larry King to Jay Leno is courting
him, and he stands to make more than $2 million, plus $1 million in
bonuses from the US Postal Service team next year, not to mention
endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   But in between the highs was a year and a half of lows as
Armstrong battled cancer, considered giving up racing, and faced
rejection from a half-dozen European teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was humiliating,'' said his agent, Bill Stapleton.
</P>
<P>
   When Armstrong was growing up in Austin, Texas, his sport of
choice was the triathlon. After high school, he decided to turn to
racing full time, which is when Carmichael spotted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely saw something,'' said Carmichael. ``It was kind
of like an iceberg; you saw this kind of peak, but knew there was
much below the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael, 38, also wasn't surprised when Armstrong was called
the next Greg LeMond _ the only American to win the Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I raced on the junior team with LeMond, he was just kind
of above everyone else, like Lance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael said he had to rein in Armstrong's aggressiveness on
the race course.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so aggressive that he'd either tear the field apart and
win, or pull everyone after him, so they'd blow by him at the end .
. . he'd get so mad,'' Carmichael said.
</P>
<P>
   But the trait that could be a bane could also be a boon.
</P>
<P>
   ``His nature is one that he's so driven to success,'' Carmichael
said. ``He can't just sit back and let things go.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Armstrong would easily follow in LeMond's
footsteps when he joined the Motorola team in 1993. Later that
fall, at age 22, Armstrong finished first in the world championship
road race, defeating a field of European racers.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the iceberg Carmichael talked about was beginning to
show.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's success continued for the next three years with
victories in both America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fall of '96, Armstrong's life started spiraling. In
October, he developed flu-like symptoms and was vomiting blood. He
was diagnosed with testicular cancer. The news came as a shock,
considering Armstrong had won the Tour DuPont and a Belgian race
earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors then learned that the cancer had spread to his abdomen
and brain, and Armstrong spent the next months having brain surgery
and chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him over the winter, he was frail and bald,'' said
Postal Service director of operations Dan Osipow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was near death,'' Carmichael said.
</P>
<P>
   But like LeMond, who came back after being shot in a hunting
accident to win the Tour de France, Armstrong was determined to get
back on his bike. After sitting out the 1997 season, he tried
riding again. But it was frustrating, said Carmichael, and after 10
or 12 miles, the rider had to pull over.
</P>
<P>
   And although Armstrong had every intention of returning to
racing for the '98 season, professional racing teams didn't feel
the same.
</P>
<P>
   The French Cofidis team he had signed with in 1996 paid only
half of his salary for one year and cut him loose, saying he didn't
pass the medical tests. Stapleton mailed Armstrong's impressive
resume to a half-dozen European teams, all of which were
uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the US Postal Service team agreed to sign him, and
Armstrong rode in some spring races in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he started to slide again.
</P>
<P>
   On a wet and windy day at a stage race in France, a frustrated
Armstrong got off his bike, flew home, and said he ``didn't unpack
my bike for four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Carmichael he was done with racing.
</P>
<P>
   But the former coach and current trainer and confidante wasn't
convinced. He talked Armstrong into coming to a ``training camp''
in Boone, N.C., where, along with racer Bob Roll, they stayed in a
cabin and rode bikes all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd cook, and they'd do the dishes and ride for five, seven
hours a day,'' said Carmichael. ``There were the same kind of roads
he had ridden in the Tour, and I thought it'd be good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong went on to finish second to teammate George Hincapie
in the US Pro race, won the Tour of Luxembourg, and finished the
season with fourth-place finishes in both the road race and time
trial world championships.
</P>
<P>
   He was ready to come back to France.
</P>
<P>
   And his team was ready, too, as it geared up to make Armstrong
the team leader in the Tour, which started two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He won the opening day prologue to wear the leader's yellow
jersey _ a stark contrast to the hospital gown he was wearing two
years ago. He gave up the jersey the first week, but got it back at
the time trial last Sunday when he called Carmichael.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong now holds a sizable lead over Abraham Olano.
Armstrong's wife, Kristin, will come over to see the race at the
end of week, and Olympic film guru Bud Greenspan is planning to
make a movie of Armstrong's life.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any downside it's that some of the French media have
revived the drug controversy of last year, and have speculated that
Armstrong's performance might be drug enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous and so irresponsible,'' said Stapleton. ``This
guy has worked for this . . . I don't think it has any legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong thus far has let his own legs do the talking.

SAMPRAS'S FEAT IN FIFTH SET WAS STUFF OF CHAMPS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The fifth set wasn't doubles. That was 1
7/8ths.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth set was all about an all-time champion doing what
all-time champions do. Pete Sampras simply took over. He was Orr
going end-to-end; Bird telling people to give me the ball and get
out of my way; and Pedro telling the fielders to sit down while he
strikes out the side.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth set was Sampras delivering aces, sending rockets back
at Australians and leaping around in Baryshnikovian fashion. The
fifth set was Sampras even lending some audio to the gorgeous
video.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth set was Sampras serving searing winners in the first
game, delivering three aces in the fifth game, and serving for the
match in such a frenzied state he hardly recognized himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serving for the match I was jumping out of my skin,'' Sampras
said.
</P>
<P>
   He never before had been to Boston. He may never have reason to
play here again. We have witnessed every team superstar who's ever
lived, but we never before had had an up-close-and-personal glimpse
of the consensus Best Tennis Player On The Planet.
</P>
<P>
   So for those of you not privileged to be among the 5,000-plus at
the Longwood Cricket Club Saturday afternoon, let me summarize what
we saw:
</P>
<P>
   Oh.
</P>
<P>
   My.
</P>
<P>
   God.
</P>
<P>
   This was why Sampras wanted in. He had caught Davis Cup fever
watching Todd Martin and Jim Courier whip the Brits, and he
couldn't stay away any longer. ``The crowd was tremendous,'' he
gushed. ``The crowd was behind us 100 percent. It was a great
atmosphere, and that is what this is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The only question remaining is a big one. In the wake of the
Sampras and Alex O'Brien series-saving 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3
triumph over Australia's Mark Woodforde and Sandon Stolle, will
there now be an encore? Will Sampras be unshackled? Will the
world's 774th-ranked doubles player get a chance to perform in his
specialty? Will United States captain Tom Gullikson find a way to
replace Martin with Sampras in Sunday's singles match against
Patrick Rafter?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a possibility,'' said Gullikson. ``Some of our players
aren't 100 percent fit. That's all I'll say right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras neatly sidestepped the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be here,'' he deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   If it comes to pass that the Americans pull off this caper, the
Aussies will be angry, but, frankly, unsurprised. Team captain John
Newcombe couldn't believe it when he heard Sampras wasn't going to
play singles in the first place. He, more than anyone else, can get
inside the head of Gullikson. After watching what Sampras did in
the fifth set Saturday, nobody on earth had more reason to request
an encore than an American captain whose team trails, 2-1, in a
best-of-five deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Sampras body language was very bad at the end of the fourth
set. He and O'Brien had dropped the third and fourth sets after
winning the first two. Sampras was hanging his head with every
mis-hit. After a promising start, the Americans were having a great
deal of difficulty with the Australians. You had to wonder if
Sampras wished he never had injected himself into these
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   But he was serving the first game in the fateful fifth set. One
thing Sampras never will lose faith in is his serve. He lost the
first point, but the next one was a very big one, because the next
one was charged with meaning. Sampras won that point with a leaping
and growling overhead smash of a volley that shocked both the
Australians and the crowd. Sampras does a lot of things on the
tennis court, but one thing he does not normally do is emote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on the moment,'' he said, ``and that was the moment
where at that point we were a little bit down on ourselves and just
to have the other guys know that I am going to jump through the
roof and put out a little yell out there and let them know we are
not going to die. At that point it might not have been a huge part
of the match, but I think it might have sent them a message that we
are still _ we are going to fight and we fought 'til the end.''
</P>
<P>
   If that message was intended for the Aussies, they claim not to
have gotten it. ``He didn't do anything great,'' shrugged the
red-headed Woodforde, one of the most accomplished doubles players
alive. Perhaps Mr. Woodforde is just a hard marker. A more likely
explanation is that both he and his partner are in denial. Sampras
took over the fifth set, is what he did, and it all began with that
soaring (and screeching) overhead smash that, if nothing else, got
the Longwood crowd into the match.
</P>
<P>
   What transpired was athletic greatness. Both O'Brien and the
Aussies had little choice but to raise their own games in the hopes
of keeping up with the excited Sampras. ``I think we had some
tennis in the last half hour that was as good as you are going to
see,'' observed Newcombe, who has seen a fair share of tennis in
his day.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual artistic highlight was the 16-point eighth game, a
tense affair that was punctuated by both some painful play (three
Woodforde double-faults) and some spellbinding
bang-bang-bang-bang-BANG! face-to-face confrontations that only
doubles can provide. The Americans managed to break service, the
final point being an O'Brien tribute (a great, unreturnable lob),
but Sampras had also had his say, getting his side back to deuce
for the third time with a great shot that split the Aussies, who
had been priding themselves on only being beaten along the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies broken, Sampras served for the match with the
enchanted crowd roaring ``Pete! Pete! Pete!'' At 30-15 he got
perhaps too excited, barging into O'Brien as the latter was going
to deliver a winner at the net. ``I basically almost knocked his
head off,'' Sampras admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He forgot he was playing doubles,'' O'Brien said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he had been playing modified singles in his own mind
for the entire set, and that lost point was the final moment of
trepidation for the Americans. Sampras took care of the next point
with a big serve and smash of a feeble return and he nailed down
the match with _ what else? _ an ace.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't play Sunday, well, then, what we saw was Hogan at
Carnoustie. He might never play here again, but that would be OK.
We in Boston always will have the fifth set.

A MATTER OF TIMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Saturday's Major League Soccer all-star match used
international timing (which counts up to 45 minutes) instead of the
traditional MLS version which counts down.
</P>
<P>
   In the MLS, when the clock expires the half has ended. But
Saturday, MLS officials added injury time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt like changing it, said MLS commissioner Doug
Logan. ``We're toying with the idea of doing it next season.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Logan also expressed disappointment with Saturday's
crowd of xx,xxx, which also featured a doubleheader involving
Mexico's Guadalajara Chivas and Chile's Universidad Catolica.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have preferred more people in the stands but bringing
the game here was a success, said Logan. ``It has no material
impact whether we'll bring a team here in the future.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) New England midfielder John Harkes, left off the 1998
U.S. World Cup squad by former U.S. coach Steve Sampson for
disciplinary reasons, was recalled Friday by new U.S. coach Bruce
Arena for next week's FIFA Confederations Cup, July 24-Aug 4 in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes, who spent three seasons under arena at D.C. United
before being dealt to New England, will join the U.S. team for the
first time in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes, a starter for the East squad in Saturday's MLS all-star
game in San Diego, felt his absence in France affected the U.S.
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's redemption, unfortunately the events that
unfolded in 1998 not only affected me directly, but the team as a
whole, said Harkes. ``I think the team themselves have really
climbed back to the top with Bruce coaching. We've produced a lot
of good results lately to help put '98 behind us. It's a year ago
now, unfortunately those things happen and I'm doing the best I can
to be a professional player.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes replaced David Regis, who in the last 36 hours has
developed swelling in his left knee and will not be available for
the matches in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called John in because he's in good form right now, said
Arena. ``He's an experienced player and will give us some cover in
the midfield.
</P>
<P>
   (Bullet) Carlos Valderrama, Preki and Alexi Lalas each made
their fourth consecutive start Saturday while Galaxy midfielder
Mauricio Cienfuegos saw his three-game starting streak ended as a
West reserve.

VAN DE VELDE RUNS AWAY FROM BRITISH OPEN FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ On Friday, when the world discovered him,
Jean Van de Velde had insisted he would treat this like any other
golf tournament. But he has failed to fulfill that vow.
</P>
<P>
   He's still leading this one.
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly the norm for this 33-year-old French journeyman,
who in 10 years on the European Tour has accumulated exactly one
victory, in the 1993 Roma Masters. Now he's on the threshold of
adding a slightly more prestigious bookend: The claret jug that
symbolizes preeminence in the game's most venerable tournament, the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   While most of those expected to overtake him fell on their
faces, Van de Velde stood the 128th edition on its head Saturday
when he expanded his one-stroke second-round lead to an improbable
five. His 1-under-par 70 _ with a 45-foot birdie putt on the 18th
serving as the exclamation point and drawing a rousing ovation from
a gallery that didn't know his name two days ago _ left him at
even-par 213.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing him are Justin Leonard (71), who faced a similar
last-round deficit two years ago at Troon and won by three strokes,
and Australian Craig Parry, who gained the most ground Saturday
with the best round of the week at 7,361-yard Carnoustie Golf Club,
a 67.
</P>
<P>
   But the anticipated challenge from golf's two most glamorous
names never materialized. Paired for the first time ever in a
tournament, Tiger Woods and Greg Norman matched each other
virtually stroke for stroke. Unfortunately for them, Woods needed
74, Norman 75.
</P>
<P>
   That left Woods in a tie for third at 7 over with local favorite
Andrew Coltart (71) and South African David Frost (71), who has
played 2-under-par golf since opening with an 80.
</P>
<P>
   Norman is another stroke back, along with Argentine Angel
Cabrera, who trailed Van de Velde by a shot Friday but reverted to
form Saturday with a 77. Another would-be pursuer, Jesper Parnevik,
began the day in third place, two strokes behind, and plunged out
of contention with a 78_223.
</P>
<P>
   With the train wrecks piling up behind him, all Van de Velde had
to do was hold steady. That's what nobody expected.
</P>
<P>
   But he personified consistency in the pressure cooker, carding
four birdies to more than offset three bogeys, though he spent more
time in bunkers than the cast of ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed ready to unravel when he wrapped bogeys on the second
and fourth holes around a birdie at the third. But he didn't waver
from there, making several valiant saves from traps and relying on
a torrid putter. In fact, the climactic birdie at 18 wasn't even
his personal highlight. That would be the 70-footer he rammed in at
14.
</P>
<P>
   He well knows he could return to nonentity status by Sunday
night, but he's taking the philosophical approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to go out there, do my best to enjoy it,'' he
said. ``I know there's a lot better players than me who had an even
more commanding lead and who have lost. Whatever happens, I'm going
to go out there, try to focus on my game, try to give a hard time
to the course if it doesn't give me too hard a time itself. Then
we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   His pursuers with far better pedigrees could barely keep him in
their sights Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard made the turn in 2 under, but bogeys at the 10th, 12th,
and 16th, sandwiched around a birdie at 14, stalled his progress.
Still, he's been in this position before and knows how to close the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a chance to win the tournament going into Sunday was
my primary goal at the beginning of the week,'' he said. ``Now I've
accomplished that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry accomplished much more to vault into contention. The
33-year-old veteran knows how Van de Velde feels _ Parry led the
1992 Masters entering the final round but imploded with a 78 and
finished tied for 13th as Fred Couples donned the green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Masters was a long time ago,'' he said. ``When I led the
Masters, maybe I was a little bit young, not really knowing what
was going to happen on the final day _ expectations and all that.
Hopefully, I can go out there and play my own game and not worry
too much about what's going to happen out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Parry, who's built like a fire hydrant and is equally solid _
hence his nickname, Popeye _ said what happened Saturday ``has to
rank right up there with the best rounds that I've ever played. I'm
actually only 5 foot 6, but I felt about 6 foot out there the way I
was playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods played considerably below expectations, failing to make a
birdie and suffering a disastrous double-bogey 6 at the 17th. Had
it not been for his short game and a trusty putter, the damage
would have been far worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really give myself a whole lot of chances to make up
shots,'' he said. And he doesn't give himself a great chance
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be awfully difficult to catch him,'' said
Woods. ``Myself and a few other players who are right there in the
hunt, we basically need to do what Craig Parry did today _ post the
number early.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Norman is banking on after a topsy-turvy round
undone by seven bogeys. ``Anybody 8, 7, or 6 over has a definite
shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what they were saying after the second round, too.
And Jean Van de Velde shut them all up for at least one more day.

RED SOX SUBMIT FORGETTABLE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-PHILLIES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Darren Lewis said it best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ugly. Delete it and forget about it,'' said the Red Sox
right fielder following Saturday's 11-3 loss to the Philadelphia
Phillies before 32,228 at sweltering Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   That delete button has been pressed too often lately. The Red
Sox have lost seven of their last 11 games. They are 4-11 against
the National League, have fallen four games behind the Yankees in
the AL East, and now lead the Blue Jays for the wild card by just
two games.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox managed just six hits off starter Randy Wolf, who
improved to 5-0 with 7 1/3 innings, and were pummeled for a
season-high 18 hits as starter Mark Portugal, who was in mum mode
after the game, was shelled for nine hits and five runs in 2 2/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams again had to go deep into his bullpen, calling on
Pat Rapp, who actually pitched well (no runs in 2 1/3 innings),
John Wasdin, who was clubbed for seven hits and six runs in 1 2/3
innings, and Jin Ho Cho, who provided 2 1/3 innings but was moved
from his scheduled start Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will now likely go with Japanese pitcher Tomokazu
Ohka, a righthander who is 3-0 at Pawtucket after being 8-0 at
Trenton, in Cho's place. Williams refused to pull the trigger on an
official Ohka announcement, but he did rule out anyone on the
current pitching staff getting the nod.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez's start Sunday against the Florida Marlins can't
come soon enough as the Red Sox are in desperate need of pitching _
and hitting _ help to revive what has become a sagging team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They swung at it, they hit it,'' was the way Williams summed
up Portugal's performance. ``They got a lot of hits but we'll move
on and he'll be right back out there five days from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Creighton Gubanich suffered the effects of the 98-degree
game-time temperatures when he cramped up while batting in the
eighth inning and had to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pitching, the defense was also subpar as
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who provided the only Boston power
with his 15th homer, a two-run shot in the first inning, couldn't
stretch enough to gather a ground ball off Kevin Jordan's bat in
the first, then pulled first baseman Mike Stanley off the bag with
a high throw in the seventh just before Ron Gant belted a Wasdin
pitch for a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief sign that the offense might come alive in the
sixth as the Sox scored a run. Troy O'Leary singled but was erased
at second on a nice play behind the bag by Alex Arias on Damon
Buford's ground ball. Arias made the throw to second baseman
Jordan, who threw the relay into the Boston dugout, enabling Buford
to reach second. After Lou Merloni reached on an infield hit,
Gubanich's grounder to second scored the third Boston run.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a nifty running catch by Lewis in foul territory in
the fourth on Gant's slicing liner, there was nothing sharp about
the Red Sox defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf did well in keeping the Boston hitters off balance,
according to Lewis, who was at a loss to explain the team's
troubles in interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Williams issued a ``get back to me later'' to the question,
probably feeling he won't have to answer it with Martinez on the
mound Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four and eleven isn't a very good record,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal could do nothing right from the outset. Tattoo parlors
may be illegal in Massachusetts, but the Phillies took Portugal to
one with a five-run, nine-hit pasting. Ironically, Portugal was
lifted after Arias's bloop single to left, scoring Mike Lieberthal.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville greeted Portugal with a wall double in the first.
He scored after the next batter, Gant, singled to right. After an
out, third baseman Scott Rolen singled off the wall and eventually
scored on Jordan's single underneath Garciaparra's glove. Prior to
Jordan's ``hit'' Lieberthal (4 for 5) singled to center driving
home the second Phillies' run.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra made up for his de facto fielding error with a
vintage Fenway homer, a high fly ball that barely made it over the
Monster with John Valentin aboard. Portugal got through the second
inning, allowing only a Glanville single, but the third seemed a
repeat of the first as three hits and two runs later, Portugal was
gone in favor of Rapp.
</P>
<P>
   Like the All-Star game last Tuesday, this one was over early.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the Red Sox can't push the delete button in the
loss column.

THE GAME GOES ON

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  SAN DIEGO  &UR; _ &LR;  For a brief moment, Major League Soccer
commissioner Doug Logan thought of cancelling Saturday's fourth MLS
All-Star game at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium Saturday because of
the disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr. (please fill in latest and
updated info.)
</P>
<P>
   The West captured its first victory over the East, 6-4, after
two previous tries, which was played before a disappointing crowd
of xx,xxx and televised on ESPN2 after ABC cancelled its live
broadcast to follow the Kennedy story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Kennedy comes up and (Pete) Rozelle and playing the
football game and not playing the football game comes to mind, said
Logan. ``It's significantly less important but I have to tell you
the thought crossed my mind at 6:15 (Saturday) morning. It was for
only about 10 seconds, but this (all-star game) is about fun and
entertaining the fans and it's very hard to throw a party under
these circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Losing the game on ABC surely hurt the ratings of the MLS
All-Star game and one of the few chances MLS is viewed on
cable-free television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll survive this, said Logan. ``It's a stumble along the
way, but All-Star games are parties and these are rather somber
circumstances upon which to throw a party.
</P>
<P>
   Those who witnessed Saturday's match were not disappointed. The
East rallied from three goals down to tie the match, 4-4, after
Columubus striker Stern John picked up a loose ball and beat West
goalkeeper Matt Jordan in the 83rd minute.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Ronald Cerritos helped put the West back in front,
feeding Mauricio Wright in front of the goal for an easy finisher
to give the West a 5-4 lead in the 84th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Cerritos finished off the East minutes later, scoring on a pass
from the Galaxy's Mauricio Cienfueogs in the 89th minute to
preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United's Roy Lassister scored in the first 30 seconds to
give the East a 1-0 lead, but former San Diego Sockers indoor
legend, Preki, notched two goals and set up another to give the
West a 4-1 lead at the half to earn MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game we said this All-Star game belonged to the
players, said Colorado Rapids and East coach Glenn Myernick. ``When
we wen't down 1-0 thirty seconds into the match, I said `nah, the
game belonges to the coaches.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Seriously, it was a fun match. The fans were treated to a lot
of goals and it was nice for the West to get a win.
</P>
<P>
   Preki, who has struggled along with his Kansas City team this
season, wasn't too enthusiastic about earning MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean much, it means we won today, said Preki. ``It
was great for all the player because we all had a lot of fun. And
sure it's nice to get a couple goals, but we've (at Kansas City)
had a tough year.
</P>
<P>
   Preki tied the match in the 13th minute following a pass from
Chicago's Roman Kosecki inside the penalty area. East goalkeeper
Tom Presthus came out to challenge but Preki's delicate chip to the
far netting gave him his third career MLS all-star goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kosecki scored to give the West a 2-1 lead, then Preki, drawing
a crowd in the middle of the field, dropped a pass to the right
side for the Galaxy's Cobi Jones, who beat Presthus to the left in
the 36th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Preki received a give-and-go back from
Kosecki, nailing a volley with his left foot from the penalty spot
to give him a record four MLS career goals to go allong with three
career MLS assists for a record 11 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Long has the world of tennis envied golf and
its Ryder Cup, jealously watching as golf fever sweeps Europe and
the United States every two years. ``If only, if only, if only,''
worried tennis minds say, ``if only tennis could cause much the
same fever.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, in that gorgeous little island of tennis that
is the Longwood Cricket Club amid the commerce of Route 9, tennis
could have a day as feverish as any Ryder Cup day. Tennis fever
could be ignited once again if tennis is ready, that is, to make
the most of this day.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities are immense.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Davis Cup team appears ready to insert a
no-longer reluctant Pete Sampras into its singles lineup, replacing
an apparently no-longer healthy Todd Martin against Australia
Sunday. The Australian team, namely captain John Newcombe, is ready
to battle any such American attempt with claims of chicanery and
skullduggery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have to be a very brave doctor to submit a request
that Martin isn't fit to play,'' said Newcombe. ``I saw Martin play
the match the other day, and I didn't see him injured in that
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have the US and Australia battled over anything, the most
recent ``serious'' flare-ups being over US tariffs on Australian
lamb and Aussie unhappiness over a US spy outpost at Pine Gap near
Alice Springs in the barren center of Australia. Sunday afternoon,
though, even diplomatic relations might be tested if the Americans
get Sampras onto the court at Longwood.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, if the US succeeds, Sampras will be meeting
Australia's Patrick Rafter, generating a rather interesting matchup
between Sampras, the world's best player, and Rafter, the world's
second-best, with the hopes of two countries riding on the outcome.
This could make the best (worst) McEnroe-Connors moments of
tennis's golden era seem like idle child's play.
</P>
<P>
   All this developed after a scintillating doubles match Saturday
which the US won, 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, as Sampras made his
first appearance with the 1999 US Davis Cup team one to remember.
The loss was the first in five years in Davis Cup play for an
Australian doubles team.
</P>
<P>
   The win kept the US hopes alive, but the Americans need to win
both singles matches Sunday to advance to the Cup semifinals. In
the one matchup that is settled, the final one, the US team's Jim
Courier wil meet Lleyton Hewitt; in the first match of the day,
Rafter is certain to be on the court for Australia, but the
identity of the American is . . . uh, being mulled over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had some tennis there that was as good as you're
ever going to see,'' said Newcombe, in an understatement. ``What is
this . . . about the Davis Cup not being exciting or anything? I
mean, the crowd's going absolutely nuts out there, and four guys
are out there just killing one another to win. This is what sports
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The US victory was charged, supercharged, and turbocharged by
Sampras on the second point of the final set, when Sampras leaped
high into the air to deliver a vicious overhand smash while
emitting a primal scream.
</P>
<P>
   The jump, the overhand smash, and the scream awoke Sampras, his
team, and even Tom Gullikson, the US captain, who dramatically
reversed course and sent out strong signals that Sampras will play
singles Sunday. Until now, Gullikson had allowed Sampras to call
his own shot and reserve himself only for doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, we were a little down on ourselves,'' said
Sampras of his smash-and-scream. ``I just wanted to let the other
guys know that I'm going to jump through the roof and put a little
yell out there, and let (the Aussies) know we're not going to die.
It might have sent them a message that we're still in the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   And fight is the right word. The Sampras scream and yell _ and
an absolutely memorable eighth game, when Sampras and partner Alex
O'Brien broke the serve of Australian Mark Woodforde and partner
Sandon Stolle _ allowed the US team to live another day. And fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to need a doctor's report,'' said Newcombe of
the brewing battle to replace Martin with Sampras. This is the
final year of Davis Cup rules in which the captain must choose
before the first match who his singles competitors will be for the
four singles matches; next year, captains will be able to do what
coaches do in other sports: choose whom to play up to the last
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cup rules state the referee ``may sanction the
substitution of any player who, in his opinion, is incapacitated by
illness, injury or other unavoidable hindrance . . . '' That
injury, illness or other unavoidable hindrance must be certified by
a neutral doctor _ in other words, a doctor not affiiated with the
US or Australian team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens from time to time,'' said Stefan Fransson of
Sweden, the umpire who may be called upon to make the final
decision on Martin this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson, the US captain, was certain to be hammered no matter
what was the final decision on Sampras. If the best player in the
world sat on the bench while Martin, who wilted in losing to Hewitt
on Friday, lost the deciding Cup match to Rafter, Gullikson would
be crucified by Americans. If Gullikson tries to replace Martin
with Sampras, as it appears he is doing, the Australians are sure
to berate him for treachery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' said Sampras, who was caught up in the
patriotic fervor of the overwhelmingly American crowd cheering on
him and O'Brien in that wondrous fifth set, ``is that we are down,
2-1, and we have a couple of matches. We will see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd has not really been healthy this year,'' said Gullikson,
digging the first spades of groundwork for the apparent American
move. Later, the captain mentioned other problems such as
dehydration and tennis elbow; Martin, meanwhile, was practicing as
his health was beginning to be called into question.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens Sunday _ as feverish as it could get _ can't
diminish by much the beauty of Saturday's doubles match. The
Americans easily took the first two sets, the key coming on
O'Brien's first game of serve, when he withstood four break points
from the Aussies and held. The Aussies then dominated the Americans
in the third and fourth sets as Sampras, in particular, seemed to
wilt in the heat, which reached 131 degrees on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sampras's fuel gauge seemed to be on empty as the
decisive fifth set began. But as he has done in the past, Sampras
called on an extra reserve and suddenly was leaping and smashing
and screaming. And even sweeter for Sampras was that the break of
the Aussies came on the serve of Woodforde, who had pointedly said
Thursday he didn't see how ``Sampras can believe he can just step
out on the court and play doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras replied, first with racket, then with tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fifth set . . . it's a lot of nerves out there, no
question,'' said the American of the Australian. ``I don't care how
many times Mark has been in that position _ he has won many Grand
Slams in doubles _ but when you are playing in the fifth set,
you're going to feel it. I am a little surprised (at three
double-faults by Woodforde in that eighth game), but there's a lot
of tension out there. And it showed.''
</P>
<P>
   To be continued . . . Sunday at Longwood. Tennis fever.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Sampras broke the strings on four rackets and was
``jumping out of my skin.'' Sunday could be more.

HARVARD TAPS MAZZOLENI 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The new Harvard hockey coach is Mark Mazzoleni of Miami
of Ohio, The Boston Globe learned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni's Wisconsin-Stevens Point teams won three Division 3
titles, he was affiliated with a successful University of Minnesota
program, and did well at Miami of Ohio the past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong point in his favor was that he's an educator
first and a coach second. Miami of Ohio had the highest academic
standards of any college in the state of Ohio system.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made Friday night by Harvard athletic director
Bill Cleary. Mazzoleni was on a three-day recruiting trip and
Cleary was on Cape Cod when they agreed in a phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni has an 11-year head coaching record of 223-135-30.
He's a native of Green Bay, Wis., and played junior hockey for St.
Paul of the USHL as a goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to Michigan State, where he won the team's
Outstanding Rookie Award in 1977. As a senior he received the Blue
Line President's Award as the team's top scholar-athlete. He
graduated in 1980 as a criminal justice/psychology major. He earned
his masters in physical education and athletic administration at
the University of Illinois-Chicago in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni caught the college hockey world's eye during the
1996-1997 season. His Red Hawks made a remarkable turnaround from
10-22-4 to 27-12-1 and a second-place finish in the Central
Collegiate Hockey Association. He was named Coach of the Year and
was a finalist for national honors. His five-year record at Miami
of Ohio was 85-83-20.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College coach Jerry York, who coached in the CCHA for
years, said, ``I knew Mark when he was an assistant at Minnesota
and I also met him at our hockey conventions. He's a hard-working
guy and very knowledgeable about hockey. He's basically a good guy
and he did an excellent job at Miami. Having coached at Bowling
Green for so long, I always kept track of the CCHA. He's a fine
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   During Mazzoleni's three years at Minnesota he served under
coach Doug Woog. Mazzoleni coordinated recruiting and coached the
special teams, which were among the best in the WCHA. Among his
recruits were 1996 Hobey Baker Award winner Brian Bonin and
All-American defenseman Mike Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Before Minnesota, Mazzoleni was coach at Wisconsin-Stevens Point
from 1985-91. His teams went 138-52-8 and he won national Division
3 titles his final three years. He was named Northern Collegiate
Hockey Association Coach of the Year from 1988-90.
</P>
<P>
   His first coaching assignment after graduation was at the
University of Illinois-Chicago, where he earned his masters degree.
He was there five years as an assistant coach and recruiting
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni and his wife, Karen, have four children.
</P>
<P>
   He has all the attributes Cleary said he was seeking: He's
intense, a great recruiter, comes from a winning background, is an
educator, and has the ability to get his message over to his
players.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzoleni was on Cleary's short list, along with Middlebury's
Bill Beaney, St. Lawrence's Joe Marsh, and Yale's Tim Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard has had only four hockey coaches in 50 years: Cooney
Weiland, Cleary, Ronn Tomassoni, and Mazzoleni.

DUNCAN DUNKED ON IN EASY WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett could well be the NBA
poster boys of the next century. After Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, they also
will likely be seen in every Argentinian basketball promo for the
next umpteen years.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: They were dunked on rather forcefully, dramatically,
and unexpectedly by a 6-foot-7-inch forward named Andres Nocioni.
If he's smart, he already has his people lining up deals in Buenos
Aires. We can see it now: ``El Donqueador! Aero Andres!''
</P>
<P>
   When you win by 31, as the United States did Saturday &UR;  &LR; night,
103-72, sometimes a single play overshadows everything else. So it
was with the dunk by Nocioni. With his team down by the revealing
score of 72-34 in the second half, he drove baseline around
Garnett, came up around the basket and dunked on the waiting Duncan
and the trailing Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, generously estimated at 5,000, went wild. The
Argentinian bench erupted. The Argentinian coach, who did not play
Nocioni in the first half, raised his arms in triumph. Nocioni was
mobbed by teammates when time was called eight seconds later. US
coach Larry Brown turned to his assistants, Purdue's Gene Keady and
Kentucky's Tubby Smith, and wondered why they hadn't recruited the
kid.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The US trailed for the first time in the tournament, falling
behind for all of 12 seconds, 5-4. But the Yanks got rolling soon
thereafter and blew the lead to 20 at the 13:38 mark and an even 30
(57-27) at the break. Garnett led a balanced attack with 21 points,
while Tim Hardaway added 20 and Duncan 14. The US finishes
first-round play Sunday against winless Cuba.

RECOMMENDATIONS MIGHT GET OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ Down here, the rules are different in international
basketball. The lane is a trapezoid, the game is divided into
20-minute halves, and the 30-second clock expires if there is
merely a shot attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But out in California, and later this month in Boston, the NBA's
recent rule ``recommendations'' to clean up the game and,
supposedly, increase scoring will be implemented in a summer pro
league. Initially, it could make for some painful viewing as
players adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics general manager Chris Wallace reports from Long Beach
that the first quarter of the Celtics-Portland game a week ago took
50 minutes to play. ``It was a major shock,'' he said of all the
whistles. ``We've seen some 70- and 80-foul games and they're
calling any kind of contact. These guys are starting to adjust, but
you'll see the same thing in the exhibition season with the regular
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Players don't foul out, which is a good thing for Vitaly
Potapenko. He picked up 22 fouls in 87 minutes, including seven in
18 minutes against Seattle. To cut down on free throws, a team
doesn't get into the bonus until the 10th team foul.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran NBA referee Dick Bavetta said the recommendations and
experiments are designed mainly for one reason: ``The overall
theme,'' he said, ``is to draw a more literal line between
aggressive play and rough play. We don't want to penalize
aggressive play. We will penalize rough play.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few areas where we'll hear whistles where none have
blown before.
</P>
<P>
   --There will be no contact allowed on the player bringing up the
ball until that player has reached the foul line at the offensive
end. You used to be able to put a forearm on him. Now, you have to
wait until he's at the foul line (or where the foul line would
extend if he's on either side).
</P>
<P>
   --The so-called ``Mark Jackson Rule'' will be implemented.
Basically, a player can't post-up with impunity and take his time
dribbling, waiting for a double-team, a shot opportunity, or an ice
tea. All you get is five seconds and then there will be a
violation.
</P>
<P>
   --The shot clock won't be reset to 24 seconds automatically. If
there is a nonshooting foul and the clock is below 14 seconds, it
will be reset to 14 seconds, not 24. That could lead to some
interesting strategies from teams that have a foul to waste late in
a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   --There will be no contact on players cutting to the basket,
looking for passes. We know what happened to those unfortunate lads
in the past. They'd run into elbows, shoulders, forearms, or errant
hands. The referees used to call that ``rerouting.'' Now, it's a
foul.
</P>
<P>
   --Once a player gets post position, the defender will not be
allowed to move him out. (Shaq will approve of this one.) Before,
the defender used his forearm, knee, or superior strength to move
his man off the block. However, the offensive player will not be
able to simply come in and blow the defender off the block, either.
</P>
<P>
   --On screens, the man who sets the screen must give the
defensive player a chance to change direction and get around it.
</P>
<P>
   --There also is a revision of the illegal defense guidelines,
but since no one understands the existing guidelines, why bother?
This area is a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Bavetta will be in Boston along with 23 other referees working
on indoctrinating the players to the changes. (We'd like to use the
term ``strict constructionist'' here, but Richard Nixon followers
might disapprove.) The summer pro league games will be shorter
(10-minute quarters, no mandatory timeouts, 60-second regular
timeouts). The recommendations also will be implemented in summer
leagues in Salt Lake City and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fouls notwithstanding, the Celtics' entry in the FILA California
Summer Pro League got off to a rousing start, winning its first
four games. The undisputed star of the show: Paul Pierce. In a
110-96 win over Seattle Wednesday, Pierce poured in 46 points. Now,
he wasn't playing against the real Sonics of course; they're
scattered hither and yon (two are down here in Puerto Rico). But 46
is still 46. ``It was a sight to behold,'' said Wallace. ``It
wasn't a selfish 46. It was inside, outside, within the flow. It
was awesome.'' Pierce was 14 of 20 from the field and 12 of 15 from
the free throw line in 40 minutes. In those first four games,
Pierce averaged 27 points a game while shooting 54 percent. Alas,
his finale was Friday night against the Lakers; he agreed to go to
Miami for a charity game. The other two ``contract'' Celtics on the
team for the first four games were Potapenko and Tony Battie.
(Three free agents on last year's team also played: Bruce Bowen,
Marlon Garnett, and Eric Riley). Potapenko was struggling; he shot
29 percent. Battie, on the other hand, put up some nice numbers. He
had 23 points in the opener against Portland and averaged 16 a game
in the first four. Second-round pick Kris Clack averaged 11 minutes
a game in the first three games and then played 26 against Seattle.
In that game, he had 12 points (including two treys) and four
assists. ``He's been fair,'' said Wallace. Finally, Wayne Turner
averaged 7.8 points and 5.3 assists in 24.3 minutes a game over the
first four, shooting 48 percent. ``Wayne has looked good,'' Wallace
said . . . While on the subject of second-rounders, Pat Williams,
now with the Magic, recalled how the 76ers snared Maurice Cheeks
with the 36th pick in 1978. ``Jack McMahon (the team's assistant
and top scout) saw him play at West Texas State and came back
raving about him, even though he played in a slow-down offense. We
needed a point guard at the time (Williams was then the Sixers'
general manager) because the (World B.) Free thing was not working
out. Then, he played really well in the Pizza Hut Classic, so
people started to know who he was. We worked him out again in
Cincinnati before the draft and liked him a lot. But we really
sweated it out in the second round to get him at 36.'' Philly did
not have a first-round pick that year . . . Hoop fans in Croatia
were aflutter this week when news broke that Dino Radja had signed
with Zadar and was coming home. (Zadar is a couple hours from his
native Split.) Not so fast, says Radja's agent, Marc Fleisher. All
Dino did was agree to play for Zadar and no one else in Croatia. He
remains free to choose another team in Europe or, perhaps, return
to the NBA. ``I think his preference is still Europe,'' Fleisher
said, ``but there aren't that many teams that can make a good
offer. He's feeling better. He had an injury-free season (in
Greece) and he's more inclined now to consider the NBA because he
feels he can handle the grind.'' Fleisher said there was a ``fair
likelihood'' that Radja would come back, but with whom? ``It's too
early to tell,'' he said. ```Several of the better teams in the
league already have contacted me, though. And there still are a
couple of teams in Europe we're waiting on.'' In other words, Zadar
is the equivalent of the safety school in the college application
process. If nothing else works, that's where he'll be. But it looks
like something else will work. Radja is 32 . . . Detlef Schrempf, a
free agent, was thought to be considering joining an over-the-cap
contender for the veteran's exception, hoping to wrangle a ring
before he gets too old. (He turns 37 Jan. 21.) His two favorites at
the moment appear to be the Lakers and the Trail Blazers. Whether
the interest is reciprocated remains to be seen. Schrempf has
played the last six years for Seattle . . . Jayson Williams of the
Nets is trying to use his considerable powers of persuasion to
convince Charles Oakley to come to the swamps of Jersey. Williams
will have his thumb operated on _ it's an old war wound _ but both
he and Kerry Kittles (knee) are expected to be fine for Don Casey's
first training camp. As a precaution, however, Casey is thinking of
using Kendall Gill at shooting guard and re-signed Scott Burrell
(as well as Keith Van Horn) at small forward.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Things will get really antsy in Denver in the next week or so.
That's when it will be known who, if anyone, is willing to top the
$400 million offer to buy the Nuggets, Avalanche, and new Pepsi
Center. A handful of stockholder lawsuits originally held up the
sale from Ascent to Bill Laurie, who married well (one of the
Wal-Mart women) and also has a hoop pedigree (point guard on the
1973 Memphis State NCAA runners-up.) Laurie's $400 million is
already known. What isn't known is if there are any other bids, but
former Nugget John Roche (author of the indelible 8-0-24 line) is
rumored to be putting together a group, and that might spell
trouble for Dan Issel. Once all bids are revealed, Laurie will have
48 hours to respond. There remains a possibility the properties
could be up for auction, like Joyce Maynard's letters from JD
Salinger, only less revealing. The Pepsi Center, meanwhile, will be
ready for the opening of hockey and basketball season this fall.

SOUTH AFRICAN HEYNS SETS WORLD RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAMONA SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Penny Heyns was just trying to post a good time in
the 200-meter breaststroke at the Janet Evans Invitational on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   She did a little better than she had hoped for, setting the
world record twice in the event at USC's McDonald's Swim Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still didn't feel like it was me doing it out there. It's
been a really weird day,'' Heyns said.
</P>
<P>
   Heyns set the first of her world records in a morning
preliminary qualifying race, with a time of 2:24.69.
</P>
<P>
   That record lasted only seven hours as Heyns bested her morning
time by .18 in the final with a packed stadium and crowded poolside
cheering her. Heyns won the race eight seconds ahead of
second-place finisher Kristen Caverly (2:32.71).
</P>
<P>
   Heyns, a South African who won gold medals in the 100 and
200-meter breaststroke at the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta, also
holds the world record in the 50 and 100-meter breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
   __  &UR; Surely but not so slowly &LR; : Former USC All-American Kristine
Quance-Julian did not dominate the meet as in years past.
</P>
<P>
   But considering the meet is one of the first she has competed in
since giving birth to a baby boy, Trenton Jeffrey, last December, a
third-place finish in the 400-meter individual medley (4:50.83) and
a fourth-place finish in the 200-meter breaststroke (2:34.92)
aren't bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard not to compare it to my previous meets because I
still want to win,'' Quance-Julian said.
</P>
<P>
   __  &UR; Future  &LR; s &UR; tar &LR; : She won no events, but 12-year-old Brett
Shiflett made her presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   Shiflett, who swims for Canyons Aquatics, is the younger sister
of Granada Hills standout Nicole Shiflett, who also competes for
Canyons.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Shiflett placed 88th in the 200-meter freestyle
(2:11.21) and 121st in the 50-meter freestyle (29:07). Older sister
Nicole just missed the cut for the bonus final by .32 in the
50-meter freestyle with a time of 27.81. She missed a qualifying
time for Junior Nationals by .02, and finished 77th in the
200-meter freestyle with a time of 2:11.09.
</P>
<P>
   __  &UR; C &LR; onsolation time: Hart High star Anthony Ervin and
Cleveland High standout Amy Jones have posted some of the fastest
times in their events so far. Ervin, the Daily News boys' swimmer
of the year and holder of two state records, won the consolation
final of the 50-meter freestyle with a time of 23.70. He just
missed the cut for the championship final by .29 with a preliminary
time of 24.03.
</P>

THIS POINT WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO RETURN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ He thought his time had passed. Unless your name is
Michael Jordan, one generally gets so many shots to represent one's
country. Tim Hardaway had had two. He figured there would never be
a third.
</P>
<P>
   But he's here, the senior statesman in age and NBA service on a
United States team with a lot of youth, promise, firepower, and
flash. He's recovering from knee surgery, getting his minutes, and
enjoying his first international foray as a member of the United
States's pre-Olympic qualifying team.
</P>
<P>
   He'll also be there next summer in Sydney, health and qualifying
results willing. That's when it will all sink in for the veteran
point guard from the Miami Heat, who turns 33 Sept. 1. This is only
a preliminary _ but it's still a meaningful one for him. He could
easily have been dismissed as too old or too ordinary by the USA
Basketball folks. He's grateful that wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really means so much to me,'' he said. ``I missed the last
two. USA Basketball didn't have to call me. But I was thankful they
did. It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   More than any of his fellow elders, playing here is important to
Hardaway if, for nothing else, opportunities lost. Most of the US
team assembled here for the Qualifying Tournament of the Americas,
including headliners Kevin Garnett, Tim Duncan, and Jason Kidd,
have some international competitions ahead of them. The next oldest
player on the team, Gary Payton, has a gold medal at home from the
1996 Olympic team. The third oldest, Steve Smith, has one from the
US team that won the 1994 world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway was to have been a teammate of Smith's on that 1994
team, which probably is best remembered for the boorish, arrogant,
and stupid behavior from social luminaries Larry Johnson, Shawn
Kemp, and Derrick Coleman. But 12 days after being selected _
Hardaway was still with the Golden State Warriors at that point _
he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He missed
all of that season and couldn't make it to Toronto for the 1994
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last summer, he was offered yet another chance. He had
been reborn under Pat Riley in Miami, recognized once again as one
of the game's best point guards. He already had collected 5,000
points and 2,500 assists faster than any other player in NBA
history, with the exception of Oscar Robertson. He needed 262 games
to do it. Robertson needed 247.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to Miami midway through the 1995-96 season,
Hardaway had been named All-NBA first team (1997) and all-NBA
second team (1998, '99), and he was a participant in the All-Star
Game (1997, '98). Due to such prowess, he was selected along with
his NBA brethren to be on the US team for the 1998 World
Championships in Athens, where a gold medal was all but certain.
But after the NBA imposed a lockout July 1, the players decided not
to participate and the hastily assembled team of US scrubs could
not win the gold, which would have eliminated the need for the US
team to be here.
</P>
<P>
   USA Basketball forgave the ingrates _ it had nothing to do with
the lockout, despite a heavy NBA presence on its masthead _ and
invited most of them here. Then, Hardaway had a minor scare of
sorts this time around when he tore cartilage in his left knee,
which rendered him uncharacteristically ineffective against the
Knicks in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's over,'' he said of the New York disappointment. ``I've
cried enough. I've cried enough. But it still leaves a bad taste in
my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The early exit, however, had an unanticipated benefit. Hardaway
had surgery and now, a couple of months later, he's able to play
and is gradually rounding into shape.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is about ``75 percent'' back. He's trying, as he put
it, ``to get my knee and mind working together again.'' He's coming
off the bench for the US team and averaged 8.5 points in the first
two US runaways. He wanted No. 10, which is what he's worn in the
NBA, but instead was given No. 8. As they say, any port in a storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be here,'' he said. ``When I tore my ACL,
that hurt me tremendously because I wanted to go out and represent
my country. I want to play this year. I almost didn't make it
because of a little meniscus tear. But it's been (more than) six
weeks since I had surgery. If it was the regular season, or even
the offseason, it would be time to get on the court again. Why not
here? It feels good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I missed my turn. But my turn has come back around
and here I am. I'm going to make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's happy to be here, Australia is clearly on his mind
because he knows _ knows _ that there won't be a fourth chance. The
US simply has to finish first or second here _ ``we just have to
make sure we don't screw up,'' said the ever-candid Payton _ and
the nine NBA members of this team will go to Sydney. Three more NBA
players will be chosen early next year to complete the squad. It
will be the third Olympiad in which NBA players have participated.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway said he won't get the proverbial goose bumps until he's
actually down under, walking with his fellow athletes in the
opening ceremonies and then playing the actual Olympic schedule.
That's when it will sink in _ that he really is, at long last, a
member of America's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a qualifying round,'' he said. ``It will mean a
lot (to win here). But when we go to Australia, that's when it
really, really, really means something. We'll be going against the
big teams. It will be the real McCoy. It will be for all the
marbles. This is a qualifier. Once we get to the big dance, we
gotta do something in it.''

ARMSTRONG 36TH, BUT RETAINS LARGE LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
 DE FRANCE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBI, FRANCE _ The ride from Saint-Flour to Albi Saturday was
this tour's longest (147 miles) and also the hottest _ the
thermometer hit 102 degrees. So the riders weren't inclined to
knock themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Overall leader Lance Armstrong finished 36th at more than 22
minutes back, as Italian rider Salvatore Commesso finished first in
5 hours 52 minutes 45 seconds. Since Commesso started the day 46
minutes back in overall time, the yellow jersey still easily
belongs to Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   It was an all-Italian finish as Marco Serpellini, who broke away
with Commesso on the last climb, was second and Mariano Piccoli
third. It was the sixth stage won by an Italian this year.
</P>
<P>
   Commesso, 24, was one of 16 riders who attacked after only five
miles. As the Coca-Cola motorcycle patrolled the pack and handed
out water bottles, the rest of the riders seemed to say, ``Be my
guest.''
</P>
<P>
   Commesso and Serpellini made their move 20 miles from the finish
on the hilly but long course that passed by fields of sunflowers.
The rest of the lead bunch broke into smaller groups as the two
Italians took a lead of two minutes over their nearest rivals and
got ready for their sprint into town.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, American George Hincapie shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me how many bottles of water I drank, it was too
many to count,'' he said.

BUSINESSES TURN TO CHINESE METHOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The producers were worried that the sitcom pilot
they were about to shoot at a Burbank studio was doomed. Not
because the script was bad or the actors didn't know their lines.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were worried the show was doomed because the studio was
jinxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me that all the pilots that had been filmed there
had never been picked up,'' said P.K. Odle. ``They wanted to do
everything they possibly could to change the luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that dismal track record, the producers hired Odle to
perform feng shui, an ancient Chinese art that detractors call
superstition but supporters call science.
</P>
<P>
   Odle said her recommendations included putting ``water''
elements in the back and ``mountain'' elements in the front of the
studio. She said the show responded by placing stones on pallets in
front of the building and parking a water truck out back.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers _ whom Odle wouldn't identify _ will have
to wait until the fall television season to see if their effort
pays off.
</P>
<P>
   But their attempt puts them solidly among the growing ranks of
businesspeople who have turned to feng shui (pronounced FUNG SHWAY)
_ an ancient Chinese tradition rooted in natural forces _ to boost
their bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   While the art has several different schools, its basic premise
is that the environment affects things such as health, prosperity
and relationships. Feng shui, which is used extensively in Asia,
involves what supporters say is the scientific design or selection
of environments to maximize natural positive energy.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui has long been used in Southland homes, but
practitioners say it is making inroads in the business world as
companies search for ways to increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``More consciousness is coming into the workplace, and people
are realizing there are more things influencing them than meets the
eye,'' said Odle, a proponent of the Compass school who also
teaches at the American Feng Shui Institute in Monterey Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``More businesses feel comfortable having this done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Errico, president of Errico Design Associates in Santa
Monica, said about 10percent of her commercial clients use feng
shui, a proportion that has increased dramatically in the last
couple years.
</P>
<P>
   And Errico said that has not bothered her at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (feng shui) follows principles that open up an office
or a home, and it provides usually good common-sense principles to
design,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Spread mostly through word of mouth, feng shui has moved beyond
its old bulwark of businesses owned by Asians or Asian-Americans in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Many say the art has brought concrete results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had huge improvements in the business since we brought
feng shui in,'' said Jennifer Harvey, owner of Australian Living in
Woodland Hills. ``People come in here, and they feel positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey attributes her improved business and personal life to the
work of Santa Clarita-based feng shui consultant Patti
Robbins-Vignal.
</P>
<P>
   Vignal, an adherent of the art's Black Hat school, said her work
is centered around helping positive energy flow through the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent visit to Capital Office Products in nearby San
Fernando, Robbins-Vignal gave business owner Carolyn Nelson advice
on everything from lighting to telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Her suggestions included: eliminating clutter, removing pictures
of family members, bringing in more colorful pictures and placing
plants in certain corners.
</P>
<P>
   But the visit also dealt with the unseen.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's upstairs loft, Robbins-Vignal hung a length of
red string to make a ``wall'' across an unsafe area; in a closet
buzzing with electrical equipment, she suggested a mirror to
deflect harmful energy.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said she brought feng shui to her business after having
it done at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt it couldn't do any harm,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson said she does not advertise her use of the ancient
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I'm going to go out and tell everyone,''
she said, ``because I'm going to be judged for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That fear is common among businesspeople who have turned to feng
shui, Robbins-Vignal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have lots of employees, and some may not understand,''
she said. ``People who are very, very religious misinterpret this
to be a religious action when it's really a scientific one.''
</P>
<P>
   Odle, the instructor with the American Feng Shui Institute, said
larger, successful businesses are especially secretive.
</P>
<P>
   But some designers say there is nothing embarrassing about the
ancient art form.
</P>
<P>
   The advice of feng shui consultants usually complements or
confirms her own interior design work, Errico said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the goals are the same: really good space that
functions for the person and makes them feel good in working in the
space,'' she said. ``We haven't been in conflict with that at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui-inspired changes _ while not scientific in the classic
sense _ often make a major difference for employers and employees,
said Jenny Liu, owner of New Feng Shui Concepts in Alhambra.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Liu said she recently changed the floor plan for a
business client so that workers at their desks would have solid
walls _ not open, active spaces _ behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Before the change, she said, workers were distracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a sense of not knowing what's going on behind
them, and this will lower their focus and mental clarity,'' she
said. ``It influences how they work.''

BIT OF A SQUEEZE AT CARNOUSTIE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ This is a seaside town, grim and harsh by
the North Sea. The people who reside here are hardy souls, proud of
their heritage and easy to engage. They last staged the British
Open at Carnoustie Golf Course in 1975, when Tom Watson won the
first of his five claret jugs. Will they return again? Doubtful,
simply because of accessibility.
</P>
<P>
   There were several thousand spectators waiting for space on a
train to get to Dundee, Edinburgh, or Glasgow Thursday night. There
was no room, and there was nearly a riot. People driving from
across the watery bays between here and St. Andrews to the course
on the north side of the River Tay were stuck in traffic, requiring
two hours to go 40 miles.
</P>
<P>
   This is sad, because Carnoustie is one of the world's great
links courses. It is in top form entering Sunday's final round of
the 128th British Open, a course British writer John Huggan has
said is ``unquestionably a golf course of regal magnificence.''
</P>
<P>
   The five champions who have won here are Tommy Armour (1931),
Henry Cotton ('37), Ben Hogan ('53), Gary Player ('68), and Watson.
Hogan's only visit to the championship _ the same year he won the
Masters and the US Open _ was inspirational, and the Scots called
him ``The Wee Ice Mon.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the late Pat Ward Thomas wrote of Hogan's
performance in his only British Open and has been reprinted in Golf
Digest. ``Imagine him as he scrutines a long, difficult stroke,
with arms quietly folded, an inscrutable quarter-smile on his lips,
for all the world like a gambler watching the wheel spin. And then
the cigarette is tossed away, the club taken with abrupt decision,
the glorious swing flashes and a long iron pierces the wind like an
arrow. That was Hogan. We shall never see his like again.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the bleak surroundings in what otherwise is a delightful
town, old Carnoustie reared up to take its toll on the globe's best
players. Part of it was the setup _ narrow fairways with fierce
winds. You could stand by the 18th green Friday and see rows of
flags. They were blowing in the howling winds in two directions.
This is why Billy Andrade, on the eve of the championship, said
that whoever wins Sunday is ``in my mind the world's greatest
golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   After Greg Norman's whiffed shot on Friday _ when his tee shot
kicked just 9 feet into the rough _ he bemoaned the fact the course
was unfairly set up to make it play to a more difficult level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think hitting a tee shot off the fairway by 9 feet
deserves something like that,'' said Norman. ``In my estimation, I
don't think that's the way the game of golf should be played. I got
a real dose of the true punishment of what it is like and it
doesn't feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   The tent city at Carnoustie has to be crammed into limited
acreage. It's a shame. What it all comes down to is the bottom
line: Money. The real shame is that courses and clubs such as
Merion, in the suburbs of Philadelphia (discarded as a US Open
venue), and Carnoustie should be permanent fixtures on the major
championship calendar. As Zimbabwean Mark McNulty put it, ``I would
say condition-wise, it's one of the best I've ever seen. As far as
severity is concerned, it's probably one of the toughest. If you
don't enjoy it, it's going to bite you. That's the whole philosophy
of mine this week. It's just to go out there and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, who became the oldest player to win two of the
game's major championships in the same year when he triumphed in
the Masters and the British Open in 1998, is someone Tiger Woods
has frequently referred to as his ``big brother,'' and O'Meara is a
sincere family man. He's also become a bore when he opens his mouth
relative to the Ryder Cup. He's a contradiction in terms _ a
self-proclaimed multimillionaire who feels players should be paid
to show up at The Country Cup in September.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to his sermon, and sort out the particulars. ``The
majority of players don't want to speak about it because they're
going to get crucified in the press,'' said O'Meara, on the eve of
his British Open defense that fizzled after an 83-74_157. ``You ask
me time and time again about that. I've played on four Ryder Cup
teams. I think the Ryder Cup is a very special event. I've never
denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing for your country is an honor, but I think more or less
playing as a team is what the honor is all about. As long as the
PGA of America and the European PGA Tour feel like the money is
going back to further the game of golf or it's going back to some
good charities, I have no problem not being paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of you, as media people, should come and donate your money
to a charity that week, too. Just think how much money they can
raise for charity if everybody donated all the money that week for
charity. You guys don't mind doing that, do ya? Give your salary
that week.''
</P>
<P>
   Then O'Meara denied he was a multimillionnaire. ``I'm not,'' he
said. ``I have a few, and you can go back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think that everybody else involved in the event is not
making money? All I am saying is that there's a lot of money being
made somewhere, and if it is going back to further the game of
golf, I have no problem with it. But some of the stuff that I read
in the media that I'm going to boycott or Tiger is boycotting or
demanding this, demanding that . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never demanded anything. You asked me a point of view. I
gave you a point of view. Some people agree with me, some people
don't agree with me. I played at Valderrama (in Spain) two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came home and the media laid into the American players and
said we're spoiled millionaires and that's why we can't win the
Ryder Cup. I think that the credit needs to be given to the team
that wins. You can come with all sorts of reasons why a team loses,
but in golf, you lose a lot more times than you win.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara said he didn't know how much it cost to transport,
outfit, and house him at the Cup competition in Valderrama. He said
that playing in the President's Cup last year in Australia enabled
him to donate $100,000 to Arnold Palmer's Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could designate where some of the funds that were made by
the event were specifically going, to charities I support,'' he
said. ``You guys have some charities. I'll send some money to your
guy's charities. Let me know.''
</P>
<P>
   Since one writer has just set up a scholarship at a small rural
high school in memory of his parents with a $16,000 donation,
O'Meara was given the option.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember Justin Rose? He was the teenager who delighted the
golfing nation of England by throwing a scare into the game's best
golfers by threatening to win the British Open at Royal Birkdale
last year. He finished joint fourth, turned pro, failed to qualify
for the European PGA Tour, and wasn't able to make a cut despite
sponsor's exemptions. ``I don't regret anything I have done,'' he
said. ``There's no doubt about that. I feel I'm a better player due
to everything that has gone on technically, mentally. I feel a lot
tougher. I can take anything that anybody throws at me. The more
times I didn't do well in a tournament, the harder I would go home
and practice. The harder you practice and not see the results, the
more frustrating it gets. I wouldn't say it was like a low. There's
no doubt that practice does pay off eventually. Timing didn't quite
happen, momentum didn't quite get going, but I never regret turning
professional. I'd like to lay this ghost to rest. I was turning pro
after the British Open no matter what happened.'' . . . Lee Janzen,
who won the US Open twice in this decade, doesn't think another
American will necessarily win Sunday. ``I think the winner will be
a guy who is playing extremely well, and I think that's great.
That's what everybody wants to see. A worthy champion. The guy who
wins this week will be the guy who plays the best, whether he's an
American, a European, or whatever.' . . . Jaime Ortiz-Patino, who
became a billionaire through the Bolivian tin mines and bought
Valderrama, released his book ``The Ryder Cup Years 1992-1997'' at
a luncheon at Carnoustie Thursday. He's a frequent visitor to
Greater Boston, where he is on the board of directors at the Lahey
Clinic, and he plays golf at Weston GC and Brae Burn CC. The Club
de Golf at Valderrama will host the inaugural World Golf
Championships (Nov. 4-7) with a $5 million purse to go to the top
50 players in the world rankings. Jimmie, as he is known to his
friends, feels the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship,
which was won by Jeff Maggert at La Costa in February, should
change its format. ``You should have 36 holes of medal play, and
let the low 32 go into match play on the weekend,'' he said. ``Let
it end Monday, which is your President's Day next year.'' The
tournament will be contested at La Costa again, and then move to
Victoria in Australia in 2001. ``Do you think top players will want
to travel all that distance and be eliminated after just one
round?'' asked Jimmie. No way . . . The latest teenager to grace
the British Open is the somehow aptly named Zane Scotland, who just
turned 17 Saturday and resides in Wallington, England. ``I don't
think it is daunting at all for me,'' he said before opening with
an 82. ``For me I'm just going to go and play golf like I normally
do and let everyone else be themselves and get in the zone. It's
just the way I am, I suppose. I'm going to take everything as it
comes really, just go and play a bit of golf, and have a bit of
fun.''

VARGAS SHOWS SKILLS, ENDURANCE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LAKE TAHOE _ As hot-blooded as Fernando Vargas is outside the
ring, he's as cool and calculating as any fighter in it.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF junior middleweight champion from Oxnard, Calif., didn't
destroy former champ Raul Marquez as so many people thought he
would. Instead, he methodically dismantled him &UR;  &LR; Saturday night at
Caesars Tahoe, slicing up Marquez's tender face with pinpoint
accuracy until the challenger finally fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   The end came at two minutes of the 11th round, when Vargas
wobbled Marquez's knees with a left-right-left combination and then
_ with his prey leaning helplessly against the ropes _ followed
with a vicious flurry of unanswered punches that prompted referee
Joe Cortez to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The knockout preserved Vargas' perfect record _ 17 fights, 17
knockouts _ but it was the first time the champion had gone past
seven rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were asking all week what would happen after seven
rounds. Was that good enough for you?'' said Vargas, who won almost
every round on the three cards.
</P>
<P>
   Take nothing away from Marquez (30-2, 20 KOs), a good fighter
known for his grit. The Texan, whose facial skin regularly fails
him, suffered three cuts _ above and under his left eye and to the
side of his right eye _ and his cheeks were badly swollen. But he
kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he was much too slow for the remarkably quick Vargas.
But he kept coming. He simply didn't have the skills to prevent
taking undue punishment from the opening bell. But he kept coming,
until Vargas' punches finally knocked him senseless.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, it was out of his hands. No one argued when
Cortez stopped the fight: It was a merciful ending.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez said before the fight that Vargas was more hype than
anything else. Afterward, he corrected himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vargas is !ital!real good,'' he said. ``He's a sharp shooter.
I just couldn't catch up to him. He's better than I thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to slug with him, I tried to make him fight my fight,
but he wouldn't. He's smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Smart indeed.
</P>
<P>
   When Vargas came into the ring, he had madness in his eyes.
Without question, he's one of the most intense and intimidating
fighters in the world.
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, he exacted some revenge on Marquez. The
challenger provoked him at a recent news conference by giving him a
T-shirt of Oscar De La Hoya, whom Vargas disdains. Vargas, who had
said when he received the gift that he would return it so Marquez
could wipe the blood off his face, did just that.
</P>
<P>
   There was some mean-spirited pushing in the ring and, again,
Vargas had that look in his eyes. However, even at 21 and with few
fights behind him, he's able to gain complete control of his anger
once the bell rings. He calls his state of being ``controlled
anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Take the sixth round, when Marquez landed a painful. low blow
that put a stop to the fight for about two minutes while Vargas
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   One wondered: Would that set him off? It didn't. He once again
reverted to one of the most efficient machines in boxing, with no
trace of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas' first truly big fight could be next summer against WBA
junior middleweight champ David Reid, who narrowly slipped past
unknown Kevin Kelly of Australia on Friday night. Now, Reid might
not want any part of him.
</P>
<P>
   Said Marquez: ``Of all the junior middleweight champs, Vargas is
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to argue with that.
</P>
<P>
   In another featured bout, big-punching heavyweight contender
David Tua (34-1, 29 KOs) knocked out Gary Bell (21-3, 14 KOs) 79
seconds into a scheduled 12-round bout.
</P>
<P>
   Tua, ranked No. 1 by the IBF, savagely attacked Bell from the
opening bell, cutting him over the left eye in the early seconds
and ending the fight with an barrage of punches as Bell leaned
against the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Tua is looking for a shot at either heavyweight champion,
Evander Holyfield or Lennox Lewis, and might be better than both.
</P>
<P>
   And Mario Aguiniga of Oxnard stopped Francisco Guzman at 51
seconds of the second round in a scheduled four-round featherweight
bout.

LEONARD HAS THE EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-LEONARD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Just two years ago on the west coast of
Scotland at Royal Troon GC, Justin Leonard elevated his game to a
new level. There were 32 players in contention entering the final
round of the British Open on the Ayrshire Coast. Of the 32, only
Leonard broke 70. He bolted out of the pack, and showed the world
that a 65 in the final round of one of the game's major
championships is the way to win.
</P>
<P>
   After a bogey out of a greenside bunker on the par-3 16th
Saturday in the third round of the British Open at Carnoustie Golf
Club, Leonard had to face up to the difficult two closing holes.
Perhaps thinking back for a moment to the way he finished at Royal
Troon, he hit two 3-woods into the 459-yard 17th and made his par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that hole's played really hard,'' he said. He then hit
a weak tee shot on the 18th, hit his second to the back of the
green, and said he ``made a nice two-putt.''
</P>
<P>
   So Leonard, who warmed up for the winds of Carnoustie by
practicing in the winds near his home in Dallas last week, finished
with an even-par 71 and tied for second with Australian Craig Parry
(67) at 5-over 218. They're five astern of Frenchman Jean Van de
Velde, who sank a monumental putt on the 18th to shoot 70 and take
control of the tournament at level-par 213. It's his to win or
lose, but Leonard's outlook is upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it just two years ago he entered the final 18 trailing
Jesper Parnevik by five shots and won by three over Parnevik and
Ireland's Darren Clarke?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the 17th played the most difficult this week,'' Leonard
said. ``It felt the wind was coming in a different direction. To
get a four there, you know you're picking up half a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit a very good tee shot on the 18th, but it was in
the fairway, and I hit it up the left of the green and made a nice
two-putt from off the green. To par those last two holes maybe
keeps me in the last two groups. I feel I can go out and shoot a
good round and reach them tomorrow. I'm pleased to have a chance to
win the tournament going into Sunday. That was my primary goal at
the beginning of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who hasn't won this year and whose last victory was in
The Players Championship in 1998 in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., talked
about the way it was on the Saturday night at Troon and what he
expected Saturday &UR;  &LR; night to be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine they'll be a little bit different,'' he said. ``I
hadn't played well on Saturday (at Troon) and felt I'd kind of let
things slip away a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited. I knew if I played well that I'd probably make
the Ryder Cup team. I caught myself and reminded myself I still had
a chance to win the golf tournament. For the rest of the night and
the next morning, my mindset was more than just going out trying to
play solid but to go out and try to give myself a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, today I didn't have to putt that well. If I had,
I could have shot a better score. I hit the ball real well. I gave
myself a lot of chances. It's different every day. Thursday I
putted beautifully. Yesterday I could have putted better. Today I
was very happy with the way I putted. I think the goal tomorrow is
to go out and give myself some chances. I know I'm going to make
bogeys, but I just want to try to give myself enough chances to
offset that.''
</P>
<P>
   The number he figures he has to shoot Sunday to overtake a
sturdy Van de Velde isn't one he wanted to come up with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't,'' said Leonard. ``I found out in college I was a
terrible judge of trying to judge the number. I'll just judge the
day, see how things unfold, and if I have a chance I'll play
aggressively. The weather? Guys have gotten used to the conditions
and how the golf course is playing. I would probably just order up
more of the same.''

SAMPRAS, O'BRIEN COME TOGETHER ON COMMON GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ It was sort of like Stanley finding
Livingstone in darkest Africa 128 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras, on what looks like the darkest afternoon for the
US Davis Cup team, comes across a sandy-haired chap wandering an
asphalt plain in Chestnut Hill, and proclaims: ``Alex O'Brien, I
presume!''
</P>
<P>
   The very same. William Alexander O'Brien out of Amarillo, Texas,
says he wasn't really lost, but the US would have been without the
two of them. Dr. David Livingstone, the famed missionary-explorer,
also said he wasn't misplaced when newspaper reporter Henry Stanley
tracked him down. But their meeting made beautiful headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Same for the heralded Sampras and the unheralded O'Brien, whose
encounter Saturday on a 131-degree griddle at LCC (that's Longwood
Cauldron Club) kept the natives on life support, though down, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2-0 for the Australian invaders Friday, and the plugs
were being pulled from the inert home body. However, the two
strangers, Sampras and O'Brien, never before cohabiting a tennis
court, resuscitated the presumed corpse _ at least for another day
_ by cutting through the bedlam, and Mark Woodforde and Sandon
Stolle, 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the best-of-five series continues, perhaps as it concluded
Saturday evening with the crammed-house audience of 5,342 bleating
and bonkering while the Harvard band blared ``Stars and Stripes
Forever!'' It was madness on Route 9 as never before, even though
Longwood has been presenting international tennis fiestas since the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Mad hounds and tennis nuts go out on such dog day 98-degree
afternoons, and they were all there in the grandstands, passing
their rabidity on to this seemingly found-and-lost doubles
amalgamation Sampras and O'Brien. Fading in the third and fourth
after winning the first two sets, Pete and Alex bonded like gin and
vermouth in a martinificent fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say Pete and Alex were lucky to find each other for 3
1/2 hours. They may never again. After all, they don't travel in
the same circles. O'Brien, 29, is clunking along at No. 185 in the
rankings _ although he does know what to do in a game of doubles.
He's a college graduate (Stanford '92). His accomplice-for-a-day,
merely the universe's finest, may have swerved away from the last
years of high school, but will have a Ph.D in tennis the day he's
tapped for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find Pete and Alex at the same bank. Pete probably
owns his. But Saturday they were common cause-mates on that big
green brick in a situation _ Davis Cup doubles _ where Australian
teams had won 12 straight times, and the American record during the
tenure of Captain Tom Gullikson was laughable: 7-10.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to solve the problem, Gullikson has felt like Edison
searching for the right filament, and mostly winding up in the
dark. But you know what they always say in a fleshpot called
Onalaska, Wis., Gullikson's hometown? The 14th time never fails,
and Sampras and O'Brien were the 14th blind date the captain has
arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson has thought of trying the personals. You know: Lonely
WMT seeks two WMT to share rectangle, travels, and find lasting
satisfaction. But Gullikson, an aging WMT (Wandering Male Tennist)
seldom finds two young WMTs to relieve his doubles troubles.
</P>
<P>
   That's why his smile Saturday night was nearly as broad as the
stretch the Americans may try Sunday. That might be, as Gullikson
hinted, discovering that Todd Martin is gravely infirm _ suddenly
coughing, limping, and groping so blindly that he must be replaced
by Pete in an attempt to waylay Patrick Rafter. That scenario would
leave Jim Courier to deal with the kid, Lleyton Hewitt, in the
showdown fifth match. Wouldn't that cause a man in attendance,
Australian ambassador to the US, Andrew Peacock, to immediately
break off diplomatic relations?
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, paying his first call on Boston, should have known he'd
be all right when introduced to O'Brien. This is an O'Brien town.
There are 578 of them in the phone book, and many have mattered.
Hugh O'Brien once sat in the mayor's chair. Conan O'Brien glitters
on TV. Tim O'Brien writes good books. Rev. James O'Brien had a
highway named for him. Lincoln O'Brien was publisher of the
departed daily Transcript. Jim O'Brien coached basketball as well
as anyone. George O'Brien ran for the city council, promising to
rescue roving Charlie from the MTA.
</P>
<P>
   Now 29-year-old, 6-foot-1-inch Alex O'Brien _ not related to any
of them, he sighs _ has played tennis in Boston, and very well in
the left court, one spare part complementing another named Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great, just being on the same side of the court with a
guy I consider the best of all-time,'' O'Brien said. ``Even if he
almost took my head off once.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who loves avoiding doubles, is Garboesque. He wants to
be alone on the tennis court, and nearly guillotined his partner
when they went after the same ball once in the concluding game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous at first, playing with him _ but Pete made me
feel comfortable. We played two-man touch football against Courier
and Brad Stine during the week, and beat them. I got to know him a
little in those games.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, carrying rackets through the clubhouse, O'Brien was
asked, he smiles, if he was the team stringer. ``That's OK. I don't
have to be known. It was just nice to get my first Cup win in a
home match. The people here were wonderful in supporting us. But
not the loudest crowd. That was in Brazil, and they were very
difficult, even hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   The match was difficult, but in the last two games, O'Brien was
as firm as the road named for another of his tribe. His nifty
chipped lob over Stolle was the shot that fractured Woodforde's
serve on a third break point after four deuces to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the stretch, as the four went at it _ eyeball-to-eyeball! _
in fantastic volleying duels, the Aussies finally had to blink.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras served it out crunchingly despite a break point, and
reveled in the ``Pete-Pete-Pete!'' chants. But he couldn't have
done it without O'Brien. It takes two to tangle in doubles, and the
guy who did as much to strengthen the American heartbeat was, as
all the hundreds of O'Briens in this town would tell you: ``Alex,
we presume.''

MARTIN DEFLECTS INJURY SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-MARTIN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ The world according to Todd Martin works
something like this: Comment on what you know. Speak to your
captain before being caught by surprise. Keep quiet on all
situations beyond your control.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at the Longwood Cricket Club, Martin's world spun
upside down in a matter of minutes and the player was left looking
awkward, uncomfortable and unsure of his position on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the doubles match, Martin talked about his
preparation for Sunday's singles contest against Patrick Rafter. He
talked about strategy. He talked about focus. He talked as if he
was a man in control of his own fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Patrick, the two most important things are serving well
and returning well,'' said Martin. ``It's a different situation
than playing (Lleyton) Hewitt. It's more shotmaking than grinding.
My biggest problem against Lleyton was not making decisions and
I'll be more focused on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The tall player with more than a touch of gray hair made his
remarks before US team captain Tom Gullikson called the 29-year-old
``a medical marvel this whole year.'' The captain's closing comment
at the post-match press conference continued to hold the door open
wide for an appearance by Pete Sampras in singles. When discussing
the player Sampras would replace, no debate ensues. Martin is the
obvious choice.
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Courier, the singles player somewhat overshadowed by the
speculation surrounding Sampras, could again finish as the hero in
the fifth and final match. If the redhead defeated Hewitt, he would
repeat his first-round, final-match victory against Great Britain
in April. Against the Brits, Martin's loss to Tim Henman forced a
fifth contest.
</P>
<P>
   During the fifth set of the doubles match Satufday, Martin stood
up and encouraged fans to chant ``U-S-A, U-S-A,'' cheering his
teammates on to an essential victory from his sideline perch. But
as Day Two concluded he stood as the man on the side of the
quarterfinal controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The news was slow to reach Martin, catching him offguard as he
walked to a practice court more than two hours after the doubles
match. According to Australian reporter Robert Lusetich, Martin
said he was not injured and felt fine. When Lusetich informed
Martin of comments made by Gullikson that seemed to imply Sampras
would play singles, Martin said, ``I haven't spoken to Gully. I
don't want to say anything more.'' Then, he strode quickly to the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments before, Gullikson tiptoed around questions
concerning Martin's health. He wouldn't comment upon whether or not
Martin was 100 percent fit. Yet, he planted doubts about Martin's
singles status.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Martin) has been in two states since January 1st, playing
competitive matches and having the third or fourth record on Tour,
or rehabbing,'' said the captain, who noted any medical excuse
would need to be certified by a neutral doctor before substitution.
``He has really not been healthy all year and he manages to be able
to win some matches. So, he's had an assortment of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australian players and captain John Newcombe are preparing
for the singles matchups that were originally scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you have got Pat against Todd,'' said Newcombe. ``They
just played a four-setter at Wimbledon. It was a tight, tight
match. They play tight matches against each other. I think you've
probably got to give a slight edge to Pat in that one. If it did
come down to the fifth match, well, you saw them both play the
other day, it will be a pretty good match . . . Between Jim and
Lleyton it will be very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Martin and the Americans, the men from down under weren't
hung up on having their world turned upside down.

MARTIN INJURY WOULD ALLOW SAMPRAS TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-RULE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ What would it take for Pete Sampras to
replace Todd Martin for Sunday's Davis Cup singles match against
Australian Patrick Rafter? A letter from the doctor that would
satisfy the International Tennis Federation, its officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, if Martin complained of injury, he would need to
be examined by a neutral physician. That doctor then would submit a
written certificate detailing his findings to neutral referee
Stefan Fransson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   If the findings stated Martin was indeed injured, and if
Fransson concurred with the findings, Martin would be given medical
clearance to miss the match, and US captain Tom Gullikson could
insert Sampras, a late team entry who has vowed only to play
doubles, to face Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter is the No. 2 singles player in the world. Sampras is No.
3 but still widely considered the world's best player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, there are three doctors on site, and that doctor
(who would examine Martin) would be chosen randomly by the neutral
referee,'' said Fransson. ``The doctor's report is then given to
the neutral referee, and it has to satisfy the neutral referee.''
The doctors are normally from the host country.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to Saturday's match, Gullikson said repeatedly he
would honor Sampras's wish to play only doubles. But at a press
conference following the Sampras-led American doubles win,
Gullikson said, ``There is a possibility'' he might play Sampras
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter then began a query by saying, ``The rules of the
Davis Cup are such that . . . '' whereupon Gullikson interjected,
``We know the rules. You don't have to quote the rules, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   When Sampras was asked how he felt about the possibility of
playing, he said, ``I'm just happy to be here,'' then chided the
press for its coverage of the issue and its criticism of
Gullikson's stance.
</P>
<P>
   Talk that Sampras might play Sunday came as a surprise to
Australian captain John Newcombe, who said he didn't know anything
about Martin being injured. ``I am surprised because the rules say
that you have got to have a doctor's report saying you are not able
to play,'' said Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   When told that Martin said he was going to get treatment but did
not say for what, Newcombe said, ``It is all hypothetical. I don't
want to get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alun James, the ITF's head of communications, said such
substitutions are rare. ``It's a difficult thing because players
play with injuries all the time,'' he said. ``It's rare, but it's a
fairly unusual circumstance the United States has. Most people
don't keep their best player on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule will be eliminated next season, and the captain will be
able to substitute any player for another up to an hour before the
tie is to start.

</HEADLINE>
 CUP-AUSTRALIA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ When you have an opportunity to claim
victory, it is paramount to home in with a vengeance. You never
know what uncertainty lies beyond chance. Both the United States
and Australian Davis Cup teams discovered that Saturday. The lesson
proved more costly for the latter squad.
</P>
<P>
   Australians Mark Woodforde and Sandon Stolle entered the
best-of-five quarterfinal tie with a 2-0 lead by virtue of
consecutive singles victories Friday. They had a chance to make
Sunday's singles a formality with a victory. In fact, they had two
chances.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans Pete Sampras and Alex O'Brien took the first two
sets, 6-4, 6-3. In the third and fourth sets, however, they
struggled and the Aussies capitalized, winning 6-3 and 6-4, giving
themselves another opportunity to end the tie.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for a most-memorable fifth set, most notably
a brilliant battle over the last two points, as the Americans
outlasted their counterparts to take the fifth game, and then the
sixth, for a 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first set, one pair dominated. The other pair was down
a little bit,'' said Australian captain John Newcombe. ``It swapped
around the next two sets. Then we were into the fifth. It (the
fifth set) is as good as you are going to get as a sporting
spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   But the loss meant not only are the Americans still alive in the
meet, but following the contest, the Aussies had to put up with
speculation whether Sampras will meet Patrick Rafter in the first
of two singles contests Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who joined the team late, vowed he would play only
doubles. But following Saturday's match, US team captain Tom
Gullikson said ``it is a possibility'' that he would replace Todd
Martin with Sampras against Rafter. That comes after Gullikson has
steadfastly declared he would honor Sampras's wish.
</P>
<P>
   News of such seemed to surprise and irritate Newcombe, who said
he is not preparing for Sampras to play because he hasn't heard
Martin is injured. Asked if he would protest if Sampras plays,
Newcombe said, ``I don't run the event. It is up to the referee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australians need take only one of two matches Sunday to
claim the tie. Rafter holds a 5-3 edge in head-to-head meetings
against Martin and has won five of the last six, although the
matches have been close. Both players in the fifth match, Lleyton
Hewitt and Jim Courier are playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat and Todd just played a four setter at Wimbledon,'' said
Newcombe, referring to Rafter's 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 7-6 triumph over
Martin a couple of weeks ago. ``It was a tight, tight match. They
play tight matches against each other. I think you probably give a
slight edge to Pat in that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it came down to the fifth match, well, you saw them both
play the other day. It will be a pretty good match between Jim and
Lleyton. It will be very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Many walked away from Saturday's meet with the same conclusion.
Except that Stolle and Woodforde blamed themselves for both the
slow start and for lapses near the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult in the first place to come down from two sets
to love,'' said Woodforde, ``but Sandon and I felt talking to Newk
(Newcombe) on the change of ends that we weren't playing at our
best by any means and we were just making errors on the two service
games we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two did take the next two games of the fifth set and
were tied with the Americans, 3-3. ``We weren't playing our best,
but Newk was saying it was a five-set match,'' said Stolle, ``and
we felt as the match went on that we started playing heaps better
than we were doing in the first two sets.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans took the next game of the fifth set to go up,
4-3. That's when the two teams began going in opposite directions
again.
</P>
<P>
   Woodforde double faulted to put the Aussies down, 0-30. They
took the next three points for a 40-30 advantage, but O'Brien
responded with an inside-out forehand winner for the first of five
deuces.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth, Woodforde hit his third double fault of the game
for advantage US. The Americans took the point for a 5-3 lead when
O'Brien lobbed a shot over Stolle's head that the Australian ran
down but returned long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two double faults came out of nowhere,'' said Woodforde. ``It
is not like my hands were shaking or it was a bad ball toss. Newk
said I pulled down off the ball so it was sort of a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies went ahead, 40-30, in the next game, then saw the
Americans take the next point for duece. Then Sampras delivered a
wicked, 123-m.p.h. ace: advantage US. Then Sampras fired a delivery
Woodforde could not return. Game. Set. Match, US. Opportunity
squandered for Australia.

</P>
<P>
   He's been a stranger I've known most of my life.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. was born on my sixth birthday, only a few
months after his father made a campaign stop in the western
Pennsylvania steel town where I grew up.
</P>
<P>
   My mother and our neighbor, Wanda Betters, took me and Wanda's
son, Ronnie, to see the young presidential candidate. We walked
from our neighborhood above downtown Aliquippa to a hillside
overlooking the mercantile store parking lot where Kennedy was to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most people I'd ever seen in one place, many more
than the San Rocco Day celebrations held each year outside the
Italian-American club on Fourth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy rode through town in a convertible, stopping to shake
hands with steelworkers headed into the mill for the night shift.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally climbed onto the speaker's platform off Franklin
Avenue, the afternoon sun shown on him like a spotlight and
transformed my mother and Wanda into giggling schoolgirls.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, dreamily recalling that day, my mother told me,
``I remember his hair, how light it was, reddish and blond, and how
it seemed to glow.''
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy wasn't some wealthy East Coast aristocrat to my
family. He was a handsome Catholic boy, the child of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   He was of them, made good.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after he became president, his photograph was mounted
on a wall in our house, with all the other relatives. &QL; 
Closer relationship &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In those days, it seemed as if everyone in our neighborhood, no
matter the nationality, had a Kennedy in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Our particular relationship was closer because ``John-John'' and
I both had been born on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   My seventh birthday was his first.
</P>
<P>
   My eighth was his second.
</P>
<P>
   My ninth was his third, and the day of his father's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   When you're a child and it's your birthday, it's impossible to
understand how everyone in your family, even your father, could be
sitting in front of the television set all day, crying.
</P>
<P>
   But they were.
</P>
<P>
   So I watched, too, glum and confused and wondering if the little
boy on the screen, saluting his father's casket outside St.
Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C., had any idea what a
terrible day it was for the both of us.
</P>
<P>
   When President Kennedy was shot in Dallas, the nuns let us out
early from St. Titus grade school, and we all ran home. I told my
mother the news.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, it was my daughter who told me that John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s plane was missing.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it goes with the generation of the families whose
lives run parallel to Kennedy lives. What happens to them seems to
happen to all of us.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, who once lost a child she was carrying, spoke like a
friend about how it must have been for Jacqueline Kennedy when she
lost a son, Patrick, only two days after he was born.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackie died, my mother talked about how well she had done
raising John-John (she always called him that) and his sister,
Caroline. &QL; 
Salute for a lifetime &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They've come to personify grace in the aftermath of tragedy, as
if the salute John-John gave at his father's funeral went on for a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   My mother thought JFK Jr's wife, Carolyn Bessette, lost in the
plane with her husband and a sister, had a ``good face,'' a kind
face. She was interested in the woman young John would marry, not
out of a sense of celebrity, but a sense of family.
</P>
<P>
   That's why TV coverage of his missing plane went on all day, and
why newspapers in this country and all over the world printed
special editions announcing the news, and going over the Kennedys'
tragic history.
</P>
<P>
   It's why guys like me came into the office on a Saturday, and
spent the afternoon and early evening watching TV, reading wire
service reports, and daydreaming, in ways a reporter on the job
isn't supposed to do, about his ninth birthday. &QL;

HEAT SQUARELY ON GULLIKSON 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-GULLIKSON-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Dateline Longwood: Tom Gullikson under siege.
The heat is on. And the temperature creeps upward by the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The heat was on the Davis Cup captain when he announced Thursday
that, no, the Americans were not trying to kid anyone, Pete Sampras
was not going to play singles in this Davis Cup match at the
Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   Leave the world's best player on the sidelines for singles?
Please, what is the captain thinking?
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and Alex O'Brien held off Aussies Mark Woodforde and
Sandon Stolle in doubles Saturday to keep the Americans alive, down
two matches to one. And crank up the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said in his postmatch press conference that his lineup
is not necessarily set for Sunday's singles matchups. They are
scheduled to be Todd Martin against Pat Rafter to open up and then
Jim Courier vs. Lleyton Hewitt in what the Americans hope is a
winner-take-all finale.
</P>
<P>
   There could, Gullikson said on television after the match and
then again in the press conference, be changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a possibility,'' he said about Sampras substituting
Sunday. ``Because some of the players aren't 100 percent fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian captain John Newcombe had preceded Gullikson into the
interview area and expressed surprise that there would be any talk
of Sampras playing singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Todd injured? I didn't think Todd was injured,'' Newcombe
said. ``I am surprised because the rules say that you have got to
have a doctor's report saying that you are not able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The substitute rule becomes much more liberal and gives captains
more leeway next year. For the present, it reads that the
tournament refereee, in this case Stefan Fransson of Sweden, can
rule a singles player is unable to play because of injury, illness,
or other unavoidable hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said he was willing to play singles Sunday if Martin was
``not up to par.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very sensitive subject,'' Sampras said. ``I mean, Tom
has been getting killed in the press for me not playing, and it's
not fair. It was my choice. I have said all along I wasn't going to
play singles here. And Tom is the main reason that I am here.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat, Gullikson said, comes with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to write things without knowing the real story,''
said Gullikson. ``That's part of the job. People can write what
they want to write, and everybody's a Monday morning quarterback. I
do the same thing myself in other sports. It sells newspapers. It's
good copy.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe said he is unsure about the likelihood of lodging a
protest if the Americans call on Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I have never been in the position
where someone has pulled out where they shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And meanwhile, just after Gullikson got done talking about the
injuries Martin has fought through this year, the player in
question headed out to practice. No, said Martin, he was not
injured and felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Todd says he's 100 percent and ready to play, then he'll
probably play, absolutely,'' Gullikson said. ``If he's suffering
from heat stroke or something or he can't lift his elbow, then he
wouldn't play. But who knows?''

back? Will Terry Glenn last the season? Can Willie McGinest stay
injury free?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a closer look at 10 stories:
</P>
<P>
   1. Instant replay: The technology the NFL has to make this a
more efficient process is staggering. Officials in the booth will
have the best angles of the plays and the likelihood of making the
right call appears greater in this second incarnation. Yet there
will be complications.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches will have to add a new skill: replay management. Since
they're allowed to question only two calls in the game, they have
to make sure they're picking the right time and circumstances.
There's always the possibility a coach will have used his replay
calls, and thus have to swallow a tough call on a play that could
impact the game. One bail out is that in the final two minutes of
each half, close calls are reviewed automatically.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Cleveland Browns: Expansion teams are always interesting,
but Cleveland, like Baltimore, will get a second chance at
football, and the Browns will be adding to a solid fan base.
</P>
<P>
   The team should be very competitive, given it didn't have to
wrestle with another expansion franchise (as Jacksonville and
Carolina did) for draft picks. No. 1 pick Tim Couch will add a bit
more spice to the story and locally, there will be interest in head
coach Chris Palmer, who coached at Boston University and was a
Patriots receivers and quarterbacks coach. He was passed up for
Carroll after Bill Parcells left to go to the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   3. Holdouts: Just what will happen with Sanders, Jamal Anderson,
and Carl Pickens, three explosive offensive players who may stage a
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The Sanders situation appears to be the most explosive since the
running back may retire because of his unhappiness with the
direction of the Detroit Lions, who have not been winning in the
Bobby Ross era. Sanders's father also stoked the fires in May when
he said his son was ``sick of losing and sick of the Lions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has not talked to the Lions since the end of the season
and his agent recently said the situation is complicated. Anderson
is trying to negotiate a Curtis Martin-like deal with the Falcons,
who tried to trade him to the Patriots on draft day. Anderson wants
an $8-million-$10 million signing bonus and an average salary of
more than $6 million. Talks are reaching a crucial stage, and if no
settlement is reached, Anderson likely will hold out. Pickens, who
has received the franchise tag from the Cincinnati Bengals, said he
will hold out if a new deal isn't reached. Attempts to trade him
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   4. The law; and we don't mean Ty: The Miami Dolphins head the
list of teams who have players with potential legal issues,
including All-Pro receiver Tony Martin, who is facing as many as 20
years in prison if he's found guilty of laundering drug money. His
federal trial begins Aug. 2. The Dolphins also drafted the troubled
Cecil Collins, who has a long rap sheet, and wide receiver Robert
Baker, who spent 10 months in prison for drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, generally favored as the team that could unseat the
Denver Broncos, recently got into the law enforcement business when
two of their finest offensive linemen _ Jumbo Elliott and Jason
Fabini _ went on a violent rampage at a Long Island bar that
required 31 police officers to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who faces third-degree assault charges, allegedly took
a swing at a woman and urinated in a sink in the women's restroom.
The league will come down on the players, but Parcells's wrath is
what both players should dread.
</P>
<P>
   In his younger coaching days with the New York Giants, Parcells
put up with Lawrence Taylor's off-the-field transgressions because
Taylor never allowed them to affect his play.
</P>
<P>
   In the twilight of his coaching career, Parcells is less
tolerant of those behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers will be dealing with quarterback Jim Druckenmiller's
rape trial, which is scheduled to begin Monday in Virginia.
Druckenmiller is accused of raping a Virginia Tech coed last March.
</P>
<P>
   5. Young quarterbacks: The focus is always on quarterbacks, but
with five taken in the first round of the draft, there are many
storylines. Couch will have the most pressure as the top pick on
the expansion Browns, but Palmer may try to alleviate that by
starting veteran Ty Detmer. Philadelphia is looking for someone to
juice their organization, so there will be pressure on Donovan
McNabb to step in and make an impact. Akili Smith will eventually
be the No. 1 guy in Cincinnati, another organization in need of a
boost. The Bears are hoping for the second coming of Steve Young in
Cade McNown, while the Vikings will break in Daunte Culpepper
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   6. Ricky Williams: The former Heisman winner will be under a
microscope from the start. Is he worth all of the draft picks Mike
Ditka surrendered for him? Ditka's decision will likely be analyzed
on a week-to-week basis. But the excitement level in New Orleans
should rival the days of Archie Manning.
</P>
<P>
   7. Life after Elway: This will be a common theme throughout the
season. If the Broncos fail to make it back to the Super Bowl, then
Elway's departure will be blamed. Most fans in Denver don't expect
another Super Bowl championship, but Bubby Brister could own the
town if he leads the Broncos back.
</P>
<P>
   8. The Jets: Many speculate that this is Parcells's last year,
but the coach hasn't said it, and he probably won't. The Jets have
the best team in the AFC East and probably in the conference. Two
years ago, little was expected of a team coming off a 1-15 season.
The opposite is true this year, where anything short of a Super
Bowl appearance will be considered a failure.
</P>
<P>
   9. Lawrence Phillips: Does this guy finally ``get it?'' as
Parcells used to say? Jack Bicknell, his coach in Barcelona, says
he does. He's got a rap sheet the size of Montana, but at age 24,
it's not too late for the former Nebraska great, who was the NFL
Europe MVP. If he signs with Oakland, San Francisco, or Green Bay,
it'll be interesting to see how good he is. It's one thing to play
against players who are either roster fillers or those who will
never make it to the NFL, but it's something else to excel in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have stepped to the head of the list in the Phillips
sweepstakes after Baltimore did an about-face this week following
an organizational meeting. The Ravens decided the risk-reward
factor wasn't worth it. A combination of Phillips's past off-field
problems, their past experiences with Errict Rhett, and the fact
that Phillips has already played 10 games entered into the
decision. To play, Phillips will have to pay big fines for his past
on-field and off-field conduct in his stints with the St. Louis
Rams and Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   10. The coach watch: Carroll may head this list. If his team is
healthy, he's expected to go deep into the playoffs. If he doesn't,
there will probably be a change made. There are also nine new
coaches in the league, none more prominent than Mike Holmgren in
Seattle. Holmgren, who also has the personnel responsibilities, is
expected to get the Seahawks out of the .500 funk and into the
playoffs. Others who bear watching are Ray Rhodes in Green Bay,
Palmer in Cleveland, Brian Billick in Baltimore, and George Seifert
in Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before all is said and done, the Patriots' new stadium in
Foxborough will likely soar beyond $300 million and not the
$225-million-$250-million figure being publicized. The Patriots are
trying to duplicate the Ravens' stadium as much as possible. The
Patriots don't want to cut too many corners and leave themselves
with a less-than-spectacular venue after years of playing in a
subpar facility . . . Combatting the spread offense was the focus
of the Dolphins' defensive drills at their minicamp last week.
That's because the Patriots used that formation to pick the
Dolphins' defense apart in a 26-23 win last Nov. 23. Drew Bledsoe
completed passes of 36, 46, and 49 yards en route to a 423-yard
passing day. Two of the long gainers were to running back Robert
Edwards and fullback Tony Carter . . . The 49ers might have done a
creative job with their salary cap in recent years, but they may
have been too creative. The league is looking into alleged cap
violations. The 49ers have had to pare about $20 million off the
payroll in the offseason, but also managed to sign running back
Charlie Garner to a two-year, $1.4 million deal as insurance in
case Garrison Hearst doesn't return from circulatory problems in
his leg . . . Nobody's worked harder this offseason than rookie
receiver Sean Morey of Brown and Marshfield. Morey continued on
Johnny Parker's workout program long after others stopped. Morey
feels he's improved his quickness working with Patriots speed coach
Mike Morris, and his ability to get off the line of scrimmage after
working one-on-one with Tebucky Jones. Morey is looking forward to
two-a-days at Smithfield. ``I want to go out every day and show the
Patriots what I can do to help them,'' said Morey, who not long ago
was a delivery man for Famous Pizza in Marshfield. ``I've had a lot
of guys helping me. This is a very tight receiving corps. Terry
Glenn has shown me some things about running good routes and, Briz
(Vincent Brisby), (Tony) Simmons, and Troy Brown have helped with
things, and Shawn Jefferson has taught me about what to expect and
how to act.'' Morey said he was a frequent visitor to Patriots
training camp when he attended Brown. ``I was just trying to pick
up some things,'' he said. . . . Chris Slade completed his third
annual football camp at Bridgewater State with more than 650 kids
attending. Several Patriots, including McGinest, Adam Vinatieri,
Ted Johnson, Jason Andersen, and Harold Shaw attended, as did line
coach Ray Hamilton. Slade said his knee is 100 percent after
offseason surgery. ``This offseason has been incredible for me,''
said Slade. ``I feel like a rookie again.'' He said his goal is to
get back to All-Pro status, and he thinks he can if he stays
healthy. ``No doubt, I want to play at an All-Pro level again. I'm
focused and I'm excited.'' A big part of Slade's success will
depend on the defensive coaches putting him in pass-rushing
situations and also the effectiveness of McGinest, who will rush
from the opposite side. ``When Willie is healthy _ and I think he's
getting pretty close to where he wants to be _ they can't double
team, and that springs one of us loose to make a play,'' he said.
``I want to rush the passer more because that's what I think I do
best. I think I'm a better pass rusher than you are a
sportswriter.'' We shall see.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miami's Rob Konrad, a fullback from Syracuse and North Andover,
recently finished his third minicamp in Miami. He said with 12
running backs, ``It's a little crowded, but there's a lot of talent
there and surprisingly there's no animosity and we're all
friends.'' Konrad, who will be used as a fullback and a wing tight
end, said he's impressed with the respect the players show Jimmy
Johnson. ``He's not as hands on as I thought he'd be, but he gets
so much respect from the guys because he's won the big game before
and he's convinced us that we have a chance to do that here.''
Konrad said that Dave Wannstedt, hired by Johnson as the assistant
head coach, has been more hands-on with the offense than Johnson .
. . The Dolphins may hold on to Karim Abdul-Jabbar, knowing the
Patriots would take him if they cut him. Teams have been trying to
trade for Jabbar and that could happen, but it's unlikely he will
be traded to the Patriots . . . The Patriots are in the process of
revamping their front office. Andy Wasynczuk, who has worn
virtually every hat imaginable, will soon be getting some help from
someone who will focus on player contracts and negotiations. The
Patriots have hired a stadium operations director and appear to be
setting up their organization similar to the Green Bay Packers, who
have three or four financial people who help out general manager
Ron Wolf, including former Woolf Associates agent Andrew Brandt,
who negotiates contracts . . . Within the next two weeks, the
Patriots will begin renegotiating contracts and also consider
cutting a veteran or two. Wasynczuk is close to getting draft picks
Tony George and Kevin Faulk signed, and he began talks on No. 1
picks Damien Woody and Andy Katzenmoyer Friday. When Bobby Grier
returns from vacation, he's expected to make a tough cut on a
veteran positional player. Jefferson, Willie Clay, Steve Israel,
Tony Carter, and Zefross Moss are all candidates. Jefferson,
despite being reliable, could go because second-year receiver Tony
Simmons could take his place as the deep threat. Clay's situation
appears safer, without anyone who could step in and play 16 games.
Israel is a good player when healthy, but the Patriots could be
impressed enough to hand the right corner job to Jones. As for
Moss, he came into the minicamp 5 pounds lighter than his playing
weight and talks between Moss's agent, Don Cronson, and Wasynzcuk
have given the agent no reason to believe Moss would go. ``He was a
very steady player for them last year and he's come back in great
shape,'' said Cronson. ``If that's what they're thinking they
haven't even given a hint. Zefross has another year to go on his
deal after this year, and I think after this season we'll probably
start talking about another contract.'' Moss seems to have a little
more left in him than previously thought . . . The Patriots signed
sixth-round pick Marcus Washington of Colorado to a three-year deal
worth $807,500. It includes a $57,500 signing bonus, which brings
the Patriots down to less than $100,000 under the salary cap . . .
The only free agent the Patriots have focused on is Terry Allen.
Wasynczuk insists it's not a done deal . . . Heath Irwin signed his
one-year tender offer of $429,000 after initially deciding not to.
Irwin, who was touted as the heir apparent to Dave Wohlabaugh by
Carroll before the draft, now appears to be relegated to a backup
role again.

HERE'S THE DEAL: AN EVEN SWAPS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There are two big summer races for 3-year-olds in the
East, both worth $1 million _ the Haskell at Monmouth Aug. 8 and
the Travers at Saratoga Aug. 28. But Sunday's $500,000 Swaps Stakes
at Hollywood Park is the one chance for the sophomores to shine in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Run at 1 1/8 miles, the Swaps will feature a battle among
General Challenge, Desert Hero, and Cat Thief, three veterans of
the war that was the Kentucky Derby. General Challenge ran 11th in
the Derby; Desert Hero 13th, and Cat Thief third. Cat Thief was the
only one to go on to the Preakness at Pimlico, where he finished
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge and Desert Hero both returned to the races in
the recent Affirmed Handicap at Hollywood, with General Challenge
prevailing by 2 lengths over Desert Hero. Cat Thief tried his hand
against older horses in the Met Mile at Belmont in May, but wound
up sixth.
</P>
<P>
   With the 3-year-old division wide open following the
career-ending injury to Derby and Preakness winner Charismatic in
the Belmont, the winner of the Swaps could go right to the head of
the class. Both General Challenge, who is trained by Bob Baffert,
and Desert Hero, who is trained by Richard Mandella, are working
well. General Challenge, a gelded son of General Meeting, authored
a blistering 6-furlong move at Hollywood Thursday, finishing in
1:09 4/5. The second fastest of 15 works at that distance was 1:12
2/5. ``For any other horse, I would say it was too fast, but not
for him,'' said Baffert. ``He does things I've never had any other
horse do.''
</P>
<P>
   Desert Hero, a son of Sea Hero, went 5 furlongs in 1:01 the same
day, while Cat Thief, a son of Storm Cat, had a 7-furlong drill of
1:25 1/5 for trainer D. Wayne Lukas at Santa Anita last week. David
Flores will ride General Challenge; Jerry Bailey will be aboard
Desert Hero, and Pat Day will handle Cat Thief. The thing to
remember about Desert Hero, who was unraced at age 2, is that the
Swaps will mark only his sixth career start, and, with the
exception of the Derby, in which he was bumped, checked, then
bumped again, he has never run a poor race (5-2-1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is sitting on two tigers, the filly Silverbulletday, and
the colt Forestry, both of whom won stakes last weekend, and the
outcome of the Swaps could determine when and where they race next.
Baffert will surely be represented in the Haskell, and, since he
requested stalls at Saratoga for the first time, he may have a
starter in the Travers, as well. ``A lot depends on what happens
with General Challenge in the Swaps,'' said Baffert, who could have
three bullets in the gun after Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Swaps, which will be shown live on ESPN from 5-6 p.m., is
the first of 15 telecasts in the ``NTRA Racing to the Breeders' Cup
Series,'' leading to the big day at Gulfstream Park Nov. 6. The
Haskell and Travers are also on the list.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to make it a truly big day, Rockingham Park has increased
the purse of the Aug. 1 Spicy Living from $75,000 to $100,000, and
added the $25,000 Rockette Stakes as the feature on the undercard.
The Spicy Living is for fillies and mares at 1 1/8 miles on the
turf, and is expected to attract local standout Lambana, heroine of
the $75,000 Rock Breeders' Cup July 4. The Rockette is for
3-year-old fillies going a mile on the grass. First run in 1968,
the Rockette became a popular race at the New Hampshire oval, but
it was discontinued in 1995 . . . Menifee, second in both the Derby
and Preakness before finishing eighth in the Belmont, is working
steadily for the Haskell. On Thursday, Menifee, a son of Harlan,
worked 5 furlongs in :59 4/5, the best of the day at Churchill
Downs. ``He's on target for the Haskell,'' said trainer Elliot
Walden. ``He worked super. He has really grown and physically
matured.''. . . Also working at Churchill Thursday was Vicar, who
went the same distance in 1:01 4/5. A son of Wild Again, Vicar was
highly regarded until he ran 18th in the Derby and 10th in the
Preakness. ``He's doing good,'' said trainer Carl Nafzger. ``He
will run in either the Haskell or Jim Dandy (at Saratoga Aug. 8).
Right now, we are looking very seriously at the Haskell.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free House, who won the Santa Anita Derby and Swaps at age 3,
and the Pacific Classic at 4, is on the verge of being retired. The
big gray, now 5, hurt his back while losing a stretch duel by a
neck to Real Quiet in the Pimlico Special May 8, and his
connections now say he probably won't make it back to the track.
``We will scan him again in a couple of weeks, but even if
everything is all right, it would take until nearly the end of the
year to have him ready again, and then there's nowhere to run
him,'' said co-owner John Toffan. ``I don't plan to race him next
year at 6.'' Free House, whose battles with the now-retired Silver
Charm were classics, ran 3-2-3 in the 1997 Triple Crown, and has a
record of 22-9-5-3, with more than $3 million in earnings. Not bad
for a California-bred, whose sire, Smokester, once stood for a
$1,500 fee . . . Bob Lewis, owner of Silver Charm and Charismatic,
and the No. 1 ambassador for racing, will be the featured speaker
at the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies at Saratoga Aug. 9. Among
those to be inducted are Lukas, who trained Charismatic.

WORLDS OF FUN ROLLER COASTER DERAILS AND DANGLES IN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS and LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Worlds of Fun's Orient Express roller
coaster derailed about 9:30 p.m. Saturday, leaving four persons
trapped in two cars that were dangling about 20 to 30 feet above
the ground. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Emergency workers at 11:30 p.m. rescued four riders who had been
dangling about two hours. They were being held in their seats by
only safety harnesses on the ride. The cause of the derailment had
not been determined early today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen persons were treated at hospitals after the
accident, according to Metropolitan Ambulance Services Trust
officials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department officials said at least one person was ejected
from the ride and another had jumped to safety. However, park
officials disputed that someone was thrown from the ride. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most serious injuries were treated at North Kansas City
Hospital, where three men were taken. A nursing supervisor reported
that one person was treated and released while the remaining two
were reported in good condition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their injuries were not life-threatening and were caused by
being ``tossed around'' on the roller coaster, the nursing
supervisor said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four passengers were treated and released at Liberty Hospital in
Liberty, Mo. They were complaining mostly of back strains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three persons were described in stable condition at the Barry
Road Campus of St. Luke's Northland Hospital. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fairly minor injuries,'' a nursing supervisor there
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two persons were being assessed at Shawnee Mission Medical
Center in Merriam, Kan., in suburban Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman there said their injuries were not serious. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If they came this far from Worlds of Fun, you can be assured
they're stable and they'll be OK,'' the spokeswoman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had to first secure the dangling cars with chains
before any attempts at a rescue were possible, said Brad Humston,
spokesman for the Kansas City Fire Department. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the cars are not real comfortable, but they are
calm in the position they're in,'' he said at 11:15 p.m. ``We got
real lucky here tonight.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Orient Express, a 20-year-old roller coaster, travels at
speeds of 65 mph and is a six-car train. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One eyewitness, Monica Danforth, 19, said she heard five huge
booms. ``It was so silent, then we heard people screaming for
somebody to help them,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another rider, David Aguilar, 27, from St. Joseph, Mo., said he
was waiting in line to ride about 8:30 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the very next ones in line, and they stopped it for 20
minutes,'' he said. ``They said they were having technical
differences, so the ride was delayed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Rick Rau, Worlds of Fun spokesman, temporary delays
happen ``at every ride in every amusement park in America.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sensors on all these big coasters, but they didn't
indicate any problems,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters hovered near the accident to shed light on the
rescue effort. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were 25 fire trucks and seven ambulances called to the
scene. The park did not close until its regular closing time at
midnight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Keller, the park's vice president and general manager
said: ``The Orient Express over the years has had an excellent
safety record. We'll bring in our own investigators and hire
external investigators, and we will work with local, state and
county officials. We just don't have a lot of information yet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the park's only fatality since it opened in 1973, 14-year-old
Ryan Bielby died after a fall from the Timber Wolf roller coaster
on June 30, 1995. Her mother received a $200,000 settlement in 1998
from the former Worlds of Fun owner, Hunt Midwest Entertainment
Inc., and coaster manufacturer Philadelphia Toboggan Co. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Accounts differ on how Ryan fell from the roller coaster. The
girl who was riding next to her said the seat belt and lap bar
failed. Officials said witnesses saw the girl kneeling or standing
in the roller coaster before falling. Soon after, the park improved
the safety devices on the rides. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The park has had other accidents over the years, including one
in 1990 when 38 persons were injured when two Timber Wolf trains
collided. &QL;

 &HT;    The Kennedys and us
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even before the writing of this most recent chapter,
the Kennedy family story raised more profound and unsettling
questions _ mainly about fate, fame and the cruel random irony of
life _ than any other story line in the American experience.
</P>
<P>
   Because we have been here before, the Kennedys and us.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the clan were assembling this weekend at their
Hyannisport compound for a family wedding. It was to have been a
time of joy and celebration, a time in which the family would be
renewed and extended. John F. Kennedy Jr., blessed like his father
with athletic good looks, charisma and wealth, was flying in on his
private plane with his wife and sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a plane crash set off the cycle once again. Family
members inside the compound find themselves trapped again in a
familiar nightmare, trying to handle immense personal grief while
outside, the world demands its right to intrude.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, even those outside the compound fence _ the
reporters, the cameramen, the tens of millions of Americans looking
on through those cameras _ are trapped just as surely as the
Kennedys are. Try as we might not to watch, not to intrude, somehow
we must and do.
</P>
<P>
   We play our role in their tragedy; they play their role in ours.
</P>
<P>
   It is all so strange.
</P>
<P>
   All through the day Saturday, as the nation awaited confirmation
of what seemed inevitable, the television set played endless images
of John F. Kennedy Jr., his father, his sister and uncles and
grandparents and cousins, familiar faces in familiar poses, too
often in moments of familiar pain. In many of the happier photos,
his mother, Jackie Kennedy Onassis, gazes at her son with touching
pride and love.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. had grown up under difficult circumstances, confronted
both by great opportunity and great burdens. Through it all, his
mother had made sure that when adulthood came, he would be equipped
with all the tools he needed to handle his unique status. By all
indications, she had succeeded remarkably well.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bit of godly grace _ for her and for us _ that Jackie
is not here to have experienced this anguish. To have seen this all
through her eyes would have been even more excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   The public interest in the Kennedy story is not a mystery. It is
not about celebrity or glamour or fame, or at least not just those
superficial concerns. It is simply human to be drawn to lives writ
large, to successes and calamities inflated as if for dramatic
effect.
</P>
<P>
   The story is made all the more powerful because the principals
are not actors who will walk away into the night when the final
scene ends, back into their regular lives. They are human beings
like ourselves for whom this is life, real life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no doubt at times _ and this is one _ it must feel more
dreamlike than real for the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   What can explain the repeated tragedies that afflict the family?
It is, depending on your personal understanding of such things,
simply another in an awful string of random circumstance, or a
thread of preordained doom running through the Kennedy family
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Because of our shared history, we Americans treat them as if we
know them, they are ours. But we don't, and they aren't. We can
share their grief, but we cannot know it. And that makes the
fascination grow even stronger.

 &HT;    Bush, Gore worlds apart on how to clean up Earth
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ During the 1992 White House campaign, President Bush
dubbed Al Gore ``ozone man'' because of the Democratic vice
presidential candidate's deep interest in global environmental
issues. The vice president has since toned down his environmental
rhetoric, focusing on urban sprawl, an issue with broader appeal.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, son of the former president, scored points with
independent-minded voters in his 1994 campaign for governor of
Texas when he declared that they didn't need Washington to tell
them how to take care of the state's natural resources. Then he
mistakenly shot a killdeer, a protected nongame bird, on the
opening day of dove season and had to pay a $130 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental issues have not figured prominently in the current
presidential campaign _ at least so far. Still, they are virtually
certain to assume a higher profile. Opinion polls show that the
public cares deeply about clean air, safe water and parks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the campaign issues du jour, which tend to be
decided on a state, local or personal level, environmental policy
is something over which the occupant of the White House actually
wields considerable influence. Moreover, the environment is an area
where the two front-runners, Bush and Gore, appear to differ
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the environment has been a second-tier issue during
his 4 1/2 years as governor. He has never delivered a major speech
on environmental issues, focusing instead on civil and criminal
justice, welfare, taxes and education. Bush nonetheless
acknowledged the likely role of environmental policy in the
campaign at a news conference just days before he announced that he
was definitely in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be a major issue,'' Bush said. ``I think the
environment's incredibly important for the 21st century for
America. I'll address Mr. Gore's positions if I run and if I'm
nominated and if he runs and if he's nominated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has offered few details about the environmental policy he
would pursue as president. During a recent swing through Washington
state, he said Pacific Coast salmon should be protected in a way
that would not require breaching dams on the Snake River. On global
warming, he says the scientific evidence is sufficient to warrant
concern, but he has not specified whether and how emissions of
carbon dioxide and other ``greenhouse gases'' should be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Bush has pursued a lighter regulatory touch, a
states' rights agenda, a cooperative approach with industry,
deference to private-property interests and aggressive action in
limited problem areas. He sponsored a resolution at the Western
Governors' Association in 1997 calling for increased federal
spending on land acquisition, as well as a boost in the states'
share of such outlays from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a
little-known trust fund financed by offshore oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's top legislative priority on the environment this year was
to curb air pollution from older industrial plants that are exempt
from current regulations. He pursued a plan under which companies
would be encouraged to voluntarily scale back emissions.
Environmentalists pressed for mandatory reductions. The governor
got what he wanted from state lawmakers, except for a provision
that triples fees annually for the largest plants if they do not
cut emissions _ an incentive that he did not seek but welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also helped craft an electric-utility deregulation bill
requiring older power plants to reduce emissions. In addition, he
moved aggressively, through legislation and administratively, to
secure improvements in a program intended to provide water and
sewer services to substandard developments along the border with
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's mantras is local control, but he has made an
exception for Austin. The Legislature regards the capital city in
Texas as too liberal, and so lawmakers have approved several bills
in recent years curtailing the city's powers to regulate
development and water quality. Bush did not push for the laws, but
he signed them. And four years ago, Bush signed a
private-property-rights bill to make it harder for state agencies
to impose regulations that reduce property values.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed signals
</P>
<P>
   The governor counts cleaner air as his biggest environmental
achievement. But much of the improvement is a result of the federal
Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, signed by his father and
implemented largely under President Clinton. The governor's
appointees to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission
opposed the federal government's tightening of standards for
ground-level ozone and fine particles, an initiative spearheaded by
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's record on wildlife and parks is also mixed. His
appointees to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission have slowed
the acquisition of parkland while working to improve management of
current holdings. The governor was silent on proposed state
legislation to increase funding for parks, and the measure failed.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush helped launch an effort to establish a privately funded
endowment for parks that has secured $4 million in cash and $10
million in pledges, and he backed a voluntary program that protects
wildlife habitat on more than 10 million acres of private land,
said Andrew Sansom, executive director of the Parks and Wildlife
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The governor opposed the listing of the Barton Springs
salamander as an endangered species, arguing that the amphibian,
found only in Austin's Zilker Park, was adequately protected by
state and local water-quality rules. That view was rejected by most
scientists and a federal judge. On the other hand, Bush vetoed
legislation this spring that would have reduced safeguards for
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to establish a marine reserve along the Gulf Coast
for the endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtle. But his administration
has stepped up enforcement by state game wardens of laws to protect
the turtles from shrimping.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush doesn't really seem to put environmental issues on his
list of priorities, much less high on his list of priorities,''
said Ken Kramer, director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra
Club.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry McBee, Bush's former conservation commission chairman
and now executive assistant to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, said the
governor backs full and fair enforcement of environmental laws and
demands solid scientific grounding for decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very quick study,'' McBee said. ``The governor's
record will tell the American people that balanced, reasonable
environmental protection will occur on his watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore softens approach
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no issue is more important to Gore than the environment.
But he has been careful so far in the campaign not to overplay his
hand. Gore is a card-carrying environmentalist, having written a
1992 best-seller, ``Earth in the Balance,'' an impassioned plea for
vigorous action to combat global warming, ozone depletion and
species extinction. He has been Clinton's environmental point man,
leading the anti-sprawl initiative, promoting stricter clean-air
standards and rescuing negotiations in Kyoto, Japan, on an
international climate treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president learned the danger of appearing too green in
the late '80s, when he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic
presidential nomination. Global warming and nuclear arms were
``exotic at best'' to voters, as he put it in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign Web site lists four priorities for ``America in
the 21st Century,'' and the environment is not one of them. The
four are education, faith-based organizations, prosperity and
fighting cancer. Don't expect his campaign rhetoric to include such
zingers as this one from his book: ``We must make the rescue of the
environment the central organizing principle for civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's no doubt the environment is at the top of his
agenda. His anti-sprawl initiative _ Gore likes the term
``livability'' _ seems to be resonating with soccer moms stuck in
traffic and other demographic groups. The vice president is pushing
a multibillion-dollar plan to preserve green space and water
quality, ease traffic congestion, expand mass transit and curb
low-density suburban development.
</P>
<P>
   He recently took the podium to announce the administration's
$7.8 billion plan to restore water flow in the Everglades, a plan
supported by Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, brother of the Texas governor.
That was a delicious political moment for the vice president. Not
only did he get to announce a pet project, but he got to do it with
the backing of someone named Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists have been disappointed that Gore has not done
more to push environmental initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the day Gore was elected vice president, he has sought to
moderate some of the messages in his book and has followed a very
balanced and in some respects disappointing environmental policy,''
said John Echeverria, director of the Environmental Policy Project
at Georgetown University Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bunch, chief counsel of the Austin-based Save Our Springs
Alliance, said Gore has not been aggressive enough in pushing to
protect endangered species and to set aside ecologically
significant lands. Coming from another perspective, author Gregg
Easterbrook, in his book, ``A Moment on the Earth,'' faults Gore
for dwelling on ``end-of-the-world locutions'' while downplaying
good ecological news. ``Someday even Vice President Gore will smile
when he talks about the ecology,'' Easterbrook wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A deep commitment
</P>
<P>
   But most environmentalists regard Gore as a longstanding ally.
Twenty years ago, as a member of the House, he co-sponsored the
Superfund program for cleaning up toxic wastes. Long before global
warming became recognized as an issue, he held hearings and
sponsored legislation on the subject. He authored legislation to
protect the stratospheric ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   The League of Conservation Voters, the political arm of the
nation's environmental movement, gives Gore a 64 percent overall
rating for his terms in the House and Senate. That means he sided
with environmentalists on 64 percent of key votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has traveled around the world to study environmental
problems, once spending a night in a small tent on a slab of ice in
the Arctic Ocean. He is comfortable with such technical concepts as
chaos theory, feedback loops and the first law of thermodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's book, written while he was a senator, traces his interest
in environmental protection to his childhood. He grew up learning
about soil erosion on the farm in Tennessee, and dinner-table
discussions about ``Silent Spring,'' Rachel Carson's
movement-launching book on pesticides, left a lasting impression.
In 1989, his son nearly died in a car accident, and writing ``Earth
in the Balance'' was part of Gore's effort to find broader meaning
in life.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president, Gore has weighed in to help protect
Yellowstone National Park from mining, to set aside red-rock
canyons in Utah and to safeguard ancient redwoods in California's
Headwaters Forest. And along with Clinton, he has deflected
numerous attempts by Republicans in Congress to roll back
environmental legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say that the vice president has played a mixed
hand pretty well,'' said Mike Casey, vice president of the
Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit watchdog organization. ``I
don't think anyone can doubt he has a serious commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   George Frampton, chairman of the White House Council on
Environmental Quality, said a lesson of the Clinton-Gore
administration is that an ambitious environmental agenda and robust
economic growth go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously the major supporter of stronger environmental
measures within the administration,'' Frampton said. ``He's
provided support for people in the administration and agencies to
do good things.''

 &HT;    Mormon church flourishing in Austin
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
is not exactly a household name in the buckle of the Bible belt,
where Baptists have cornered the Protestant religious market.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two decades, the Mormon church's growth has
taken off in Central Texas and across the state. In the past 10
years alone, the Mormon church in the Austin metropolitan area has
more than doubled its congregations and membership. Church
membership jumped from 6,500 in 1990 to 13,500 this year, and the
number of congregations increased from 12 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the church created a new stake in Williamson County, a
testament to the growing Mormon population. It joins two other
metro-area stakes _ geographical collections of congregations,
called wards or branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the economy is adding to the number of people who
are moving to the area,''' said Howard J. Nicholas, president of
the Round Rock stake. ``By the same token, we are experiencing
growth due to the number of new converts coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mormon missionary activity is brisk in Central Texas. Of the
1,200 missionaries sent to Texas, 200 of them are in the Austin
area.
</P>
<P>
   The building for the Round Rock Texas Stake, located in the
Woods of Brushy Creek, is expected to be completed at the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Several wards meet in one chapel to keep the congregations
numbers down _ usually no more than 500 people in each
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do that for the ease of managing the number of people,''
Nicholas said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops, who preside over congregations, and stake presidents,
who oversee several wards in a particular area, are volunteers.
Keeping the congregation small makes it easier for bishop's to have
personal contact with members and for church teachers, required to
visit each family in the congregation at least once a month, to
make home visits.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in the Hill Country has not been limited to the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bastrop started off as a small branch and now has become a
ward,'' said Mark Palmer, president of the Texas Oak Hill Stake.
</P>
<P>
   The stake recently purchased land in Dripping Springs to build a
new chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Marcos is one of our largest units in the area,'' Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is a part of the church's international missionary
efforts. His parents converted to the Mormon religion when he was
young. Palmer, who grew up in New Zealand, came to the United
States to attend Brigham Young University in Utah, where he met his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have six Texan children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the church has more than 10 million members worldwide,
growing at a rate of more than 300,000 new members a year. It is an
American-born religion founded by Joseph Smith in 1830. Smith is
said to have received the Book of Mormon from an angel named
Moroni. The Angel Moroni is believed to have been an ancient
American prophet who gave Smith a scriptural record that includes
an account of Jesus' appearance in the New World after his
resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its American roots, the majority of the church's
membership is overseas, where aggressive Mormon missionary efforts
have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, television and radio commercials
encouraging people to learn about the Book of Mormon have enticed
people to the faith. When people call the toll-free number for the
book, a missionary shows up to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are to visit within the first 24 hours from the time the
person makes the call,'' Nicholas said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Austin's three stakes had 200 converts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The church has been in Texas since 1843. It took more than 100
years after the arrival of Mormon missionaries for the church's
membership to reach 2,000. Today, Texas' 209,000 Mormons make up
the sixth-largest Mormon population in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Houston will be home to a new temple expected to open next
summer. Earlier this year, a Mormon temple was opened in Colinia
Juarez, Chihuahua, across the border from El Paso. Before that
temple, Mormons in that area of Texas were forced to travel to
Mesa, Ariz., for their required monthly temple visit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Austin area, local stakes bus Mormons to Dallas once a
month to the state's only temple, which was dedicated in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The temple, where Mormons conduct sacred ordinances and
covenants, is central to the faith. Here, baptisms are performed,
and couples are sealed in marriage to each other and their children
to obtain what Mormons believe is eternal life together. It also is
where they stand in for non-Mormon relatives who have died,
performing the ordinances of the faith, so that they, too, can
obtain eternal life with Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Building and giving Mormons access to temples is part of an
ambitious plan by the church's president, Gordon B. Hinckley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constructing temples on a scale never before dreamed of
to carry this work to its destined conclusion,'' Hinckley said at a
church conference in April.
</P>
<P>
   His goal was to have 100 new temples completed or under
construction before the end of this year. So far, the church has
exceeded that number by 18 temples.
</P>
<P>

   For the so-called media elite, George has been an easy punching
bag. Its architect is the nation's unofficial heartthrob, who has
no prior experience in the magazine business. Critics say George's
articles are so short and digestible, that they're forgettable;
little new information sticks to your ribs. It regularly features
models and movie stars in various states of undress. (Kennedy
himself disrobed once for the picture that appeared alongside that
famous editor's note.) Washington insiders say they rarely read the
magazine, don't know anybody who does, and feel perfectly well
informed without it. They say that George doesn't matter, that its
articles don't make news or waves on the cocktail circuit, that
it's not clear what it's trying to be.
</P>
<P>
   But mention the circulation -- 419,214 -- and the pundits pause.
Hmm. That's respectable. If nobody reads George, who are all these
readers? By comparison, The New Republic, a more respected
political weekly, sells just under 100,000 copies. The Weekly
Standard, which was launched the same autumn as George, manages
just half that. (By contrast,Vanity Fair, George's main glossy
competitor, leaves it in the dust with more than 1 million
readers.)
</P>
<P>
   So does this mean George is a player after all? Nina Totenberg,
legal-affairs correspondent for National Public Radio, says, ``I
don't want to sound culturally illiterate, but I've never read it.
I don't mean to sound snippy, but why should I?'' She says her
reading list is an exercise in ``triage,'' and George doesn't make
the cut. ``I spend my life feeling guilty about what I'm not
reading. George isn't one of the ones I feel guilty about.'' Does
the fact that so many Americans put George in their reading pile
tell her anything about the country's political appetite? ``I don't
think George magazine is a political magazine,'' says Totenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Washington Post columnist David Broder says George's
journalism lacks heft. ``I'm not sure I've ever ripped a piece out
of George magazine and stuck it in my files,'' he says, ``which is
what I do with magazines when something is exceptionally well
reported or gives me new insight to something I may be writing
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard anyone talk about a George piece,'' says
Michael Kelly, the editor of National Journal, a 6,500-circulation
political weekly, who says he hasn't read the magazine since he
perused the first few issues. ``It's pretty consciously not
serious. It's not intended for people who actually know anything
about politics or Washington....It's finding a new vehicle to
exploit the celebrity culture. That seems to be its editorial
mission.'' Kelly says George plays it so safe that there are no
surprises: ``It seems to be a magazine the point of which is to
reassure readers that James Carville really is James Carville and
Newt Gingrich really is Newt Gingrich -- with two new anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   The bashing rankles Kennedy. But he says he expected the early
obituaries, and he claims they've stopped. ``We're like the Conan
O'Brien of magazines,'' he laughs. ``We're still here.''

 Brill's Content 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr., was famous even before he left the womb, and
his 38 years in the media glare as the son of one of this country's
most legendary politicians has informed his ideas about how
politics and its players should be covered by his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On January 8, Kennedy sat down for an interview with editor in
chief Steven Brill and senior writer Abigail Pogrebin at the New
York headquarters of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines. Kennedy
explained why George fills a gap in political journalism and where
he thinks it has strayed. He didn't duck questions about how
personal his involvement is in the magazine, how he weathers the
carping of critics who say George is irrelevant, and why he thinks,
after three-plus years, he's proving them wrong. Edited excerpts of
the approximately 70-minute interview follow.
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN BRILL: What are you trying to do with the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KENNEDY, Jr.: When we started, there (had) never really
been a political magazine for the general public in America that
(had) been commercially successful. So, basically, the idea was to
create a lifestyle magazine that was grounded in politics and
American history for a broad audience, particularly with reference
to people who hadn't really been drawn to political magazines
before -- women and young people.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But what's a political lifestyle magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: The idea was to make it accessible, and to make it
visual, and to make it entertaining -- as opposed to something you
had to read in order to be literate in your job and conversant in
the environment that you work (in). Which I think the National
Journals or the National Reviews or The New Republics are, for the
most part. And that it has the visual cues of a lifestyle magazine
-- that it be visually driven, that there be photographs, that
there be color, that there be a sense of vibrancy and a kind of
contemporary modern look, that are evocative of a fashion magazine
or an Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, one of the big problems with political magazines
before (was) that they really had not changed the way that they
looked in 40 years. They're text driven, they're black-and-white,
they're written mostly by men, mostly for men. And they don't
reflect a modern sensibility, which is to try to grab people's
attention and say, This is interesting. Politics is interesting.
You should know about it. Come read our magazine.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So I read George this month, and I'm a 27-year-old middle
manager at Microsoft. Your perfect (reader), right? I read George
this month, and what do I know that I didn't know (before)?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's a difficult question. There might be certain
facts that are in the magazine that you didn't know. But the thing
that we really wanted to do was, for any well-rounded person,
politics is something one should be literate about, and people want
to be. Our idea was to make politics accessible to people who
wanted to have it close by, who wanted to read it and pick it up,
who could talk about politics with the same sort of informed
casualness that they might talk about the new movie coming out, or
a new record, or the NBA strike, or whatever. And the way that we
figured is the best way to do that is really through the people
that inhabit the political process, and to deal with them as
compelling personalities.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Give me an example of an article -- particularly in
recent issues -- that you think really is emblematic of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think that there are two main kinds of articles
(that) do that for us. One is a piece which has not appeared yet
(on Minnesota Democratic Senator) Paul Wellstone. (He) is not a
terribly well-known senator, but yet (was) probably going to run
for president. (He) is known as this kind of quirky eccentric
within the Senate, very liberal. And not much has been reported on
him. And he's had a fascinating life. He came from a very
interesting background, quite passionate, quite aggressive, and
feisty. He was a boxer, and that informs all his sensibilities. And
you read about him, and all of a sudden, instead of just a guy you
see who's in the Senate, you have a sense that you have a proximity
to him as a person, to his lifestyle, to his upbringing -- that you
didn't have before -- that I think only a magazine can do (and) TV
can't. Conversely, when you have familiar people who have a proven
ability to get the attention of the masses -- like a John Travolta
-- talking about politics, talking about what he thinks about it, I
think people are interested in that. Maybe not the Washington
cognoscenti, but I think that it's interesting for the kind of
people who we're going for to have that exchange. To hear
politicians talk about popular culture, (such as Ohio Republican
Congressman) John Kasich talking about his first Grateful Dead
concert, which (was) in an article that we had before, or Tony
Blankley (Newt Gingrich's former press secretary) on what it was
like to be a conservative who smoked marijuana in a university in
the late sixties.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You just mentioned the difference between the cognoscenti
and everybody else. There seems to be a gap, in terms of the
perception of this magazine. Washington insiders say this magazine
does not have the inside story; there's no buzz about it on Capitol
Hill. But when we talk to the people who subscribe to it, they like
it. Does that bother you that there's that gap? Is that gap
bridgeable?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We didn't want to be the National Journal. We've had
one politician on our cover, Newt Gingrich, and we've had an old
photograph of Richard Nixon. And when you have in your inaugural
issue Madonna talking about, ``If I were President,'' clearly it
had not been our objective to woo the folks in Washington. They
have The Hotline, they have C-SPAN, they have The (Weekly)
Standard, they have The New Republic. They have their own
discourse, their own conversations.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you care if they dismiss it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure. No one likes to have their hard work dismissed.
But I don't lose sleep over that. (We) are the largest political
magazine in the country now, which is, after three years, an
achievement. We have the numbers, and we have the audience that we
wanted to get. And if the two shall meet, great -- and I think,
occasionally, that they do. I also think George is a little bit of
a closet read. There's a sense of George, particularly (for)
younger staffers, younger people on the Hill, (being) a paradigm of
politics that they understand. And if they don't read it to get the
latest on the budget debate, that's fine. But if they read it
because it's (got) an interesting article on Wellstone, or someone
got an interesting thing on (Arizona Republican Senator) John
McCain, and there's some great photographs that have never been
there before, then I think we've done our job.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What do you think your biggest mistake has been,
editorially? What would you take back?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Pause) I think the magazine is more explicitly
political now. We maybe shoehorned, forced, the popular-culture
stuff in.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What's an example?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't want to name names. Well, why not? Demi Moore
was doing, I think it was Striptease, right? That was going to be a
big movie. She has an affair in the movie with a senator, I think,
or something like that, so there was, tangentially, a political
aspect to it. And so we had her on the cover talking about sexual
politics. And that's not what people really want to hear about from
her. You can't just take any movie, and you can't just take any
person, 'cause people smell when you're trying to give them a bait
and switch. So now we confine ourselves to what movies are dealing
with a political topic, sort of a compelling social issue. For
instance, A Civil Action. There were other, more glamorous folks we
could have put on the cover, but they weren't going to be about a
political movie. And we sort of made the choice: We're going to
confine ourselves to these things. And we're not just going to put
someone in a string bikini on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ABIGAIL POGREBIN: But when you say it's more explicitly
political now, do you mean it also has more politics?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah. Because what we've found from researching was
that people like the proximity of the popular-culture aspects to
it. They got it. A lot of our reader mail is people who said, I
never thought I would like a political magazine before. I never
bought one. I'm really starting to understand it. I appreciate the
nonbiased aspect of it. But they don't want too much pop-culture
stuff in there. Just like in Rolling Stone, they don't want too
much politics. They want mostly music and a little bit of politics.
In our magazine they want mostly politics and a little bit of
popular culture. And when the balance gets out of whack, I think it
(becomes) a problem. Which is good for me, because actually I know
more about the political world than I do about the entertainment
world.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Tell me about your own involvement in the editorial
process. If I look through a table of contents, how many of the
stories in there -- big or little -- would be your ideas? KENNEDY:
It depends. Some issues more than others.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In the current issue you've got (former) President Reagan
on the cover. Is that something where you said, Let's do that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: What really happens is, we have meetings with the
senior staff, and there are things that interest me, and there are
things that interest them, and we talk about them. And, in a kind
of Socratic method, we vet the ideas. And the ones that stand up
under that scrutiny, and the ones (for) which we have a writer that
can deliver it, get done in the magazine. There was always, from
the beginning of this magazine, a certain skepticism of me. Was I
(the) front man for this?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I'm asking.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Frankly, I'm not sure I want to dignify it with an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I didn't ask it directly.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) This enterprise has consumed almost now six
years of my life. It came at considerable, personal kind of risk.
There (were) a lot of people that would have loved to see this be a
farce, and it hasn't been. And I don't really care what people
think as far as my involvement. I care what the people who work
here think. And it works, and our readers seem to (think) we put
out a good product. So I'm as involved as (an) editor in chief
should be.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you read everything that's in the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Do I read every word? Mmm, no. I'll skim stories, and
I'll get very involved in some stories that I think are important,
and really line-edit (them). And other ones -- for instance, the
columnists -- I don't get as involved in, because they work with
separate editors.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What about on the business side?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm an owner, and not many editor in chiefs are
owners. And I think that since part of the mission of the magazine
is the challenge of Could you really marry the commercial
opportunities that magazines really need to live by and politics?,
(then) it's appropriate that I be the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You sound defensive.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, I'm not defensive. But I think it's quite important
that I proselytize, that I make the case for George.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And that includes making the case to advertisers?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: One ingredient it seems you've avoided is (what) I'll
call ``Your Tax Dollars at Work'' -- or anything about how the
government really works. Why doesn't a magazine about politics have
that kind of thing in the mix?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure I really agree that there isn't a
process aspect to the magazine because, actually, I think there is.
And particularly in the front of the book there is more (of that)
kind of the arcana of government and politics. The government-waste
thing is an old faithful, everyone does it. We do these top tens
every now and then that are sort of government excesses, or bad
laws, or failed bills, or what the do-nothing Congress didn't do.
But we don't want to fall back in a reflexive, antigovernment,
the-government-is-fleecing-you, politicians-are-fleecing-you
position. There's enough of that and we would rather sort of focus
on the things that are exclusive to us.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about investigative pieces? Do you feel that's
something you want more of?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, I would love more. I mean, as you probably have
found, we did one on Scientology in Germany. We've done a couple on
the drug industry. Investigative pieces are difficult. We tried to
do one on the Apollo Theater (in New York); it didn't pan out. And
I find that investigative reporters are a really unique batch. And
that for every eight or ten that you assign, maybe you get two that
really work and really deliver the goods. BRILL: I always tell
people that if I were running a journalism school, I would get rid
of the whole curriculum. And the only thing that would happen is
that the students would be written about. The best training for any
journalist is to have someone write a profile on you, and have it
published in your hometown newspaper. Then you understand
everything about journalism. If I'm right, that makes you the best
qualified journalist on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) Right.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: How do you think your life makes you -- or doesn't make
you -- a more sensitive journalist, or (does it just make) you want
to be more vengeful?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think, to be honest, it's an advantage and a
disadvantage. I have a perspective on politics that I would say is
unique, and one (that) I created a magazine around. There's been
enough written about my family that I have notions about
journalism, when it's practiced well and when it's not. However, I
think good journalism has a very strong point of view, and
downplays facts which go against you and plays up facts which
support you.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: A good piece should downplay facts that go against you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, like in a good argument. Like a lawyer makes a
good argument. You are trying to persuade, and you craft an
argument accordingly. So I think that my own experience has made me
probably more sensitive to a fairness issue. And perhaps the pieces
have suffered, in that it's fun to read a really harsh, mean piece
about somebody.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What (does) it mean to you that something is
nonpartisan or postpartisan, words that you have used to describe
the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think the current political imbroglio has indicated
that real people across America do not have the same investment in
partisan politics as people in Washington do. And I think that you
find people want solutions, people want government to work, they
want to feel good about politics. And they'll vote the person
rather than the issue a lot of the time. And I think that happens
increasingly. Part of the reason why I think the Washington
community maybe has not embraced George to the extent that readers
across America have (is that) there is a populist element to it. We
are interested in exploring the outsider sensibility about
politics. And that is kind of postpartisan -- or it's a lot more
nonpartisan than it is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What I heard a lot from the (political and media)
elite was, if (George) had a point of view it would have more edge,
it would count more, it would matter more. But the readers said
they like it.They don't feel like anybody is coming down on one
side, and they're tired of that. But it does also feel like it's in
no-man's-land. Does that bother you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It is something which is the essential challenge of
this magazine. I think a lot of people expected there would be a
brief flurry of mouthing about (being) nonpartisan, and then it
would turn into John Kennedy's soapbox. And it can't be that. The
way you address that is, your stories have strong points of view,
and strong sensibilities, but that you have a variety of different
ones in there. The thing that people really respond to the most is
that they do feel that they are not being led around by the nose.
And in terms of Washington, we get a lot of access. Maybe they just
think that we'll just be nice to everybody. But I do think that
they think that there is an element of fairness, which, given my
own experience, is very important.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Suppose the magazine assigns a piece about somebody, and
that somebody doesn't want to pose for a photo. Would you assign a
photographer to ambush that person?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It would never be necessary, because there's so much
pickup (photos available from agencies) of the people that we do. I
know what the question is -- would I assign a paparazzi? And it's
sort of a trite question, because you don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Let's see if I can make it a little less trite. Most of
the pickup you'd buy would be from those same paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you wouldn't buy one of those shots, or you would?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, I would buy them. I would get the best pickup that
was available that I could.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Even if it's (a) photographer who ambushed someone?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'm not a big moralizer about the paparazzi. I may not
like it, and it may be a difficult aspect of my life, but it's my
problem.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You don't begrudge them doing the job they do?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It's not something that I think is worth talking
(about). It's not a pressing public principle.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: If you were the editor of Salon, would you have reported
on the sex life of (Illinois Republican Congressman) Henry Hyde?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We may not have done it, but was I dismayed that it
happened? No. Because I think that any time there is an element of
hypocrisy lingering, it's interesting to read about it.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you would or would not have done it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I really don't know. For us to do it, it would have
looked weird. You know, it's inconsistent. There are obviously my
own family issues in which it looks hypocritical. It looks too
partisan. So would I have done it in our magazine? No. Salon is
obviously a magazine you know where they're coming from. They're
fighting that fight. So was it appropriate for them to do it? Yeah,
I think so. It's not as appropriate for us to do it.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: When you sat down to do a Richard Mellon Scaife
interview, (a lot of reporters called it) a coup. Everybody wanted
(to talk to the millionaire well known for funding right-wing
publications and think tanks). And some people have said that you
have a kind of Larry King style of letting people's words speak for
themselves, but not necessarily nailing them to the wall. Is that
something that is conscious?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm very flattered by the comparison. (Laughs) I
find interviews difficult, because I don't like to really do them,
present situation excluded, and I know, having done a few of them,
what makes me uncomfortable and what makes me feel noncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Which is what?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Which is sort of a sense that a reporter has an idea
already about what he wants this to come to. That you're not just
sitting down in a conversation and see(ing) where it will lead;
there's sort of a setup going on. And I just find the people I
interview are people whom I'm interested in. I worked in the Reagan
Justice Department during law school, I clerked for William
Bradford Reynolds in the civil-rights division. Not because I
agreed with him, but because I was just interested in how they
thought, which was obviously completely opposite to what I had
grown up with. So I just go in to an interview, and I just ask
questions that I am curious about. And, more often than not, it
starts out stilted, but, (as with) Richard Mellon Scaife, he just
felt comfortable, and he just talked. It's not my nature to be
inquisitorial; I think it is my nature to be curious. I'm thinking
about the people who read us. You're sort of being a proxy for
them.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Doesn't it drive you crazy to read the stuff that
belittles you and the magazine, when you're actually coming to work
every day?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, there's a lot less of it now than there was in
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Did you ever think, Why did I get into this?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, because I knew that was going to happen. I knew
that it would irritate people no end -- the supreme irony of me
going and joining a media conglomerate to be a journalist! And then
to have it kind of work fairly well? I mean, we're still in
business, you know?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you like to be liked
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't really like to be liked. I never look for
approval from the journalistic community. If it comes, great. But I
didn't really see that as the group that I had to answer to. And
then the more condescending it got, the more that I knew that I was
doing the right thing. But that has stopped now, I think. I mean,
we're like the Conan O'Brien of magazines. You know, we're still
here.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In your column in the (February) issue, you (wrote)
something about how the idea of politicians as role models is a
fraud. That's what you think?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No. I think that people don't think of politicians as
role models anymore, that there is an inherent contradiction. On
one side, we perpetuate the notion that politicians should be role
models, and on the other, we don't treat them as such.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Don't you think they can be, should be?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think they are, merely by doing what they're doing.
And if they have a marital infidelity or if they did something in
college that they wouldn't do 20 years later, I don't think that
makes them a role model. But I think for an industry now that has
been (as) demarketed as politics, who wants to go into politics now
anymore? People just roll their eyes, and I think that's really
sad. When my father was president, there were 30 people covering
the White House. There are now 3,000, and they're all chasing the
same rabbit. So it becomes very difficult to maintain perfection
under that kind of scrutiny. You're putting an impossible burden on
them -- and you're setting yourself up for a sense of failure about
the political system. And I think that that burden is unfair, and
it makes good people stay away from government.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: I've got to ask you one snide, condescending question.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, John Travolta, Tom Hanks,
Christy Turlington, Johnny Depp. You're getting the point, right?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Mmm-hmm. BRILL: Bruce Willis, Charlize Theron, whoever
she is.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Hey, she's on the cover of Vanity Fair this month, and
we had her first.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Well, okay, fair enough. My point is, if you take the
last year of covers, with all of the movie stars, that package
doesn't say this is a magazine about politics. Are you doing with
the magazine what people get frustrated and angry at politicians
for, which is doing something that's popular, that brings in a
crowd, and then, after the election, changing the message on them?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I started this as a business, and my objective is that
this be a real business. Because if it's not a business then
there's no point in doing it. And I don't shy away from that.
Having familiar people from popular culture integrated within the
political content of our magazine, that is the essence of what the
magazine is, which is that politics has migrated into the realm of
popular culture. And in order to maintain the attention and the
interests of Americans, or viewers, they have to use the same kind
of attention-getting device as popular culture, that politicians
have to become personalities, in the show-business sense. And by
virtue of the fact that there's been an explosion of media,
personalities have an opportunity to become political. And that's
really the germ of what George magazine is saying. I think we've
made, perhaps, an error on one or two covers. I don't want to
offend her, but Charlize Theron I think was arguably one of those.
We were doing a thing about American folklore, and she was
commenting about America. It would really be unsatisfying to me to
have some somber politician on the cover, and we gather dust in the
back of some newsstand somewhere. I mean, if I sell 180,000 copies
of a political magazine -- man, I am happy. And so I could do
something else, with some drawing of (South Carolina Republican
Senator) Strom Thurmond and sell 20(,000), and maybe I'm serious
and consequential in Washington. But if the people that I'm trying
to reach are passing me by, then that's a failure.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about Maureen Dowd's quote: ``Celebrity distorts
democracy, by giving the rich, beautiful and famous more authority
than they deserve?'' The idea that it's one thing to sell
magazines, but to give celebrities any sense of weight, (for
instance) what Pamela (Anderson) Lee has to say, is taking it a
step further than you should?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Maureen Dowd writes, as far as I can tell, mostly about
the personal, about celebrity, and about the personally trivial.
And it makes for interesting (reading). The reason why she's
interesting is because she writes about the most kind of
provocative personal points of people in politics. And so that
comment seems sort of freighted with contradiction coming from
where it does.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Should the media report about the sex lives of kids of
politicians?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It depends how interesting their sex lives are.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You really mean that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think it's a broad question. I think you should give
me a context.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Eleanor Mondale (the daughter of former vice-president
Walter Mondale and the subject of a gossipy February story that had
little connection to politics). That's the context.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Listen, I understand the irony in that story appearing
in George. But that's kind of a racy, fun story, and something that
I would read.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And if she calls you up and says, ``How can you, of all
people, publish a story like that?''
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'd say: ``Hey, man -- you know, I've been there. It's
a pain in the neck, but, you know, it ain't as bad as all that.''
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: Looking back on your famous editor's note (in which
Kennedy wrote about two of his cousins' marital problems and posed
tastefully nude for an accompanying picture), would you do anything
differently?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's almost one of (our) best-selling issues ever, so
I don't think so. Without reinterpreting the letter, because
hopefully the letter (spoke) for itself, though it was deliberately
oblique, I did that because that was something I wanted to say and
something that I had felt strongly about, which is, we judge
harshly people in the public eye for being human. The picture had
to accompany the letter, because otherwise the letter would have
looked like I was being judgmental. And the picture had to
accompany the letter because the picture exposed me to judgment.
And it was not an exhibitionistic thing. There (are) 40
photographers in Hyannis during the summer that photograph me
swimming (and the photos are) far more revealing. The reason I
(talked) about myself in the letter was just to reinforce (that) I
was not exempting myself from what I was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you came into the office and said I have this really
great idea, I'm going to write this piece and it's going to be
accompanied with a nude picture of me, (and everyone said), Great
idea, John.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: They were horrified. This is how I have to do it.
Listen, your magazine is obviously the product of some strong
opinions you have. And if a magazine is not reflective of one
person's soul, then it probably stinks. And sometimes, depending on
how I'm feeling, I just kind of let it loose. Otherwise, what's the
point, right? What's the point for me to have a magazine if I'm not
going to use it in some way that is personal?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You seem not overwhelmingly thrilled about being in the
public spotlight. Why do people keep saying that you're going to
run for office?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you think you ever will?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't have any immediate desire to. Obviously this
magazine brings you right up against politics, and I like that.
However, do I feel a frustration about being an observer, not a
participant, sometimes? Yeah, because that's my background, that's
what I have in my blood. But, yet, would I want to go in, with the
hell that would envelop my life? Not at this juncture of my life. I
just got married. I like my privacy.

<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr., was famous even before he left the womb, and
his 38 years in the media glare as the son of one of this country's
most legendary politicians has informed his ideas about how
politics and its players should be covered by his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On January 8, Kennedy sat down for an interview with editor in
chief Steven Brill and senior writer Abigail Pogrebin at the New
York headquarters of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines. Kennedy
explained why George fills a gap in political journalism and where
he thinks it has strayed. He didn't duck questions about how
personal his involvement is in the magazine, how he weathers the
carping of critics who say George is irrelevant, and why he thinks,
after three-plus years, he's proving them wrong. Edited excerpts of
the approximately 70-minute interview follow.
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN BRILL: What are you trying to do with the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KENNEDY, Jr.: When we started, there (had) never really
been a political magazine for the general public in America that
(had) been commercially successful. So, basically, the idea was to
create a lifestyle magazine that was grounded in politics and
American history for a broad audience, particularly with reference
to people who hadn't really been drawn to political magazines
before -- women and young people.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But what's a political lifestyle magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: The idea was to make it accessible, and to make it
visual, and to make it entertaining -- as opposed to something you
had to read in order to be literate in your job and conversant in
the environment that you work (in). Which I think the National
Journals or the National Reviews or The New Republics are, for the
most part. And that it has the visual cues of a lifestyle magazine
-- that it be visually driven, that there be photographs, that
there be color, that there be a sense of vibrancy and a kind of
contemporary modern look, that are evocative of a fashion magazine
or an Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, one of the big problems with political magazines
before (was) that they really had not changed the way that they
looked in 40 years. They're text driven, they're black-and-white,
they're written mostly by men, mostly for men. And they don't
reflect a modern sensibility, which is to try to grab people's
attention and say, This is interesting. Politics is interesting.
You should know about it. Come read our magazine.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So I read George this month, and I'm a 27-year-old middle
manager at Microsoft. Your perfect (reader), right? I read George
this month, and what do I know that I didn't know (before)?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's a difficult question. There might be certain
facts that are in the magazine that you didn't know. But the thing
that we really wanted to do was, for any well-rounded person,
politics is something one should be literate about, and people want
to be. Our idea was to make politics accessible to people who
wanted to have it close by, who wanted to read it and pick it up,
who could talk about politics with the same sort of informed
casualness that they might talk about the new movie coming out, or
a new record, or the NBA strike, or whatever. And the way that we
figured is the best way to do that is really through the people
that inhabit the political process, and to deal with them as
compelling personalities.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Give me an example of an article -- particularly in
recent issues -- that you think really is emblematic of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think that there are two main kinds of articles
(that) do that for us. One is a piece which has not appeared yet
(on Minnesota Democratic Senator) Paul Wellstone. (He) is not a
terribly well-known senator, but yet (was) probably going to run
for president. (He) is known as this kind of quirky eccentric
within the Senate, very liberal. And not much has been reported on
him. And he's had a fascinating life. He came from a very
interesting background, quite passionate, quite aggressive, and
feisty. He was a boxer, and that informs all his sensibilities. And
you read about him, and all of a sudden, instead of just a guy you
see who's in the Senate, you have a sense that you have a proximity
to him as a person, to his lifestyle, to his upbringing -- that you
didn't have before -- that I think only a magazine can do (and) TV
can't. Conversely, when you have familiar people who have a proven
ability to get the attention of the masses -- like a John Travolta
-- talking about politics, talking about what he thinks about it, I
think people are interested in that. Maybe not the Washington
cognoscenti, but I think that it's interesting for the kind of
people who we're going for to have that exchange. To hear
politicians talk about popular culture, (such as Ohio Republican
Congressman) John Kasich talking about his first Grateful Dead
concert, which (was) in an article that we had before, or Tony
Blankley (Newt Gingrich's former press secretary) on what it was
like to be a conservative who smoked marijuana in a university in
the late sixties.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You just mentioned the difference between the cognoscenti
and everybody else. There seems to be a gap, in terms of the
perception of this magazine. Washington insiders say this magazine
does not have the inside story; there's no buzz about it on Capitol
Hill. But when we talk to the people who subscribe to it, they like
it. Does that bother you that there's that gap? Is that gap
bridgeable?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We didn't want to be the National Journal. We've had
one politician on our cover, Newt Gingrich, and we've had an old
photograph of Richard Nixon. And when you have in your inaugural
issue Madonna talking about, ``If I were President,'' clearly it
had not been our objective to woo the folks in Washington. They
have The Hotline, they have C-SPAN, they have The (Weekly)
Standard, they have The New Republic. They have their own
discourse, their own conversations.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you care if they dismiss it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure. No one likes to have their hard work dismissed.
But I don't lose sleep over that. (We) are the largest political
magazine in the country now, which is, after three years, an
achievement. We have the numbers, and we have the audience that we
wanted to get. And if the two shall meet, great -- and I think,
occasionally, that they do. I also think George is a little bit of
a closet read. There's a sense of George, particularly (for)
younger staffers, younger people on the Hill, (being) a paradigm of
politics that they understand. And if they don't read it to get the
latest on the budget debate, that's fine. But if they read it
because it's (got) an interesting article on Wellstone, or someone
got an interesting thing on (Arizona Republican Senator) John
McCain, and there's some great photographs that have never been
there before, then I think we've done our job.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What do you think your biggest mistake has been,
editorially? What would you take back?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Pause) I think the magazine is more explicitly
political now. We maybe shoehorned, forced, the popular-culture
stuff in.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What's an example?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't want to name names. Well, why not? Demi Moore
was doing, I think it was Striptease, right? That was going to be a
big movie. She has an affair in the movie with a senator, I think,
or something like that, so there was, tangentially, a political
aspect to it. And so we had her on the cover talking about sexual
politics. And that's not what people really want to hear about from
her. You can't just take any movie, and you can't just take any
person, 'cause people smell when you're trying to give them a bait
and switch. So now we confine ourselves to what movies are dealing
with a political topic, sort of a compelling social issue. For
instance, A Civil Action. There were other, more glamorous folks we
could have put on the cover, but they weren't going to be about a
political movie. And we sort of made the choice: We're going to
confine ourselves to these things. And we're not just going to put
someone in a string bikini on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ABIGAIL POGREBIN: But when you say it's more explicitly
political now, do you mean it also has more politics?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah. Because what we've found from researching was
that people like the proximity of the popular-culture aspects to
it. They got it. A lot of our reader mail is people who said, I
never thought I would like a political magazine before. I never
bought one. I'm really starting to understand it. I appreciate the
nonbiased aspect of it. But they don't want too much pop-culture
stuff in there. Just like in Rolling Stone, they don't want too
much politics. They want mostly music and a little bit of politics.
In our magazine they want mostly politics and a little bit of
popular culture. And when the balance gets out of whack, I think it
(becomes) a problem. Which is good for me, because actually I know
more about the political world than I do about the entertainment
world.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Tell me about your own involvement in the editorial
process. If I look through a table of contents, how many of the
stories in there -- big or little -- would be your ideas? KENNEDY:
It depends. Some issues more than others.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In the current issue you've got (former) President Reagan
on the cover. Is that something where you said, Let's do that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: What really happens is, we have meetings with the
senior staff, and there are things that interest me, and there are
things that interest them, and we talk about them. And, in a kind
of Socratic method, we vet the ideas. And the ones that stand up
under that scrutiny, and the ones (for) which we have a writer that
can deliver it, get done in the magazine. There was always, from
the beginning of this magazine, a certain skepticism of me. Was I
(the) front man for this?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I'm asking.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Frankly, I'm not sure I want to dignify it with an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I didn't ask it directly.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) This enterprise has consumed almost now six
years of my life. It came at considerable, personal kind of risk.
There (were) a lot of people that would have loved to see this be a
farce, and it hasn't been. And I don't really care what people
think as far as my involvement. I care what the people who work
here think. And it works, and our readers seem to (think) we put
out a good product. So I'm as involved as (an) editor in chief
should be.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you read everything that's in the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Do I read every word? Mmm, no. I'll skim stories, and
I'll get very involved in some stories that I think are important,
and really line-edit (them). And other ones -- for instance, the
columnists -- I don't get as involved in, because they work with
separate editors.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What about on the business side?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm an owner, and not many editor in chiefs are
owners. And I think that since part of the mission of the magazine
is the challenge of Could you really marry the commercial
opportunities that magazines really need to live by and politics?,
(then) it's appropriate that I be the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You sound defensive.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, I'm not defensive. But I think it's quite important
that I proselytize, that I make the case for George.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And that includes making the case to advertisers?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: One ingredient it seems you've avoided is (what) I'll
call ``Your Tax Dollars at Work'' -- or anything about how the
government really works. Why doesn't a magazine about politics have
that kind of thing in the mix?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure I really agree that there isn't a
process aspect to the magazine because, actually, I think there is.
And particularly in the front of the book there is more (of that)
kind of the arcana of government and politics. The government-waste
thing is an old faithful, everyone does it. We do these top tens
every now and then that are sort of government excesses, or bad
laws, or failed bills, or what the do-nothing Congress didn't do.
But we don't want to fall back in a reflexive, antigovernment,
the-government-is-fleecing-you, politicians-are-fleecing-you
position. There's enough of that and we would rather sort of focus
on the things that are exclusive to us.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about investigative pieces? Do you feel that's
something you want more of?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, I would love more. I mean, as you probably have
found, we did one on Scientology in Germany. We've done a couple on
the drug industry. Investigative pieces are difficult. We tried to
do one on the Apollo Theater (in New York); it didn't pan out. And
I find that investigative reporters are a really unique batch. And
that for every eight or ten that you assign, maybe you get two that
really work and really deliver the goods. BRILL: I always tell
people that if I were running a journalism school, I would get rid
of the whole curriculum. And the only thing that would happen is
that the students would be written about. The best training for any
journalist is to have someone write a profile on you, and have it
published in your hometown newspaper. Then you understand
everything about journalism. If I'm right, that makes you the best
qualified journalist on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) Right.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: How do you think your life makes you -- or doesn't make
you -- a more sensitive journalist, or (does it just make) you want
to be more vengeful?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think, to be honest, it's an advantage and a
disadvantage. I have a perspective on politics that I would say is
unique, and one (that) I created a magazine around. There's been
enough written about my family that I have notions about
journalism, when it's practiced well and when it's not. However, I
think good journalism has a very strong point of view, and
downplays facts which go against you and plays up facts which
support you.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: A good piece should downplay facts that go against you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, like in a good argument. Like a lawyer makes a
good argument. You are trying to persuade, and you craft an
argument accordingly. So I think that my own experience has made me
probably more sensitive to a fairness issue. And perhaps the pieces
have suffered, in that it's fun to read a really harsh, mean piece
about somebody.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What (does) it mean to you that something is
nonpartisan or postpartisan, words that you have used to describe
the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think the current political imbroglio has indicated
that real people across America do not have the same investment in
partisan politics as people in Washington do. And I think that you
find people want solutions, people want government to work, they
want to feel good about politics. And they'll vote the person
rather than the issue a lot of the time. And I think that happens
increasingly. Part of the reason why I think the Washington
community maybe has not embraced George to the extent that readers
across America have (is that) there is a populist element to it. We
are interested in exploring the outsider sensibility about
politics. And that is kind of postpartisan -- or it's a lot more
nonpartisan than it is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What I heard a lot from the (political and media)
elite was, if (George) had a point of view it would have more edge,
it would count more, it would matter more. But the readers said
they like it.They don't feel like anybody is coming down on one
side, and they're tired of that. But it does also feel like it's in
no-man's-land. Does that bother you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It is something which is the essential challenge of
this magazine. I think a lot of people expected there would be a
brief flurry of mouthing about (being) nonpartisan, and then it
would turn into John Kennedy's soapbox. And it can't be that. The
way you address that is, your stories have strong points of view,
and strong sensibilities, but that you have a variety of different
ones in there. The thing that people really respond to the most is
that they do feel that they are not being led around by the nose.
And in terms of Washington, we get a lot of access. Maybe they just
think that we'll just be nice to everybody. But I do think that
they think that there is an element of fairness, which, given my
own experience, is very important.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Suppose the magazine assigns a piece about somebody, and
that somebody doesn't want to pose for a photo. Would you assign a
photographer to ambush that person?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It would never be necessary, because there's so much
pickup (photos available from agencies) of the people that we do. I
know what the question is -- would I assign a paparazzi? And it's
sort of a trite question, because you don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Let's see if I can make it a little less trite. Most of
the pickup you'd buy would be from those same paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you wouldn't buy one of those shots, or you would?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, I would buy them. I would get the best pickup that
was available that I could.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Even if it's (a) photographer who ambushed someone?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'm not a big moralizer about the paparazzi. I may not
like it, and it may be a difficult aspect of my life, but it's my
problem.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You don't begrudge them doing the job they do?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It's not something that I think is worth talking
(about). It's not a pressing public principle.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: If you were the editor of Salon, would you have reported
on the sex life of (Illinois Republican Congressman) Henry Hyde?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We may not have done it, but was I dismayed that it
happened? No. Because I think that any time there is an element of
hypocrisy lingering, it's interesting to read about it.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you would or would not have done it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I really don't know. For us to do it, it would have
looked weird. You know, it's inconsistent. There are obviously my
own family issues in which it looks hypocritical. It looks too
partisan. So would I have done it in our magazine? No. Salon is
obviously a magazine you know where they're coming from. They're
fighting that fight. So was it appropriate for them to do it? Yeah,
I think so. It's not as appropriate for us to do it.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: When you sat down to do a Richard Mellon Scaife
interview, (a lot of reporters called it) a coup. Everybody wanted
(to talk to the millionaire well known for funding right-wing
publications and think tanks). And some people have said that you
have a kind of Larry King style of letting people's words speak for
themselves, but not necessarily nailing them to the wall. Is that
something that is conscious?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm very flattered by the comparison. (Laughs) I
find interviews difficult, because I don't like to really do them,
present situation excluded, and I know, having done a few of them,
what makes me uncomfortable and what makes me feel noncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Which is what?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Which is sort of a sense that a reporter has an idea
already about what he wants this to come to. That you're not just
sitting down in a conversation and see(ing) where it will lead;
there's sort of a setup going on. And I just find the people I
interview are people whom I'm interested in. I worked in the Reagan
Justice Department during law school, I clerked for William
Bradford Reynolds in the civil-rights division. Not because I
agreed with him, but because I was just interested in how they
thought, which was obviously completely opposite to what I had
grown up with. So I just go in to an interview, and I just ask
questions that I am curious about. And, more often than not, it
starts out stilted, but, (as with) Richard Mellon Scaife, he just
felt comfortable, and he just talked. It's not my nature to be
inquisitorial; I think it is my nature to be curious. I'm thinking
about the people who read us. You're sort of being a proxy for
them.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Doesn't it drive you crazy to read the stuff that
belittles you and the magazine, when you're actually coming to work
every day?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, there's a lot less of it now than there was in
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Did you ever think, Why did I get into this?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, because I knew that was going to happen. I knew
that it would irritate people no end -- the supreme irony of me
going and joining a media conglomerate to be a journalist! And then
to have it kind of work fairly well? I mean, we're still in
business, you know?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you like to be liked
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't really like to be liked. I never look for
approval from the journalistic community. If it comes, great. But I
didn't really see that as the group that I had to answer to. And
then the more condescending it got, the more that I knew that I was
doing the right thing. But that has stopped now, I think. I mean,
we're like the Conan O'Brien of magazines. You know, we're still
here.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In your column in the (February) issue, you (wrote)
something about how the idea of politicians as role models is a
fraud. That's what you think?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No. I think that people don't think of politicians as
role models anymore, that there is an inherent contradiction. On
one side, we perpetuate the notion that politicians should be role
models, and on the other, we don't treat them as such.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Don't you think they can be, should be?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think they are, merely by doing what they're doing.
And if they have a marital infidelity or if they did something in
college that they wouldn't do 20 years later, I don't think that
makes them a role model. But I think for an industry now that has
been (as) demarketed as politics, who wants to go into politics now
anymore? People just roll their eyes, and I think that's really
sad. When my father was president, there were 30 people covering
the White House. There are now 3,000, and they're all chasing the
same rabbit. So it becomes very difficult to maintain perfection
under that kind of scrutiny. You're putting an impossible burden on
them -- and you're setting yourself up for a sense of failure about
the political system. And I think that that burden is unfair, and
it makes good people stay away from government.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: I've got to ask you one snide, condescending question.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, John Travolta, Tom Hanks,
Christy Turlington, Johnny Depp. You're getting the point, right?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Mmm-hmm. BRILL: Bruce Willis, Charlize Theron, whoever
she is.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Hey, she's on the cover of Vanity Fair this month, and
we had her first.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Well, okay, fair enough. My point is, if you take the
last year of covers, with all of the movie stars, that package
doesn't say this is a magazine about politics. Are you doing with
the magazine what people get frustrated and angry at politicians
for, which is doing something that's popular, that brings in a
crowd, and then, after the election, changing the message on them?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I started this as a business, and my objective is that
this be a real business. Because if it's not a business then
there's no point in doing it. And I don't shy away from that.
Having familiar people from popular culture integrated within the
political content of our magazine, that is the essence of what the
magazine is, which is that politics has migrated into the realm of
popular culture. And in order to maintain the attention and the
interests of Americans, or viewers, they have to use the same kind
of attention-getting device as popular culture, that politicians
have to become personalities, in the show-business sense. And by
virtue of the fact that there's been an explosion of media,
personalities have an opportunity to become political. And that's
really the germ of what George magazine is saying. I think we've
made, perhaps, an error on one or two covers. I don't want to
offend her, but Charlize Theron I think was arguably one of those.
We were doing a thing about American folklore, and she was
commenting about America. It would really be unsatisfying to me to
have some somber politician on the cover, and we gather dust in the
back of some newsstand somewhere. I mean, if I sell 180,000 copies
of a political magazine -- man, I am happy. And so I could do
something else, with some drawing of (South Carolina Republican
Senator) Strom Thurmond and sell 20(,000), and maybe I'm serious
and consequential in Washington. But if the people that I'm trying
to reach are passing me by, then that's a failure.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about Maureen Dowd's quote: ``Celebrity distorts
democracy, by giving the rich, beautiful and famous more authority
than they deserve?'' The idea that it's one thing to sell
magazines, but to give celebrities any sense of weight, (for
instance) what Pamela (Anderson) Lee has to say, is taking it a
step further than you should?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Maureen Dowd writes, as far as I can tell, mostly about
the personal, about celebrity, and about the personally trivial.
And it makes for interesting (reading). The reason why she's
interesting is because she writes about the most kind of
provocative personal points of people in politics. And so that
comment seems sort of freighted with contradiction coming from
where it does.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Should the media report about the sex lives of kids of
politicians?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It depends how interesting their sex lives are.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You really mean that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think it's a broad question. I think you should give
me a context.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Eleanor Mondale (the daughter of former vice-president
Walter Mondale and the subject of a gossipy February story that had
little connection to politics). That's the context.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Listen, I understand the irony in that story appearing
in George. But that's kind of a racy, fun story, and something that
I would read.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And if she calls you up and says, ``How can you, of all
people, publish a story like that?''
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'd say: ``Hey, man -- you know, I've been there. It's
a pain in the neck, but, you know, it ain't as bad as all that.''
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: Looking back on your famous editor's note (in which
Kennedy wrote about two of his cousins' marital problems and posed
tastefully nude for an accompanying picture), would you do anything
differently?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's almost one of (our) best-selling issues ever, so
I don't think so. Without reinterpreting the letter, because
hopefully the letter (spoke) for itself, though it was deliberately
oblique, I did that because that was something I wanted to say and
something that I had felt strongly about, which is, we judge
harshly people in the public eye for being human. The picture had
to accompany the letter, because otherwise the letter would have
looked like I was being judgmental. And the picture had to
accompany the letter because the picture exposed me to judgment.
And it was not an exhibitionistic thing. There (are) 40
photographers in Hyannis during the summer that photograph me
swimming (and the photos are) far more revealing. The reason I
(talked) about myself in the letter was just to reinforce (that) I
was not exempting myself from what I was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you came into the office and said I have this really
great idea, I'm going to write this piece and it's going to be
accompanied with a nude picture of me, (and everyone said), Great
idea, John.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: They were horrified. This is how I have to do it.
Listen, your magazine is obviously the product of some strong
opinions you have. And if a magazine is not reflective of one
person's soul, then it probably stinks. And sometimes, depending on
how I'm feeling, I just kind of let it loose. Otherwise, what's the
point, right? What's the point for me to have a magazine if I'm not
going to use it in some way that is personal?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You seem not overwhelmingly thrilled about being in the
public spotlight. Why do people keep saying that you're going to
run for office?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you think you ever will?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't have any immediate desire to. Obviously this
magazine brings you right up against politics, and I like that.
However, do I feel a frustration about being an observer, not a
participant, sometimes? Yeah, because that's my background, that's
what I have in my blood. But, yet, would I want to go in, with the
hell that would envelop my life? Not at this juncture of my life. I
just got married. I like my privacy.

 &HT;    Kennedys' tragic saga comes full circle, on TV again
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He was part of the first national tragedy that America
gathered around the TV to mourn, his chubby 3-year-old hand frozen
forever in our collective memories as it saluted his father's
passing casket.
</P>
<P>
   So televised tragedy came full circle Saturday when all the
networks broke into their regular programming to bring us, almost
36 years later and virtually without break, what could well be the
tragic loss of John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   TV brought it to us, and we watched, because John Jr. felt like
one of the last genuine links both to another time and to our
unofficial royalty. As much as watching the news about Kennedy, it
was as if we were watching everything Kennedy represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name has magic. (The family's) opponents may not like it,
but it's a fact,'' said CBS' Dan Rather. ``The pictures of him as a
little one, those images are part of American history, the legacy,
the mystique of Camelot, and John F. Kennedy Jr. is the inheritor
of the myth and legend of Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Peter Jennings noted that children of other presidents
haven't captured the public imagination as Kennedy has, and
wondered aloud why, especially since he was a public figure
``better known for his glamour than his substance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything comes together at this moment,'' said Time
correspondent Hugh Sidey. ``The legend of President Kennedy, the
legend of Jackie Onassis. Then you have the boy who's survived all
this tragedy, a particularly handsome and engaging person, and all
the other tragedy in this family, and it all comes to bear on him.
Has there ever been anything in our history like it?''
</P>
<P>
   The weight of that history seemed to temper much of TV's
coverage with a kind of reverent discretion, rather than the
hyperventilating that greeted the similarly sudden tragedy
surrounding Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is trying to be cautious; no one is wanting to make a
mistake,'' said CBS correspondent Bob Orr. ``While they all fear
the worst-case scenario, I don't think anyone wants to be the first
to confirm this news.''
</P>
<P>
   Into the evening, when it remained unclear what had happened to
Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren
Bessette, CNN's Bernard Shaw had to remind Evan Thomas, Newsweek
assistant managing editor, who was talking to Shaw by phone, to
refer to Kennedy in present, not past, tense.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the nonstop coverage forced broadcasters to talk when
there really was nothing to say. Newsweek's Jonathan Alter on NBC
relayed, by phone, his recollections of Kennedy's ``uncanny ability
to search out and find a sense of normality in a life that was
anything but.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Walters told ABC's Jennings of the time she tried, at
Princess Diana's request, to arrange a date between the two. The E!
Entertainment channel got into the act with its version of Kennedy
coverage _ footage of his youth, his dates with actress Darryl
Hannah, the glamorous events he and his wife attended.
</P>
<P>
   As networks stuck to full coverage, the crash wreaked havoc with
programming schedules. CNN rushed to produce a ``Larry King Live''
at 9 p.m. CBS created a live ``48 Hours.'' ABC made plans to update
tonight's ``20/20.'' The British Open was bounced from ABC to ESPN.
As a show of respect, A&AMP;E, at the last minute, pulled its
``Investigative Reports,'' program scheduled for 4 p.m. _ an
examination of Sen. Ted Kennedy's involvement in Mary Jo Kopechne's
death at Chappaquiddick 30 years ago this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of the missing plane began, as most unfolding stories
do, with few facts and much speculation _ a potentially dangerous
combination when it comes to live television news.
</P>
<P>
   And as the day went on, the best coverage came from the
broadcasters who tempered their reports with repeated warnings that
nothing had been confirmed other than the fact that Kennedy's plane
had disappeared en route to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   With no footage to air for much of the time, the networks that
broke into regular programming and stayed with the story all day
resorted to graphics of the Piper Saratoga that Kennedy had been
piloting and reports from the Kennedy family compound in
Hyannisport and from the New Jersey airport where Kennedy had taken
off.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually there were helicopters filming helicopters hovering
over the choppy waters and sunbathers on Martha's Vineyard beaches.
At its worst, weathercasters were explaining the meaning of
``haze,'' which may have been a factor as Kennedy's plane was
attempting to land.
</P>
<P>
   Rather was doing what he is known for doing _ emoting. He was
misty-eyed recounting meetings with Kennedy, including a recent
exchange in an Upper East Side cafe in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy was leaving, Rather said, he walked by Rather's table
and greeted him with a ``smashing smile that could light up a room
or, for that matter, an area code.'' Then, said Rather, his voice
breaking and eyes tearing, ``he went away. ... That's what
(Kennedy) was like.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, TV and radio stations led newscasts with reports of
the search for the missing plane. Kennedy's disappearance topped
French TV news Saturday with reports on the search, profiles of
Kennedy's life and special reports devoted to the Kennedys, one
about President Kennedy's death by Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the British Broadcasting Corp. led its TV afternoon
news with a report of the plane's disappearance, while the BBC's
Internet site said the Kennedy family ``could be facing another
tragedy, the latest in a long history, which has become known as
the curse of the Kennedys.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian state TV led with the story, using the photo of
``John-John'' saluting his father's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the independent NTV television carried news of the
search, accompanied by footage of Kennedy meeting President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And in Israel, correspondents traveling with Prime Minister Ehud
Barak during his trip to the United States were asked by local
stations about the fate of Kennedy and his wife.

<HEADLINE>
JFK JR.'S GRACEFUL, UNDERSTATED LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Handsome. Gentle. Raised right, against astronomical odds.
Graceful in an era of grunge. Understated in an age of over-the-top
celebrity. Hemmed in by history but never defeated by it.
Protected, from age 3 on, by a lioness of a mother.
</P>
<P>
   John Jr. lived a life so ironic it went beyond irony. His crafty
paternal grandfather, smarting from immigrant slights, unable to
settle for winning his varsity letter at Harvard as a
saloonkeeper's son, erected with guile and nerve and fabulous
amounts of money a publicity machine that first celebrated, then at
times seemed to devour, his offspring. But floating above the sea
of journalistic dross that lapped at the clay feet of idols
relentlessly erected by the Old Man, the grandson prevailed. In his
own way. John F. Kennedy Jr. had a life. His own life. His way.
</P>
<P>
   Even his disappearance in a plane over the sea, an echo of the
plane crash deaths of an uncle and an aunt he only heard about, had
something clean and graceful and peaceful about it. At least it
wasn't some ugly little man pulling a gun to settle some demonic
grievance against the myth that represented the closest thing
America has ever had to a royal family. The modern world of media
is simply not big enough to afford privacy and space and serenity
to the likes of John Jr. Mama, don't raise your sons to be
Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   He was the male Garbo of this age. Like her, he chose New York,
a city so crowded, so confusing, that he could recede from
Manhattan's teeming sidewalks. With dark glasses and a baseball
cap, his German shepherd loping alongside, John had the freedom of
the streets. Stalked by paparazzi, he submitted calmly to the
importuning of a world ever desperate to profit by capturing his
image.
</P>
<P>
   As the media moths flitted about the family flame, he played his
part so gracefully it became unremarkable. In a family scorched by
revisionist journalistic exploitation, he seemed to have learned
innately the maxim voiced by another relentlessly pursued scion,
Henry Ford: ``Never complain, never explain.''
</P>
<P>
   In his professional choice, he went over to the enemy. He became
a journalist, in a sense. He went over to the other side and
prospered at it, in a sense beating the pursuers at their own game.
By founding George magazine, he created his own vehicle for playing
the game in which he had been a pawn. From pawn to publisher. That
had to be a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   When he was just out of college, a son bedeviled by the demons
that made headlines out of his relatives, John was intrigued by
journalism. At one point in the '70s, when I was the editor running
the Globe newsroom, I got a call from Dick Goodwin, his father's
speechwriter and mother's counselor. Would it be OK, Goodwin
inquired guardedly, if John Jr. came to work for you as a reporter,
to learn the biz?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it would be OK. But it never happened. I don't know for
certain, but it had to have occurred to Goodwin and John and his
mother that things had gone too far for a young Kennedy to adopt
the mantle of ordinariness that is essential to be a neutral
recorder of small events, the starting point for any beginning
journalistic career.
</P>
<P>
   How can you cover some routine event, your notebook blank, your
ballpoint poised, and the cameras swivel back to you, when you're
trying to lose yourself in the herd? In any event, he went to law
school. Kept taking a stab at passing the bar exam. But lawyering
would have been just as unavailing, given his total lack of privacy
whenever he stepped out of his apartment elevator.
</P>
<P>
   So he became a publisher of a fluffy-concept magazine that
futzed around in the very worlds he was trapped in, a Kennedy fly
in journalistic amber. He couldn't be just another employee, so he
made himself a boss, and made it work. Someone I know helped out as
he was refining the concept, an attempt to give politics the next
turn of the screw, yanking the game into the realm of postpartisan
politics, in which lifestyle repudiated the rules and customs of
the Old Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked John. He was a smart guy in a way you wouldn't know
from just reading what's written about him. He was trying to live a
life, as best he could, without complaining. I sat with him one day
in his office, with his feet up on his desk, the dog lying
alongside, John opening his mail. He kept slitting open envelopes,
and all this unbelievable stuff kept spilling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would John come to tea at the Plaza with Princess so-and-so?
Would John serve as honorary chairman of this charitable ball, or
that benefit? Want to be in my movie? Such-and-such magazine wanted
to do a photo shoot and promised him veto of the cover shot. He
opened one envelope and said, `Hey, Nick, wanna go to the Knicks
game tonight? Here's two sideline seats.' I could have lived
fabulously for a year on the invitations that spilled out on his
desk from just one morning's mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedys and magazines. Jack and Jackie on the covers of a
thousand glossy publications. John Jr. saddled with that cheezy
People headline ``The sexiest man alive'' after his father's memory
had been pilloried for affairs relentlessly speculated upon by the
insatiable tabloid culture.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedys and islands. Thirty years after Chappaquiddick, another
Kennedy has an accident in Martha's Vineyard Sound. Another summer
weekend event gone horribly wrong. ``The Kennedy curse,'' muttered
Daniel Shore on NPR's Saturday morning show, voicing the newsroom
cliche that has galvanized media types since his father was shot
down in Dallas. I was sent to Chappaquiddick the morning after, a
young reporter for the Associated Press, when the world descended
upon Edgartown. Bad news for a Kennedy was good news for the media.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedys and airplanes. His uncle Joe, the one the Old Man
wanted to be president, perished volunteering to pilot a World War
II bomber mission. His aunt Kathleen, the apple of the Old Man's
eye, died in another crash. Teddy fell out of the sky in a '64
plane crash but survived and has a bad back still to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and Bobby you know all about. The other nephews and cousins
of a hard-driving, hard-living clan. The papers will be listing
their tragedies in endless detail. But the family kept soldiering
on. And this will be no different. Teddy overcame Chappaquiddick,
crafting a Senate career unmatched by his brothers, plowing on,
fighting the good fight. John Jr. joins the pantheon. A prince lost
at sea.
</P>
<P>
   How could a guy like him be forgotten? That won't happen.

shaken the ways that Americans view and use clothing, so much so
that cast-off clothes have become the flotsam of
turn-of-the-century affluence. In 1998, Americans bought 17.2
billion articles of clothing and gave the Salvation Army alone
several hundred million pieces, well over 100,000 tons. The glut is
a boon to the many charities like the Salvation Army that sort and
sell old clothes. While clothes have become relatively cheap, the

 Brill's Content 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr., was famous even before he left the womb, and
his 38 years in the media glare as the son of one of this country's
most legendary politicians has informed his ideas about how
politics and its players should be covered by his magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On January 8, Kennedy sat down for an interview with editor in
chief Steven Brill and senior writer Abigail Pogrebin at the New
York headquarters of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines. Kennedy
explained why George fills a gap in political journalism and where
he thinks it has strayed. He didn't duck questions about how
personal his involvement is in the magazine, how he weathers the
carping of critics who say George is irrelevant, and why he thinks,
after three-plus years, he's proving them wrong. Edited excerpts of
the approximately 70-minute interview follow.
</P>
<P>
   STEVEN BRILL: What are you trying to do with the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN KENNEDY, Jr.: When we started, there (had) never really
been a political magazine for the general public in America that
(had) been commercially successful. So, basically, the idea was to
create a lifestyle magazine that was grounded in politics and
American history for a broad audience, particularly with reference
to people who hadn't really been drawn to political magazines
before -- women and young people.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But what's a political lifestyle magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: The idea was to make it accessible, and to make it
visual, and to make it entertaining -- as opposed to something you
had to read in order to be literate in your job and conversant in
the environment that you work (in). Which I think the National
Journals or the National Reviews or The New Republics are, for the
most part. And that it has the visual cues of a lifestyle magazine
-- that it be visually driven, that there be photographs, that
there be color, that there be a sense of vibrancy and a kind of
contemporary modern look, that are evocative of a fashion magazine
or an Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, one of the big problems with political magazines
before (was) that they really had not changed the way that they
looked in 40 years. They're text driven, they're black-and-white,
they're written mostly by men, mostly for men. And they don't
reflect a modern sensibility, which is to try to grab people's
attention and say, This is interesting. Politics is interesting.
You should know about it. Come read our magazine.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So I read George this month, and I'm a 27-year-old middle
manager at Microsoft. Your perfect (reader), right? I read George
this month, and what do I know that I didn't know (before)?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's a difficult question. There might be certain
facts that are in the magazine that you didn't know. But the thing
that we really wanted to do was, for any well-rounded person,
politics is something one should be literate about, and people want
to be. Our idea was to make politics accessible to people who
wanted to have it close by, who wanted to read it and pick it up,
who could talk about politics with the same sort of informed
casualness that they might talk about the new movie coming out, or
a new record, or the NBA strike, or whatever. And the way that we
figured is the best way to do that is really through the people
that inhabit the political process, and to deal with them as
compelling personalities.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Give me an example of an article -- particularly in
recent issues -- that you think really is emblematic of the
mission.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think that there are two main kinds of articles
(that) do that for us. One is a piece which has not appeared yet
(on Minnesota Democratic Senator) Paul Wellstone. (He) is not a
terribly well-known senator, but yet (was) probably going to run
for president. (He) is known as this kind of quirky eccentric
within the Senate, very liberal. And not much has been reported on
him. And he's had a fascinating life. He came from a very
interesting background, quite passionate, quite aggressive, and
feisty. He was a boxer, and that informs all his sensibilities. And
you read about him, and all of a sudden, instead of just a guy you
see who's in the Senate, you have a sense that you have a proximity
to him as a person, to his lifestyle, to his upbringing -- that you
didn't have before -- that I think only a magazine can do (and) TV
can't. Conversely, when you have familiar people who have a proven
ability to get the attention of the masses -- like a John Travolta
-- talking about politics, talking about what he thinks about it, I
think people are interested in that. Maybe not the Washington
cognoscenti, but I think that it's interesting for the kind of
people who we're going for to have that exchange. To hear
politicians talk about popular culture, (such as Ohio Republican
Congressman) John Kasich talking about his first Grateful Dead
concert, which (was) in an article that we had before, or Tony
Blankley (Newt Gingrich's former press secretary) on what it was
like to be a conservative who smoked marijuana in a university in
the late sixties.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You just mentioned the difference between the cognoscenti
and everybody else. There seems to be a gap, in terms of the
perception of this magazine. Washington insiders say this magazine
does not have the inside story; there's no buzz about it on Capitol
Hill. But when we talk to the people who subscribe to it, they like
it. Does that bother you that there's that gap? Is that gap
bridgeable?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We didn't want to be the National Journal. We've had
one politician on our cover, Newt Gingrich, and we've had an old
photograph of Richard Nixon. And when you have in your inaugural
issue Madonna talking about, ``If I were President,'' clearly it
had not been our objective to woo the folks in Washington. They
have The Hotline, they have C-SPAN, they have The (Weekly)
Standard, they have The New Republic. They have their own
discourse, their own conversations.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you care if they dismiss it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure. No one likes to have their hard work dismissed.
But I don't lose sleep over that. (We) are the largest political
magazine in the country now, which is, after three years, an
achievement. We have the numbers, and we have the audience that we
wanted to get. And if the two shall meet, great -- and I think,
occasionally, that they do. I also think George is a little bit of
a closet read. There's a sense of George, particularly (for)
younger staffers, younger people on the Hill, (being) a paradigm of
politics that they understand. And if they don't read it to get the
latest on the budget debate, that's fine. But if they read it
because it's (got) an interesting article on Wellstone, or someone
got an interesting thing on (Arizona Republican Senator) John
McCain, and there's some great photographs that have never been
there before, then I think we've done our job.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What do you think your biggest mistake has been,
editorially? What would you take back?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Pause) I think the magazine is more explicitly
political now. We maybe shoehorned, forced, the popular-culture
stuff in.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What's an example?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't want to name names. Well, why not? Demi Moore
was doing, I think it was Striptease, right? That was going to be a
big movie. She has an affair in the movie with a senator, I think,
or something like that, so there was, tangentially, a political
aspect to it. And so we had her on the cover talking about sexual
politics. And that's not what people really want to hear about from
her. You can't just take any movie, and you can't just take any
person, 'cause people smell when you're trying to give them a bait
and switch. So now we confine ourselves to what movies are dealing
with a political topic, sort of a compelling social issue. For
instance, A Civil Action. There were other, more glamorous folks we
could have put on the cover, but they weren't going to be about a
political movie. And we sort of made the choice: We're going to
confine ourselves to these things. And we're not just going to put
someone in a string bikini on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   ABIGAIL POGREBIN: But when you say it's more explicitly
political now, do you mean it also has more politics?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah. Because what we've found from researching was
that people like the proximity of the popular-culture aspects to
it. They got it. A lot of our reader mail is people who said, I
never thought I would like a political magazine before. I never
bought one. I'm really starting to understand it. I appreciate the
nonbiased aspect of it. But they don't want too much pop-culture
stuff in there. Just like in Rolling Stone, they don't want too
much politics. They want mostly music and a little bit of politics.
In our magazine they want mostly politics and a little bit of
popular culture. And when the balance gets out of whack, I think it
(becomes) a problem. Which is good for me, because actually I know
more about the political world than I do about the entertainment
world.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Tell me about your own involvement in the editorial
process. If I look through a table of contents, how many of the
stories in there -- big or little -- would be your ideas? KENNEDY:
It depends. Some issues more than others.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In the current issue you've got (former) President Reagan
on the cover. Is that something where you said, Let's do that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: What really happens is, we have meetings with the
senior staff, and there are things that interest me, and there are
things that interest them, and we talk about them. And, in a kind
of Socratic method, we vet the ideas. And the ones that stand up
under that scrutiny, and the ones (for) which we have a writer that
can deliver it, get done in the magazine. There was always, from
the beginning of this magazine, a certain skepticism of me. Was I
(the) front man for this?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I'm asking.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Frankly, I'm not sure I want to dignify it with an
answer.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: That's why I didn't ask it directly.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) This enterprise has consumed almost now six
years of my life. It came at considerable, personal kind of risk.
There (were) a lot of people that would have loved to see this be a
farce, and it hasn't been. And I don't really care what people
think as far as my involvement. I care what the people who work
here think. And it works, and our readers seem to (think) we put
out a good product. So I'm as involved as (an) editor in chief
should be.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you read everything that's in the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Do I read every word? Mmm, no. I'll skim stories, and
I'll get very involved in some stories that I think are important,
and really line-edit (them). And other ones -- for instance, the
columnists -- I don't get as involved in, because they work with
separate editors.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: What about on the business side?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm an owner, and not many editor in chiefs are
owners. And I think that since part of the mission of the magazine
is the challenge of Could you really marry the commercial
opportunities that magazines really need to live by and politics?,
(then) it's appropriate that I be the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You sound defensive.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, I'm not defensive. But I think it's quite important
that I proselytize, that I make the case for George.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And that includes making the case to advertisers?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: One ingredient it seems you've avoided is (what) I'll
call ``Your Tax Dollars at Work'' -- or anything about how the
government really works. Why doesn't a magazine about politics have
that kind of thing in the mix?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm not sure I really agree that there isn't a
process aspect to the magazine because, actually, I think there is.
And particularly in the front of the book there is more (of that)
kind of the arcana of government and politics. The government-waste
thing is an old faithful, everyone does it. We do these top tens
every now and then that are sort of government excesses, or bad
laws, or failed bills, or what the do-nothing Congress didn't do.
But we don't want to fall back in a reflexive, antigovernment,
the-government-is-fleecing-you, politicians-are-fleecing-you
position. There's enough of that and we would rather sort of focus
on the things that are exclusive to us.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about investigative pieces? Do you feel that's
something you want more of?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, I would love more. I mean, as you probably have
found, we did one on Scientology in Germany. We've done a couple on
the drug industry. Investigative pieces are difficult. We tried to
do one on the Apollo Theater (in New York); it didn't pan out. And
I find that investigative reporters are a really unique batch. And
that for every eight or ten that you assign, maybe you get two that
really work and really deliver the goods. BRILL: I always tell
people that if I were running a journalism school, I would get rid
of the whole curriculum. And the only thing that would happen is
that the students would be written about. The best training for any
journalist is to have someone write a profile on you, and have it
published in your hometown newspaper. Then you understand
everything about journalism. If I'm right, that makes you the best
qualified journalist on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) Right.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: How do you think your life makes you -- or doesn't make
you -- a more sensitive journalist, or (does it just make) you want
to be more vengeful?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think, to be honest, it's an advantage and a
disadvantage. I have a perspective on politics that I would say is
unique, and one (that) I created a magazine around. There's been
enough written about my family that I have notions about
journalism, when it's practiced well and when it's not. However, I
think good journalism has a very strong point of view, and
downplays facts which go against you and plays up facts which
support you.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: A good piece should downplay facts that go against you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Yeah, like in a good argument. Like a lawyer makes a
good argument. You are trying to persuade, and you craft an
argument accordingly. So I think that my own experience has made me
probably more sensitive to a fairness issue. And perhaps the pieces
have suffered, in that it's fun to read a really harsh, mean piece
about somebody.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What (does) it mean to you that something is
nonpartisan or postpartisan, words that you have used to describe
the magazine?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think the current political imbroglio has indicated
that real people across America do not have the same investment in
partisan politics as people in Washington do. And I think that you
find people want solutions, people want government to work, they
want to feel good about politics. And they'll vote the person
rather than the issue a lot of the time. And I think that happens
increasingly. Part of the reason why I think the Washington
community maybe has not embraced George to the extent that readers
across America have (is that) there is a populist element to it. We
are interested in exploring the outsider sensibility about
politics. And that is kind of postpartisan -- or it's a lot more
nonpartisan than it is in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What I heard a lot from the (political and media)
elite was, if (George) had a point of view it would have more edge,
it would count more, it would matter more. But the readers said
they like it.They don't feel like anybody is coming down on one
side, and they're tired of that. But it does also feel like it's in
no-man's-land. Does that bother you?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It is something which is the essential challenge of
this magazine. I think a lot of people expected there would be a
brief flurry of mouthing about (being) nonpartisan, and then it
would turn into John Kennedy's soapbox. And it can't be that. The
way you address that is, your stories have strong points of view,
and strong sensibilities, but that you have a variety of different
ones in there. The thing that people really respond to the most is
that they do feel that they are not being led around by the nose.
And in terms of Washington, we get a lot of access. Maybe they just
think that we'll just be nice to everybody. But I do think that
they think that there is an element of fairness, which, given my
own experience, is very important.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Suppose the magazine assigns a piece about somebody, and
that somebody doesn't want to pose for a photo. Would you assign a
photographer to ambush that person?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It would never be necessary, because there's so much
pickup (photos available from agencies) of the people that we do. I
know what the question is -- would I assign a paparazzi? And it's
sort of a trite question, because you don't have to.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Let's see if I can make it a little less trite. Most of
the pickup you'd buy would be from those same paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, not necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you wouldn't buy one of those shots, or you would?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, I would buy them. I would get the best pickup that
was available that I could.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Even if it's (a) photographer who ambushed someone?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'm not a big moralizer about the paparazzi. I may not
like it, and it may be a difficult aspect of my life, but it's my
problem.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You don't begrudge them doing the job they do?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It's not something that I think is worth talking
(about). It's not a pressing public principle.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: If you were the editor of Salon, would you have reported
on the sex life of (Illinois Republican Congressman) Henry Hyde?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: We may not have done it, but was I dismayed that it
happened? No. Because I think that any time there is an element of
hypocrisy lingering, it's interesting to read about it.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you would or would not have done it?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I really don't know. For us to do it, it would have
looked weird. You know, it's inconsistent. There are obviously my
own family issues in which it looks hypocritical. It looks too
partisan. So would I have done it in our magazine? No. Salon is
obviously a magazine you know where they're coming from. They're
fighting that fight. So was it appropriate for them to do it? Yeah,
I think so. It's not as appropriate for us to do it.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: When you sat down to do a Richard Mellon Scaife
interview, (a lot of reporters called it) a coup. Everybody wanted
(to talk to the millionaire well known for funding right-wing
publications and think tanks). And some people have said that you
have a kind of Larry King style of letting people's words speak for
themselves, but not necessarily nailing them to the wall. Is that
something that is conscious?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, I'm very flattered by the comparison. (Laughs) I
find interviews difficult, because I don't like to really do them,
present situation excluded, and I know, having done a few of them,
what makes me uncomfortable and what makes me feel noncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Which is what?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Which is sort of a sense that a reporter has an idea
already about what he wants this to come to. That you're not just
sitting down in a conversation and see(ing) where it will lead;
there's sort of a setup going on. And I just find the people I
interview are people whom I'm interested in. I worked in the Reagan
Justice Department during law school, I clerked for William
Bradford Reynolds in the civil-rights division. Not because I
agreed with him, but because I was just interested in how they
thought, which was obviously completely opposite to what I had
grown up with. So I just go in to an interview, and I just ask
questions that I am curious about. And, more often than not, it
starts out stilted, but, (as with) Richard Mellon Scaife, he just
felt comfortable, and he just talked. It's not my nature to be
inquisitorial; I think it is my nature to be curious. I'm thinking
about the people who read us. You're sort of being a proxy for
them.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Doesn't it drive you crazy to read the stuff that
belittles you and the magazine, when you're actually coming to work
every day?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Well, there's a lot less of it now than there was in
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Did you ever think, Why did I get into this?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No, because I knew that was going to happen. I knew
that it would irritate people no end -- the supreme irony of me
going and joining a media conglomerate to be a journalist! And then
to have it kind of work fairly well? I mean, we're still in
business, you know?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: But you like to be liked
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I don't really like to be liked. I never look for
approval from the journalistic community. If it comes, great. But I
didn't really see that as the group that I had to answer to. And
then the more condescending it got, the more that I knew that I was
doing the right thing. But that has stopped now, I think. I mean,
we're like the Conan O'Brien of magazines. You know, we're still
here.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: In your column in the (February) issue, you (wrote)
something about how the idea of politicians as role models is a
fraud. That's what you think?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: No. I think that people don't think of politicians as
role models anymore, that there is an inherent contradiction. On
one side, we perpetuate the notion that politicians should be role
models, and on the other, we don't treat them as such.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Don't you think they can be, should be?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think they are, merely by doing what they're doing.
And if they have a marital infidelity or if they did something in
college that they wouldn't do 20 years later, I don't think that
makes them a role model. But I think for an industry now that has
been (as) demarketed as politics, who wants to go into politics now
anymore? People just roll their eyes, and I think that's really
sad. When my father was president, there were 30 people covering
the White House. There are now 3,000, and they're all chasing the
same rabbit. So it becomes very difficult to maintain perfection
under that kind of scrutiny. You're putting an impossible burden on
them -- and you're setting yourself up for a sense of failure about
the political system. And I think that that burden is unfair, and
it makes good people stay away from government.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: I've got to ask you one snide, condescending question.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, John Travolta, Tom Hanks,
Christy Turlington, Johnny Depp. You're getting the point, right?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Mmm-hmm. BRILL: Bruce Willis, Charlize Theron, whoever
she is.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Hey, she's on the cover of Vanity Fair this month, and
we had her first.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Well, okay, fair enough. My point is, if you take the
last year of covers, with all of the movie stars, that package
doesn't say this is a magazine about politics. Are you doing with
the magazine what people get frustrated and angry at politicians
for, which is doing something that's popular, that brings in a
crowd, and then, after the election, changing the message on them?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I started this as a business, and my objective is that
this be a real business. Because if it's not a business then
there's no point in doing it. And I don't shy away from that.
Having familiar people from popular culture integrated within the
political content of our magazine, that is the essence of what the
magazine is, which is that politics has migrated into the realm of
popular culture. And in order to maintain the attention and the
interests of Americans, or viewers, they have to use the same kind
of attention-getting device as popular culture, that politicians
have to become personalities, in the show-business sense. And by
virtue of the fact that there's been an explosion of media,
personalities have an opportunity to become political. And that's
really the germ of what George magazine is saying. I think we've
made, perhaps, an error on one or two covers. I don't want to
offend her, but Charlize Theron I think was arguably one of those.
We were doing a thing about American folklore, and she was
commenting about America. It would really be unsatisfying to me to
have some somber politician on the cover, and we gather dust in the
back of some newsstand somewhere. I mean, if I sell 180,000 copies
of a political magazine -- man, I am happy. And so I could do
something else, with some drawing of (South Carolina Republican
Senator) Strom Thurmond and sell 20(,000), and maybe I'm serious
and consequential in Washington. But if the people that I'm trying
to reach are passing me by, then that's a failure.
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: What about Maureen Dowd's quote: ``Celebrity distorts
democracy, by giving the rich, beautiful and famous more authority
than they deserve?'' The idea that it's one thing to sell
magazines, but to give celebrities any sense of weight, (for
instance) what Pamela (Anderson) Lee has to say, is taking it a
step further than you should?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Maureen Dowd writes, as far as I can tell, mostly about
the personal, about celebrity, and about the personally trivial.
And it makes for interesting (reading). The reason why she's
interesting is because she writes about the most kind of
provocative personal points of people in politics. And so that
comment seems sort of freighted with contradiction coming from
where it does.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Should the media report about the sex lives of kids of
politicians?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: It depends how interesting their sex lives are.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You really mean that?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I think it's a broad question. I think you should give
me a context.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Eleanor Mondale (the daughter of former vice-president
Walter Mondale and the subject of a gossipy February story that had
little connection to politics). That's the context.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: Listen, I understand the irony in that story appearing
in George. But that's kind of a racy, fun story, and something that
I would read.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: And if she calls you up and says, ``How can you, of all
people, publish a story like that?''
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: I'd say: ``Hey, man -- you know, I've been there. It's
a pain in the neck, but, you know, it ain't as bad as all that.''
</P>
<P>
   POGREBIN: Looking back on your famous editor's note (in which
Kennedy wrote about two of his cousins' marital problems and posed
tastefully nude for an accompanying picture), would you do anything
differently?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: That's almost one of (our) best-selling issues ever, so
I don't think so. Without reinterpreting the letter, because
hopefully the letter (spoke) for itself, though it was deliberately
oblique, I did that because that was something I wanted to say and
something that I had felt strongly about, which is, we judge
harshly people in the public eye for being human. The picture had
to accompany the letter, because otherwise the letter would have
looked like I was being judgmental. And the picture had to
accompany the letter because the picture exposed me to judgment.
And it was not an exhibitionistic thing. There (are) 40
photographers in Hyannis during the summer that photograph me
swimming (and the photos are) far more revealing. The reason I
(talked) about myself in the letter was just to reinforce (that) I
was not exempting myself from what I was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: So you came into the office and said I have this really
great idea, I'm going to write this piece and it's going to be
accompanied with a nude picture of me, (and everyone said), Great
idea, John.
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: They were horrified. This is how I have to do it.
Listen, your magazine is obviously the product of some strong
opinions you have. And if a magazine is not reflective of one
person's soul, then it probably stinks. And sometimes, depending on
how I'm feeling, I just kind of let it loose. Otherwise, what's the
point, right? What's the point for me to have a magazine if I'm not
going to use it in some way that is personal?
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: You seem not overwhelmingly thrilled about being in the
public spotlight. Why do people keep saying that you're going to
run for office?
</P>
<P>
   KENNEDY: (Laughs) I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   BRILL: Do you think you ever will?

   KENNEDY: I don't have any immediate desire to. Obviously this
magazine brings you right up against politics, and I like that.
However, do I feel a frustration about being an observer, not a
participant, sometimes? Yeah, because that's my background, that's
what I have in my blood. But, yet, would I want to go in, with the
hell that would envelop my life? Not at this juncture of my life. I
just got married. I like my privacy.

that include the defiling of an apple pie. Now get ready for the
television season. The audience at the center of the wave of
gross-out entertainment, are boys and men under the age of 25. Not
only has this group established itself as the most loyal to
Hollywood movies, but it is also a favored target of a long list of
television advertisers. By Bill Carter and Lawrie Mifflin.

   MEDIA-TALK (Undated) _ Short news items from the media world,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ When WEEI, a Boston talk radio station, dropped Don Imus this
month, the Boston press corps played it as an Imus-in-decline

that Imus was about to drop himself. A look at the art of managing

</P>
<P>
   _ The Wall Street Journal's Sunday edition is going to reach 4

 &HT;    Paving his own course, Kennedy embraced life
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John F. Kennedy Jr., 38, perhaps more than any
contemporary American, connects national memory with history.
</P>
<P>
   His image is engraved _ in television screen black-and-white _
in the collective consciousness as 3-year-old John John, saluting
the coffin of his father, the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   It is poignant that when Kennedy's plane went missing, he was on
the way to the wedding of his cousin, Rory, in Massachusetts. She
is the youngest daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, assassinated during
a presidential campaign in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   And it is poignant, too, that this latest tragedy befell the
Kennedy family on the weekend marking both the 30th anniversary of
an American walking on the moon, a goal set forth by his father,
and the Chappaquiddick incident, in which a car driven by his
uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, went off a bridge, killing passenger
Mary Jo Kopechne on a tiny island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   But although we may remember this child of a president from his
appearances at funerals and memorial services _ including that of
his mother, Jacquelyn Kennedy Onassis in 1994, and his grandmother,
Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy in 1995 _ he embraced life with
Kennedy-like robustness.
</P>
<P>
   Bring it on, his whole body seemed to say.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the first child to be born of a president-elect
and the first infant to live in the White House since 1893, he was
literally a celebrity from the moment he was born.
</P>
<P>
   There are pictures of him we carry in our heads: peeking out
from beneath his dad's desk in the Oval Office, at his college
graduation with his mother on his arm, with a long line of
girlfriends including Daryl Hannah, emerging jubilant from his
wedding to Carolyn Bessette, announcing the birth of his political
magazine George.
</P>
<P>
   Child celebrity
</P>
<P>
   He was born Nov. 25, 1960, in Washington, D.C. The press
christened him John John; the Secret Service agents he often eluded
named him Lark.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of those White House days in recent years: ``You know,
there are so many photographs and stuff, you never really know if
you're remembering something that you saw in an image or if it was
something real. ... My mother built this slide for us in the back
of the White House and (the family dog) used to run up the slide
and slide down, like, hundreds of times. I feel like I remember
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After his father's assassination in 1963, the family settled in
New York City, where his mother guarded the children's privacy.
Paparazzi could sell photos of John John bicycling for $3,000 a
pop.
</P>
<P>
   When his uncle Robert was assassinated in 1968, he lost a
surrogate father, although later that year his mother married Greek
tycoon Aristotle Onassis, who died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy went to school in New York, developed a taste for acting
early on, worked a summer helping earthquake victims in Guatemala,
and was held back a year in high school to bring his math grades
up.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Brown University in Providence, R.I., in 1983,
where he pursued acting and athletics with more rigor than
academics.
</P>
<P>
   During the next three years, he tried a variety of jobs,
including professional acting. The reviews were not raves and he
eventually gave up the stage.
</P>
<P>
   His life _ at least to the outside observer _ often seemed a
quest for focus.
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled at New York University Law School in 1986, working
in the Juvenile Rights Clinic, and on behalf of the homeless and
the Special Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Finding fulfillment
</P>
<P>
   He grew up to have his father's good looks and his mother's love
for the arts. He also grew up to be 6-foot-1 and muscular, and out
went the name John John.
</P>
<P>
   He loved sports and being around them. He made his last public
appearance Thursday night at the Braves-Yankees game in the Bronx.
Kennedy was honored before Saturday's game with a moment of silent
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he introduced his uncle Edward at the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, and received a two-minute standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over a quarter of a century ago, my father stood before you to
accept the nomination for the presidency of the United States,''
the young man told the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of you came into public service because of him and in
a very real sense it is because of you he is with us today.''
</P>
<P>
   After he earned his law degree in 1989, Kennedy made newspaper
headlines by failing the New York State bar exam _ twice. But he
passed in 1990 and worked as an assistant district attorney in
Manhattan. He became a prosecutor, resigning in 1993 with a 6-0
conviction record.
</P>
<P>
   Like his mother, he has supported charities throughout his life,
including those benefiting mental retardation, disabled children
and literacy.
</P>
<P>
   He was close to his mother, and after her death in 1994, he
seemed to become even closer to his sister, Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg.
</P>
<P>
   The siblings established the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage
award for public service. ``I'd like to see it become what the
Oscars are to the film industry or the Nobel Prize to peace and
economics. The single award that recognizes achievement and acts of
courage in public life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after a life of avoiding the media, he founded the
monthly political magazine George.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of dressed in irony, right? Me in a media
conglomerate?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue featured a cover of Cindy Crawford dressed as
George Washington; Kennedy's interview with Alabama's George
Wallace; and a story by Madonna on what she would do if she were
president. In a later issue, Kennedy posed nude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy here (at George),'' he told USA Today last
year, adding that he took the subway to work. ``I like doing this
and this is a job that's going to take a while to really develop.
And I feel like, in a way, I'm serving a larger purpose in bringing
more people to learn about politics and be interested in it and to
feel optimistic about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing politics
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he traveled as a journalist to Cuba on the 35th
anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, during which his father
won a tense showdown with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev.
</P>
<P>
   He considered running for office himself, he told Vogue in a
1993 interview. ``It's obviously something people ask me
occasionally, and having grown up with it, I have to admit it is
something I consider a lot. I frankly feel there are many
opportunities and avenues outside of elective office to become
involved in issues, issues that have the same broad scope that
government or elected office provides you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you run for office, you're in it. Sort of like going into
the military _ you'd better be damn sure that it is what you want
to do and that the rest of your life is set up to accommodate that.
It takes a certain toll on your personality, and on your family
life. I've seen it personally. So if I were to do it, I would want
to make sure that was what I wanted to do, and that I didn't do it
because people thought I should. Right now I am very fulfilled
doing what I am doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He dated a long string of actresses and socialites, and People
magazine once labeled him ``the sexiest man alive.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sept. 21, 1996, he married Carolyn Bessette, who had been
a publicist for Calvin Klein, at an extremely private Cumberland
Island wedding. By all accounts, she was learning to weather the
publicity that follows in the Kennedy wake.
</P>
<P>
   Revered and scrutinized
</P>
<P>
   Princess Diana saw Kennedy as a role model for her son, Prince
William, especially in the handling of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping he'll grow up to be as smart about it as John
Kennedy Jr.,'' she said two months before her death in a 1997 Paris
auto crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want William to be able to handle things as well as John
does,'' The New Yorker magazine quoted her as saying in an article
published after her death.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy responded that he believed the public scrutiny was
tougher for William and his brother, Prince Harry, than it had been
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really able to lead a normal life from about the age of
5. I went to boarding school and then college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always grew up just living a fairly normal life. I thank my
mother for doing that. I always took the bus. I always took the
subway ... Hotel suites and limo cars, it's like, `Whew! Forget
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his mother had taught him about handling fame,
Kennedy said: ``We didn't actually sit down and have a tutorial
session. But you pick things up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the February edition of George, Kennedy wrote about the loss
of privacy that modern-day politicians must endure:
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities are people whose personal lives are at least as
newsworthy as their professional lives ... In becoming so anointed,
they have won some measure (large or small) of immortality.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview three weeks after he earned his pilot's license,
Kennedy said his single-engine plane could hold at least four
people, but that he hadn't yet been able to persuade relatives to
fly with him.''The only person I've been able to get to go up with
me, who looks forward to it as much as I do, is my wife,'' he said.
``The second it was legal she came up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``whenever we want to get away, we can just get in a plane
and fly off.''

   WASHINGTON _ They had come to the Kennedy estate at Hyannisport
to celebrate a wedding; instead, they found themselves preparing
for a funeral. Once again, at what should have been one of its most
joyous moments, America's premier political family found itself
struck by tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 guests, most of them members of the Kennedy clan,
had been expected at Saturday afternoon's wedding in the grounds of
the family compound on the southern shore of Cape Cod. The previous
evening, Ethel Kennedy, widow of the late Senator Robert Kennedy,
had held a bridal dinner for her daughter, Rory.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy, Jr., cousin of the bride and only son of the
assassinated president, had been due to arrive at the estate
Saturday, after spending the night at the island of Martha's
Vineyard. He and his wife, Carolyn, never arrived. The couple had
no children.
</P>
<P>
   When the news first broke Saturday morning that JFK's small
plane was missing off the coast of Long Island, a shudder went
through the East Coast political and media establishment. Could it
really be that the ``curse'' had struck again, felling another
young and promising Kennedy in his prime?
</P>
<P>
   His father, John F. Kennedy, had met his premature death at the
hands of an assassin in Dallas in 1963. His uncle, Robert, who
aspired to follow in his brother's footsteps, was assassinated five
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's news was replete with eerie coincidences. Friday was
the 30th anniversary of an earlier Kennedy tragedy, the death of
Mary-Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick, in a car driven by President
Kennedy's brother, Ted.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, too, as ships and helicopters searched the waters
north of Long Island, relatives of the some of the 200 people
killed in the unexplained crash of TWA's flight 800 were gathering
on the island's southern shore to commemorate the third anniversary
of that disaster.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, Jr., who is universally recalled in the U.S. from
the pictures of himself and his sister Caroline as small children
at his father's funeral, shone out in many ways as a laudable
exception in a clan plagued by scandals and rumors of every hue,
from drink, drugs and sex, all the way to allegations of murder
surrounding one young relative.
</P>
<P>
   The last Kennedy to meet an untimely death was Michael, a son of
Robert Kennedy, killed after hitting a tree while skiing in Aspen
in 1997. He had just surfaced from reports _ never denied _ that he
had an illicit affair with an underage babysitter.
</P>
<P>
   JFK Jr. had eschewed the political and public service careers
pursued by so many of his relatives, and _ despite living a glitzy
Manhattan life _ dissociated himself from the fast living of
others.
</P>
<P>
   When the babysitter scandal broke over his cousin Michael, John
used an article in George magazine, his own publishing venture, to
describe his relative as a ``poster boy for bad behavior'' and
remind the ``clan'' that ``of those to whom much is given, much is
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   To that clan, the presumed death of JFK Jr. is not just another
member lost to the ``curse.'' It is the end, in a way, of the JFK
legend. This is how Camelot has ended: in the black waters of the
Atlantic, at night. &QL;

legend. This is how Camelot has ended: in the black waters of the
Atlantic, at night. &QL;

   HYANNISPORT _ So consuming was the worry at the Kennedy compound
in Hyannisport on Saturday that nobody told the catering company
hired to feed the 275 guests at the wedding of Rory Kennedy that
the ceremony had been called off. Their vans arrived at three in
the tense afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, most of the rest of the world knew tragedy had
returned to haunt America's most famous political dynasty as it had
done so many times.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound, prayers were being said in desperate and
fading hope for the life of the only son of the late President John
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Within the walls of what the world came to know as Camelot _ the
Kennedy estate set in a picturesque town of clapperboard homes and
rose hedges on the southern shore of Cape Cod, Mass. _ the clan was
struggling to absorb an almost unthinkable reality.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six hours after the private Piper plane of JFK, Jr.
vanished from radar screens off the island of Martha's Vineyard, no
trace of him, his wife, Carolyn Bessette, or her sister, Lauren
Bessette, had been found.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Kennedy, his wife and her sister had been heading
here for a wedding deepens the agony.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Kennedy is a daughter of the late Robert Kennedy _ her
mother, Ethel, was pregnant with her when RFK was shot to death in
California in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months ago she cradled her dying brother Michael in her
arms after a skiing accident at Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, her wedding was postponed because of the presumed
death of her cousin. All the clan gathered here on Saturday for her
marriage to Mark Bailey, a book and film critic from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Many guests were visiting the tiny John F. Kennedy Museum on
Main Street on Saturday, when Pearl Guba, its manager made a grim
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were preparing to go to the wedding, some of them from
Ireland, and they were totally shocked when we told them,'' he
said. ``It's a good thing John's mother, Jackie, died first. She
was so fond of her son.''
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, many of the guests in the compound, a main beachside
house and several small cottages, had slipped discreetly away,
leaving a core of family members. They included Senator Edward
Kennedy, 67, the only principal member of the Kennedy cast to make
it past middle age.
</P>
<P>
   And there were three priests who had come to Cap Cod to bless
the wedding vows. Just 19 months ago the same priests had attended
the funeral of Michael Kennedy, JFK's cousin, killed in Aspen on
New Year's Eve 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a brief mass was said on the steps of the main
house, overlooking a huge sweeping lawn, with 50 friends and
family. In the streets of Hyannisport, yellow ribbons were wound
around trees, tied by neighbors sharing in the grief and worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the family could use some hope,'' said Melissa
Lewandowski, who put up one of the bows. ``If they saw a yellow
ribbon, they would know that the community is hoping with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of Hyannisport still remember when the compound was
an oasis of joy. In an earlier era, it was the gathering point for
family members to summer parties and days by the sea. But these
days, grief more often brings this clan together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad,'' said Janice Beechum, a local resident. ``The
only time everybody comes down here now is when there is a Kennedy
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the many children brought along for the cancelled wedding
the somber mood was too hard to comprehend. At midafternoon on
Saturday, a kite-flying party strayed on to the lawn. Later, RFK,
Jr., another cousin of John's, was seen navigating a rocky
breakwater on the beach with his small son on his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of children running around, which always seems
to change the atmosphere,'' said Brian O'Connor, a family
spokesman. ``People are happy to see one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists and TV crews from around the world were once more
pressed up against police fences on the streets from the compound
Sunday, waiting for word from a family that has become so practiced
in dealing with loss.
</P>
<P>
   And family members are waiting for the U.S. Coast Guard to say
they had turned from search and rescue to accident investigation.
Then the family will have to prepare for yet another journey into
grief, and more funerals. &QL;

ANALYSIS: THE END OF A FREEWHEELING ERA AT WARNER BROS. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The surprise announcement on Thursday that Robert A.
Daly and Terry Semel were leaving their jobs as co-chairmen of
Warner Brothers after nearly two decades marked not only a turning
point at the multibillion-dollar entertainment conglomerate but the
end of a freewheeling era when Hollywood moguls behaved like rajahs
and operated independently of corporate bosses.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the departures of these two highly respected
executives _ who are the longest-running management team in
Hollywood and are lavishly paid even by their industry's excessive
standards _ represents a generational change. Once the most
successful and formidable of studio chiefs who ran a movie division
that consistently set earnings records, Daly and Semel stumbled in
recent years for one reason: they too often relied on a team of
older stars, directors and producers who churned out weak or
formulaic movies that had scant appeal to audiences aged 15 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, 62, and Semel, 55, a team for nearly 20 years, said on
Thursday that they had told Gerald M. Levin, chairman of the
studio's parent company, Time Warner Inc., of their decision not to
renew their contracts, which expire on Dec. 31. Levin, as well as
Daly and Semel, went to great pains to tell the press that the
decision was strictly a personal one by the studio chiefs: the two
said they wanted to start a partnership on their own and begin a
new venture as entertainment entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the studio as well as top talent agents said
the situation was more complicated, that the low-keyed Levin, who
generally seeks to avoid confrontation but has been emboldened by
the company's soaring stock price, had made it clear that the
stumbling music division would no longer be under the control of
Daly and Semel. At the same time Levin was said by people close to
the studio to be questioning the extraordinary sums earned by the
two.
</P>
<P>
   Their yearly compensation is believed to be as high as $25
million each. Because of Time Warner's stock price, which has
climbed despite the company's poor performance in films, Semel's
wealth is estimated as high as $500 million. Daly's is perhaps $300
million, less than his partner's because of a divorce settlement.
The two men declined to discuss their finances, and Levin said on
Thursday that the contract-renewal talks had barely begun and that
compensation had not been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever replaces the team _ and Levin may promote from inside
the company _ it is obvious that the chief executive will now have
far more control over the $10 billion empire that Daly and Semel
presided over. That empire includes the film studio; television,
including the WB network, consumer products and music.
</P>
<P>
   Daly and Semel were the last top executives trained and guided
by Steven J. Ross, the almost legendary Time Warner chairman who
died in 1992. Ross gave his executives independence and a
relatively free rein and, perhaps more important, was an
extravagant show business rajah whose largess endeared him to stars
like Clint Eastwood, Barbra Streisand, Goldie Hawn and Mel Gibson.
Lavish gifts, trips on the Warner jets, and weeklong visits to the
company's mansions in places like Acapulco stamped Ross' reign.
</P>
<P>
   Semel gave extravagantly high-priced deals to producer friends
like Jerry Weintraub, Jon Peters and Joel Silver, who generally
made big-budget and big-star action movies that worked for a while,
like the ``Batman'' and ``Lethal Weapon'' franchises. But audience
tastes changed, and Warner Brothers didn't. Cheaper, more
adventurous films without stars were left to companies like Miramax
and New Line Cinema, which is now owned by Time Warner, as well as
other studios.
</P>
<P>
   And while Hollywood studios like Warner Brothers still treat
stars and directors like pampered children who demand everything
from private planes to round-the-clock nannies, the Daly-Semel era
seemed to set new standards for excessiveness. In the flush times
of the mid-'80s to the early '90s, when the studio produced hits,
the extravagances were accepted by the company's hierarchy as the
way Hollywood does business. In leaner times, with Levin in firm
control, the studio's strategies seemed outdated.
</P>
<P>
   Although Warner Brothers released successes like ``Unforgiven,''
``The Fugitive,'' and ``JFK,'' and, more recently, ``You've Got
Mail,'' ``Analyze This'' and ``The Matrix'' (a science-fiction
drama credited largely to the perseverance of a younger executive,
Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the production chief), the high-priced,
big-star flops far outweighed the winners.
</P>
<P>
   Failures like ``The Postman'' with Kevin Costner; ``Father's
Day'' with Robin Williams and Billy Crystal; ``Mad City'' with
Dustin Hoffman and John Travolta; Clint Eastwood's ``Midnight in
the Garden of Good and Evil''; ``The Avengers'' with Uma Thurman
and Ralph Fiennes; Barry Levinson's ``Sphere,'' and the animated
``Quest for Camelot'' served to underline a fundamental flaw: that
Warner Brothers, under Daly and Semel, had failed to tap into the
new talent and teen-age market that rivals' sought out.
</P>
<P>
   Hits as varied as New Line's ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me'' and Miramax's more serious and grown-up ``Shakespeare
in Love,'' all of them without big-budget stars, stamped the new
Hollywood and left Warner Brothers in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently Warner Brothers' ``Wild Wild West,'' the most
expensive movie of the summer (it probably cost as much as $180
million), opened to dismal reviews and is expected to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   Semel, however, also maintained a close relationship with the
idiosyncratic filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who died in March and
whose last film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' released by Warner Brothers,
opened over the weekend to wildly mixed reviews. The film was No. 1
at the box office, and the studio said it would take in an
estimated $22.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts the extravagances, which symbolized the
Hollywood of a different era, were anathema to Levin and to Ted
Turner, vice chairman and 11 percent owner of Time Warner. Despite
their wealth, Levin and Turner are unglitzy and bewildered by
Hollywood excess. In that way they resemble the current corporate
owners of other film studios, like Sumner Redstone, chairman of
Viacom, which owns Paramount, and Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News
Corp., who have nurtured reputations as men who seek to cut costs
at every corner and say privately that they are appalled at the way
Hollywood conducts business.
</P>
<P>
   Even Michael Eisner, the Disney chairman, has a reputation as a
budget cutter who seeks to avoid extravagances to employees and
stars. ( Eisner paid his former No. 2, Michael Ovitz, only about $1
million a year in salary, as well as bonuses and stock options, but
felt compelled to pay Ovitz a severance package of about $90
million despite his failure at the company.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever tensions and disagreements existed between Daly and
Semel, on the one hand, and Levin and Turner, on the other, it
seems evident that Daly and Semel were intent on setting out on
their own. ``There was another chapter I wanted in my life,'' said
Daly. Levin, while paying tribute to the considerable
accomplishments of the Daly-Semel team, was only too happy to
oblige.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Northeast and Middle Atlantic states will have
another hot and humid day, but a cold front marking the leading
edge of cooler air will move south through upstate New York and New
England. A broken band of strong thunderstorms will erupt ahead of
the front during the afternoon. Brief torrential rain will occur in
some of the storms causing local flooding in a few areas. The
thunderstorms will reach the northern Middle Atlantic states late
Monday and Monday night as the front moves slowly south. In the
wake of the front less humid air will spread across New York and
New England for Monday night and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Heat and high humidity will cover a large area from the central
and southern Plains to the Southeastern states. Afternoon
thunderstorms will be common near the Gulf Coast as sea breezes
lift the sultry air. Scattered thundershowers will occur elsewhere
in the interior Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   A wavering front from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes
states will separate the hot, moist air from cool air near the
Canadian border. A series of disturbances traveling along this
boundary will promote clusters of thunderstorms in the humid air
from the Dakotas to the southern Great Lakes. Meanwhile, there will
be ample sunshine from the southern Plains to the lower Ohio
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and thundershowers will be common in the central and
southern Rockies as high-level winds from the south continue to
draw moist air over the region. West of the Rockies, plentiful
sunshine and seasonal heat will prevail in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Erroneous Heat
</P>
<P>
   The air was not as hot as the 103-degree reading the thermometer
on the roof of the terminal building indicated at the Philadelphia
International Airport on Saturday. The official reading was later
determined to be 98 degrees. The placement of the instrument is
crucial to obtaining accurate air temperatures. Air absorbs very
little energy directly from the sun. But thermometers exposed to
sunlight absorb energy, causing the temperature of the mercury
itself to rise above the air temperature. Thermometers mounted on
roofs are often inaccurate, since they absorb heat from the
building.

`TAKE MY ADVICE': A TALE OF TWIN ADVICE COLUMNISTS 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ In a story of rival twin sisters, even Ann Landers
and Abigail Van Buren, it's tempting to ask, ``Which one is the
evil twin?'' Based on Monday night's Lifetime film ``Take My
Advice: The Ann and Abby Story,'' it depends.
</P>
<P>
   First the viewer has to get the names straight. Esther Friedman,
known as Eppie, becomes Ann Landers. Pauline Friedman, known as
Popo, becomes Abigail Van Buren. Both are played by Wendie Malick _
best known now as Nina, the model turned editor, in the sitcom
``Just Shoot Me'' _ who looks as stiff and uncomfortable in the
'40s and '50s fashions and hairstyles as many women really were.
</P>
<P>
   Popo makes the first move, at a dance in Sioux City, Iowa, in
1938. Eppie is dancing with Mort (Robert Desiderio), a man who has
just been described as being ``worth a mint,'' but when Popo walks
by, her eyes meet his. The next thing you know, they're engaged,
which will soon make Popo the rich twin.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling left out (or just competitive), Eppie quickly announces
her engagement to a ``good and decent'' man she doesn't really
love. Luckily, while buying her wedding dress, she finds herself
attracted to the salesman. So the double wedding takes place, but
with a switch in grooms. Eppie's husband, Jules (Kenneth David
Gilman), later makes a fortune with Budget Rent-a-Car, but for the
moment this marriage makes her the poor twin.
</P>
<P>
   Popo is always giving Eppie nice dresses from her own
overflowing closet. Popo loves their identical twinness and wants
to maintain it, even as grown married ladies. ``Being the same is
what makes us unique,'' she says to Eppie. But Eppie has always
been the rebel. When they're shopping and Popo declares a dress
``not our style,'' Eppie quickly replies, ``Not yours, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Eppie has been restless for a while. In a scene set in 1942, she
explains to Jules: ``Being a housewife is wonderful, but it's only
half a life. I feel like the other half of me is being wasted.''
This will give you some idea of the originality of the dialogue. So
in 1955, when she meets a Chicago Sun-Times editor, she tells him
how pathetic the newspaper's Ann Landers advice column is and
volunteers to write some sample columns. She gets the job.
</P>
<P>
   Now things get complicated. Overwhelmed by a backlog of letters,
Eppie calls Popo (who is living in California) and asks for her
help. Soon the two sisters are happily collaborating in Eppie's
dining room, coming up with clever replies to reader letters.
Everybody's happy, it seems, until Eppie says, in essence, OK, I'm
caught up now, you can go home.
</P>
<P>
   But, Popo says, ``Our column's a knockout.'' Ours? Rejected,
Popo flies home, promptly gets her own column (in The San Francisco
Chronicle), calling herself Abigail Van Buren), and a feud that
lasts more than two decades is off and running.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, choosing the ``evil'' twin depends on whether
falling in love with a man your sister just met and taking career
advantage of your sister's good nature and free time are equivalent
transgressions. It is completely unexpected that ``Take My Advice''
should actually cause a viewer to think. The film is, for the most
part, trite and unimaginative; luckily the story itself is of some
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The most unbelievable scenes show three women in a beauty
parlor, in rollers and hairnets, discussing the two columns under
the hair dryers. Either these women have superhearing or the dryers
are never turned on.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a chance meeting between a self-described ``physicist
gone bad'' and a chemist. And it may someday lead to the creation
of a new breed of computers based on tiny electronic switches, each
no thicker than a single molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Phil Kuekes, a Hewlett Packard physicist with
three decades of experience designing computers, was pondering new
ways to use a computer he had developed using massively parallel
architecture _ technology that attacks computing problems by
breaking them into hundreds or even thousands of pieces to be
simultaneously processed by many individual chips.
</P>
<P>
   At about this same time, Kuekes (pronounced KEE-kus) happened to
make the acquaintance of James Heath, a chemist at the University
of California at Los Angeles whose lab had been experimenting with
tiny structures based on molecules of a synthetic substance called
rotazane. It seemed that these molecular structures might be able
to function as digital switches _ the basic, binary on-off
information gateways of modern computing.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the two scientists were brainstorming about how it might be
possible to blend Kuekes' computer design with Heath's Lilliputian
switches. In the fashioning of tiny switches, or transistors, from
small clusters of molecules a single layer deep, the researchers
see a coming era of computers that would be 100 billion times as
fast as today's fastestPCs.
</P>
<P>
   The work, detailed in a paper published Friday by the
Hewlett-UCLA teams in Science magazine, is a noteworthy example of
the groundbreaking research that suddenly seems to be flourishing
at computer laboratories around the country _ a flowering of ideas
that some leaders in the field have begun to consider a renaissance
in computer science and design.
</P>
<P>
   In corporate and academic labs, researchers appear to be at or
near breakthroughs that could vastly raise the power and ubiquity
of the machines that have insinuated themselves into almost every
facet of modern society. And since many of these efforts, like the
Hewlett-UCLA research, are focused at the microscopic level,
computing could become an increasingly invisible part of everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of exciting stuff is happening outside the mainstream PC
market,'' Marc Snir, a senior research manager at IBM Corp., said.
``We are entering a world where there will be billions of small
devices spread everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hewlett-UCLA team is just one of six groups around the
country working under an ambitious program of the federal Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency that is trying to create a new
kind of molecular-scale electronics _ known as moletronics _ that
researchers hope will one day surpass the power and capacity of the
silicon-based technology used in today's computers. Last year
researchers at Yale and Rice universities took earlier steps toward
the same goal of assembling computers from molecular components.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, separate from the military research program,
researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Laboratory of Computer Science are trying to meld the digital with
the biological by ``hacking'' the common E. coli bacterium so that
it would be able to function as an electronic circuit _ though one
with the marvelous ability to reproduce itself.
</P>
<P>
   It may all sound esoteric. And even the most enthusiastic
researchers concede that practical applications of their theories
and methods may be a decade or more away. But researchers seem
intent on renewing the emphasis on the science in computer science,
venturing beyond electrical engineering and physics to draw upon
diverse disciplines like biochemistry as they form their hypotheses
and test them with empirical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   MIT's computer scientists, for example, are pursuing the idea of
building _ or possibly growing, if the E. coli experiments pan out
_ vast numbers of almost identical processors that might act as
sensors or even as the task-performing devices called actuators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to be able to make processors by the
wheelbarrow-load,'' said Harold Abelson, an MIT computer scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Abelson and his colleagues, who call their approach amorphous
computing, are experimenting with the idea of mapping circuitry
onto biological material. That might let living cells function, for
example, as digital logic circuits. Such circuits are information
pathways that, whatever their complexity, ultimately involve a
multitude of quite simple, binary choices: 0 or 1, on or off, this
but not that.
</P>
<P>
   Biological cells, of course, would be able to compute only as
long as they remained alive. But the premise is the same as in the
molecular-scale work: Pack as many millions or billions of these
tiny decision switches as possible into the smallest spaces
conceivable.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting ``smart'' materials might be used for new types of
paints or gels, for example, that would enable a highway to be
``painted'' with computerlike sensors to issue traffic reports, or
let floors be given a surface of infinitesimal actuators that could
detect dirt and dust and silently and instantly whisk it away.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Hewlett-UCLA work, researchers have
successfully created digital logic circuits, but not yet any in
which the molecular switches can be restored to their original
state _ returning to the off position, for example, after having
switched to on. And still to be developed are the molecular-scale
wires that would be needed to interconnect the switches.
</P>
<P>
   The really significant implication of the Science article is
that for the first time researchers have built molecular-scale
computing components using chemistry rather than the time-honored
technology of photolithography, the ultraviolet-light etching of
circuitry onto silicon that is the process for making today's
chips. The chip industry has not yet reached the theoretical limits
of photolithography, but the day may come when it is no longer
possible to etch circuits any closer together. That is where
molecular chemistry could take over _ and possibly wring more
computing power from a single chip than exists today in the
biggest, fastest supercomputers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Kuekes said his team had been in contact with the MIT
group and was now discussing the possibility of combining the
Hewlett-UCLA molecular switching technology with the MIT lab's
biological processor work with an eye toward future computer
designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of us as the Sherwin-Williams of the Information Age,''
Kuekes said, referring to the vision of suspending billions of tiny
processors in a paint. ``This is the raw material for
super-intelligent materials.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The scientists acknowledge that their projects are gambles and
that any practical applications may be a decade or more away. But
the work on both coasts indicates the breadth of the renaissance
now sweeping through computer-design circles.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the most recent work is a continuation of
efforts that began about five years ago and quickly grew into the
commercial field of microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS chips.
MEMS are microscopic mechanical structures etched into the surface
of silicon chips; they have spawned a multibillion-dollar business,
largely around the chips in silicon accelerometers that are now
standard equipment as sensors for air-bag collision systems in
cars.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Hewlett-UCLA and MIT research makes clear, even the
conventional circuitry of a silicon chip _ or the silicon, for that
matter _ can no longer be assumed. Indeed, computer architects are
rethinking the whole concept of the microprocessor, the master chip
that begat the PC and that has been the building block of modern
computers for a quarter of a century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to do something different. It's time to look at the
things we've ignored,'' said David Patterson, a computer scientist
at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Patterson helped pioneer one of the most
significant computer design innovations of its era, a technology
known as reduced instruction set computing, or RISC.
</P>
<P>
   Building on ideas first advanced during the 1970s by a team of
researchers working under the computer scientist John Cocke at
IBM's Thomas J. Watson Laboratory, Patterson and his Berkeley
graduate students proved that sharp increases in the speed of
processor chips could be achieved by simplifying computer hardware
and shifting many functions to software.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a decade after the success of the Berkeley RISC
project, many experts in the computer industry believed that RISC
would ultimately displace Intel Corp.'s X86 computer chip design,
on which the industry-standard PC was based.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to unseat Intel, dozens of new RISC-inspired companies
sprang up from the mid-'80s through the mid-'90s. But beginning
with its 486 chip, introduced in 1989, and continuing in its
Pentium series, Intel was already incorporating the best RISC ideas
into its chips, keeping their performance close enough to RISC's
potential to let the company retain its commanding market lead.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Intel's hardware and Microsoft's software
proved invincible, and one by one the RISC challengers collapsed.
The end of the RISC era almost a decade ago left computer designers
with few fundamentally new ideas for improving computer
performance.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Intel juggernaut moved on, the rising importance
of the Internet and a growing consensus that computing's future
lies in inexpensive consumer-oriented devices helped fuel the
renaissance in chip design.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, the RISC pioneer, has now embarked on a new design
approach, known as intelligent RAM, or IRAM, that has generated
great interest among consumer electronics companies.
</P>
<P>
   RAM stands for random access memory, the semiconductor memory
that is used as a kind of temporary scratch pad by software
programs. Patterson and his Berkeley colleagues have noted that the
largest performance constraint in computer systems today is the
mismatch in speed between the microprocessor and the slower memory
chips. The Berkeley researchers predict that in the next decade
processors and memory will be merged onto a single chip.
</P>
<P>
   The IRAM chips would embed computer processors in vast seas of
memory transistors. Instead of stressing pure processor speed,
these new chips would place the emphasis on avoiding bottlenecks
that slow the data traffic inside a processor. Such an approach
would be especially attractive to makers of memory chips _
companies eager to find new ways to distinguish themselves in what
is now a commodity market.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some consumer electronics companies are
pursuing ideas similar to those behind the IRAM project. For
example, Sony Corp.'s Emotion Engine chip, which the company is
designing in cooperation with Toshiba Corp. for the coming Sony
Playstation II game console, blends memory and processor logic as a
way to create faster, more vivid on-screen game action.
</P>
<P>
   But no single computer architecture is optimal for every kind of
problem. That is why many researchers are exploring the idea of
reconfigurable chips _ chips whose circuitry can be reorganized for
each specific computing problem.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most extreme efforts in this direction is a processor
approach known as RAW, for raw-architecture work station, that is
being pursued by a group of researchers at MIT's Laboratory of
Computer Science, working separately from the E. coli project.
</P>
<P>
   RAW pushes the idea of RISC to a new extreme. The processor
would not have an ``instruction set'' in the conventional sense of
the term, which refers to the types of instructions that let
software programmers direct a chip to do things like add or
subtract, or compare and move blocks of data. Instead of using
preordained instruction sets, RAW would present the entire chip to
the programmer as a veritable blank slate on which tens of millions
of transistors might be individually programmed.
</P>
<P>
   Such unprecedented flexibility would mean that the same basic
chip might be used for an infinite variety of purposes _ like
creating three-dimensional animated graphics, performing
supercomputer calculations or carrying out tasks not yet conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to determine whether this is simply a challenge
for programmers or a complicated nightmare,'' said Anant Agarwal,
the MIT computer designer who heads the RAW project.
</P>
<P>
   As all these research efforts proceed, computer scientists are
toiling against the perceived limits of Moore's Law _ a guiding
principle for chip design since the Intel co-founder, Gordon Moore,
observed in 1964 that the number of transistors that could fit onto
a silicon chip doubles approximately every 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, there are physical limits to how closely
together circuits can be etched with light onto the surface of a
silicon chip and still function _a reality that is expected to mean
the end of the Moore's Law paradigm sometime around the year 2012.
That is why forward-looking work like the molecular-scale circuitry
research of the Hewlett-UCLA team is so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly a technology this radically different won't tip over a
trillion-dollar industry'' like today's computer-chip industry,
Kuekes said. ``But we're looking considerably ahead of where
silicon runs out of steam.''

`THE PLOT TO GET BILL GATES': MICROSOFT CAPITALISM AS MIRROR OF
AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's safe to say that few among the public have ever heard of
Tim Berners-Lee and that few newspapers and magazines have hailed
him as a visionary. But Berners-Lee, a physicist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, created the World Wide Web.
He did it to enable himself and his friends to share their
research, not to make money, and that is just the point of ``The
Plot to Get Bill Gates,'' a spirited new book by Gary Rivlin.
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin has written an intimate history of the do-or-die
competition that reigns in the lucrative, high-stakes world of
computer technology, a history that centers on the amazing success
of Gates and Microsoft, which he started with Paul Allen and has
guided to fabulous wealth. Gates has been written about as much as
any contemporary figure, and Rivlin covers some well-trodden
ground. But he also casts a light not just on Gates but on the
world that loves him and hates him and that has made him a
celebrity even as it has essentially ignored people like
Berners-Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the science and tech world's stars are entrepreneurs,
fabulously well-to-do titans honored with sweet-smelling profiles
everywhere from People to The New Yorker,'' Rivlin writes.
``Nowadays, it's as if a technical breakthrough isn't a
breakthrough, at least in the realm of the popular press, until
someone figures out how to shrink-wrap the idea and make truckloads
of money off it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is well known that Gates has made truckloads of money; his
wealth has an almost Homeric quality. In 1997, when his net worth
was one-third what it is today, his income amounted to $22,000 a
minute. Rivlin tells the often unsavory story of how Gates acquired
that money: generally not by producing a better product but by
imitating his rivals' products and being better than they were at
marketing and then destroying them in the ensuing competition.
Rivlin writes some graphic passages about Gates as a kind of
corporate predator, and his descriptions of the cult of Bill Gates
that prevails at Microsoft have an anthropological ring.
</P>
<P>
   But at the heart of this narrative is the dark side of fabulous
success. It is the fabulous envy that that success generates, the
cult of hatred that Rivlin argues is behind the scheming and
plotting to ``get'' Gates, scheming and plotting that, in Rivlin's
description, have united Gates' main competitors with the United
States and other governments in what has now become a well
publicized antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, on the moral plain ``The Plot to Get Bill
Gates'' is a complex tale, although it is handled surely by Rivlin,
a reporter at Upside magazine and the author of two previous
nonfiction books. If you want to dislike Gates, Rivlin gives you
plenty of reasons to do so. But his ultimate point of view is that
Gates has only been more conspicuously successful than almost all
others in a cutthroat capitalist game that is as American as robber
barons and price fixing.
</P>
<P>
   The very captains of industry who have become obsessed with
toppling Gates from his pedestal, Rivlin shows, have done unto
others more or less as Gates has done unto them. Rivlin's book in
this sense is a kind of moral portrait of America today. We are a
country that worships the entrepreneurial killer instinct even as
it makes the collective flesh crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, all the big companies, all the companies that have
won, are run by bloodthirsty killers,'' Mitchell Kertzman, the
president of Sybase, a Silicon Valley software company, told
Rivlin. But Rivlin's message goes further than that. ``Even those
who can't stand Microsoft's business practices and find its
gluttonous eating habits revolting might wish they had invested
$10,000 in Microsoft stock in 1986,'' he writes. If you had done so
and held on to it, you'd have a holding worth more than $4.5
million now.
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin maintains his hard-headed point of view throughout his
portrait of American capitalism at its most raw and rampant, but
the argument does have some bugs in it. The implication is that the
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft stems more from a
kind of generalized envy of Gates than from the law, but he gives
rather short shrift to the legal case.
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin also asks whether Microsoft has really behaved
differently from other corporate giants in trying to squeeze out
the competition. He gives a couple of examples of other
contemporary companies that have behaved ruthlessly toward their
competitors, including rather small and seemingly harmless
competitors; but his argument here is thin and far from
authoritative.
</P>
<P>
   Rivlin himself sometimes seems caught uncertainly between two
visions of the Gates phenomenon. Mostly he seems to agree with
Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief technology officer, who invented
what he called Captain Ahab's Club. Myhrvold holds that Gates has
been turned by his jealous competitors into a kind of Great White
Whale, mercilessly hunted by unreasoning and demented Captain
Ahabs.

   At other times Rivlin describes a kind of ruthlessness on Gates'
part, an impulse not just to win over his competitors but to
annihilate them, that subverts Myhrvold's comparison. Among the
conclusions one draws from this book is that Gates defeated his
business adversaries even though his products, like the cumbersome,
crash-prone Windows operating system, were not as good as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout, Rivlin lays out all the information, not only
about Gates and Microsoft but also about various other
larger-than-life figures who inhabit the ultra-rich,
ultra-ambitious world of the computer business. His description of
the hate-Gates industry and his intimate glimpses into the
personalities and practices of Silicon Valley are bright and
readable pieces of urban sociology. Rivlin, in other words, has
performed the not inconsiderable task of taking on an already
overworked subject and saying something new not only about it but
about what it reveals about the rest of us.

IRON MAIDEN: A SMALL-TOWN NIGHTMARE STEEPED IN SCARY LITERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of audience members chanted ``Bruce'' in
excited anticipation at a sold-out show on Friday night at the
Hammerstein Ballroom. Bruce Springsteen, it seems, wasn't the only
Bruce in the area reuniting with his former bandmates. Bruce
Dickinson, who led Iron Maiden through its glory years as the
reigning horror-fantasy British heavy-metal act of the '80s, was
performing his first United States show with the group after having
quit to pursue his solo career in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Also rejoining the group was Adrian Smith, the band's
perfectionist guitarist, who left in 1990. Adding extra weight to
an already heavy sound, the band chose to retain Smith's
unpredictable replacement, Janick Gers, making the 1999 incarnation
of Iron Maiden a dense, relentless three-ax affair. Each guitarist
wore a uniform of long hair, muscle shirt and wrist bands, and
turned cowboys-and-Indians metal classics like ``Run to the Hills''
into tag-team blitzes of squealing solos. With the time-tested team
of Smith and Dave Murray pulling the weight, Gers (a foil to the
more serious-minded Dickinson) was free to goof off, playing his
guitar behind his head, hitting the strings with the electric cord,
and swinging the instrument precariously by its strap.
</P>
<P>
   If Bruce Springsteen stands for the small-town dream in all its
complexity, then Iron Maiden represents the small-town nightmare
boiled down to its simplest elements, namely death, power and power
over death. ``The good that men do is buried with their bones, but
the evil that men do lives on,'' Dickinson paraphrased Shakespeare
for the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   With short hair and an energetic but not-very-convincing stage
presence, Dickinson, it must be said, is distinctly lacking in the
evil department these days. In fact, at one point, the crowd
actually seemed to hurt his feelings. When he announced that he was
about to sing a song from one of the band's recent albums, the
audience actually booed him, causing him to falter before beginning
``The Clansman,'' which he stressed was about Scottish freedom
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Though 12 of the band's albums were reissued last year as
well-conceived enhanced CDs, this tour was not to promote an album,
but a computer game, Ed Hunter, named after the band's undead
mascot, Eddie. The show began with projected images promoting the
game and several times, in the Iron Maiden tradition, a giant Eddie
figure stormed the stage, only at one point to be attacked
mischievously by Gers.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour, 18-song, flames-and-flash-pot-filled set ran
across the pages of the band's back catalog: the show-opening,
Winston Churchill-quoting ``Aces High''; the parent-scaring,
Satan-loving ``Number of the Beast''; the gruesome ``Two Minutes to
Midnight,'' and the terrific crowd-participation version of ``Fear
of the Dark.'' But, in the end, with songs inspired by Coleridge,
Miyamoto Musashi, Tennyson, William Golding and Shakespeare (and
lyrics that tend to smack of overwrought Edgar Allen Poe) _ Iron
Maiden is a band more likely to send a fan running to the library
than to the devil.

MOBSTER SAMMY THE BULL REVEALS LIFE IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
 PHOENIX-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 Copyright  1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _Salvatore Gravano, Mafia hit man and Phoenix-area
resident, eyed his visitor with a steely glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you're going to write about Sammy the Bull living here?''
he said in a semi-raspy voice. ``Do you know how many people will
get killed if you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed odd coming from someone responsible for 19 murders,
but the question had merit.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, the turncoat underboss who put John Gotti and 36 other
New York mobsters in prison, had managed to stay underground for
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   He was hiding in sunny Arizona from assassins, from Illinois
cops who offered a reward for sightings, from families of victims
who filed a lawsuit, from the media.
</P>
<P>
   He came for the same reason most everyone else does: to get a
new start.
</P>
<P>
   Most neighbors didn't know the middle-age guy next door was
notorious for robberies, loan-sharking, extortion and homicide.
Employees had no idea their boss once operated a corrupt New York
construction business, rigging bids and running unions.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gravano wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   But, over time, his secret life and identity slowly unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   It happened, in part, because Gravano is sometimes indiscreet.
He has a business, a publicist, a lawyer. U.S. marshals and FBI
agents watch over him.
</P>
<P>
   He tells some people his real name.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knew his identity would be exposed someday.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a modest bungalow, the sort of place a 20-something
bachelor would call home.
</P>
<P>
   There are no family photographs visible, nothing intimate or
interesting other than a life-size dummy used for a punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   A little dog growls and sniffs at strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wears a black muscle shirt, gray sweat pants and dark
shades in a low-light living room.
</P>
<P>
   After small talk, he wonders aloud why his story is worth
telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be so interesting about me? Running a legitimate
business. Being monitored by the government . . . I think it's
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he says, if word gets out, the New York media will
swarm into Arizona, ferreting out every detail of his new life. And
the Mafia might feel compelled to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mob, anytime anybody flips, there's an open contract on
him,'' Gravano says.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he downplays the danger.
</P>
<P>
   There's no real worry about getting whacked, Gravano says,
because he's become pals with FBI agents and U.S. marshals. They
drop by on vacations to Arizona. He talks to their wives by phone.
Besides, the Mafia has been so thoroughly infiltrated that the feds
would know who ordered a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mob is smart enough that when they do something, they
wanna get away with it,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, a stocky, muscular man who seems younger than his 54
years, oozes bravado. He says he doesn't look under his car or over
his shoulder, doesn't understand fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up in a lifestyle,'' he says. ``There's 30,000 cops
in New York. Every time you go out, you don't know if you're coming
back. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a boxer. I know what it's like to get hit. I know what
it is to fight. And you lose your fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go to Montana and live 20 years in a cabin and be
scared to death. Or I can live here, where I'm happy, five years. I
choose to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano pauses, smiles. ``When it happens, it happens. If they
start shooting, then I'll be a little scared.'' &QL; 
A NEW IDENTITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull arrived here as an inmate in the Federal
Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Upon release, he was given a new identity and background. He
rented an apartment, returned to the construction business, settled
in.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy with the haunting threat of a bullet in the head, life
was tolerable. Until two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The secret died at his construction office amid junkyards and
vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull stormed into the foyer, and with a clenched jaw
confronted an unexpected visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want?'' he demanded. Then, turning heel, he
grunted, ``Follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a back room, Gravano used indelicate terms to vent his
anger about being found out.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't worried about himself, but family members and
employees. Innocent people would suffer. Jobs would be lost,
reputations ruined.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's created a new life in the Phoenix area, and wasn't
going to start over, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia,'' he added. ``I'm
not running from the (expletive) media.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he might tell his story, under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knows about cutting deals. He traded testimony against
La Cosa Nostra for a shortened prison sentence. In 1995, he
completed the five-year term, entered a Witness Protection Program
and got some facial work.
</P>
<P>
   Then he blew the cover by appearing on TV to promote a book:
``Underboss, Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia.''
Coincidentally, a movie version of the story is being rebroadcast
tonight on NBC (Channel 12, KPNX).
</P>
<P>
   With celebrity came infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Gravano's murder victims have sued him for $25
million. The New York attorney general is pursuing book and film
profits. The John Gotti Tribute Page, an Internet site, warned that
Gravano ``may be living next door to you with the government's
blessing.'' And the Combined Counties Police Association of
Illinois posted a $500 reward for sightings of Sammy the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Association President John Flood said it's despicable that an
admitted murderer was unleashed on society after spending fewer
than five years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sammy left the world tomorrow, we could all sit down and
say, `Thank God,' '' Flood added. ``It would be no loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward money went uncollected. Gravano had vanished into
Arizona, the anonymous retirement mecca that attracted a number of
mob bosses over the years, including Joe Bonanno. &QL; 
BEST-KEPT SECRET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wasn't the only one who didn't want his secret out.
</P>
<P>
   Athia Hardt, a public relations woman who represents him, said
the FBI was concerned about his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt, who once worked for Arizona Govs. Bruce Babbitt and Rose
Mofford, also provided a reference: Supervising FBI Agent George
Gabriel, who handled Gravano during Gotti's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call from New York, Gabriel said blowing Gravano's
cover would have one outcome: ``He's a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardt said her client would talk if the newspaper agreed not to
reveal his new name or company, and if it would withhold
information on family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' agreed, on the condition that the deal
would be void if the newspaper found that Gravano or his company
had engaged in corrupt activity in Arizona. &QL; 
NO FEAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the 2{-hour interview in Gravano's apartment, Hardt sips
red wine. Attorney Thayne Lowe lies on the floor to ease the pain
of a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull lights a cigarette and worries aloud about family
members. He says they are the main reason he sought refuge here,
along with the weather and relatively mob-free environment.
</P>
<P>
   Though he hasn't been threatened here, Gravano figures the Mafia
knows his whereabouts. FBI agents agree, saying he is too casual
about his cover.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano quit the Witness Protection Program nine months after
getting out of prison. (``Too many restrictions. You couldn't have
contact with your family or anybody.'')
</P>
<P>
   And though he had plastic surgery, the face didn't change much.
(``I asked the doctor if I could look like Robert Redford, do it.
But he said, `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano settled for repairs to his boxer's nose and some minor
liposuction. The result: Strangers still recognize him on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come right over to me,'' Gravano says, proudly. ``Some
shake my hand and congratulate me for what I did. Some want an
autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that more than 300 Phoenix area residents know his
real identity. Sometimes, he even tells people.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says he recently ruined a business deal by coming clean
with a prospective partner. He shrugs, adding, ``We thought it was
ethical and right to let them know.'' &QL; 
A MORAL MAFIOSO? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ethical mobster.
</P>
<P>
   That theme is the fabric of Sammy the Bull's tale.
</P>
<P>
   He talks indignantly about the treachery of others. When told it
seems curious for a man who murdered 18 or 19 people to complain of
deceit, he interrupts to clarify the precise number _ ``It was 19''
_ then tells a story.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano and Gotti were trying to decide what to do about a Mafia
associate who was snitching to the cops. Gotti wanted to enlist a
homosexual who could destroy the traitor's credibility by accusing
him of being gay. Gravano was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `No, John, we don't do that. We're family. He's
one of us. We should just go kill him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano views his homicidal history in a cultural context, like
the moral relativism of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a guy (on TV) who dropped a bomb on Hiroshima,'' he
says. ``Killed 100,000 people in one day. What's that about?''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, in the 2{-hour interview, Gravano boasts that
each of his murders was coldblooded. It may seem repugnant to
mainstream American values, but he adhered to the oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never killed anybody in a fit of rage,'' Gravano says.
``Everybody I killed was planned. I'm a hit man, not a serial
killer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these things, I didn't want to do. I felt I did the
right thing in La Cosa Nostra. I was loyal to the life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was even a good person within the mob. I was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says the killing is behind him. As an ex-Mafioso, a
friend of the law, his code has changed.
</P>
<P>
   That transition came when Gravano realized that Gotti was
setting him up as a fall guy. Gravano insists that it was Gotti,
not him, who violated the brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never betrayed anybody in my life first,'' he adds. ``But if
I'm betrayed, I become a good betrayer. Go ask John.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says dozens of others took plea deals and testified,
helping to put 37 criminals behind bars. He seems puzzled about
getting all the credit, or blame.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sammy the Bull flashes a winking grin and says, ``I was the
smartest, best-looking, most charismatic of the underbosses who
flipped.'' &QL; 
MAN OF PARADOXES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gravano is an avid chess player.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys talking to young people, helping them with their
problems. He goes fishing and takes in a ballgame occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he works, rising at 5 a.m. and putting in 12-hour
days. Gravano says he's always been a workaholic with ideas racing
through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the wheeling and dealing, the business, the
whirlwind,'' he adds. ``I think up deals every other minute.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gravano is a contradictory goodfellow.
</P>
<P>
   Once a garrulous gangster, he lives alone with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   He traded Mafia cronies for law enforcement chums.
</P>
<P>
   He says the FBI doesn't need his help anymore. Then, moments
later, he declares, ``I have everything to offer the government.
They'd be totally retarded not to deal with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims not to care what people think of him, yet helped write
a book to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says life in the Mafia was always stressful. Prison was
intolerable, but it mellowed him. Now, he is content in a stuffy
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bunked in. See the brick on the walls? It's like a cell.
I'm comfortable again.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor knocks on the back door and delivers a cup of
Starbucks coffee. He smiles and talks of friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think good people, if they see you're really not a threat,
they'll protect you,'' Sammy the Bull adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy right now. I'm a boss. Of my family. Of my
friends. Of my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims he was offered an acting slot on ``The Sopranos,''an
HBO show that satirizes the New York mob. The script called for
Sammy the Bull to appear in several broadcasts as a hit man, then
get killed off. He turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   As for La Cosa Nostra, he says the government has delivered a
nearly mortal blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wrecked the mob all over the country. I don't think
they're anywhere near finished. They're letting up too early. But
they really hurt the mob.'' &QL; 
Sammy to the core
</P>
<P>
   Through all the changes, Gotti claims he's held true to
relationships and integrity. That's why he turned on Gotti, and why
he respects the FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were straight up people,'' Gravano says. ``I never caught
them in a lie, and I'm really good at that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Have my values changed? No. You can't change what you are
inside. A leopard doesn't change his spots.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site dedicated to Gotti uses a different mammalian
metaphor for Gravano: ``rat bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes a psychological evaluation that says Sammy the Bull
suffers from a ``severe character pathology: The likelihood of
violent behavior is substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano shrugs off the criticism, living day to day.
</P>
<P>
   He moves every eight or nine months.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for people to trust. Of all the hardships, he says
giving up his name was among the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I lost my identity for a while, but I found it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who is he today? Mobster, government informer, ex-con or
businessman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Sammy,'' he says with a wily smile. ``Sammy to the
core.'' &QL;

   When David Andre noticed that the Windows NT operating system
would not allow him to set the date on the clock of his Toshiba
510CDT laptop past 2079, he performed a dangerous experiment: He
set the time to 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31, 2079, and let the clock roll
over to 2080.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big mistake,'' Andre, a graduate student in computer
science at the University of California at Berkeley, said last
week. ``I'm stuck with my laptop in complete failure mode because I
can't get Windows NT to boot. I have to reinstall NT and all of my
software.''
</P>
<P>
   Two nuggets of wisdom can be gleaned from Andre's experience:
certainly, that one should exercise caution when toying with the
date settings on computers, but more important, that the
much-vaunted millennium, or Y2K, problem is just the first of what
will prove to be a nasty legacy of time bombs in the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even scarier, while the time of detonation is known for some of
these bombs, others are deeply imbedded in programs and even
operating systems where they may give no advance warning.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are beginning to voice concern that date-related
computer problems are more pervasive than anyone had realized and
will continue to plague generations of users well past Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there's been programming, there have been
date-related issues,'' said Uche Ogbuji, a consultant and
co-founder of Fourthought LLC. ``Y2K has gotten the most attention,
but the rest are not going to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the Year 2000 issue, most date-related problems result
from using a limited number of digits to represent the time and
date on a computer. Eventually, the limit is reached, forcing the
date to wrap around to zero, which, in effect, makes computer
programs suddenly jump backward in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parts of operating systems and programs depend on time
advancing forward,'' said John Kubiatowicz, a professor of computer
science at Berkeley. ``These bugs cause time to go backward, which
really screws things up.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-known of these problems, named Y2038, affects machines
that run the Unix operating system _ which includes most of the
powerful computers that sort and route packets of data through the
Internet. Unix stores time as the number of seconds elapsed since
Jan. 1, 1970, the beginning of the decade in which it was invented
at Bell Labs. Unfortunately, some Unix-based computers will run out
of space to store these seconds at 3:14:07 a.m. on Jan. 19, 2038.
</P>
<P>
   Why should anyone fret about a problem more than 38 years hence?
</P>
<P>
   First, because seemingly distant dates can have a very near-term
impact. Payments on a 30-year mortgage issued in 2009, for example,
must be calculated beyond the rollover date for Unix machines.
</P>
<P>
   And second, software tends to be stubbornly persistent.
Programmers assumed back in 1970 that by the millennium, the code
they were writing would have been long replaced. But it turns out
that while hardware gets updated regularly, old software often
becomes the foundation on which new programs are built. The Year
2000 problem is with us because layers of software have been laid
down by thousands of programmers over the last 40 years, and the
top layers are almost invariably vulnerable to the vagaries of the
bottom layers _ in this case to a hardware limit that disappeared
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Date problems with Microsoft Corp.'s operating systems and
application programs may prove to be more serious than those of
Unix, some experts say. That is because unlike Unix programs, which
all represent time in the same way, Microsoft's programs have been
cobbled together over decades from many sources, and time
representations vary widely. As a result, the Web sites Microsoft
has built to help customers deal with clock-related problems show
program expiration dates ranging from 1999 to ``future centuries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disaster waiting to happen,'' Kubiatowicz said of
Microsoft's expiration dates. ``Almost every year is a panic year
because something else will expire.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Microsoft itself appear to be sure what to expect _ or
when to expect it. For example, one of its Web sites originally
listed a 2099 limit for Windows NT _ 20 years beyond the date that
wiped out Andre's machine.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned about many of the product date limits posted on
Microsoft Web sites _ including a 2099 limit for Windows NT _ Don
Jones, who heads the company's Year 2000 compliance effort, said
the warnings were ``out of date'' and would be removed. And indeed,
several Web sites mentioning date limits disappeared or changed
within 24 hours of the interview.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked what the correct date limits were for Microsoft's
popular Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems,
Jones said, ``To my knowledge, they will work indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not explain Andre's problem. And while it is
true that software embedded in the computer's basic input-output
system, or BIOS, could also be the cause of such a failure, Toshiba
says its laptop runs to 2099 with other operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Jones did confirm, however, that the Microsoft programming
language Visual C++ measures time as seconds elapsed since Jan. 1,
1900, and will roll over to zero in 2036. Because Visual C++ is
among the most popular languages in use today, many applications
being written throughout the industry today could fail in that
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone uses Microsoft programming tools,'' Andre
said. ``While we have 36 years to fix it, it may take us 34 years
to make it a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Some date-related glitches are just careless programming. For
example, leap years occur every fourth year that is not a multiple
of 100 _ unless it is a multiple of 400. Thus, while 1900 was not a
leap year, 2000 is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many programmers forget this,'' Fourthought's Ogbuji said. ``I
myself have made that mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Software with this error may ``forget'' that Feb. 29, 2000,
exists, causing enormous potential headaches with, for example,
financial software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Excel 97 has the opposite problem: It recognizes 2000
as a leap year, but incorrectly thinks that 1900 was one as well,
causing problems with historical data.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Microsoft's persistent date errors are more laughable
than serious. Through the last three versions of its Outlook
program, Microsoft has calculated the wrong day for Thanksgiving _
and each year a different wrong day. This year the holiday, which
always falls on the fourth Thursday of November, will be celebrated
at Microsoft on Tuesday, Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   But other problems are more serious. Kubiatowicz predicts that
software problems dealing with past dates will eventually become
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are still relatively young,'' he said. ``But at some
point they'll be old enough that there will be 100-year-old files
that people care about.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry is already addressing some long-term
issues. The newest generation of Unix machines, for example, will
not run out of clock space for at least another 200 billion years _
long after the sun has swallowed up the earth.

YADDO ARCHIVES, BOUGHT BY NEW YORK LIBRARY, REVEAL THE CREATIVE
PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the race track is quiet, visitors to Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., sometimes wander over to the 400-acre wooded estate
nearby known as Yaddo, the renowned artists' retreat. But they can
only peek inside. While Yaddo's rose garden is open to the public,
its 55-room turn-of-the-century mansion and surrounding studios are
off limits to everyone but the writers and artists who go there
seeking uninterrupted time to think and to create.
</P>
<P>
   But cultural voyeurs will soon have their day, at least
vicariously.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Public Library is to announce Monday that it has
acquired Yaddo's archives. For the first time the applications,
evaluations, letters, photographs and other memorabilia of
thousands of famous (and some not-so-famous) Yaddo residents will
be available to the public, once they are moved, organized and
cataloged.
</P>
<P>
   Both institutions declined to say how much the library paid for
the archives, whose value is estimated at about $1 million. The
Morris and Alma Schapiro Fund, a New York foundation, gave the
library a grant to cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Yaddo's archives relate an important chapter of American
cultural history. Sylvia Plath, Milton Avery, Hannah Arendt, Meyer
Schapiro, Philip Guston, Aaron Copeland, Virgil Thompson and Philip
Roth are just a few of the artists who spent time at Yaddo. More
recently, A.M. Holmes, Rick Moody, Polly Apfelbaum and Todd Solondz
have, too.
</P>
<P>
   The archives reveal something about each of them. There is, for
example, a 1954 letter from Lionel Trilling calling James Baldwin
``one of the best and most promising men of his generation,'' along
with a 1949 letter from Katherine Anne Porter (on her trademark
periwinkle-blue stationery) belittling the talents of Truman
Capote. It begins, ``The guest list is very superior, no Capotes,
for one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the applications there is one written on May 31, 1938, by
Leonard Bernstein, still a student at Harvard, citing a long list
of people who would recommend him (including Copeland). And there
is one written in April 1933 by 21-year-old John Cheever saying his
proposed residency was Malcolm Cowley's idea and stating that
``other than Malcolm's word and a few published stories, I have
little to recommend me.''
</P>
<P>
   (Yaddo did not accommodate either in those years, but Bernstein
made the cut in 1952 and Cheever went many times beginning in 1934,
first as a caretaker, and he considered it his home during the
1930s.)
</P>
<P>
   The collection, really a history of Yaddo since two wealthy New
Yorkers, Katrina and Spencer Trask, conceived of it 100 years ago,
also documents a wrenching moment in 1949 when the poet Robert
Lowell plunged Yaddo into the hysteria of the communist witch
hunts. He charged that the executive director, Elizabeth Ames, was
a leader of a communist conspiracy because Agnes Smedley, the
pro-communist writer, had lived there. Ms. Ames was cleared by
Yaddo's directors and remained in her post until 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The records shed light on racial relations in 1942 with a letter
from the owner of a pub called the New Worden in Saratoga Springs,
who wrote to Ms. Ames granting permission for Langston Hughes,
``the colored writer,'' to enter as long as he was accompanied by
someone else from Yaddo.
</P>
<P>
   Many artists made breakthroughs or did important work there.
Clyfford Still once said the environment gave him the opportunity
for intense artistic probing, adding, ``I realized I would have to
paint my way out of the classical European heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   One envelope in the archive, addressed to Ms. Ames, contains a
play by Carson McCullers called ``Marvelous, to the Millionth
Power,'' which is an early draft of her 1957 Broadway play ``The
Square Root of Wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know this existed,'' said Paul LeClerc, the
library's president. ``And I wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot
more like that in there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There are also eight filing cabinets of ``Never Yaddo Guests''
files, kept separate from other files only since 1980. In it are
applications from people who were rejected (no prominent names
could immediately be found) as well as from people like Jasper
Johns, who was accepted but could not come because his dealer, Leo
Castelli, had scheduled a show for him in New York.
</P>
<P>
   LeClerc said he was immediately interested when Yaddo approached
him about acquiring its records in 1997. The library has maintained
literary and cultural archives since its inception in 1895, and
they now include the records of The New Yorker magazine; the
publisher Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux and many writers. ``When the
history of the 20th century is written, we want to be in a position
of being the greatest repository in America of documents that shed
light on the culture of our nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LeClerc sent Mimi Bowling, curator of manuscripts at the
library, to Saratoga Springs for a few days to see exactly what is
in the Yaddo files. ``Her reaction was enthusiastic, and it was a
hands-down decision,'' LeClerc said.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment at Yaddo was identical. Michael G. Sundell,
Yaddo's president, said that when its board decided to sell the
archives for scholarly reasons, it wanted them to go to the New
York Public Library, where they would be easily accessible to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not able to preserve the material properly,'' Sundell
said. ``We don't have climate control or acid-free folders, and we
have papers that are 50 and 100 years old that are deteriorating.''
Yaddo could have invested in preservation, he added, ``but we can't
give access to the archives even if we did, because it would ruin
the tranquillity of the place. And we have to carry out our
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well with preservation and cataloging, the Yaddo
material will be available in 2001 in the library's rare books and
manuscripts reading room, adjacent to the main reading room, in the
building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Yaddo, meanwhile, will be richer in cash, which Sundell said
would go into its campaign to establish an $8.5 million endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the $3 million raised in that effort so far comes
from one source, a bequest from the novelist Patricia Highsmith,
who died in 1995. Her decision to apply to Yaddo had involved
Capote, as documented in the archives. As Sundell tells the story,
she went for her first and only time in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Then 27, Highsmith was working in a department store in New York
and needed time to complete her first novel, ``Strangers on a
Train.'' Capote, then 23, who was her friend, lacked an apartment.
He had been to Yaddo 18 months earlier and suggested, with an
ulterior motive, that she go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said Capote said, `I will get you in if I can use your
apartment while you're there,''' Sundell said. ``And he did write a
letter recommending her.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaddo was founded in 1900, when Mrs. Trask, an author, and her
husband, a financier, created a trust establishing their home in
Saratoga Springs as an artists' retreat after their deaths. He died
in 1909, she in 1922, and Yaddo opened to artists in the summer of
1926.
</P>
<P>
   Their personal papers, correspondence, household and business
records and memorabilia, all in the archives, record their social
world and that of Saratoga. Also in the holdings are thousands of
the Trasks' photographs, including four rare autochromes made with
an early photographic process on glass, and 14 ``brown wax''
cylinder recordings from the 1890s that are believed to hold the
voices of people speaking and the playing of musical instruments at
Yaddo.
</P>
<P>
   Yaddo receives about 1,000 applications a year and accepts
almost 200 of the applicants for residencies lasting five weeks to
two months. Peer panels in four disciplines (visual arts,
literature, musical composition, and performing arts and film) make
the decisions. Usually, Sundell said, ``40 to 50 percent are
rejected out of hand.'' The best of the rest are invited as guests,
and others go on a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   To nurture creativity, Yaddo asks residents to observe quiet
hours daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and again after 10 p.m., prime
time for working. There is no television or radio (though guests
may bring their own); there are no organized programs. But the
artists do come together for communal breakfasts and dinners. (The
menu for Christmas Eve 1953: ``Clear vegetable soup, baked ham,
mayonnaise sauce, parsley potato balls, beet salad and rice pudding
with strawberry jelly.'')
</P>
<P>
   The artists also do a lot of socializing (by invitation only
during quiet time). Rowdy behavior is hardly unheard of. Marc
Blitzstein, the composer, staged a cocktail party in his studio in
1939 that included Gypsy Rose Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Delmore Schwartz, the poet, was married just a few days before
he was accepted, and _ contrary to rules _ he sneaked his wife in,
hiding her in his bedroom and cadging food from the dining room to
feed her. Eventually Ms. Ames found out, took pity and allowed her
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Several times Bernstein created a stir with loud, dramatic calls
from the telephone booth. Once he was heard calling Hollywood to
talk to Shelley Winters, interspersing ``Shelley, dear'' and
``Shelley, darling'' with pleas that he ``simply had to have her''
for his next production, which was at Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Many Yaddo guests, including Cheever and Porter, maintained long
correspondences with Ms. Ames, sometimes getting very personal.
McCullers, who had married an alcoholic, Reese McCullers, divorced
him, remarried him and endured his suicide, and whose tormented
love life included affairs with men and women, wrote (probably in
1943), ``In the end I expect that I will find again that I am not
meant to have a certain kind of love, and that I must not try to
escape the loneliness that it seems God has marked out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it went at Yaddo, and in all likelihood will continue to
go there, and at the library. ``One of the nice things is that the
library has acquired stuff that doesn't exist yet, up until 2026,''
Sundell said. ``It'll keep growing.''

MOBSTER SAMMY THE BULL REVEALS LIFE IN ARIZONA

 PHOENIX-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX _Salvatore Gravano, Mafia hit man and Phoenix-area
resident, eyed his visitor with a steely glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you're going to write about Sammy the Bull living here?''
he said in a semi-raspy voice. ``Do you know how many people will
get killed if you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed odd coming from someone responsible for 19 murders,
but the question had merit.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, the turncoat underboss who put John Gotti and 36 other
New York mobsters in prison, had managed to stay underground for
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   He was hiding in sunny Arizona from assassins, from Illinois
cops who offered a reward for sightings, from families of victims
who filed a lawsuit, from the media.
</P>
<P>
   He came for the same reason most everyone else does: to get a
new start.
</P>
<P>
   Most neighbors didn't know the middle-age guy next door was
notorious for robberies, loan-sharking, extortion and homicide.
Employees had no idea their boss once operated a corrupt New York
construction business, rigging bids and running unions.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gravano wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   But, over time, his secret life and identity slowly unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   It happened, in part, because Gravano is sometimes indiscreet.
He has a business, a publicist, a lawyer. U.S. marshals and FBI
agents watch over him.
</P>
<P>
   He tells some people his real name.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knew his identity would be exposed someday.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a modest bungalow, the sort of place a 20-something
bachelor would call home.
</P>
<P>
   There are no family photographs visible, nothing intimate or
interesting other than a life-size dummy used for a punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   A little dog growls and sniffs at strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wears a black muscle shirt, gray sweat pants and dark
shades in a low-light living room.
</P>
<P>
   After small talk, he wonders aloud why his story is worth
telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be so interesting about me? Running a legitimate
business. Being monitored by the government . . . I think it's
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he says, if word gets out, the New York media will
swarm into Arizona, ferreting out every detail of his new life. And
the Mafia might feel compelled to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mob, anytime anybody flips, there's an open contract on
him,'' Gravano says.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he downplays the danger.
</P>
<P>
   There's no real worry about getting whacked, Gravano says,
because he's become pals with FBI agents and U.S. marshals. They
drop by on vacations to Arizona. He talks to their wives by phone.
Besides, the Mafia has been so thoroughly infiltrated that the feds
would know who ordered a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mob is smart enough that when they do something, they
wanna get away with it,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, a stocky, muscular man who seems younger than his 54
years, oozes bravado. He says he doesn't look under his car or over
his shoulder, doesn't understand fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up in a lifestyle,'' he says. ``There's 30,000 cops
in New York. Every time you go out, you don't know if you're coming
back. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a boxer. I know what it's like to get hit. I know what
it is to fight. And you lose your fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go to Montana and live 20 years in a cabin and be
scared to death. Or I can live here, where I'm happy, five years. I
choose to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano pauses, smiles. ``When it happens, it happens. If they
start shooting, then I'll be a little scared.'' &QL; 
A NEW IDENTITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull arrived here as an inmate in the Federal
Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Upon release, he was given a new identity and background. He
rented an apartment, returned to the construction business, settled
in.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy with the haunting threat of a bullet in the head, life
was tolerable. Until two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The secret died at his construction office amid junkyards and
vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull stormed into the foyer, and with a clenched jaw
confronted an unexpected visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want?'' he demanded. Then, turning heel, he
grunted, ``Follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a back room, Gravano used indelicate terms to vent his
anger about being found out.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't worried about himself, but family members and
employees. Innocent people would suffer. Jobs would be lost,
reputations ruined.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's created a new life in the Phoenix area, and wasn't
going to start over, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia,'' he added. ``I'm
not running from the (expletive) media.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he might tell his story, under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knows about cutting deals. He traded testimony against
La Cosa Nostra for a shortened prison sentence. In 1995, he
completed the five-year term, entered a Witness Protection Program
and got some facial work.
</P>
<P>
   Then he blew the cover by appearing on TV to promote a book:
``Underboss, Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia.''
Coincidentally, a movie version of the story is being rebroadcast
tonight on NBC (Channel 12, KPNX).
</P>
<P>
   With celebrity came infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Gravano's murder victims have sued him for $25
million. The New York attorney general is pursuing book and film
profits. The John Gotti Tribute Page, an Internet site, warned that
Gravano ``may be living next door to you with the government's
blessing.'' And the Combined Counties Police Association of
Illinois posted a $500 reward for sightings of Sammy the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Association President John Flood said it's despicable that an
admitted murderer was unleashed on society after spending fewer
than five years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sammy left the world tomorrow, we could all sit down and
say, `Thank God,' '' Flood added. ``It would be no loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward money went uncollected. Gravano had vanished into
Arizona, the anonymous retirement mecca that attracted a number of
mob bosses over the years, including Joe Bonanno. &QL; 
BEST-KEPT SECRET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wasn't the only one who didn't want his secret out.
</P>
<P>
   Athia Hardt, a public relations woman who represents him, said
the FBI was concerned about his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt, who once worked for Arizona Govs. Bruce Babbitt and Rose
Mofford, also provided a reference: Supervising FBI Agent George
Gabriel, who handled Gravano during Gotti's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call from New York, Gabriel said blowing Gravano's
cover would have one outcome: ``He's a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardt said her client would talk if the newspaper agreed not to
reveal his new name or company, and if it would withhold
information on family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' agreed, on the condition that the deal
would be void if the newspaper found that Gravano or his company
had engaged in corrupt activity in Arizona. &QL; 
NO FEAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the 2{-hour interview in Gravano's apartment, Hardt sips
red wine. Attorney Thayne Lowe lies on the floor to ease the pain
of a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull lights a cigarette and worries aloud about family
members. He says they are the main reason he sought refuge here,
along with the weather and relatively mob-free environment.
</P>
<P>
   Though he hasn't been threatened here, Gravano figures the Mafia
knows his whereabouts. FBI agents agree, saying he is too casual
about his cover.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano quit the Witness Protection Program nine months after
getting out of prison. (``Too many restrictions. You couldn't have
contact with your family or anybody.'')
</P>
<P>
   And though he had plastic surgery, the face didn't change much.
(``I asked the doctor if I could look like Robert Redford, do it.
But he said, `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano settled for repairs to his boxer's nose and some minor
liposuction. The result: Strangers still recognize him on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come right over to me,'' Gravano says, proudly. ``Some
shake my hand and congratulate me for what I did. Some want an
autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that more than 300 Phoenix area residents know his
real identity. Sometimes, he even tells people.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says he recently ruined a business deal by coming clean
with a prospective partner. He shrugs, adding, ``We thought it was
ethical and right to let them know.'' &QL; 
A MORAL MAFIOSO? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ethical mobster.
</P>
<P>
   That theme is the fabric of Sammy the Bull's tale.
</P>
<P>
   He talks indignantly about the treachery of others. When told it
seems curious for a man who murdered 18 or 19 people to complain of
deceit, he interrupts to clarify the precise number _ ``It was 19''
_ then tells a story.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano and Gotti were trying to decide what to do about a Mafia
associate who was snitching to the cops. Gotti wanted to enlist a
homosexual who could destroy the traitor's credibility by accusing
him of being gay. Gravano was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `No, John, we don't do that. We're family. He's
one of us. We should just go kill him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano views his homicidal history in a cultural context, like
the moral relativism of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a guy (on TV) who dropped a bomb on Hiroshima,'' he
says. ``Killed 100,000 people in one day. What's that about?''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, in the 2{-hour interview, Gravano boasts that
each of his murders was coldblooded. It may seem repugnant to
mainstream American values, but he adhered to the oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never killed anybody in a fit of rage,'' Gravano says.
``Everybody I killed was planned. I'm a hit man, not a serial
killer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these things, I didn't want to do. I felt I did the
right thing in La Cosa Nostra. I was loyal to the life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was even a good person within the mob. I was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says the killing is behind him. As an ex-Mafioso, a
friend of the law, his code has changed.
</P>
<P>
   That transition came when Gravano realized that Gotti was
setting him up as a fall guy. Gravano insists that it was Gotti,
not him, who violated the brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never betrayed anybody in my life first,'' he adds. ``But if
I'm betrayed, I become a good betrayer. Go ask John.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says dozens of others took plea deals and testified,
helping to put 37 criminals behind bars. He seems puzzled about
getting all the credit, or blame.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sammy the Bull flashes a winking grin and says, ``I was the
smartest, best-looking, most charismatic of the underbosses who
flipped.'' &QL; 
MAN OF PARADOXES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gravano is an avid chess player.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys talking to young people, helping them with their
problems. He goes fishing and takes in a ballgame occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he works, rising at 5 a.m. and putting in 12-hour
days. Gravano says he's always been a workaholic with ideas racing
through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the wheeling and dealing, the business, the
whirlwind,'' he adds. ``I think up deals every other minute.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gravano is a contradictory goodfellow.
</P>
<P>
   Once a garrulous gangster, he lives alone with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   He traded Mafia cronies for law enforcement chums.
</P>
<P>
   He says the FBI doesn't need his help anymore. Then, moments
later, he declares, ``I have everything to offer the government.
They'd be totally retarded not to deal with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims not to care what people think of him, yet helped write
a book to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says life in the Mafia was always stressful. Prison was
intolerable, but it mellowed him. Now, he is content in a stuffy
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bunked in. See the brick on the walls? It's like a cell.
I'm comfortable again.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor knocks on the back door and delivers a cup of
Starbucks coffee. He smiles and talks of friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think good people, if they see you're really not a threat,
they'll protect you,'' Sammy the Bull adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy right now. I'm a boss. Of my family. Of my
friends. Of my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims he was offered an acting slot on ``The Sopranos,''an
HBO show that satirizes the New York mob. The script called for
Sammy the Bull to appear in several broadcasts as a hit man, then
get killed off. He turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   As for La Cosa Nostra, he says the government has delivered a
nearly mortal blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wrecked the mob all over the country. I don't think
they're anywhere near finished. They're letting up too early. But
they really hurt the mob.'' &QL; 
Sammy to the core
</P>
<P>
   Through all the changes, Gotti claims he's held true to
relationships and integrity. That's why he turned on Gotti, and why
he respects the FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were straight up people,'' Gravano says. ``I never caught
them in a lie, and I'm really good at that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Have my values changed? No. You can't change what you are
inside. A leopard doesn't change his spots.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site dedicated to Gotti uses a different mammalian
metaphor for Gravano: ``rat bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes a psychological evaluation that says Sammy the Bull
suffers from a ``severe character pathology: The likelihood of
violent behavior is substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano shrugs off the criticism, living day to day.
</P>
<P>
   He moves every eight or nine months.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for people to trust. Of all the hardships, he says
giving up his name was among the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I lost my identity for a while, but I found it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who is he today? Mobster, government informer, ex-con or
businessman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Sammy,'' he says with a wily smile. ``Sammy to the
core.'' &QL;

MAINSTREAM TV BETS ON `GROSS-OUT' HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Wis., Wash.)  (jw) 
 By BILL CARTER and LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This summer, the movies have been filled with crude language,
bathroom humor and sex scenes that include the defiling of an apple
pie. Brace yourself for the fall television season.
</P>
<P>
   The trend that has turned vulgarity and bodily functions into
big-screen entertainment will spread to mainstream television in
September, with the premiere of a Fox network comedy called
``Action.'' The pilot contains the first all-out barrage of
four-letter words ever unleashed on broadcast television _ all of
them bleeped out, but easy enough to lip read _ and such moments as
a prostitute putting her hand down the trousers of a movie star and
a father discussing the size of his sex organ with his preteen
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of what some television executives and social
scientists see as the rapid disappearance of most taste and
language restrictions in mass media, a trend fueled by shifting
standards of what is socially acceptable _ and what, for the
television industry, is deemed to be financially necessary.
</P>
<P>
   As Doug Herzog, the president of Fox Entertainment put it:
``This is all happening because society is evolving and changing.
But the bottom line is, people seem to be buying it.''
</P>
<P>
   The main buyers, the audience at the center of this wave of what
the industry calls gross-out entertainment, are boys and men under
25. Not only has this group established itself as the most loyal to
Hollywood movies _ because of a desire to be the first to see the
hip new film and a willingness to go back and see it several more
times. It is the group favored by a long list of television
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, never before have the age-old elements of
adolescent male humor _ body functions, scatology and coarse
language _ dominated such a broad swath of American popular
culture. The reason is scarcity; younger males traditionally watch
less television than any other group.
</P>
<P>
   And yet this young male audience is willing to spend ``a lot of
disposable income'' on entertainment, said Gene DeWitt, chairman of
DeWitt Media, a firm that buys advertising time on television.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many areas of entertainment, especially
television, are being fragmented into smaller and smaller niches
defined by gender, age and tastes. As a result, producers and
programmers who formerly sought to smooth the roughest edges of
comedy in order to reach as many viewers as possible without giving
offense, now are free to target young men with the kind of
entertainment they most enjoy: gross-out comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For adolescent males, there has always been an appeal in
things they are told are not appropriate, and gross-out humor is
one of those things,'' said Joanne Cantor, a professor of
communication arts at the University of Wisconsin, who researches
issues involving television and children.
</P>
<P>
   This humor has disproportionate influence because young men
serve as ``the barometer of new comedy,'' said Herzog, who before
moving to News Corp.'s Fox unit was head of Comedy Central, owned
by Time Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc., which gave the world that
seminal gross-out series, the animated ``South Park'' (now one of
the summer's leading gross-out movies). ``From David Letterman to
Conan O'Brien to Chris Rock, young men found them first. A channel
like Comedy Central is naturally going to build itself as a guy
channel.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, several executives suggested, the public has
become desensitized to sexual and scatological material because of
mass exposure to news stories like President Clinton's relationship
with Monica S. Lewinsky, with its open discussions of oral sex and
cigars as sex toys.
</P>
<P>
   In popular entertainment, this new freedom of raunchy expression
has recently brought, in movies and on television, such previously
uncontemplated sights and sounds as:
</P>
<P>
   -- A teen-ager using an apple pie to masturbate in the film
``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A talk show host vomiting into a toilet on the ``Tom Green
Show'' on the MTV network.
</P>
<P>
   -- A character sipping from a beverage made of excrement in the
film ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A teen-age boy captured on a stadium's giant video screen
picking his nose in a television commercial for J.C. Penney jeans.
</P>
<P>
   -- A movie star (Adam Sandler) and his child co-star urinating
in the direction of the Statue of Liberty in a print advertisement
for the movie ``Big Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A host of animated characters, all of them supposedly
children, spewing torrents of foul language in the film ``South
Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A comedian stopping women of all ages in the street and
asking them if they will have sex with him, on ``The Man Show'' on
Comedy Central.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Not every entertainment industry executive is willing to
attribute all this to a hunt for free-spending, heavy-breathing
young men. ``Before it's about getting young men, it's about
getting anybody,'' said one senior Hollywood studio executive,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There's a level of
desperation to all this.''
</P>
<P>
   But young men do seem to be a favorite quarry.
</P>
<P>
   Even the scheduling of ``Action'' fits into the young-male
entertainment cycle. Fox is putting it on Thursday night _ the
biggest night on television for movie advertising, one of the most
lucrative ad categories for television networks. And of course,
many of the movies being advertised are aimed the same male
audience that is the ``Action'' target.
</P>
<P>
   Trying a similar strategy is another Viacom unit, UPN, which has
the lowest Nielsen ratings of the six broadcast networks and is now
trumpeting its desire to attract young males. The network has added
three male-appeal shows for the fall season, including two hours of
a professional wrestling free-for-all show called ``W.W.F.
Smackdown'' _ on Thursdays, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The senior studio executive who spoke of ``desperation'' for
viewers also noted that ``every decade there is some television
show that raises the bar'' on what is acceptable. A quarter-century
ago it was ``Saturday Night Live''; in the mid-1980s it was
``Married With Children'' on Fox, and in the 1990s ``Seinfeld''
broke several rules, especially with an episode involving
masturbation. But most executives agreed that the groundbreaking
``Seinfeld'' episode was handled with a sense of cleverness and
even charm that seemed to be lacking these days.
</P>
<P>
   Some social critics and some television executives assign part
of the blame to the federal law requiring a V-chip censoring device
in new television sets (all new sets must have it by January 2000),
and the parallel development of a ratings system to label shows for
age appropriateness and for violence, sex, foul language or
suggestive dialogue. Though meant to protect children, the labels
and blocking options, these critics say, give producers carte
blanche on vulgar (or violent) content.
</P>
<P>
   Some even worry that the labels will serve as magnets to attract
children. Ms. Cantor of the University of Wisconsin, though, has
found that the ``V'' itself is not the magnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just say it's violent, that doesn't attract most
kids,'' said Ms. Cantor, who has done extensive research on
children's reaction to violence rating labels. ``But if you tell
them they shouldn't watch it, or they're too young for it, that
does.'' That pattern has yet to be adequately tested for other
labels, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of
Washington, cautioned that so-called male adolescent humor does not
appeal only to boys. ``You hang out with some teen-agers today, and
you'll hear young girls say things that would fry your hair,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog notes that the broadcast networks are held to a different
standard than cable networks when to comes to foul language or
sexual content, because the broadcasters are licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission. He pointed out that viewers
seemed to simply accept such things as four-letter words on cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he cited a moment from his days at Comedy
Central, when an episode from ``South Park'' arrived so late it had
to be rushed onto the air the same day. In the television version
of ``South Park,'' the cartoon children frequently utter
four-letter words, but they are bleeped, much in the way Fox is
doing on ``Action.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, when Herzog watched the new episode of ``South
Park'' at his home, however, he heard one character utter the most
common of sexual obscenities, which had gone unbleeped in the rush
to complete the episode. He expected a flood of protests from
viewers. ``We didn't even get one call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, last week during baseball's All-Star Home Run Derby,
which was carried on the ESPN cable network, several players could
clearly be heard shouting obscenities when they failed to drive a
ball out of the park. Herzog surmised that if the event had been
broadcast by NBC or Fox, hundreds of complaints would have been
called in. ESPN reported no calls at all.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Action,'' which was originally designed to play on HBO,
Fox is clearly trying to compete with cable's standards of
vulgarity and sexual explicitness. And of course, the network would
love to see the show establish itself as a Thursday hit with young
male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   And if ``Action'' works? Imitation has always been the sincerest
form of television, as the comedian Fred Allen said long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in moralizing whether this is a good or bad
thing,'' said the advertising executive, DeWitt. ``Television is a
business whose purpose is gathering audiences.''

   BROADBAND-CONFERENCE (New Orleans) _ A look at the status of

   MARTHA'S VINEYARD _ Square-jawed in his state ranger's hat,
Captain Robert Bird was still not ready to concede what the rest of
America had already, reluctantly, concluded _ that 36 hours after
it vanished from radar screen 19 miles off Martha's Vineyard, the
small Piper plane belonging to John F. Kennedy, Jr. was unlikely to
surrender any survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still classified as a search and rescue operation,''
he said without emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, there was still room for hope Sunday. In the summer
months, someone from that plane _ JFK himself, his wife Carolyn
Bessette, and her sister, Lauren Bessette _ might still have been
breathing in those Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   But common sense, and the belongings that had already washed up
on a beach of fine sand on the island's westernmost edge, told a
different tale. JFK, Jr. was surely dead.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, disbelief and grief have struck this land as it takes its
summer vacations _ just as it did Britain when the Princess of
Wales died in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   JFK was not royalty, but he was surely a prince. The only
surviving son of the late President John F. Kennedy, he was also
America's favorite son: impossibly good looking, very rich and a
perennial of gossip headlines and magazine covers.
</P>
<P>
   Even his death _ apparent death _ was more poignant and more
strange than the most fertile of tabloid imaginations could have
mustered.
</P>
<P>
   He and the beautiful wife he married in 1996 were heading for
Massachusetts for a wedding at the place where the American version
of Camelot was born, the Kennedy Compound at Hyannisport on Cape
Cod.
</P>
<P>
   To be wed was Rory Kennedy, the daughter of the late Robert F.
Kennedy, who just 19 months ago watched as her brother, Michael,
died in her arms on a ski slope in Aspen.
</P>
<P>
   And, as everyone on Martha's Vineyard wanted to remind you,
Sunday was the 30th anniversary of the incident on Chappaquiddick
that spawned the first Kennedy scandal, when a car driven by Edward
Kennedy plunged off a bridge killing his passenger, Mary Jo
Kopechne.
</P>
<P>
   This is no ordinary curse that the Kennedys are suffering, it is
a curse with a gruesome sense of historical neatness.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were those pieces of flotsam found by swimmers
and sunbathers just after lunchtime on Saturday: a canvas suitcase
bearing the Morgan Stanley business card of Lauren, a cosmetic bag,
a prescription bottle with the name Carolyn Bessette on the label,
a plane seat, a piece of a strut and the rubber covering from a
pedal.
</P>
<P>
   They all washed up on Philbins Beach _ less than two miles from
the Martha's Vineyard house that JFK inherited from his mother,
Jackie, after she died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It was the bag they spotted first, bobbing in the slight summer
swell. Damon Seligson, 30, from Boston swam out to fetch it. ``We
were standing on the beach, enjoying the day _ a bunch of us were
watching the waves and saw what looked like luggage floating in the
water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that the plane had gone missing, he feared the worst. ``My
heart was pounding. I almost passed out.'' When he retrieved it,
the bag was wet but intact, Lauren's business card still inserted
in a sewn-on pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened it to peek in and saw women's clothing, a makeup bag
and hair dryer. It was a terrible sinking feeling. I felt my heart
burst out of my chest. It was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The search Sunday concentrated in an area of ocean between the
western shore of the Vineyard and tiny No Man's Island 3.5 miles
away. Taking part were ships and aircraft of the U.S. Coast Guard
and the civil air patrol. Above circled a U.S. Air Force C-130
acting as an air traffic control center.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a small plane in a large expanse of water that may
have broken into a thousand pieces. And although the sandy seabed
is only about 300 feet deep _ not too far for divers to venture _
there are areas of large boulder fields that could shield any
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   And there is something else few wanted to talk about Sunday:
these are waters favored during the summer by sharks.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, across just 20 miles of water at Hyannisport on
Cape Cod, the Kennedy family can only wait, the world's press
thronging a few yards from the compound's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend that had meant to be one of joy for a young couple
getting married had not just been ruined, it had become a rehearsal
for a labor the family knows too well _ the labor of tragic loss.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wedding guests were gone by Sunday, leaving behind
only members of the family and a billowing but empty white marquee.
</P>
<P>
   They were, one acquaintance said, holding themselves together.
``It's a kind of stoic optimism,'' he said. ``This is a family that
has been through a lot. You move forward by hope.'' But hope seems
forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Fallen Son,'' said the front page of the Cape Cod Times. In
New York there were 25 pages of JFK in the Post, 24 pages in the
Daily News. Only Diana could beat him on the newsstand.
</P>
<P>
   Now in death, his story resonates with the family tragedies that
came before _ in its sadness and the shock it delivers to America. &QL;

MIT AND HARVARD GIVE BOSTON A NICHE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To meet Boston's technology elite, first finagle an
invitation to one of Robert Metcalfe's parties. His salons, as
Metcalfe _ co-inventor of the computer technology named Ethernet _
calls them, are high-technology schmooze sessions, with perhaps a
string of investors chatting up a chief executive in the hallway or
two entrepreneurs courting a partnership at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But who invited the journalists? On a given night at Metcalfe's
Back Bay home, it is not surprising to find a representative from
the publications of International Data Group in one corner, an
editor of Fast Company in another and staff members from MIT's
Technology Review mingling among the suits.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is full of editors these days, now that the city has
become something of a center for publications about technology and
business.
</P>
<P>
   There are the old-timers like IDG, which started Computer World
magazine here 35 years ago and now produces more than 300
publications, and Inc. magazine, which has called Boston home for
two decades and recently added another publication: Inc.
Technology. Sprinkled around the city are Fast Company, Technology
Review, Harvard Business Review, PC Week, Electronic Business,
Software Magazine and Web Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Why Boston? Some point to the city's rich publishing history and
the historical importance of the loop of high-technology companies
on Route 128, which rings the city. But the real reason can be
summed up in two names: Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why IDG began in Boston, its chief executive, Kelly
Conlin, said, ``The founder went to MIT, and so that was where he
was.'' Conlin himself came to Boston via the Harvard Business
School.
</P>
<P>
   The two universities do supply a pool of talent, says Alan
Webber, a founding editor of the 3-year-old Fast Company, a
business magazine aimed at young professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the same phenomenon as 128 in its heyday, only
applied to information and writing,'' Webber said. ``We've got a
lot of smart people, well-educated people, a lot of people who take
business ideas very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Massachusetts does have its fill of biotechnology
companies, software start-ups and teaching hospitals, which lends
some weight when publishers here say they have a broader economic
base to work with than Wired, Red Herring and their other
chip-focused counterparts out West.
</P>
<P>
   Is it just superciliousness from a coast that lost the battle
for computer supremacy? The Boston magazines cover the goings-on
out West as well, but being away from the ``froth'' of
personalities and issues in Silicon Valley has its advantages,
Webber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a little bit of distance from the personalities,
the issues, the ideas, so we're able to write to an international
business audience without coming directly from Silicon Valley, as
if we were only interested in the goings-on in Silicon Valley,'' he
said. ``You get a little bit better line of sight into the business
and technology if you're not in the belly of the beast.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One magazine that is reveling in the local mix of academia and
industry is MIT's Technology Review. A 100-year-old magazine, it
metamorphosed last year when Bruce Journey, the new publisher, had
the idea of replacing the editor, laying off all but a few members
of the old staff and changing the focus from sometimes Luddite
reviews to more upbeat coverage of innovation in technology,
science and business.
</P>
<P>
   After doing everything short of taking a wrecking ball to the
publication, Journey, a former Fortune executive, then boasted that
he could double the number of readers and triple the ad base.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, it worked. With the dust still settling from the
demolition, the renewed Technology Review is posting a number
better than its own prediction: Circulation has jumped to 205,000
from 92,000.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is gambling in its attempt to mix science and the
marketplace, two sectors that traditionally keep each other at
arm's length. But the economy is good, the ad team aggressive, and
the staff confident that Technology Review will survive, even after
the $2.5 million the MIT alumni association pumped into its renewal
is used up.
</P>
<P>
   In a city the size of Boston, there is bound to be some
publishing incest. Both Webber and William Taylor were editors at
Harvard Business Review before leaving to found Fast Company.
Metcalfe is a pundit for IDG as well as a board member for
Technology Review. With all the sharing of leadership, the big
question is whether there is enough readership to go around.
Metcalfe is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time when technology is being both celebrated and
analyzed,'' he said. ``What a great time.''

   SERVICE SET TO MONITOR THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   A monitoring service called Leading Web Advertisers is being
introduced to provide information about advertising on Web sites.
It will offer subscribers data on which marketers are running ads,
when and where those ads appeared and what they looked like. The
goal is to bring accountability to the Web as ad spending in
cyberspace continues its rapid growth.

<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America's Secure Digital

consumer electronics companies will have to adopt if they want to
make devices that play commercially recorded music. But don't
presume they will be the same a year from now.

<P>
   WILL USERS PAY FOR INTERNET SERVICE?
</P>
<P>
   Internet investors, entrepreneurs and analysts have convinced
one another that the only truly Internet-centered business model is
one in which online users pay nothing for content. But this concept
is starting to crack.

WIRELESS CABLE CARRIERS FINALLY CASH IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The telecommunications industry is not known for
being cyclical, but don't tell that to Matthew Oristano.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, a share of People's Choice TV Corp., a so-called
wireless cable television company based in Shelton, Conn., that
Oristano leads as chief executive, cost as little as 15.625 cents.
On Friday, those shares closed at $9.50. For those of you keeping
score at home, that means that a $500 investment in People's Choice
last fall would be worth more than $30,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   As wild as the last few months have been for Oristano, his story
was not all that unusual here last week at the annual convention
for Wireless Communications Association International, a trade
group for companies that provide television and high-speed data
services using fixed, ground-based (as opposed to satellite-based)
wireless links.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last dozen years, the wireless cable or wireless
broad-band industry has been perhaps the most volatile part of the
telecommunications business. Three years ago, shares of People's
Choice consistently traded in the teens, and in 1993 they topped
$40.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the turmoil, the small wireless cable carriers _
companies like CAI Wireless Systems Inc., CS Wireless Systems Inc.
and Wireless One Inc. _ have never really controlled their own
destiny. As the communications business has evolved from the
relatively clubby business it was in the 1980s into the circus it
is today, the fortunes of the smaller players have been tossed
about, almost capriciously, by the changing plans of the industry's
giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry has gone boom in '87, bust in '92, boom in '93,
bust in '97 and boom again in '99,'' Oristano said on the
convention floor here. ``But I think the industry has received some
validation now.''
</P>
<P>
   It has certainly been a long time coming. In the 1960s and
1970s, the Federal Communications Commission began allocating
blocks of radio frequencies between about 2.5 gigahertz and 2.7
gigahertz to schools, churches, universities and other nonprofit
groups around the country to use for an early form of televised
``distance learning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fairly farsighted initiative by the commission, coming
long before any talk of the communications revolution, and by the
early 1980s just about all the spectrum had been allocated.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one problem. The schools that held many of the
licenses often seemed to have their hands full getting enough
textbooks, leaving little time (not to mention money) for deploying
advanced wireless communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   So over the course of the 1980s, the FCC changed its rules to
permit private companies to consolidate the licenses. The companies
were allowed to acquire some spectrum outright, but much of the
bandwidth had to be leased from the educational institutions. In
exchange, the companies agreed to transmit up to 40 hours of
educational programming each week. It was in that environment that
companies like People's Choice were founded in the late 1980s. By
the time many of the wireless cable carriers got around to offering
shares to the public in the early 1990s, the future looked bright.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless cable operators were offering subscribers 33
channels of analog television, more than enough to compete against
traditional cable systems. Even more important, in the early and
middle part of the decade the Baby Bell regional phone giants were
exploring the possibility of getting into the television business
through joint ventures called Americast and Tele-TV. The Bells
discussed acquiring some of the wireless cable companies in an
effort to propel those ventures, and those discussions propelled
the wireless cable operators' stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells were considering getting into the television business
because the cable television companies were talking about getting
into the local phone business. (Those plans by the cable carriers
were in fact one of the cornerstone assumptions underlying passage
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   But just as the act was passed, the cable companies shifted
focus, concentrating on expanding the number of television channels
on their systems as they faced a looming threat from
direct-broadcast satellite operations like DirecTV. That was bad
for the wireless cable companies in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, it made their 33-channel offerings far less competitive.
Second, it removed the immediate impetus for the Bells to invest in
television. That is why stocks like those of People's Choice became
penny stocks. Other wireless cable companies, including CAI, filed
for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of the local phone companies, Bell Atlantic and SBC
Communications, have since revived their television ambitions, but
they have done so through partnerships with DirecTV rather than by
making acquisitions. At the same time, the beleaguered wireless
cable operators have found a pair of saviors in MCI Worldcom and
Sprint, the big long-distance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Spooked by the prospect of the Bells finally being able to jump
into their core long-distance market, and to some extent impressed
by AT&AMP;T's $90 billion march into the cable television business, MCI
Worldcom and Sprint seized on the wireless cable carriers as a way
to get direct links to homes across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   So just since this spring, Sprint and MCI Worldcom have
committed over $1 billion to acquire almost all of the major
wireless cable carriers. (Perhaps the biggest exception is
Heartland Wireless Communications Inc., which changed its name to
Nucentrix Broadband Networks just as Sprint and MCI Worldcom
embarked on their buying spree.)
</P>
<P>
   And People's Choice? In April, Sprint agreed to acquire it for
$10 a share, just 50 cents below the company's initial offering
price of $10.50.

MOBSTER SAMMY THE BULL REVEALS LIFE IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
 PHOENIX-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 Copyright  1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _Salvatore Gravano, Mafia hit man and Phoenix-area
resident, eyed his visitor with a steely glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you're going to write about Sammy the Bull living here?''
he said in a semi-raspy voice. ``Do you know how many people will
get killed if you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed odd coming from someone responsible for 19 murders,
but the question had merit.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, the turncoat underboss who put John Gotti and 36 other
New York mobsters in prison, had managed to stay underground for
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   He was hiding in sunny Arizona from assassins, from Illinois
cops who offered a reward for sightings, from families of victims
who filed a lawsuit, from the media.
</P>
<P>
   He came for the same reason most everyone else does: to get a
new start.
</P>
<P>
   Most neighbors didn't know the middle-age guy next door was
notorious for robberies, loan-sharking, extortion and homicide.
Employees had no idea their boss once operated a corrupt New York
construction business, rigging bids and running unions.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gravano wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   But, over time, his secret life and identity slowly unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   It happened, in part, because Gravano is sometimes indiscreet.
He has a business, a publicist, a lawyer. U.S. marshals and FBI
agents watch over him.
</P>
<P>
   He tells some people his real name.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knew his identity would be exposed someday.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a modest bungalow, the sort of place a 20-something
bachelor would call home.
</P>
<P>
   There are no family photographs visible, nothing intimate or
interesting other than a life-size dummy used for a punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   A little dog growls and sniffs at strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wears a black muscle shirt, gray sweat pants and dark
shades in a low-light living room.
</P>
<P>
   After small talk, he wonders aloud why his story is worth
telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be so interesting about me? Running a legitimate
business. Being monitored by the government . . . I think it's
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he says, if word gets out, the New York media will
swarm into Arizona, ferreting out every detail of his new life. And
the Mafia might feel compelled to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mob, anytime anybody flips, there's an open contract on
him,'' Gravano says.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he downplays the danger.
</P>
<P>
   There's no real worry about getting whacked, Gravano says,
because he's become pals with FBI agents and U.S. marshals. They
drop by on vacations to Arizona. He talks to their wives by phone.
Besides, the Mafia has been so thoroughly infiltrated that the feds
would know who ordered a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mob is smart enough that when they do something, they
wanna get away with it,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, a stocky, muscular man who seems younger than his 54
years, oozes bravado. He says he doesn't look under his car or over
his shoulder, doesn't understand fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up in a lifestyle,'' he says. ``There's 30,000 cops
in New York. Every time you go out, you don't know if you're coming
back. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a boxer. I know what it's like to get hit. I know what
it is to fight. And you lose your fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go to Montana and live 20 years in a cabin and be
scared to death. Or I can live here, where I'm happy, five years. I
choose to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano pauses, smiles. ``When it happens, it happens. If they
start shooting, then I'll be a little scared.'' &QL; 
A NEW IDENTITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull arrived here as an inmate in the Federal
Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Upon release, he was given a new identity and background. He
rented an apartment, returned to the construction business, settled
in.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy with the haunting threat of a bullet in the head, life
was tolerable. Until two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The secret died at his construction office amid junkyards and
vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull stormed into the foyer, and with a clenched jaw
confronted an unexpected visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want?'' he demanded. Then, turning heel, he
grunted, ``Follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a back room, Gravano used indelicate terms to vent his
anger about being found out.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't worried about himself, but family members and
employees. Innocent people would suffer. Jobs would be lost,
reputations ruined.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's created a new life in the Phoenix area, and wasn't
going to start over, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia,'' he added. ``I'm
not running from the (expletive) media.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he might tell his story, under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knows about cutting deals. He traded testimony against
La Cosa Nostra for a shortened prison sentence. In 1995, he
completed the five-year term, entered a Witness Protection Program
and got some facial work.
</P>
<P>
   Then he blew the cover by appearing on TV to promote a book:
``Underboss, Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia.''
Coincidentally, a movie version of the story is being rebroadcast
tonight on NBC (Channel 12, KPNX).
</P>
<P>
   With celebrity came infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Gravano's murder victims have sued him for $25
million. The New York attorney general is pursuing book and film
profits. The John Gotti Tribute Page, an Internet site, warned that
Gravano ``may be living next door to you with the government's
blessing.'' And the Combined Counties Police Association of
Illinois posted a $500 reward for sightings of Sammy the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Association President John Flood said it's despicable that an
admitted murderer was unleashed on society after spending fewer
than five years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sammy left the world tomorrow, we could all sit down and
say, `Thank God,' '' Flood added. ``It would be no loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward money went uncollected. Gravano had vanished into
Arizona, the anonymous retirement mecca that attracted a number of
mob bosses over the years, including Joe Bonanno. &QL; 
BEST-KEPT SECRET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wasn't the only one who didn't want his secret out.
</P>
<P>
   Athia Hardt, a public relations woman who represents him, said
the FBI was concerned about his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt, who once worked for Arizona Govs. Bruce Babbitt and Rose
Mofford, also provided a reference: Supervising FBI Agent George
Gabriel, who handled Gravano during Gotti's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call from New York, Gabriel said blowing Gravano's
cover would have one outcome: ``He's a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardt said her client would talk if the newspaper agreed not to
reveal his new name or company, and if it would withhold
information on family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' agreed, on the condition that the deal
would be void if the newspaper found that Gravano or his company
had engaged in corrupt activity in Arizona. &QL; 
NO FEAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the 2{-hour interview in Gravano's apartment, Hardt sips
red wine. Attorney Thayne Lowe lies on the floor to ease the pain
of a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull lights a cigarette and worries aloud about family
members. He says they are the main reason he sought refuge here,
along with the weather and relatively mob-free environment.
</P>
<P>
   Though he hasn't been threatened here, Gravano figures the Mafia
knows his whereabouts. FBI agents agree, saying he is too casual
about his cover.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano quit the Witness Protection Program nine months after
getting out of prison. (``Too many restrictions. You couldn't have
contact with your family or anybody.'')
</P>
<P>
   And though he had plastic surgery, the face didn't change much.
(``I asked the doctor if I could look like Robert Redford, do it.
But he said, `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano settled for repairs to his boxer's nose and some minor
liposuction. The result: Strangers still recognize him on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come right over to me,'' Gravano says, proudly. ``Some
shake my hand and congratulate me for what I did. Some want an
autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that more than 300 Phoenix area residents know his
real identity. Sometimes, he even tells people.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says he recently ruined a business deal by coming clean
with a prospective partner. He shrugs, adding, ``We thought it was
ethical and right to let them know.'' &QL; 
A MORAL MAFIOSO? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ethical mobster.
</P>
<P>
   That theme is the fabric of Sammy the Bull's tale.
</P>
<P>
   He talks indignantly about the treachery of others. When told it
seems curious for a man who murdered 18 or 19 people to complain of
deceit, he interrupts to clarify the precise number _ ``It was 19''
_ then tells a story.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano and Gotti were trying to decide what to do about a Mafia
associate who was snitching to the cops. Gotti wanted to enlist a
homosexual who could destroy the traitor's credibility by accusing
him of being gay. Gravano was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `No, John, we don't do that. We're family. He's
one of us. We should just go kill him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano views his homicidal history in a cultural context, like
the moral relativism of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a guy (on TV) who dropped a bomb on Hiroshima,'' he
says. ``Killed 100,000 people in one day. What's that about?''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, in the 2{-hour interview, Gravano boasts that
each of his murders was coldblooded. It may seem repugnant to
mainstream American values, but he adhered to the oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never killed anybody in a fit of rage,'' Gravano says.
``Everybody I killed was planned. I'm a hit man, not a serial
killer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these things, I didn't want to do. I felt I did the
right thing in La Cosa Nostra. I was loyal to the life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was even a good person within the mob. I was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says the killing is behind him. As an ex-Mafioso, a
friend of the law, his code has changed.
</P>
<P>
   That transition came when Gravano realized that Gotti was
setting him up as a fall guy. Gravano insists that it was Gotti,
not him, who violated the brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never betrayed anybody in my life first,'' he adds. ``But if
I'm betrayed, I become a good betrayer. Go ask John.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says dozens of others took plea deals and testified,
helping to put 37 criminals behind bars. He seems puzzled about
getting all the credit, or blame.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sammy the Bull flashes a winking grin and says, ``I was the
smartest, best-looking, most charismatic of the underbosses who
flipped.'' &QL; 
MAN OF PARADOXES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gravano is an avid chess player.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys talking to young people, helping them with their
problems. He goes fishing and takes in a ballgame occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he works, rising at 5 a.m. and putting in 12-hour
days. Gravano says he's always been a workaholic with ideas racing
through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the wheeling and dealing, the business, the
whirlwind,'' he adds. ``I think up deals every other minute.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gravano is a contradictory goodfellow.
</P>
<P>
   Once a garrulous gangster, he lives alone with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   He traded Mafia cronies for law enforcement chums.
</P>
<P>
   He says the FBI doesn't need his help anymore. Then, moments
later, he declares, ``I have everything to offer the government.
They'd be totally retarded not to deal with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims not to care what people think of him, yet helped write
a book to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says life in the Mafia was always stressful. Prison was
intolerable, but it mellowed him. Now, he is content in a stuffy
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bunked in. See the brick on the walls? It's like a cell.
I'm comfortable again.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor knocks on the back door and delivers a cup of
Starbucks coffee. He smiles and talks of friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think good people, if they see you're really not a threat,
they'll protect you,'' Sammy the Bull adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy right now. I'm a boss. Of my family. Of my
friends. Of my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims he was offered an acting slot on ``The Sopranos,''an
HBO show that satirizes the New York mob. The script called for
Sammy the Bull to appear in several broadcasts as a hit man, then
get killed off. He turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   As for La Cosa Nostra, he says the government has delivered a
nearly mortal blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wrecked the mob all over the country. I don't think
they're anywhere near finished. They're letting up too early. But
they really hurt the mob.'' &QL; 
Sammy to the core
</P>
<P>
   Through all the changes, Gotti claims he's held true to
relationships and integrity. That's why he turned on Gotti, and why
he respects the FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were straight up people,'' Gravano says. ``I never caught
them in a lie, and I'm really good at that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Have my values changed? No. You can't change what you are
inside. A leopard doesn't change his spots.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site dedicated to Gotti uses a different mammalian
metaphor for Gravano: ``rat bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes a psychological evaluation that says Sammy the Bull
suffers from a ``severe character pathology: The likelihood of
violent behavior is substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano shrugs off the criticism, living day to day.
</P>
<P>
   He moves every eight or nine months.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for people to trust. Of all the hardships, he says
giving up his name was among the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I lost my identity for a while, but I found it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who is he today? Mobster, government informer, ex-con or
businessman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Sammy,'' he says with a wily smile. ``Sammy to the
core.'' &QL;

   Running! If there's any activity happier, more exhilarating,
more nourishing to the imagination, I can't think what it might be.
In running the mind flies with the body; the mysterious
efflorescence of language seems to pulse in the brain, in rhythm
with our feet and the swinging of our arms. Ideally, the runner
who's a writer is running through the land- and cityscapes of her
fiction, like a ghost in a real setting.
</P>
<P>
   There must be some analogue between running and dreaming. The
dreaming mind is usually bodiless, has peculiar powers of
locomotion and, in my experience at least, often runs or glides or
``flies'' along the ground or in the air. (Leaving aside the blunt,
deflating theory that dreams are merely compensatory: you fly in
sleep because in life you crawl, barely; you're soaring above
others in sleep because in life others soar above you.)
</P>
<P>
   Possibly these fairy-tale feats of locomotion are atavistic
remnants, the hallucinatory memory of a distant ancestor for whom
the physical being, charged with adrenaline in emergency
situations, was indistinguishable from the spiritual or
intellectual. In running, ``spirit'' seems to pervade the body; as
musicians experience the uncanny phenomenon of tissue memory in
their fingertips, so the runner seems to experience in feet, lungs,
quickened heartbeat, an extension of the imagining self.
</P>
<P>
   The structural problems I set for myself in writing, in a long,
snarled, frustrating and sometimes despairing morning of work, for
instance, I can usually unsnarl by running in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On days when I can't run, I don't feel ``myself''; and whoever
the ``self'' is I feel, I don't like nearly so much as the other.
And the writing remains snarled in endless revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Writers and poets are famous for loving to be in motion. If not
running, hiking; if not hiking, walking. (Walking, even fast, is a
poor second to running, as all runners know, what we'll resort to
when our knees go. But at least it's an option.)
</P>
<P>
   The English Romantic poets were clearly inspired by their long
walks, in all weather: Wordsworth and Coleridge in the idyllic Lake
District, for instance; Shelley (``I always go until I am stopped
and I never am stopped'') in his four intense years in Italy. The
New England Transcendentalists, most famously Henry David Thoreau,
were ceaseless walkers; Thoreau boasted of having ``traveled much
in Concord,'' and in his eloquent essay ``Walking'' acknowledged
that he had to spend more than four hours out of doors daily, in
motion; otherwise he felt ``as if I had some sin to be atoned
for.''
</P>
<P>
   My favorite prose on the subject is Charles Dickens' ``Night
Walks,'' which he wrote some years after having suffered extreme
insomnia that propelled him out into the London streets at night.
Written with Dickens' usual brilliance, this haunting essay seems
to hint at more than its words reveal. He associates his terrible
night restlessness with what he calls ``houselessness'': under a
compulsion to walk and walk and walk in the darkness and pattering
rain. (No one has captured the romance of desolation, the ecstasy
of near-madness, more forcibly than Dickens, so wrongly interpreted
as a dispenser of popular, softhearted tales.)
</P>
<P>
   It isn't surprising that Walt Whitman should have tramped
impressive distances, for you can feel the pulse beat of the walker
in his slightly breathless, incantatory poems. But it may be
surprising to learn that Henry James, whose prose style more
resembles the fussy intricacies of crocheting than the fluidity of
movement, also loved to walk for miles in London.
</P>
<P>
   I, too, walked (and ran) for miles in London years ago. Much of
it in Hyde Park. Regardless of weather. Living for a sabbatical
year with my husband, an English professor, in a corner of Mayfair
overlooking Speakers' Corner, I was so afflicted with homesickness
for America, and for Detroit, I ran compulsively; not as a respite
for the intensity of writing but as a function of writing.
</P>
<P>
   As I ran, I was running in Detroit, envisioning the city's parks
and streets, avenues and expressways, with such eidetic clarity I
had only to transcribe them when I returned to our flat, recreating
Detroit in my novel ``Do With Me What You Will'' as faithfully as
I'd recreated Detroit in ``Them'' when I was living there.
</P>
<P>
   What a curious experience! Without the bouts of running, I don't
believe I could have written the novel; yet how perverse, one
thinks, to be living in one of the world's most beautiful cities,
London, and to be dreaming of one of the world's most problematic
cities, Detroit. But of course, as no one has yet remarked in this
diverse and idiosyncratic series, Writers on Writing, writers are
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us, we like to think, in her own inimitable way.
</P>
<P>
   Both running and writing are highly addictive activities; both
are, for me, inextricably bound up with consciousness. I can't
recall a time when I wasn't running, and I can't recall a time when
I wasn't writing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (Before I could write what might be called human words in the
English language, I eagerly emulated grown-ups' handwriting in
pencil scribbles. My first ``novels'' _ which I'm afraid my loving
parents still have, in a trunk or a drawer on our old farm property
in Millersport, N.Y. _ were tablets of inspired scribbles
illustrated by line drawings of chickens, horses and upright cats.
For I had not yet mastered the trickier human form, as I was years
from mastering human psychology.)
</P>
<P>
   My earliest outdoor memories have to do with the special
solitude of running or hiking in our pear and apple orchards,
through fields of wind-rustling corn towering over my head, along
farmers' lanes and on bluffs above the Tonawanda Creek. Through
childhood I hiked, roamed, tirelessly explored the countryside:
neighboring farms, a treasure trove of old barns, abandoned houses
and forbidden properties of all kinds, some of them presumably
dangerous, like cisterns and wells covered with loose boards.
</P>
<P>
   These activities are intimately bound up with storytelling, for
always there's a ghost-self, a ``fictitious'' self, in such
settings. For this reason I believe that any form of art is a
species of exploration and transgression. (I never saw a ``No
Trespassing'' sign that wasn't a summons to my rebellious blood.
Such signs, dutifully posted on trees and fence railings, might as
well cry, ``Come Right In!'')
</P>
<P>
   To write is to invade another's space, if only to memorialize
it. To write is to invite angry censure from those who don't write,
or who don't write in quite the way you do, for whom you may seem a
threat. Art by its nature is a transgressive act, and artists must
accept being punished for it. The more original and unsettling
their art, the more devastating the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   If writing involves punishment, at least for some of us, the act
of running even in adulthood can evoke painful memories of having
been, long ago, as children, chased by tormentors. (Is there any
adult who hasn't such memories? Are there any adult women who have
not been, in one way or another, sexually molested or threatened?)
That adrenaline rush, like an injection to the heart!
</P>
<P>
   I attended a one-room country schoolhouse in which eight very
disparate grades were taught by a single overworked woman. The
teasing, pummeling, pinching, punching, mauling, kicking and verbal
abuse that surrounded the relative sanctuary of the schoolhouse
simply had to be endured, for in those days there were no
protective laws against such mistreatment. This was a laissez-faire
era in which a man might beat the daylights out of his wife and
children, and the police would rarely intervene except in cases of
serious injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   Often when I'm running in the most idyllic landscapes, I'm
reminded of the panicked childhood running of decades ago. I was
one of those luckless children without older brothers or sisters to
protect her against the systematic cruelty of older classmates,
thus fair game. I don't believe I was singled out (because my
grades were high, for instance), and I came to see years later that
such abuse is generic, not personal. It must prevail through the
species; it allows us insight into the experiences of others, a
sense of what a more enduring panic, entrapment, suffering and
despair must be truly like. Sexual abuse seems to us the most
repellent kind of abuse, and it's certainly the abuse that
nourishes a palliative amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the lines of printed words in my books are the settings
in which the books were imagined and without which the books could
not exist. Sometime in 1985, for instance, running along the
Delaware River south of Yardley, Pa., I glanced up and saw the
ruins of a railroad bridge and experienced in a flash such a vivid,
visceral memory of crossing a footbridge beside a similar railroad
trestle high above the Erie Canal in Lockport, N.Y., when I was 12
to 14 years old, that I saw the possibility of a novel. This would
become ``You Must Remember This,'' set in a mythical upstate New
York city very like the original.
</P>
<P>
   Yet often the reverse occurs: I find myself running in a place
so intriguing to me, amid houses, or the backs of houses, so
mysterious, I'm fated to write about these sights, to bring them to
life (as it's said) in fiction. I'm a writer absolutely mesmerized
by places; much of my writing is a way of assuaging homesickness,
and the settings my characters inhabit are crucial to me as the
characters themselves. I couldn't write even a very short story
without vividly ``seeing'' what its characters see.
</P>
<P>
   Stories come to us as wraiths requiring precise embodiments.
Running seems to allow me, ideally, an expanded consciousness in
which I can envision what I'm writing as a film or a dream. I
rarely invent at the typewriter but recall what I've experienced. I
don't use a word processor but write in longhand, at considerable
length. (Again, I know: writers are crazy.)
</P>
<P>
   By the time I come to type out my writing formally, I've
envisioned it repeatedly. I've never thought of writing as the mere
arrangement of words on the page but as the attempted embodiment of
a vision: a complex of emotions, raw experience.
</P>
<P>
   The effort of memorable art is to evoke in the reader or
spectator emotions appropriate to that effort. Running is a
meditation; more practicably it allows me to scroll through, in my
mind's eye, the pages I've just written, proofreading for errors
and improvements.
</P>
<P>
   My method is one of continuous revision. While writing a long
novel, every day I loop back to earlier sections to rewrite, in
order to maintain a consistent, fluid voice. When I write the final
two or three chapters of a novel, I write them simultaneously with
the rewriting of the opening, so that, ideally at least, the novel
is like a river uniformly flowing, each passage concurrent with all
the others.
</P>
<P>
   My most recent novel is 1,200 finished manuscript pages, which
means many more typed-out pages, and how many miles of running, I
dare not guess!
</P>
<P>
   Dreams may be temporary flights into madness that, by some law
of neurophysiology unclear to us, keep us from actual madness. So,
too, the twin activities of running and writing keep the writer
reasonably sane and with the hope, however illusory and temporary,
of control.

   NEW YORK _ For those who like their music under the stars, the
1999 free New York Philharmonic concerts in the parks begin at 8
Tuesday night on the Great Lawn of Central Park, where the
Brazilian conductor Roberto Minczuk will lead a program of
Bernstein (``Candide'' overture), Mozart (Symphony No. 35,
``Haffner'') and Rimsky-Korsakov (``Scheherazade''). Next Monday on
the Great Lawn, Jahja Ling, the resident conductor of the Cleveland
Orchestra, will lead works by Dvorak (``Carnival'' Overture),

   NATIVE SON
</P>
<P>
   The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (1914-1953) may be gone, but he is
certainly not forgotten. Beginning on Friday, Swansea, his native
city, will play host to the 1999 Dylan Thomas Festival, with
readings, lectures, exhibitions, films and performances, including
a fantasy play about a meeting between Dylan Thomas and Bob Dylan.
On opening day, Thomas' daughter, Aeron, will present ``To Begin at
the Beginning,'' a portrait of her father. Information:
011-44-1-792-463-980.
</P>
<P>
   HOT TIMES
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Swing, New Orleans and ragtime will be celebrated
when the 15th annual Jazz in July Festival opens a six-concert run
at 8 Tuesday night at the 92d Street Y. The festivities start with
``Bob Haggart's South Rampart Street Parade.'' This tribute to
Haggart, the bassist and arranger who died in 1998, emphasizes the
music of the Bob Crosby Big Band, with Margaret Whiting handling
vocals. Coming up: ``Swing Piano'' on Thursday, ``Saxophone City''
(July 26), ragtime from ``The Time of the Titanic'' (July 27), jazz
versions of ``September Song'' (July 28) and the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band (July 29). Information (212) 996-1100.
</P>
<P>
   FAMOUS FACES
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand are images of the actress Sarah Bernhardt, the
artist Gustave Dore and the writers Alexandre Dumas and George
Sand. On the other are those of Truman Capote, Jane Fonda, Keith
Haring, Liza Minnelli and Jean-Michel Basquiat. An exhibition
opening Tuesday the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles is
exploring the photographic visions of two artists who, in their
time, became synonymous with fame and celebrity. The first is
Nadar; the second, Andy Warhol. Nadar was the pseudonym of Gaspard
Felix Tournachon (1820-1910), the French newspaper writer and
illustrator who portrayed some of the most creative Parisians of
his time. Warhol (1928-1987) used his camera to portray celebrities
from the 1970s until his death. In ``Nadar/Warhol: Paris/New
York,'' through Oct. 10, each is represented by more than 40
images. Parking reservations and information: (310) 440-7300.

PATENTS: PROTECTING ARCHITECTS' IDEAS; ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT THROUGH
WINDOWS; LINKING SMOKE DETECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mo., Mich.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Architects often protect their work from being plagiarized in
the same way that authors do: through copyright. Whether for a
mystery novel or an architectural plan, copyright protects against
unscrupulous copiers who attempt to steal a creative work word for
word or brick by brick.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Kaufman and Donald Meeks, two architects in Houston,
have gone a step further. They have patented what they contend are
novel space-saving configurations for apartment buildings and
single-family dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   The patents protect not the specific plans _ as a copyright
would _ but rather the concepts behind the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not patenting a building,'' Kaufman said. ``We're
patenting a circulation pattern. What we've done is solve the
riddle of the hallway.''
</P>
<P>
   The riddle for Kaufman is how to build a multifamily dwelling
without the expense of a common hallway. In the case of a
three-story apartment complex, for example, Kaufman and Meeks have
eliminated the common breezeway, a type of hallway that slices
through the middle of many apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of opening onto the breezeway, the Kaufman-Meeks
apartments open off a series of staircases that are built on the
exterior of the building. ``We can save from 10 to 15 percent of
the cost of the building by eliminating the breezeway,'' Kaufman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman acknowledged that in coming up with the plan, he and his
partner had drawn upon common architectural devices _ such as the
dead-end corridors found in high-rise buildings and the outdoor
corridors popular in many motel designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like making a new drug,'' he said. ``Most of the
compounds are already known _ you just mix them together in a
different way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaufman-Meeks patents have raised concerns among builders
and architects. The National Association of Home Builders, for
example, has established a task force to address the question of
architectural patents.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman said his firm had licensed the patents to major
developers in six states, and had settled out of court with
companies he and his partner charged with infringing the patents.
``When we believe someone has infringed on our patents, we will
take due course,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Walters, an architect with Torti Gallas &AMP; Partners/CHK
in Silver Spring, Md., doubted the novelty of the Kaufman-Meeks
apartment scheme. ``It's clever, but it's not that clever,'' he
said. ``It isn't earth-shattering by any means.''
</P>
<P>
   But Walters was even more dubious about the aesthetics of the
design. ``Those staircases are like big snouts sticking on the
outside of the building,'' he said. ``They're unsightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman and Meeks received patent 5,761,857.
</P>
<P>
   Window Lets In Ultraviolet Rays
</P>
<P>
   These days, most people are trying to get less sunlight exposure
rather than more. But Charles Chubb, a physicist in St. Louis, has
just patented a type of window that lets in the ultraviolet, or UV,
rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normal glass blocks most of the biologically important
ultraviolet light,'' Chubb said. The glass in Chubb's window's lets
in just a tiny amount of the ultraviolet light that helps the body
manufacture vitamin D. ``When you get your vitamin D through
sunlight, your body self-regulates and gets just enough,'' he said.
``When you get it through your diet you can get too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The window includes special panels so that office workers can
get maximum UV exposure during the winter but block UV light in
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Chubb received patent 5,892,619.
</P>
<P>
   A Way to Link Smoke Detectors
</P>
<P>
   New homes these days must be built with smoke detectors that are
hard-wired into the electrical system. When one of these hard-wired
devices detects smoke, all of the alarms in the house go off,
regardless of the location of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Godwin, an inventor in Michigan, has invented a
battery-operated smoke-detector system that does the same thing.
``These can be easily installed in existing older homes without the
homeowner having to incur the cost of expensive rewiring,'' Godwin
said.
</P>
<P>
   When one smoke alarm goes off, it sends a coded signal to fellow
smoke alarms, which go off when they receive the signal. ``It's
radio-frequency communication that works a lot like a garage-door
opener,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin's system has another feature: The alarm that is
originally set off makes a louder, more intense sound than the
other smoke alarms. ``This way you know exactly what part of the
house the fire is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Godwin, who received patent 5,898,369, hopes to license his
patent.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

LINCOLN CENTER FESTIVAL: ARTISTIC AND POLITICAL FIREWORKS ERUPT IN
DUTCH TROUPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deep conviction or cheap shot? That is the question
to ask of the surprise anti-war protest with which Jiri Kylian
ended a new program by his Nederlands Dans Theater as part of
Lincoln Center Festival '99.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has anyone whipped an audience into such an exhilarating
high and then brought it down so brutally as Kylian did on Friday
night with his feelings about the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to give Kylian his due, he is equally concerned about the
feelings of those he views as aggressors. Seemingly out of nowhere,
the voice of an ABC television correspondent was heard on tape at
the New York State Theater, likening the bombing to the fireworks
of a Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian had just staged his own fireworks on several levels in
``Arcimboldo,'' a piece d'occasion made up of excerpts from a 1995
work with the same name. Scores of men and women in blazing red
hoop skirts had run down the side aisles of the theater and filled
the stage with an exuberant and hilarious dance parody (set to the
Tchaikovsky polonaise that George Balanchine used in his ``Theme
and Variations'').
</P>
<P>
   But when the ABC tape was played, the festivities stopped. The
dancers collapsed in darkness, transformed into victims of war. The
music was now a sober song from Schubert's Winterreise cycle (``Der
Leiermann''), and three performers from an earlier piece sat at a
table and wiped makeup off their faces.
</P>
<P>
   War is not a show. But an idiotic remark by a television
journalist does not mean that bombing is regarded by all as a
festive occasion. A population, it is true, can be whipped up into
a war frenzy as easily as a choreographer can whip up an audience
into a happy delirium with dancers galumphing in red Baroque
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian makes this last point in a coup de theatre, complete with
a clever deflation, that registers as an immediate shock. One does
not doubt the depth of Kylian's pacifist beliefs. In 1981, New York
audiences saw his stirring ``Soldier's Mass,'' which spoke of the
futility of war. Yet there he was also at odds with his music, a
cantata by Bohuslav Martinu urging fellow Czechoslovaks on the eve
of World War II to crush the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with absolutist beliefs is that they can lead to
simplistic counterarguments. Kylian left his native Czechoslovakia
in 1967. Should one say that he was able to pursue his career in
Western Europe because NATO, as a deterrent against Soviet forces,
made it safe for him during the Cold War?
</P>
<P>
   As for the question of deep conviction or cheap shot, both
answers apply. The choreography for the full ``Arcimboldo,''
inspired by a 16th-century painter, does not usually end with a jab
about NATO bombing. That was reserved for New York audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The evening, for the most part, was conventional enough, which
accounted for the effectiveness of the finale. The cast there,
augmented by students from the Juilliard School, was made up of the
three companies that are part of Nederlands Dans Theater (billed
here in the past as Netherlands Dance Theater).
</P>
<P>
   The three troupes also appeared independently on the program.
NDT1, the senior troupe, was seen in two Kylian pieces with the
same striking choreographic style of ``One of a Kind,'' the
brilliant work that opened the engagement earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Bella Figura'' apparently refers to an Italian
expression for putting up a good front, and Kylian's program note
suggests an investigation into the nature of performance. Onstage,
however, one sees powerful and intricate dancing, often for couples
and trios. The music includes part of Lukas Foss' ``Salomon Rossi
Suite'' and weaves in some Italians (Pergolesi, Marcello, Vivaldi,
Torelli). The production values are unusual, to say the least: A
male and a female nude are suspended in plastic boxes at the start
and then replaced by curtains that close in or open the dancer's
space. Flames shoot up in a rear corner.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian's lighting design is a strong formal element, but the
dancing has an unnamed emotional tension. The broad expressive
gesture of Kylian's early works has given way to a taut balletic
line in the women that coils around the men's swift, gymnastic
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is an adult look to these dancers that
is rare in American companies. This is tough dancing, no matter how
playful the movement, with its slides across the floor and shoulder
rotations. The cast (Megumi Nakamura, Isabelle Chauffaud, Stefan
Zeromski, Cora Bos-Kroese, Joeri de Korte, Elke Schepers, Ken
Ossola, Lorraine Blouin and Johan Inger) was splendid.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian's focus on isolated body movements is less inventive in
``Wings of Wax,'' whose sense of desolation is nonetheless
striking. The music (Heinrich von Biber, John Cage, Philip Glass,
Bach) fits the dancing best in the passages culled from Bach's
``Goldberg'' Variations. A tree, hanging upside down as a
theatrical light revolves around it, has something to do with the
myth of Icarus and adds to the unhappy tone.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the younger dancers in NDT2 (Amos Ben-Tal,
Christophe Dozzi, Shintaro O-ue and Natasha Crook) are all
exuberant and rubbery legged in ``Skew-Whiff,'' by Paul Lightfoot.
It is a clever, impudent piece for dancers full of stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Kylian does some of his best work for mature dancers in NDT3 and
``A Way a Lone; To Somebody No Longer Here'' offered a stunning
mixed-media interplay between dancers on film and onstage. Sabine
Kupferberg, David Krugel and Gerard Lemaitre were the poignant
contemporary clowns.

IN THIS TOUR, FRENCH WOULD BE HAPPY WITH EVEN A DAILY WIN
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-GAUDENS, France _ For more than 4{ hours and 118 miles, most
of France held its breath Sunday, wondering if one of its own was
finally going to win a stage of the Tour de France after two weeks
of domination by Italians, Americans, Estonians, Spaniards and
Belgians.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, alas, was no. This time it was a Russian, Dimitri
Konyshev, who rides for the Meracatone Uno team from Italy and who
won a two-man sprint finish from Gianni Faresin, an Italian with
Mapei.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong of the U.S. Postal Service team kept the overall
leader's yellow jersey by 7 minutes 44 seconds over Abraham Olano,
a Spaniard with ONCE, and by 7:47 over Alex Zuelle, a Swiss with
Banesto.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing fifth in today's stage was Jacky Durand, a native with
credentials impressive enough to spark national hopes. A specialist
in long-distance breakaways, like the one Sunday, he was the only
Frenchman to win a Tour stage last year. He also has been the only
Frenchman in decades to win the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Tours
classics.
</P>
<P>
   With that history going for him, and his reputation as a
finisher, Durand should have been a lock in the fourth successive
day of long breakaways. He suffered badly with stomach problems in
the Alps on Tuesday and Wednesday, however, and has been missing in
action since then as dozens of low-ranked riders like him, but
rarely Frenchmen, have staged successful escapes.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the 123-mile 14th stage from picturesque Castres
to St.-Gaudens, Durand was noticeably chipper, much more so than
most of the other weary riders. Luckily for them, Monday will be
the second of two rest days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling better,'' he said. ``I've lost some opportunities'' in
the four-day trek from the Alps to the Pyrenees as the leaders
proclaimed a truce and let loose the bottom feeders. Durand ranks
next to last in the remaining field of 152 riders, out of the 180
who set out July 3. The race ends Sunday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   There was no change at the top, as the main pack trailed in more
than 13 minutes after Konyshev. He was timed in 4:37:59, a speed of
26 miles an hour in muggy weather that turned briefly to rain.
Faresin had the same time, with Massimiliano Lelli, an Italian with
Cofidis, 4 seconds behind in third place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was exhausted near the finish and the Italians worked well
together,'' Durand said later. ``I guess this wasn't supposed to be
the day when a Frenchman would finally win a stage.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, French riders appear to have no chance to win the
Tour itself. The French news media and public are growing
increasingly critical and, since the newspapers have nothing to
crow about, they have been devoting their vast Tour space (three to
seven pages daily) to the possibility of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   First it was the Armstrong drugging innuendos, which have calmed
down since he stated flatly in an interview that he does not and
has not used illegal performance-enhancing substances. For the last
few days, it has been the case of Christophe Bassons, a 25-year-old
French rider for the Francaise des Jeux team who was part of the
Festina squad last year. Bassons was one of three Festina riders
who did not use drugs, team officials said after Festina was
expelled from the Tour. &QL;

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Hour by hour, cars and trucks back up to the
Salvation Army's warehouse loading dock on the edge of the
prosperous East Side here and disgorge clothing. Skirts and parkas,
neckties and tank tops, sweat pants and socks, a polychromatic
mountain of clothes is left each week, some still with price tags
attached.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the warehouse, workers cull the clean and undamaged
clothes, roughly one piece in five, to give to the poor or to sell
at thrift shops. They feed the rest _ as much as 4 million pounds a
year _ into mighty machines that bind them into 1,100-pound,
5-foot-long bales. Rag dealers buy the bales for 5 cents a pound
and ship them off to countries like Yemen and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a decade of rising prosperity has changed the ways that
Americans view and use clothing, so much so that cast-off clothes
have become the flotsam of turn-of-the-century affluence. Americans
bought 17.2 billion articles of clothing in 1998 _ a 16 percent
increase over 1993, according to NPG Group, a market research
concern in Port Washington, N.Y. _ and gave the Salvation Army
alone several hundred million pieces, well over 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   And because so few people make or mend their clothes anymore,
among the changes has been this one, in 1998: The Bureau of Labor
Statistics moved sewing machines from the ``apparel and upkeep''
category of consumer spending to ``recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   The clothing glut is a boon to the many charities like the
Salvation Army that sort and sell old clothes. ``You choke on
sweaters,'' said Capt. Thomas Taylor, administrator of the
Salvation Army's Providence center, one of the three or four
busiest of the organization's 119 across the country. No one in the
United States, Taylor said, need ever go without being properly
dressed.
</P>
<P>
   At the warehouse, Judy Keegan was unloading a cargo of dresses,
jeans and shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do this regularly,'' Ms. Keegan, who has four children, ages
6 to 15, said of giving away family clothing. ``I grew up with
hand-me-downs, but if they need something, we go buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Wood, a social worker who had an excess of linens,
brought in a blanket and comforter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frightening thing,'' Ms. Wood said, ``is I'm a
nonshopper.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond clearing their closets, donors have a monetary incentive
for giving away clothes here. They can claim a tax deduction if
they ask for a form when they pull in. Ms. Keegan took one, Ms.
Wood did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority don't,'' Taylor said. `'The majority of people
just give.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothing is easier than ever to buy, not only because incomes
are up and unemployment is down, but also because clothes are
getting relatively cheaper. Clothing prices have risen just 13
percent in a decade, while the average for all consumer goods rose
34 percent. Prices of women's clothes are lower now than six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest boon to shopping and shedding may be the
fast-changing fashion styles, and not only for women. Few children
settle for their older siblings' outdated jackets and baggy jeans.
Elementary school principals routinely complain of overflowing
lost-and-found departments.
</P>
<P>
   These phenomena have swept across the spectrum of the retail
economy, from boutique shoppers to bargain hunters. Conservatively
attired in beige, Susan Brenneman, a 30-year-old software
executive, seemed a model of reserve, moderation and thrift. Then
she popped open the trunk of her Volvo sedan. From Nieman Marcus,
Banana Republic and Lord &AMP; Taylor shopping bags, she plucked six
suits, eight pairs of shoes, 10 pairs of pants, five blouses, 10
belts, two sweaters and a raincoat.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes, all spotless and neat, were up to two years old.
Ms. Brenneman said her company's shift to more casual wear put an
end to the suits. Still, wincing at the size of her load, Ms.
Brenneman said she was revising her priorities. ``More quality and
less volume,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In buying and scrapping clothes, Ms. Brenneman had nothing on a
42-year-old woman who was rifling through the racks at the
18,500-square-foot Salvation Army thrift store next to the
warehouse. She was wearing last week's acquisition, a shimmering
Navy blue tanktop embroidered with the Wilson sportswear logo,
which had cost her $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clothes, I go through them like water,'' said the woman, who
identified herself only as Casey. ``I change my outfits all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The tank top, like everything else she buys, is eventually
destined for donation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why pay $25, when you can pay 25 cents?''
</P>
<P>
   In another aisle, Sarah Demirjian, a retired widow, held up a
pair of printed Rafaella slacks. They started at $6 and now, on
sale, were $1. ``The person probably wore this once or twice and
junked it,'' she said. ``It's the disposable society.''
</P>
<P>
   In their different ways, these women are all cogs in a large,
little-known industry that helps sustain organizations like the
Salvation Army that recycle clothes so they can recycle people,
from the street into the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the Salvation Army's centers combines a warehouse and an
Adult Rehabilitation Center. Seventy-one recovering addicts, or
``beneficiaries,'' as the organization calls them, live and work at
the Providence center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deal with them spiritually, socially, rehabilitatively and
with work therapy,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   For the six weeks to the many months they are here,
beneficiaries are tightly regimented while the center feeds them,
houses them in spartan dormitories, trains them for work and steers
them into jobs beyond the centers. For their work in the warehouse,
they are paid a ``gratuity'' of $5 to $15 a week, depending on
their progress in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Three teams of beneficiaries, about 10 sorters and taggers,
confronted the great clothing glut on the second floor of the
warehouse, an old textile factory. Terrence Mitchell, 41, a
resident here for three months and a sorter, tore open a donor's
black plastic bag and spotted a denim shirt turned inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside out, throw it out,'' Mitchell said. Most inside-out
clothing has something to hide, usually dirt and stains. He picked
up a black leather handbag, still in its protective plastic cover,
still with its price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goes to new,'' Mitchell said, sending it to a crate with
other items with their original tags.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Bugle Boy windbreaker was soiled on one side. ``Out,'' he
said, tossing it into a bin that would feed it to the baling
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a bag with 20 new-looking bras, in lavender satin, red
lace, a leopard skin print, all the same size. ``Maybe someone
died,'' Mitchell said. They went to taggers like Laura Whiteside,
34.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get Jones of New York, Evan Picone, Christian Dior,'' Ms.
Whiteside said. ``Here's a Stafford shirt. That's Penney's own
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks here, Ms. Whiteside had become a
lightning-quick tagger, thrusting item upon item into a table-top
machine that pins on a blue, yellow, green or white price tag _ one
color for each week of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The color coding lets the thrift shops, which price the
clothing, know when an item has been on their racks and unsold for
a month. If it has been, it is sent to the baling machines, or
``ragged out,'' in the parlance of the workers. Twice a week or so,
the bales are loaded into the rag dealers' 18-wheelers and often
into containers for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can go to Guatemala, Mexico,'' said Fletcher Fisher, the
warehouse supervisor and a former beneficiary. ``A lot can go
overseas to Africa. We ship a lot to Canada, and from there they
ship it all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Leoson's International in Toronto specializes in trade with the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just sold a container to Yemen,'' said Leo Ohanian, the
company's export director.
</P>
<P>
   A container is 40 feet long and takes 32 bales, Ohanian said, or
nearly 18 tons of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two classes in the Middle East, high class and very
low class,'' he said. ``The very low class can't afford the
clothing they have there.''

<P>
   The elevator ride has always presented a social dilemma: people
captive in a tiny room, awkwardly silent and unwilling to make eye
contact. The piped-in Muzak version of the Beatles' ``Penny Lane''
does nothing to ease the discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to profit from such quiet desperation, a small start-up
company in Westford, Mass., has begun to install flat-panel
displays in elevators around the United States. The screens are
network terminals that can pull current information like weather,
traffic, sports and stock updates off the Internet and give
elevator passengers a nonthreatening place to focus their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Captivate Network Inc., was founded in 1997 after
its chief executive, Michael DiFranza, noticed how fidgety people
became during a long elevator ride. It occurred to him that
advertisers love captive audiences _ even audiences detained for

   Former Browser Foes Unite in Tellme Networks Start-Up
</P>
<P>
   The post-browser-war armistice continues at Tellme Networks
Inc., a Silicon Valley start-up that would already be rich if buzz
were money. Brad Silverberg, a former senior vice president at
Microsoft Corp., who remains a Microsoft consultant, is becoming an
investor and board member of Tellme.
</P>
<P>
   James Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape Corp.,
is also investing, Tellme plans to announce Monday. And Peter
Currie, the former chief financial officer of Netscape, is joining
the board.
</P>
<P>
   They are the main new investors in a $6 million seed round of
financing for Tellme, founded in February by a team of young
refugees from the Internet browser war between Microsoft and
Netscape. And James Clark, Netscape's co-founder, signed up as a
Tellme backer a couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tellme has been secretive about its technology, except to say
that it will be a service that marries the telephone and the
Internet. The speculation is that it will employ some combination
of natural-language and Internet programming to give users a way to
retrieve information from the World Wide Web with a telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Silverberg said he was backing Tellme because of his belief that
the start-up's team has ``what it takes to steadily execute and
deliver on a new service which will be used by millions of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellme plans to roll out its Web-phone service during the first
half of next year.

   GE Applies Its Talents to Internet Housekeeping
</P>
<P>
   General Electric Co.'s 3-year-old Web page has just had a face
lift to prepare for total reconstructive surgery in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate impact, starting Tuesday, will be fewer clicks to
get from www.GE.com to, say, a list of stores that sell GE
appliances. But wait a few months, the company promises, and you
will be able to just type in ``I am a homeowner who needs a
refrigerator,'' and the software will take it from there.
</P>
<P>
   The first changes, though, are primarily cosmetic. Many of the
links that now clutter the home page _ ``Frequently Asked
Questions'' and ``GE Careers,'' for example _ will move to the
navigation bar. The page itself, now equally divided into consumer,
business and corporate sections, will include only consumer
information, with buttons to guide business customers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Links to GE divisions like appliances will be replaced with
links to topics like money management (a GE Capital skill) and
women's health (GE Medical is a leading supplier of mammography
systems).
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get customers to solutions in the fewest numbers of
clicks,'' said Susan Moyer, a GE executive who oversees Internet
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The changes planned for fall are a lot more radical. Logging on
then, and identifying oneself by category _ say, homeowner,
plastics molder or aerospace executive _ will thereafter elicit a
home page tailored to the individual's interest. And asking a
question in everyday language about, say, getting a mortgage may
lead to follow-up queries about how one plans to set up the kitchen
in the new house.

SEATTLE LANDMARK OFFERS A MARKET OF GOODIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your obedient correspondent admits to the appellation
``Intermediate Eater.''
</P>
<P>
   On any scale, Michael Yaeger qualifies as an ``Expert Eater.''
So it is not surprising to learn he has spent much of his life _
eating _ in the Pike Place Market.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests non-residents should not begin a tour of the market
on an empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Spend the night at the Inn at the Market, he advises. Rise early
and head down to SBC Coffee, where artists, actors and other
creative folk congregate. Then, cup in hand, walk through the
Triangle Building passage and get a roll from the Cinnamon Works
bakery and munch it while watching owner-baker Mike Ruegamer roll
out huge swaths of dough for the next batch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next go over and watch the farmers set up their intricate
displays. Then walk out to the Desimone Bridge and take in some sea
air and great views. Next _ around 9 _ go deep into the North
Arcade and watch the crafts day-stall roll call.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, I suppose, it is time to start thinking about lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager is partial to the Greek pita sandwiches at Mr. D's, the
cioppino at Jack's Fish Spot, the cream cheese sandwich at Phillie
Deli, or he might just open a can of octopus in garlic sauce from
El Mercado Latino.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to discover your own favorite coffee, he can direct
you to 10 spots in or around the market serving that many different
brands of java, including, of course, Starbucks, served in that
company's original store.
</P>
<P>
   Honorary mayor of the market, Yeager writes frequently about
Pike Place people and places. He also shares his life and a market
art stall with Sarah Clementson. The two have just published an
expanded version of their paperback book, ``An Insider's Tour of
the Pike Place Public Market.'' It is available in most local
bookstores and, of course, at their Studio Solstone in the Market
Atrium.
</P>
<P>
   Alice the Artist put in a few years in the market as a member of
the Market Art Stall, oldest establishment in Pike Place. It's
situated right next to the market nut stall _ a fact she was never
afraid to admit.
</P>
<P>
   We still make frequent visits to take in the sights, scents and
acquire the raw materials for recipes like:
</P>
<P>
   Pike Place Peanut Greens
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches fresh mustard greens or spinach
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch green onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup peeled red peppers, chopped
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon red pepper flakes (or to taste)
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly wash the sand out of the greens, then break each leaf
into four or five pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Put water and salt into a pot, then stuff in the greens. Steam
greens, covered, for about 5 minutes. Turn them over in the pot,
add the green onions and peeled peppers (which you can buy in jars)
and steam another 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the peanut butter with enough water to make a creamy paste.
Stir in the red pepper flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Moosh this muck into the greens, stir thoroughly and cook over
low heat another 5 minutes. Serves four.
</P>
<P>
   Art Stall Soup
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh spinach
</P>
<P>
   1 minced onion
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter or canola oil
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 cup firmly packed basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 minced cloves garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cream or half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Wash the spinach, then toss into a large saucepan and cook (just
in the water clinging to the leaves) covered over low heat for 3
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In another saucepan, heat the butter or oil and saute the onion
until it softens. Add the chicken broth, basil leaves, spinach and
any spinach liquid from the pot. Add the garlic, bring the liquid
to a boil and simmer partially covered for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the cream and reheat, but do not boil. With a slotted spoon,
transfer most of the solids to a blender. Add 2 cups of the liquid,
then lean on the button for 10 seconds. Return the resultant puree
to the pot. Let soup stand, covered, for a couple of minutes then
serve in four bowls, with a tablespoon of Parmesan atop each.
</P>
<P>
   Market Chowder
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup low-fat ham, in a small dice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups minced onion
</P>
<P>
   4 cups fish or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   3 cups peeled and cubed potatoes
</P>
<P>
   Thyme to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds cod or similar fish fillets
</P>
<P>
   4 cups half-and-half or low-fat evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot heat the oil and saute the ham until it begins to
crisp. Remove and reserve. Add to the pot the onion and saute until
it begins to relax. Add the fish or chicken stock and the potato.
Simmer until the potato is soft, then add the fish, cut into 2-inch
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Resume cooking for 5 minutes or until the fish flakes with a
fork. Stir in the half-and-half or evaporated milk. Remove the pan
from the heat, add salt, pepper and thyme to taste and let sit
covered for an hour to let the flavors develop.
</P>
<P>
   Reheat and serve in six bowls. If you are trying to impress your
guests, top each serving with a tablespoon of butter and some
minced parsley.
</P>
<P>
   I have not yet conceived of a way to barbecue Rachel, the Market
Pig. But I'm working on it.

A NEW MODEL FOR THE INTERNET: FEES FOR SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (jw) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To their great shared financial benefit, Internet investors and
entrepreneurs and the market analysts who serve them have convinced
one another and most of the rest of the world that the only truly
Internet-centered business model is one in which online users pay
nothing for content.
</P>
<P>
   But the facade of this piece of Internet mythology is sprouting
cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising underwrites virtually all commercial Web sites and
serves as the multibillion-dollar foundation for the entire
Internet economy. But the number of people who click on banner
advertisements has dropped precipitously over the past year. And a
new genre of software has emerged to block ads entirely. Add to
this mix a growing consumer perception that ``you get what you pay
for,'' and the free-content argument looks increasingly threadbare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in this medium is moving away from the ad-supported
model and toward the transaction model,'' says Mark Anderson, the
president and editor of the Strategic News Service Online
newsletter, which forecasts trends in technology and business.
``People are using the Internet for transactions _ all kinds of
transactions _ and things that are not transaction-related are not
very interesting to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, for example, Sony Online Entertainment offered an
online role-playing game, Everquest (www.everquest.com), that
requires both a $25 CD-ROM and a $10-a-month subscription _ not
exactly an easy sell. But in a response that surprised even Sony,
after only four months more than 120,000 gamers are paying to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ramp-up rate has been enormous,'' says Steven Yee, the
vice president of marketing for Sony Online Entertainment. This
kind of success ``validates the subscription model for online
games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet watchers believe that stories like Everquest's
signal a fundamental shift away from what old-guard media
executives thought the Internet would be: an advertising-supported,
mass-market medium like their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interactivity,'' such as it was, mostly involved surfing
aimlessly from site to site. But as people became familiar with the
Web, that became much less thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving away from the passive model,'' Anderson says.
``We're now saying, `I'll only take your media if it's connected to
a transaction that's meaningful to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   By now we all know what those meaningful transactions are:
finding a sex partner, trading stocks and buying or selling various
stuff, either through retail or auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are all transactions,'' Anderson said, ``and that's why
we're moving from ad support to subscriptions for what I'm
personally interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Tom Baker, the general manager for The Wall
Street Journal Interactive Edition, agrees. The Interactive Journal
and Consumer Reports, each claiming about 300,000 subscribers,
paying $59 and $24 a year, respectively, are the largest pay sites
on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free-content model is conventional wisdom, and it leads to
a failure of imagination,'' says Baker. ``Everyone has ceased even
trying to invent a service valuable enough to charge for. Even in
the pawed-over area of personal finance, when you think of the
services that haven't been done _ alerts and various other uses for
the data they have about you in a way that's not just annoying _
I'm amazed that people aren't pursuing more.''
</P>
<P>
   And why are they not? ``Because they would never be able to get
funding,'' says Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when a company has what appears to be a viable pay
service, potential investors often have an antibody reaction that
expels it from the system.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a San Francisco-based company called Inquisit was
forced to shut down its service to a subscriber base that once
reached 5,000 with virtually no marketing. Inquisit indexed more
than 400 sources of content, from news services to local newspapers
around the world, and, for $12.95 a month, compared the index with
detailed personal profiles and delivered a personalized selection
of stories or headlines immediately to e-mail, pager or cell phone.
When the company shut its doors, many of the subscribers said they
would have paid several times the price for the service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James Opfer, Inquisit's president, says the closest thing
available now is Yahoo Alerts, which searches far fewer sources and
delivers only to a user's Yahoo mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, I told investors two things,'' Opfer said.
``One, e-mail's where it's at, not push technology. And two, they
could use our technology for other things _ to deliver changes in
airline schedules and good shopping deals, for example. They told
me that e-mail was passe and that e-commerce was at least a decade
away. And they passed and they passed and they passed. It's the
herd mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the industry's narrow view on payment for
Internet services, according to the Journal's Baker, probably has
as much to do with the supercharged atmosphere on Wall Street for
no-product, no-profit, Internet plays as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figure they'll go public and figure it out later,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   But it is really not so difficult to figure it out now.
</P>
<P>
   If advertising is the driving revenue generator for the Internet
economy, then most of the online market's ``revenue'' is derived
from companies' simple swapping of ad budgets back and forth in a
zero sum game.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if a company is spending more Internet funny
money than it can ever hope to regain in sales of goods or
services? What happens when the stock market regains its sanity and
insists on profits?
</P>
<P>
   The model will almost certainly collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when it happens,'' said Anderson, ``it will be like a
supernova _ it won't take these companies a year to go out of
business; it will take a month or a day.''

MAGAZINES SCRAMBLE FOR FRESH KENNEDY COVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: KENNEDY-RDP, KENNEDY-PILOT, KENNEDY-VOICES, KENNEDY-TV,
KENNEDY-MAGAZINE, KENNEDY-COLUMN) 
(jw) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The feared death of John F. Kennedy Jr. sent the staffs of news
weekly magazines scrambling back to work early Saturday morning.
Recognizing enormous consumer interest, the editors of Time,
Newsweek and U.S. News &AMP; World Report tore up covers, amplified
print runs and, in the case of U.S. News, recalled millions of
magazines already en route to newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Isaacson, managing editor of Time, tripled the magazine's
regular newsstand print run of 500,000 to more than 1.5 million
copies. After hearing news of Kennedy's disappearance, which he
first heard at 7:15 a.m. Saturday, Isaacson had a 40-page package _
with essays by Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Peggy Noonan _ ready to
ship to the printer at 4:15 a.m. Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek editor Mark Whitaker threw out a cover story about
American youth culture in favor of a portrait of Kennedy and
accompanying 29-page package; the magazine will print more than 1
million copies for the newsstand, about 700,000 more than it
usually prints.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of U.S. News, which is printed on
Fridays and shipped on Saturday mornings, took the drastic measure
of recalling the fleet of U.S. News delivery trucks on their way to
newsstands across the country. The printed cover story on memory
loss was replaced with a 10-page package on Kennedy; the newsstand
print run was increased by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Isaacson of Time had until noon Sunday, however, to choose a
final cover. Without official word on Kennedy's fate, Isaacson
decided, nevertheless, to print the years ``1960-1999'' beneath the
photograph of Kennedy.

`THREE VIRGINS': GIRLS IN DEEP TROUBLE, NOT JUST FROM HADRIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.)

   NEW YORK _ From strip to hip. That is the unlikely metamorphosis
that has taken place at Show World, the former Times Square sex
superstore, which was shut in May by the Giuliani administration.
Collapsable Giraffe, a young SoHo theater company that revels in
ironic twists, is bivouacked these days in one of the emporium's
darkened playrooms with a brash and salty performance piece it
calls ``Three Virgins.''
</P>
<P>
   The title should not, however, be construed as an old Eighth
Avenue come-on. In its way Collapsable Giraffe wants to be as much
a part of a revivified 42nd Street as Disney's New Amsterdam
Theater. The hourlong production is an attempt to place the
red-light district's historic preoccupation in a larger context:
that is, to look at the degradation of the female body as a
recurrent theme in Western culture. As a result ``Three Virgins''
is a landmark, albeit a far-out one, in the creation of what has
come to be known as site-specific theater, the type in which the
performance space itself adds information and shapes meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, half the fun is sharing in the novelty of the invasion
of the strip club by the drama club. Signs affixed to the walls of
the upstairs room _ ``Touching Girls Is Not Allowed!'' ``All Exits
Are Final'' _ attest to Show World's legacy. They are emblems, too,
of the need of sex shops to impose some limits on the violations of
the flesh, a notion that this vibrant troupe plays with in its
clever interweaving of classic dramatic texts, court documents and
conversational transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   Collapsable Giraffe's last production, ``Damfino,'' a movement
and theater piece at the Performing Garage in SoHo, looked for the
comparative expressions of whimsy in the films of Buster Keaton
and, of all things, letters written by the deranged to the Mount
Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, Calif. ``Three Virgins'' is just as
eccentrically sourced, though the satirical links among the sources
may be a little harder for audiences to identify.
</P>
<P>
   The work's chief inspiration is ``Sapientia,'' one of the six
plays by that favorite of theater historians, Hrotswith of
Gandersheim, a 10th-century Benedictine abbess who is thought to be
the first female playwright. ``Sapientia'' tells the story of the
physical torment of the three daughters of an early Christian woman
summoned to the court of the Roman Emperor Hadrian to denounce her
religion. One of the conceits of the director Amy Huggans and her
five-member cast is that a full millennium later, women are still
experiencing defilement in public rituals, in everything from strip
joints to children's beauty contests.
</P>
<P>
   Costumed in little-girl pageant dresses, Lori Chodos and Makeda
Christodoulos, playing two of the daughters _ the third is
portrayed by a doll _ submit willingly to their gruesome
punishments. Their faith in God is absolute.
</P>
<P>
   In our time all such certainties have evaporated and may even be
perceived as a kind of madness. At least that is what the company
implies in interspersing with Hrotswith's tale a modern complement
to the daughters' violent ordeal. It is the rambling testimony of
an unidentified woman who, in a 1997 case that was denied a hearing
by the U.S. Supreme Court, accused local officials of forcing her
to have sex with minors. (A third element, fragments of what sounds
like a seance, suggests a contemporary parallel for the out-of-body
experiences the daughters describe under Hadrian's torture.)
</P>
<P>
   All five of the performers are engaging and effective, but it's
the environment that gives the piece its power. As with
``Damfino,'' Collapsable Giraffe uses technology lavishly in
``Three Virgins'' to assist the narrative and create, at any
moment, two or three distinct focal points. The multimedia
production uses many television and film techniques _ overlapping
dialogue, animated clips, lip-syncing, home videos _ that
contribute to a sense of the surreal.
</P>
<P>
   That is, after all, what a journey into the split personality of
Times Square often feels like nowadays.

   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ From her front porch, Carolyn Quinn
surveyed the police barricades and phalanxes of TV crews that stood
between her shingle-sided summer home and her anxious neighbors
inside the Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we complain about this when that family has suffered
such tragedy?'' she said Sunday, waving a dismissive hand at the
media circus. ``My heart just aches for them. And all this is just
what happens when it's a Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy clan largely remained secluded in their cluster of
white houses overlooking Hyannis Bay, awaiting word from officials
overseeing the huge land and sea search for the plane carrying John
F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette, and her older sister,
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   The scene inside the compound included ``a lot of tears and
hugs,'' Mary Medeiros, a family baby sitter, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   As hope faded for the trio, the family issued no statement.
John's sister, Caroline, reported staying at a residence on New
York's Long Island, likewise made no statement.
</P>
<P>
   At Ethel Kennedy's house in the compound, a Mass was held at
which she reportedly handed out the communion wafers and her
brother-in-law, Sen. Edward Kennedy, served the communion wine to a
dozen or so relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some family members, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., walked the
beach. Later, Robert went sailing with his mother, Ethel, and other
relatives. Joining the excursion was Robert's sister, Rory, and her
fiance Mark Bailey, whose Saturday wedding was postponed as the
search continued.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 275 guests who had gathered for the wedding began
leaving the compound Sunday by a back entrance, away from the mass
of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the compound's front gate, where an American flag still
flew hopefully at full mast, the normally quiet neighborhood of
multimillion-dollar homes bustled with activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally weird,'' said Kate Floyd, 14. ``We don't think
about them as celebrities or anything. But then you see all this
stuff and realize something's up.''
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of Kennedy children now roams these winding,
shady streets and sails on the startling blue water beyond their
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're friends with the fourth generation. Joe's kids. Kate
Townsend,'' said Rick Mayfield, 15, referring to the daughter of
Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The original Kennedy brothers _ Joe Jr., Jack, Bobby and Teddy _
were the first to play touch football on the spacious yard. Then
came ``the cousins'' _ their children and those of their sisters.
Now the yard is the playground of the great-grandchildren of the
family patriarch, the late Joseph Kennedy Sr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually ride our bikes down that street a thousand times a
day,'' said Nat Bacon, 14, pointing to a barricaded street. ``They
have pools and a really big yard where we play capture the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than complaining about the satellite trucks parked in
front of their houses and the police checkpoints, the neighborhood
children cashed in on the situation Sunday by selling bottled water
and soft drinks to the sweltering reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The children said John Jr. and his wife were frequently seen in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw John-John on the docks one time,'' said Cap Bacon, 16.
``My friend didn't know who he was at first. He told him, 'Yo,
you're chosen to take us bowling.' Then John-John made this cool
motion with his hands and grinned at us.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the neighborhood has crown accustomed to the
occasional inconveniences generated by their most famous residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned for the wedding, but this turned into something
quite different,'' said John Finnegan, police chief of Barnstable,
the jurisdiction that includes Hyannis Port and seven other
villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbors have really been very good about it,'' said
Finnegan. ``We've only gotten a few complaints about the satellite
trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   During their formative years, the other Kennedy cousins spent
much more time in Hyannis Port than did John Jr. and Caroline, said
Margery Eagan, a Boston Herald reporter who grew up in the area.
Caroline and John spent more time at the summer home of their
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, on the nearby island of
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she kind of segregated them,'' said Eagan. ``Ethel's
and Bobby's kids were kind of wild.''

RADIO STATION IN BOSTON DROPS IMUS  
 PARODY OF TALK MAGAZINE UPSETS DISNEY  
 WALL STREET JOURNAL GETS 10 SUNDAY OUTLETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston is Don Imus' kind of town. Bostonians argue, sometimes
louder than New Yorkers, and they view the well-considered insult
as an art. Talk radio, one of the purest venues for argument and
creative invective, goes back a generation on radio stations like
WEEI in Boston. Don Imus is Boston's kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   So how come WEEI's management decided, after six years of
broadcasting the I-Man's guy-centric program that Imus wasn't their
guy after all? Earlier this month, WEEI announced that it would
drop the Imus show at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, how did they ensure that their
Imus-ain't-what-he-used-to-be spin flavored headlines and news
articles in the Boston publications that covered their decision?
</P>
<P>
   Not too hard. ``We sent out a release,'' said WEEI's program
director, Jason Wolfe. The heft of the Imus name attracted
attention, and the animus of columnists like The Boston Herald's
Howie Carr, did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   If WEEI management's version is correct and Imus is losing his
edge, it should show up in the count of the stations taking the
show. Unfortunately, that picture is ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Wolfe, the programming director at WEEI, said Imus lost
``half his audience in 18 months'' in Boston. ``He's been in steady
decline for three years.''
</P>
<P>
   His view is supported by other cancellations. Denver isn't
listening; Imus' show went off the air in December. Chicago isn't
listening; he has no outlet there, either. In Tucson, Ariz., a far
smaller market, Imus was off the air for about a year before being
picked up by a new station.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are plenty of signs that WEEI's move may be an
anomaly. One radio station in Los Angeles dropped the show, but
another picked it up _ as executives at Imus' home station, WFAN in
New York, confirm will happen in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Th executives at WFAN point out that Imus is on the air in about
90 cities around the United States, including Philadelphia, Dallas
and, soon, Miami. Mark Chernoff, the program director at WFAN, does
concede that Imus' ratings showed that this winter he was losing
the men in the 25-to-54 age group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But what matters most, he said, is the kind of money that
advertisers will pay. And that remains high. ``Ultimately, you have
to judge him by his revenue performance,'' Chernoff said.

   Parody of Talk Magazine Upsets Disney
</P>
<P>
   Talk magazine, the offspring of Hearst Magazines and Miramax
that is being edited by Tina Brown, has yet to hit the newsstands.
But it has already inspired a parody, and a bit of lawyerly
snarling.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday morning, Michael Colton, a staff writer at Brill's
Content magazine, posted a Web site: Talkmagazine.net, a parody of
what Colton imagines Talk magazine might be.
</P>
<P>
   One section, titled ``What is Talk,'' reads: ``Conversation!
Discussion! Chatter! Banter! Emotion! Solipsism! Pretense! Cold
fusion and Krispy Kremes!''
</P>
<P>
   And under ``Who is Talk,'' there is this: ``Talk is a man who
loves it when a plan comes together, and a woman who loves that
same man. Talk is a small child staring out a big window, looking
at a dog, or a plane, or a poster supporting the campaign of
Hillary Clinton for U.S. Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Colton included a spoof of Ms. Brown's 30-second commercial for
the magazine, that runs on Miramax videocassettes, which he calls
``The Tina Rap''; it includes a yapping caricature of Ms. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Walt Disney Co., the parent of Miramax, were not
amused. Alan Friedman, general counsel and senior vice president of
business affairs at Miramax, complained to Earthlink, the Internet
service provider on whose computers the Web site appears.
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink immediately shut it down, notifying Colton by e-mail
that the site ``is making unauthorized use of copyrighted materials
and trademarks owned and controlled by Talk Magazine LLC and/or
Miramax Film Corp.''
</P>
<P>
   But by Friday evening, after Ms. Brown had read the parody and
told the Miramax legal department to back off, Earthlink restored
the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you wouldn't parody a magazine before it comes out,''
Colton said on Friday. ``But we're talking about Talk, where every
move the magazine makes gets on the cover of the tabloids. There's
so much hype and buzz that someone needed to make fun of it all.''

   Wall Street Journal Gets 10 Sunday Outlets
</P>
<P>
   Is this co-branding or cross-dressing? Come Sunday, Sept. 12,
The Denver Post and The Minneapolis Star Tribune will look like
their familiar selves, but there will be four pages inside that
look like, read like _ in fact are _ The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking free of the lockstep of Monday-to-Friday publication,
The Journal is producing a new insert called The Wall Street
Journal Sunday that will reach readers of 10 major metropolitan
newspapers that circulate 4.3 million copies every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers _ which also include The St. Petersburg Times,
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Orange County Register, The Fort
Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, The New
Orleans Times-Picayune, The Sacramento Bee and The Raleigh News &AMP;
Observer _ may find the Journal material to be an ally in the fight
against sagging Sunday sales. They will share the section's
advertising revenue with The Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's move recalls the way Parade magazine puts its
material before millions of readers. But in this case, the articles
will focus on personal finance and careers. And while Parade stands
alone, The Journal's Sunday section will appear in the newspapers'
business sections.
</P>
<P>
   Some editors had reservations about ceding space to The
Journal's journalists. Tim McGuire, the editor of The Minneapolis
Star Tribune, said some of his editors ``wouldn't have endorsed
it.'' But he added, ``You grab onto an opportunity to get quality
material.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole Campbell, the editor of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, had
his own explanation of the benefits: ``Make a broad analogy to a
perfume counter in a department store. It's not owned by the store,
but it's essential to the traffic.''

NEW SERVICE PROVIDES DATA ON INTERNET ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Monitoring service is being introduced that promises
to provide information about advertising on Web sites in, well,
Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   The service, Leading Web Advertisers, is intended to deliver
reports to subscribers that its founders say will capture and
categorize ads on hundreds of sites, offering data on which
marketers are running ads, when and where those ads appeared and
what they looked like. The goal is to help bring accountability to
the new media as ad spending in cyberspace continues its rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this industry, where things change so quickly, the ability
to find out about ads that ran just yesterday is very powerful,''
said Lee Nadler, president, chief executive and lead sherpa _ yes,
that's his title _ at Digital Pulp Inc., a New York agency that
creates online and off-line marketing campaigns for companies like
Altavista, Doubleclick and 1800flowers.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The service,'' Nadler said, ``is especially relevant for the
clients Digital Pulp handles _ dot-com companies that need
up-to-the-moment information to stay ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The principals of Leading Web Advertisers, which is being
demonstrated to Madison Avenue as beta testing proceeds, have
wide-ranging backgrounds in off-line media. One is Leon H. Liebman,
a venture capital investor who was the founder and chief executive
of Interactive Market Systems, a media and advertising data base
and software company that was sold in 1983 to VNU N.V. (VNU is the
parent of Competitive Media Reporting, the service that tracks ad
spending, which was known until 1992 as Leading National
Advertisers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is remarkable, the first truly global medium,'' said
Liebman, who is chairman of Leading Web Advertisers. ``When someone
said there ought to be an L.N.A. for the Web, that hit a button.''
</P>
<P>
   Another principal is Michael Kubin, managing director in New
York for Western Initiative Media, the media services unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real need to get at this information,'' said Kubin,
who is a director of Leading Web Advertisers, ``and the technology
has emerged to make it possible.'' The service has programmers in
London and New Jersey and a data administration team in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only a matter of time before someone plowed through the
programming logistics so people could have access to these kinds of
numbers at their desktops,'' said Paul Ahern, president and
managing partner at DDB Digital in New York, the interactive unit
of DDB Worldwide Communications Group, owned by Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   One feature that Ahern said he particularly appreciated about
the service was the ability ``for us to go on line for clients like
Compaq or Amtrak or Mobil to see what competitors are doing,
whether image ads, retail ads or price ads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can infer the marketing strategies of your competitors,''
he added. ``It's great.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is now tracking ads on 390 Web sites using what
Liebman described as ``the Willie Sutton model'' after the famed
crook who said he robbed banks because that was where the money
was. The sites include ABC News, America Online, CBS, Cnet, CNNfn,
E! Online, Etoys, Forbes, iVillage, the Internet Movie Data Base,
Lycos, MSNBC, MTV Online, Motley Fool, Mr.cq Showbiz, Newsweek.com,
Playboy Online, Red Herring, Sidewalk.com, The Sporting News,
Switchboard, Ticketmaster, Travelocity and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to get that information now is to have a summer intern
or a college student go through a million sites,'' said Scott
Schiller, senior vice president for advertising and sponsorship
sales at Buena Vista Internet Group in New York, a unit of the Walt
Disney Company. ``L.W.A. provides a valuable service by delivering
it in more timely fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent demonstration, Liebman and Kubin showed Leading Web
Advertisers performing a variety of tasks. For instance, when asked
for information on ads that ran for the first time the day before
on the tracked sites, the service displayed a lengthy list that
included AT&AMP;T Worldnet, Amazon.com and 800.com _ and presented
miniature versions of each ad.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to sort those new ads by the sites on which they
appeared, the service displayed a list of new advertisers on
Altavista that included Buy.com, Corbis, Furniture.com and Muzic
Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of information is likely to mean more revenue for
Web publishers,'' Schiller said. ``As a manager of a sales force,
if you see that Procter &AMP; Gamble just broke a campaign on this
site, you can make a call to ask for that business.''
</P>
<P>
   Liebman and Kubin said that the service would charge annual fees
that would range from $10,000 for small subscribers to ``six
figures'' for large ones. Among potential subscribers are agency
media departments, media buying services, companies that sell ad
space on the Internet and marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler at Digital Pulp said he was ``a fan who is looking into
subscribing.'' Ahern at DDB Digital said he was ``definitely an
interested possible subscriber.'' And Schiller at Buena Vista
Interactive, soon to become part of the Go.com company combining
Disney's Internet holdings, said he was ``likely to sign.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MUSTANG, Nev. _ For all its troubles, the Mustang Ranch is still
one popular bordello, running the same as normal.
</P>
<P>
   Midafternoon on a Thursday, with the Nevada sun showing its mean
streak, the men arrived at a steady clip, alone or in twos or
threes, every 10 minutes or so. They would ring the bell and the
madam would buzz them in through the 8-foot iron gate. Then a dozen
women in bikinis and halters and short-shorts would scurry from the
bar, making tracks in the deep red carpet with their stilettos as
they lined up in front of the foyer, smiling hard and crossing
their feet like would-be Miss Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, men would take their pick and head to a bedroom. More
often, they would stand under the two-story vaulted ceiling
blinking and staring before scurrying off to the bar to fortify
their nerves. The women would then cluster around them, filling the
air with fruity perfume from the Avon lady.
</P>
<P>
   No one talked about the bad times ahead. No one mentioned that
the ``World Famous Mustang Ranch,'' as it bills itself on signs and
mugs and T-shirts, is shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to think about,'' said a woman with long, elaborately
wavy black hair, iridescent fingernails and a turquoise hot-pants
set. ``No one wants to believe the Mustang is really closing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Storey County (population 2,700, spread over more than 200
square miles of hills and scrub brush just east of Reno), the
denial is as thick as Sierra ponderosas. A lot of people refuse to
believe that the federal government actually won its corruption
trial against the brothel's owners. More than that, they cannot
believe that the government can padlock the oldest, biggest, most
famous brothel in the one state in the nation that lets them be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the federal government trying to legislate morality
against what the state wants,'' said Charles Haynes, a Storey
County commissioner. ``The federal government wants to rule every
part of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   People worry that the Mustang Ranch situation will give brothel
opponents _ they are out there _ an opening to spearhead a movement
to get rid of Nevada's 35 prostitution houses for good. But federal
prosecutors maintain that they had to do something about the
Mustang Ranch's flouting of the law and giving houses of
prostitution a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a federal jury in Reno ordered the owners of the
brothel to turn it over to the government, along with other
properties owned by two companies convicted of being set up to hide
the identity of the Mustang Ranch's true owner, Joe Conforte. The
former Mustang Ranch madam and Storey County commissioner, Shirley
Colletti, was convicted of conspiring to protect her true boss.
</P>
<P>
   Conforte, the force behind the legalization of prostitution in
Nevada in 1967, founded the Mustang Ranch in 1955 and owned it
until 1990, when the Internal Revenue Service seized the brothel
for failure to pay taxes. The government successfully argued that
Conforte bought back the ranch at a tax sale for pennies on the
dollar, using cohorts as fronts, and that he has continued to run
it as a fugitive in South America.
</P>
<P>
   The brothel's general manager, Robert Del Carlo, who gave up his
post as Storey County sheriff after 28 years to take the job at the
Mustang Ranch last year, has been lying very low. But others here
tend to talk about the situation by recalling Conforte, now 80, as
a favorite uncle. They describe him as the guy with the voice like
a gargle of gravel who gave away 200 turkeys every Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never mention his good side,'' said Brenda Ferris, who
runs the hot pink concession stand in the Mustang Ranch parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the Mustang, and an annex there known as Mustang II,
is understandable here. The brothel, which employs 75 full-time
workers as well as the 80 or so women who work there as independent
contractors, is Storey County's third-largest employer, behind the
Kal Kan factory and the school district. Storey County, where there
are more quails and jack rabbits than taxpayers, relies on the
Mustang Ranch for $500,000 a year in tax revenue, one-eighth of the
county's $4 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The houses around the ranch are the kind you can either drive or
haul away on a flat-bed truck, and the people who live in them are
grateful that they pay $90 a month to park here, one of the lowest
rents in the state. The mobile home park, with more than 300
families, is one of the Conforte properties that the government has
seized, and the people living there have nothing good to say about
that.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the other people who rely on the Mustang for
income, like all the salespeople who come calling every week: the
jewelry man, the woman with the clothes, the hairdresser and the
80-year-old Avon Lady in her red T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Things have not always been this cushy. One of the Mustang
Ranch's senior managers, a woman who goes by the name of Pebbles,
sat in her suite at the Mustang Ranch II remembering when she was a
prostitute at the brothel 30 years ago. The ``ranch'' was four
connected trailers. Seven or eight women worked the business then,
and they worked hard. While the women today may ``party'' with
clients five times in one 12-hour shift, back then, they averaged
twice as many. ``One day I counted 36 clients,'' Pebbles said,
``then I stopped counting.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustang I, with its security tower, grand ballroom and beige
hotel-room walls, was built in 1976. Mustang II, with its low
ceilings and disco-look velvet couches, sprang up in 1982 to handle
the overflow. Together with the Old Bridge Ranch, a brothel 150
yards away from the main Mustang building, they are the busiest
businesses in this stretch of Storey County, just past the point on
Route 80 where the speed limit shifts from 65 to 70. An auto
wrecking yard and a growing landfill claim the turf just down the
road, and the Mustang Saloon, a truckers' haven, sits across the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   None of the prostitutes at the Mustang Ranch, who net $50,000 a
year or more after paying the house 50 percent commission, have
moved out. They are waiting until Aug. 9, the day the government
says it is closing the place down. At Mustang I, the consensus is
that it may not happen. ``It ain't over till the fat lady sings,''
one woman whispered, before excusing herself to mosey up to a
potential client nursing a double vodka two stools away at the bar.

SHUTTLE CREW WILL DEPLOY NEW X-RAY OBSERVATORY FOR STUDY OF THE
COSMOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MARK CARREAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Perhaps not since the launching of the Hubble Space
Telescope nearly a decade ago have astronomers awaited the arrival
of a new celestial observatory with such anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, a $1.55 billion, 45-foot-long,
high-tech assembly of precision-ground optics and science
instruments, promises at least a 10-fold improvement over previous
telescopes of its type, but many involved in the project predict
the improvements will be in the order of 100-fold.
</P>
<P>
   If successfully launched by the crew of the shuttle Columbia,
the Chandra will permit a relatively new breed of scientist _ the
X-ray astronomers _ to study the boundaries of black holes, chart
the locale of the mysterious dark matter that is believed to
comprise much of the universe, and trace the cosmic production of
the carbon, oxygen, iron and the other heavy elements that coalesce
to form stars, planets and the molecular ingredients of life as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of this must sound like science fiction,'' said Harvey
Tananbaum, who will direct Chandra observations from the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
``But in truth, it will be much better than science fiction because
in a few weeks we will actually be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cambridge, Tananbaum's team has sifted through 800 proposals
from astronomers around the world eager to use the telescope after
it completes its two-month orbital check-out. Only 200 requests
have been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia is scheduled to blast off with the telescope tonight
(Monday) &UR;  &LR; at 11:36 p.m. CDT from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in
Florida. Led by Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a
shuttle crew, the five astronauts plan to deploy the new
observatory and its two-stage propulsion system, within eight
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic moment, an exciting moment for
astrophysics,'' said Martin Weisskopf, Chandra's chief astronomer
on the eve of the liftoff. ``This is an age when superlatives are
used in everything from sports to politics, probably a little bit
too much. But I can't help but use these superlatives with this
telescope.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of just four large major space telescopes envisioned by
NASA for its post-Apollo years and dubbed the Great Observatories,
Chandra is all about superlatives.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades of development at the Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., five to 10 years of orbital operations, a
shuttle launch and construction of a one-of-a-kind, ground-based
optical testing facility will bring the total estimated mission
cost to $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big program,'' acknowledged Ed Weiler, NASA's
associate administrator for space science. ``We are putting a lot
of eggs in one basket. If it works like we think it will, it will
be well worth the investment, just like the Hubble was.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the space agency agreed to extend the
Hubble's orbital life from 15 to 20 years, enabling it to probe the
boundaries of the universe. But as Hubble's former chief
astronomer, Weiler recalls well that telescope's nightmarish
beginning. Weeks after it reached orbit in 1990, astronomers
discovered its primary mirror was misshapen, blurring its vision
and shaking public confidence in NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, shuttle astronauts managed to correct the
difficulties with a do-or-die repair mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hubble problem sent shivers through everyone in the space
science business,'' said Weiler. ``A lot of important lessons were
learned. The important thing is not only did we learn those
lessons, but we acted on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandra was headed toward an August 1998 liftoff when engineers
at Marshall and its prime contractor, California-based TRW,
discovered problems in the craft's computer software. Then the
supplier of critical electronic circuity disclosed problems with
similar components on another satellite. In April, the Air Force
lost a missile-warning satellite when its Boeing-made Inertial
Upper Stage, the same propulsion system bolted to Chandra,
misfired.
</P>
<P>
   So NASA invested another $53 million to keep the X-ray
observatory on the ground and correct its problems. Each difficulty
has not only been investigated and fixed, but each corrective
action was reviewed for the space agency by oversight committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have done everything humanly possible to ensure a
successful launching,'' said Weiler. ``Let me remind everybody,
though, this is not a trip to grandma's on a Sunday afternoon. It's
high-tech stuff. There are always risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandra is the third in NASA's Great Observatories series.
Hubble's 1990 launch was followed a year later by the Compton Gamma
Ray Observatory. Chandra's launch is to be followed in 2001 by the
last in the series, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the observatories is designed to capture emissions in
specific types of light emanating from celestial objects that are
shielded by the Eart's thick atmosphere from the view of even the
best ground-based observatories.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar to anyone who has visited a doctor or dentist, X-rays
are a high energy form of light emitted during the hottest, most
violent of cosmic events and those associated with the strongest
magnetic and electrical fields. Notable examples include stellar
explosions and galactic collisions, rapidly spinning neutron stars
and the high velocity jets of material that spring from some
massive black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional light-gathering telescopes like the Hubble are
incapable of capturing high energy X-rays. But specially designed
optics like the four barrel-shaped mirrors in the rear of Chandra
can capture and focus the rays. In ground tests, the telescope
focused the X-rays it gathered down a tapering 33-foot-long snout
to a focal area narrower than a human hair. Similar powers in a
pair of eyeglasses would enable the wearer to read a stop sign at a
dozen miles.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these exceptional qualities, the Chandra will be
useless unless it can attain altitudes above the Van Allen
radiation belts that surround the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, Columbia will blast the Chandra to an orbital
altitude of 176 miles. An hour after the astronauts deploy it, with
the shuttle a safe distance away, the observatory's Inertial Upper
Stage will take over. Thrusting the telescope in two automated
burns, Chandra should attain an elliptical orbit with a low point
of 236 miles and a high point of nearly 52,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra's internal propulsion systems will finish the journey
over the first 11 days of its mission, pushing the observatory to a
final elongated orbit with a low point of 6,200 miles and a high
point of 87,000 miles, or about one third of the way to the moon.
This orbital vantage point will permit the telescope to spend about
85 percent of its time outside the Van Allen Belt.
</P>
<P>
   With a successful check-out, Chandra should be ready for its
first trial observation in about three weeks.

DISCORD REIGNS AS YUGOSLAV OPPOSITION CONSIDERS MILOSEVIC'S
OUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A leading Serbian opposition politician
says the best way to get President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
out of power is to seduce him to resign, promising him immunity
from arrest or extradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I really do to force Milosevic to resign?'' the
opposition figure, Vuk Draskovic, said Sunday in an interview.
``But a transitional government is a way for him to exit.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said he would soon name a shadow Yugoslav government
of experts led by a prime minister selected by the democratic
leader of Montenegro, the small republic that with Serbia makes up
Yugoslavia. He will then try to press Milosevic through public
rallies to accept that government and call new elections in three
to six months, while Draskovic works to attract disaffected
Milosevic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   That is Draskovic's notion, at least. But others in the Yugoslav
opposition think that now is the time to confront and oust
Milosevic, not to succor him. It is an example of how the
opposition disagrees even on the core issues since Milosevic's
defeat in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite prodding from senior American and European diplomats to
adopt a united platform, senior opposition figures here remain
intensely competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Their lack of unity makes it more likely that if Milosevic
falls, it will be through a chaotic outpouring of discontent _ the
kind of street violence that Draskovic and many other Serbs say
they should avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's aides make clear that Milosevic could remain in
power ``as a figurehead,'' with the idea that he would resign
later, and Draskovic says he has no intention of prosecuting
Milosevic or turning him over to the International War Crimes
Tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we preach hatred and revenge, then we can't broaden our
support,'' Draskovic said. ``Milosevic must accept when he realizes
the majority of Serbia supports this program, but we can't have a
majority without some Milosevic supporters, and we can't get them
by promising them prison and hatred in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in Kragujevac, at his first large street rally,
Draskovic urged some 20,000 supporters to avoid violence and the
dangers of civil war, and he urged all opposition figures to unite
behind a single program that Milosevic could accept.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said he agrees with senior U.S. officials that the
opposition must agree on a common platform.
</P>
<P>
   But while many in the opposition lament the discord, they have
not yet overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Alliance for Change _ a grouping of opposition
parties, in particular the Democratic Party of a rival of
Draskovic, Zoran Djindjic _ is calling for Milosevic to resign
immediately, with a transitional government to be named then, and
with no early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Slobodan Vuksanovic, the deputy chairman of the Democratic
Party, was pessimistic in an interview Sunday. ``Everyone knows
everything about the Milosevic regime,'' he said. ``And we've just
lost Kosovo, and the saddest part is the opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what we all know: that no one can beat the Milosevic
regime alone, and that if they are not united, Milosevic will stay
in power. Milosevic won't resign without pressure from the streets,
and people won't come out into the streets unless they see a united
opposition. And the leaders don't seem to care.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuksanovic is most upset with the convolutions of Draskovic, who
has belatedly decided to stage street rallies and was a member of
Milosevic's government throughout much of the Kosovo war. But
Vuksanovic did not exclude his own leader, Djindjic, from his
criticism, or the other leaders of the small opposition parties in
the Alliance for Change.
</P>
<P>
   Before an important Alliance rally in the central Serbian town
of Kraljevo, Vuksanovic said, ``the leaders sat around like at a
funeral, and they competed with each other over who will make the
first speech and the last.'' They did not even brief each other on
the content of their speeches, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party itself is divided on the presumably
important question of whether a new government would hand Milosevic
over for trial in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic has said in interviews that he would hand over
Milosevic; Vuksanovic says that is Djindjic's stand but not party
policy, and he himself would put Milosevic on trial at home.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic would leave Milosevic in peace so long as he resigns,
and says that the Hague indictment ``was very political and very
stupid,'' making the president's ouster harder.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, of course, is likely to trust none of the
opposition's options, which is why officials close to Draskovic say
that the indictment of Milosevic makes a peaceful transition much
more difficult. They argue that it leaves Milosevic with little
alternative but to fight for his survival in office and reject
resignation unless he receives firm guarantees for his safety and
that of his family.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. diplomat, Robert S. Gelbard, has met all key
opposition leaders and urged them to unite at least on a joint
platform, and they are trying, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But Vuksanovic said: ``Mr. Gelbard will get a Nobel Prize if he
gets a united opposition.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A senior adviser to Draskovic, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that such divisions are hurting all the opposition
parties in private opinion polls and further alienating Serbs from
any politician. While the Draskovic party has been getting about 15
percent support, just behind the bedrock 20 percent or so that
Milosevic still receives, it is now slipping again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of anger in Serbian towns from army reservists,
the unemployed, young people despairing of a collapsed economy and
a new wave of Serbian refugees from Kosovo. Spontaneous
demonstrations in a Milosevic stronghold like Leskovac brought out
thousands of people, but the parties are having trouble channeling
that anger into something positive and convincing.
</P>
<P>
   When demonstrations turn violent or chaotic, as they did last
week in Valjevo when an artist called on the crowd to march on city
hall, the Milosevic government has been quick to capitalize in
propaganda terms, warning that the opposition could bring the
country to civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Just Sunday, the army chief of staff, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic,
warned opposition leaders that ``those who call for a forceful
ouster of the legally elected authorities'' will not get popular
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the task of us all now to preserve the stability of the
country because there are many sold souls, Western vassals, who
want to take power by force and take the country into a new
catastrophe,'' he told the state-run newspaper Politika.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic says the dangers of civil war are real, which is
partly why he dismisses as ``crazy'' Djindjic's proposal for a
massive march next month on Belgrade, with participants coming from
throughout Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Vuksanovic says a better time would be September, when at least
students have returned to Belgrade. He notes that many army
reservists brought home at least two guns. ``People are more afraid
of civil war than of NATO's bombing,'' he said, ``and state
propaganda manipulates the message in a very intelligent way.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuksanovic is among the opposition leaders who feel that splits
within a weakened and nervous ruling elite are more likely to be
the catalyst for Milosevic's resignation than the rallies of the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   He even suggests that the West should do a deal with Milosevic,
promising him immunity if he would leave the country and go,
Vuksanovic suggests, to, say, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, too, is looking for the regime to split under the
pressure of international isolation and the need to keep Montenegro
in a federal Yugoslavia. With no Montenegro there is no Yugoslavia,
and hence no need for a Yugoslav president, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is in a shameful position and he knows that, as a
federal president who can't visit the sister republic or even a
province of Serbia, Kosovo,'' Draskovic said. ``He's in real
difficulties. And I believe that in September, when people will
start to feel the danger of winter, we can solve all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some businessmen close to the Milosevic system have had
exploratory talks with Draskovic and his aides, but they seem
mostly to be trying to hedge their bets.
</P>
<P>
   And the politicians say that the moderate Yugoslav deputy prime
minister, Zoran Lilic, is talking about creating a new party, the
Social Democratic Center, with the former army boss, Momcilo
Perisic, whom Milosevic fired last autumn. That party could split
the ruling elite and appeal to army and police officers unhappy
with the Kosovo adventure, the politicians say.
</P>
<P>
   But even committed democrats are not sure that new elections
will end Milosevic's 12-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sincerely and intimately, no one really expects that the
system will change through elections,'' said Goran Svilanovic, the
leader of the small opposition Civic Alliance party. ``The
political scene is perverse and I'm part of this perversion. No
group is really ready for elections; no one dares to have them.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's former leader, Vesna Pesic, who was given a medal by
President Clinton for her work for democracy, said: ``Let's forget
about elections. I'm in favor of putschist methods. He's got to go
without elections.''
</P>
<P>
   A top Draskovic aide says the opposition is losing time and
allowing the regime to catch its breath. ``Despite everything,
people are afraid of change,'' he said. ``They're tired and they're
afraid to lose what little they have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the first time the Milosevic regime has been shaky.
The problem is that nobody is the obvious alternative to Milosevic.
That's what we are trying to become.''

 &HT;    Few new facts on Day 2 of Kennedy TV coverage
 &HT;    By Robbyn Footlick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On television, Day Two coverage of John F. Kennedy
Jr.'s disappearance looked much like Day One _ spokesmen struggling
through press conferences yielding few new facts; officers
searching Martha's Vineyard beaches on four-wheelers; reports from
in front of the Kennedy homes with only speculation as to what
might be going on inside.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day networks spent on the air for fear of missing the
story, desperately seeking new reports and settling instead for
interviews with the man who once owned the Piper Saratoga Kennedy
was piloting and explanations of how sonar works. A day spent
trying not to use the past tense. A day spent putting into
perspective the media interest in the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Kennedy is a celebrity, of course. But he is not a
president or head of state,'' noted CNN's Bruce Morton. The
parallel, he pointed out, may not be to John Kennedy's late father
but to the late Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much one person, but the family. Somehow the
Kennedys mean something to Americans. . . They are in our hearts
and souls to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coverage,'' he said after a pregnant pause, ``will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it did _ though the wall-to-wall network coverage began
to drop off throughout the day _ first ABC, which aired the British
Open; then NBC and CBS, which returned to regular programming at
noon, with some break-ins for live coverage. By midday, virtually
only CNN remained fulltime.
</P>
<P>
   The blitz continued Sunday night with CBS, ABC and NBC airing
special editions of their ``60 Minutes,'' ``20/20'' and
``Dateline,'' respectively. CNN, too, morphed its Sunday night
edition of ``CNN &AMP; Time'' to a special called ``JFK Jr.: The Images
and the Stories'' and planned for a last-minute ``Larry King Live''
at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange early in the day, CNN's Wolf Blitzer and the
Coast Guard's Adm. Richard Larrabee may have captured the essence
of both television's endless coverage and the search:
</P>
<P>
   ``How long do you let this go on before you....give up?'' asked
Blitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee replied, ``I don't like to say we'll 'give up.'''

SHUTTLE, WITH FIRST FEMALE COMMANDER, SET FOR LAUNCH
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., _ The shuttle Columbia, its $2.8 billion
astronomy mission delayed nearly a year by a succession of
technical problems, is poised for launch late tonight (Monday; eds.
it will be Tuesday morning on East Coast) under the first-ever
command of a woman, NASA shuttle managers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Led by mission commander Eileen Collins, Columbia was scheduled
to blast off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center at 11:36 p.m. CDT,
with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, a 45-foot long space
telescope designed to probe black holes, distant quasars and other
high energy objects in the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory has overcome a succession of obstacles,
thwarting NASA's original plan to launch in August 1998. These
included problems with the flight control software, electronic
circuitry for the command system and the failure of an identical
propulsion system on a military mission that was launched on a
Titan 4 expendable rocket in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finally come to the point where we completed all of our
management reviews, and we are ready to proceed to launching,''
said Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program director, after Sunday's
mission management team review. ``Our launch and flight teams are
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chandra engineers were alerted to a potential problem
with 20 capacitors, small electronic components that store
electricity, aboard the observatory. A fast-paced analysis,
however, determined that Chandra's capacitors were off a different
manufacturer and design than those that prompted a notice from a
vendor, Dittemore said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's launching period spans 46 minutes, or until Tuesday
at 12:22 a.m. CDT. The brief opportunity for lift-off will require
favorable weather, and forecasters on Sunday placed the prospect of
favorable conditions at 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There was a slight concern that the beginnings of a tropical
weather system in the Caribbean could generate thunderstorms close
enough to the launch complex to interfere.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who announced Collins'
promotion to commander on the five-day mission at a White House
ceremony in March 1998, was scheduled to attend Columbia's
launching, arriving here during in the final hours of the
countdown, the space agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 42, piloted shuttle missions in 1997 and 1995. She is a
U. S. Air Force colonel and test pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Observing a day-for-night schedule throughout their flight,
Collins, pilot Jeff Ashby, flight engineer Steve Hawley, mission
specialist Catherine ``Cady'' Coleman and French astronaut Michel
Tognini will awaken in the early evening and climb aboard Columbia
shortly before 9 p.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Their first day aloft is slated to be a busy one as they attempt
to deploy the big telescope and its attached, 30,600 pound
propulsion system within the first eight hours of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The effort will require especially close coordination between
Coleman, who is in charge of deploying Chandra, mission control in
Houston, an Air Force flight control unit for the observatory's
propulsion system in Sunnyvale, Calif., and a telescope control
team in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   NASA said Sunday that, if necessary, it is prepared to make
three consecutive attempts to launch Columbia, instead of the usual
two in a row, before it offers a rest break to its launch control
teams here.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the shuttle off on time is important because on July 23,
the shuttle team is expected to relinquish its use of Air Force
ground tracking equipment and personnel to the Boeing Co., which is
preparing for the launch of a commercial Delta II rocket with four
communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Following that, the Air Force plans upgrades of its ground-based
tracking facilities, which would force a postponement of Columbia's
lift off to at least Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Columbia would have a little over a week to maneuver for
additional launching opportunities before it would face another
lengthy postponement, potentially into late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia is overdue for a routine, year-long refurbishment. NASA
is also planning shuttle flights in September and a high priority
mission to the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, this year the space agency said the space telescope's
pointing system is in need of new gyroscopes.

NASA CLEARS SHUTTLE FOR HISTORIC, PERILOUS MISSION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas)  (jw) 
 By BETH DICKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Shrugging off last-minute technical
concerns about a $1.5 billion space telescope aboard Columbia, NASA
Sunday cleared the shuttle and its first female commander for
flight on a delivery mission already laden with pitfalls. Liftoff
from the seaside Kennedy Space Center remained set for 12:36 a.m.
Tuesday, 30 years to the day after two American astronauts first
landed on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Col. Eileen Collins and four other astronauts will be
ready to take their seats in Columbia's cockpit about three hours
before liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   The technical question centered on electrical capacitors in the
power system of the Chandra X-ray Observatory that the shuttle crew
aims to place in Earth orbit on Tuesday. It turned out to be a
false alarm, but it was just one more in a series of hardware and
software hiccups that already have put the telescope's launch a
year behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an accomplishment in getting this payload as far as
it has come in the past year,'' Ron Dittemore, the NASA shuttle
program director, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Collins, 42, and her co-pilot, Navy Capt. Jeffrey Ashby,
45, had a scheduled jaunt in sleek T-38 training jets Sunday night
while three mission specialists had time to relax at a beach house
near Columbia's launch pad. The astronauts _ under intense media
scrutiny because Col. Collins is making history _ confessed they
felt pressure to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unrealistic to think that Chandra could have a useful
on-orbit lifetime of 10 or 20 years,'' Steven Hawley, 47, the
astronomer-mission specialist, said Friday. ``In all of that time,
we get to personally interact with it for one day. That's a really
important day for us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, too, mission managers opted to take an extra look at
Chandra after its builder, TRW Space and Electronics Group,
discovered cracked capacitors in power supplies similar to the ones
used on the telescope. The review turned up nothing unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a number of meetings that went well into the night,''
Dittemore said. ``Those capacitors were of a different design and a
different manufacturer.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Weiler, NASA's associate administrator for space science,
described the delivery mission as tricky at best. ``Let me remind
everybody, this is not a trip to Grandma's on a summer afternoon,''
he said recently. ``It's high-tech stuff, and there are always
risks.'' When ground facilities and data-handling costs are added
to the telescope price, almost $3 billion is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The risks will begin at liftoff, as Columbia heads to orbit with
its longest and heaviest payload ever. Chandra's 57-foot length and
50,162-pound weight, combined with the fact that it is anchored in
the aft end of the cargo bay, will complicate matters for Col.
Collins and Ashby if any problem on ascent forces them to try an
emergency landing. Once in space, the astronauts have few chances
to get the deployment right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we deploy Chandra, we cannot get it back,'' Col. Collins
said in Houston on July 7, the crew's last news conference before
liftoff. The window of opportunity for an on-time release is 8
minutes and 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, 7 hours and 17 minutes after
liftoff Air Force Lieut. Col. Catherine ``Cady'' Coleman, 38, will
pull a lever in the cockpit to eject the telescope into orbit 175
miles above the planet. Col. Collins will fly the shuttle to a safe
distance 35 miles from the telescope. There, the crew will wait one
tense hour for the two-stage rocket motor to ignite and propel the
telescope toward its working altitude as high as 87,000 miles _ an
orbit one-third of the way to the moon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The motor, a Boeing Inertial Upper Stage, is virtually identical
to one that stranded a $250 million missile-warning satellite in a
useless orbit when it malfunctioned during an April flight of an
Air Force Titan 4 rocket.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials insist a problem with Chandra's upper stage has
been corrected, but say the Air Force is prohibiting them from
releasing details about the trouble or the fix.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra also has limited power. Once the astronauts unplug the
telescope from the shuttle's electrical system, they must deploy it
within 4.5 hours or risk depleting its batteries. If that happens,
they will be forced to dump the telescope overboard. Regardless of
what happens, Columbia will have no further role in the deployment.
The telescope is not designed to be retrieved or maintained by
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the booster lights, the shuttle cannot go and get it
because the shuttle cannot go to this high orbit,'' Col. Collins
said. Col. Coleman and Michel Tognini, 47, a French Air Force
colonel who is a mission specialist, are trained to walk in space
to make minor repairs. Their options, however, are limited.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the five-day mission, the astronauts will tend
to secondary scientific chores, including a host of life and
materials experiments.

<P>
   He's a member of the world's most exclusive club since the 12
apostles; in fact, what he accomplished is something no one will
ever be able to match.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he's a virtual unknown. You might know his name, but odds
are you wouldn't recognize his face. He could probably walk into
any newsroom in America and all he'd get would be, ``Can I help
you, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   The man's name is Neil Armstrong. He was the first of the 12 men
who have set foot on the moon in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
(Ten are still alive today.)
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday marks the 30th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11
mission, manned by Armstrong; Buzz Aldrin, who was 14 minutes
behind Armstrong in climbing down the ladder of the Eagle and
reaching the moondust of the Sea of Tranquility; and Michael
Collins, who hovered above the moon in the command module. To
commemorate the occasion, NASA held a banquet Friday at the Kennedy
Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Armstrong agreed to
attend these ceremonies. He's always been good about honoring his
NASA obligations.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't give any one-on-one interviews, he made it clear
before he arrived that he wouldn't be signing autographs for
anyone, and he only reluctantly participated in a press conference.
(Asked if he regularly thinks about his trip to the moon, he
replied with typical understatement, ``Probably only when you guys
remind me.'')
</P>
<P>
   This is pretty much the way it's always been with Armstrong. The
late Joe DiMaggio was gregarious by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   My own attempts to reach Armstrong by telephone over the years _
at the University of Cincinnati, where he once taught; at his farm
outside Lebanon, Ohio; and later at the home he purchased in a
suburb of Cincinnati _ have never yielded any results. With
extremely rare exceptions, journalists from around the world
haven't had any better luck. Once a decade or so, Armstrong will
give an interview in which he explains that he doesn't like giving
interviews; other than that, he can't be bothered with us.
</P>
<P>
   And that's kind of excellent when you think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the celebrity, the novelty act, the superstar,
Armstrong could have become had he been so inclined. In a world
where everyone from deserving talents such as Ricky Martin and Mia
Hamm to schlubs like Monica Lewinsky and Eminem can achieve
international recognition overnight, imagine the endorsement
potential, the mediability, of the only man in history who could
have said things like, ``Hey kids! I was the first person in the
world to walk on the moon, and I want you to be the first one on
your block to try new Crunchy-Munch cereal! It's out of this
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Cereal, gym shoes, computers, whatever. Armstrong could have
become the Golden Endorser.
</P>
<P>
   And if network TV anchors and former senators can command
$20,000 per speech, imagine the fees Armstrong would have fetched
on the banquet circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention what he could have gotten for an autobiography,
or for being an analyst for CNN or ABC or Fox News. The
possibilities were _ and are _ almost as unlimited as space itself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Armstrong has done virtually nothing to capitalize on his
unique status. When the Apollo 11 team returned to Earth in July of
1969, they spent several days in quarantine, where they gave
detailed accounts of their adventure. Shortly thereafter, NASA sent
the three astronauts on a global tour, and Armstrong played along.
At NASA's behest, he signed hundreds upon hundreds of photos-but to
this day, he still bristles at in-person requests for autographs.
Ten years after the moon landing, Armstrong stunned everyone who
knew him by doing a Chrysler commercial.
</P>
<P>
   That's been about the extent of his public exposure. Armstrong
taught at the University of Cincinnati, tended his farm, divorced
his longtime wife, remarried _ and pretty much kept to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say Armstrong was a recluse because he didn't
want a repeat of the nightmare that was Charles Lindbergh's life as
a celebrity. Others maintain the man was shy to the point of being
aloof before the mission; why would he change because the whole
world suddenly knew his name?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe on one level we've been cheated. The lunar missions
weren't only about science and technology; they were about
humankind's ability to achieve miracles that transcended our own
petty squabbles and made us truly realize that we're but one small
ripple in an infinite pool. It would have been nice if the first
man on the moon could have shared more of that experience with us.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also something refreshing about Armstrong's refusal
to join the never-ending parade of athletes, actors, singers,
politicians, computer geniuses, explorers and princesses who become
blazingly, fleetingly famous.
</P>
<P>
   His was the first footprint on the moon, and maybe that's
statement enough from any one man.

<P>
   The one time I saw John F. Kennedy Jr. in person was also in
1996, when he hosted a party in Chicago during the Democratic
Convention. It was an almost comically star-studded event _ at the
time I wrote that it was like being ``in the middle of one of those
Mad magazine crowd scenes, where everyone is a quipping celebrity''
_ with Kennedys everywhere, and familiar faces from Oprah Winfrey
to Kevin Costner to Aretha Franklin to Norman Mailer mingling
about.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, any one of those aforementioned
superstars would have been the epicenter of a social gathering, but
when Kennedy walked into that party, the TV icons and the movie
stars became background extras in the movie of Kennedy's life _ a
movie that has been playing since the day he was born.
</P>
<P>
   I watched from a safe perch as men threw their arms around
Kennedy's shoulders and posed for photos, and women placed their
palms on his chest, gazed into his eyes and chatted him up in
rapid-fire fashion, knowing their time with him would be extremely
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working a crowd ... is natural to Kennedy,'' I wrote. ``He's
polite and in the moment, obviously aware that the meaningless 30
seconds for him is a lifetime story for the person meeting him.''
</P>
<P>
   That John Jr. was a man in his 30s who was still trying to forge
his own path is largely irrelevant. He was living history.
</P>
<P>
   And whether he liked it or not, his destiny was out of his
hands. Silly and undeserving as the title might be, John F. Kennedy
Jr. would always be thought of as an unofficial American prince.
That night in Chicago, we all swooned like intoxicated subjects in
his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, it was the news about Princess Diana that stopped
the world on a summer Saturday. From a coldly analytical news
point, I thought I had witnessed the celebrity death of the decade.
Nothing could possibly match the drama, the sadness and the public
outpouring of grief surrounding the death of Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, that might still hold true. But in the United States,
where the cliche for decades has been to call the Kennedy family
``the closest thing to American royalty,'' this tragedy resonates
more deeply and more personally _ especially for Baby Boomers and
their children.
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Americans, the photo of John-John playing under
his father's desk in the White House was the perfect symbol of the
Camelot generation _ one brief shining moment when to be a young
parent in the United States in the early 1960s meant one was
standing on the threshold of the most prosperous era a modern
civilization had ever known. The possibilities seemed limitless.
</P>
<P>
   By that same measuring stick, the image of John-John saluting
his father's casket was a sobering, crushing reminder that Camelot
was but a fairy tale, and that the real world was still a cold and
violent place where even the most privileged and favored little boy
might have to grow up without a father.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that a man saddled with the name of John Kennedy
Jr. spent most of his 20s rebelling against seriousness and
success. Had a woman comported herself as Kennedy did in the 1980s
_ roller skating around in skimpy outfits, dating a series of
Hollywood beauties, struggling mightily to pass the bar exam _ she
would have been categorized as a hopeless bimbo.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the tabloid press took it easy on Kennedy _ but there
was a kind of wink-wink quality to much of the coverage. Who could
blame the guy for treating life like a big dish of candy? There
would be ample opportunity in the future for him to assume his
legacy and start thinking about elective office ...
</P>
<P>
   More surprising than Kennedy's late-maturing personality was his
decision to helm a magazine that took an irreverent look at
politics and the media. How weird was it when John Jr. did a coy,
naked-in-the-shadows shot for his George magazine, or when he had
Drew Barrymore dressing up as Marilyn Monroe for a cover shot, over
the caption, ``Happy Birthday, Mr. President''?
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the magazine (which has struggled in recent
months) seemed like a passing fancy, not something that would have
occupied Kennedy's professional life for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what he might have ended up doing. I'm sure he thought
he had plenty of time to figure it all out.
</P>
<P>
   There's the pity.

ISRAEL TO ORDER 5O U.S. JETS, LARGEST ARMS PURCHASE IN ITS
HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Texas, Md., Wash.)  (js) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel confirmed Sunday that it plans to add at
least 50 more F-16s to an already formidable jet fighter fleet,
signaling a determination to maintain decisive regional air power
superiority even as it pursues peace deals with its Middle Eastern
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In what would be the largest arms purchase in Israel's history,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has told U.S. officials that his country
wants to buy 50 new F-16E fighter-bombers, a $2.5 billion order,
with an option to order up to 60 more jets for a further $2
billion. Israel already has more than 250 F-16s, the largest fleet
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting on Friday in the Pentagon, Barak told Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen that Israel had decided to choose the
F-16 over the more advanced but costly F-15 in its long-expected
fleet expansion. Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer, was informed of
Israel's decision ``verbally'' and expects to sign a contract later
this year, a company spokesman, Joe Stout, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had an airplane that had almost the same capability for
much less money, so ultimately it was not a tough decision,'' said
Moshe Arens, who as defense minister in Israel's last government
had favored the F-16 order.
</P>
<P>
   At Barak's request, the final decision was deferred until he
took office this month. Avi Kalstein, a defense ministry spokesman,
said here Sunday that ``after studying it, Barak decided to
follow'' recommendations from the Israeli Defense Force and
Ministry of Defense to buy the F-16.
</P>
<P>
   The jets will be purchased with U.S. taxpayer funds. Israel's
military aid package is budgeted at $1.86 billion this year, but
slated to rise as economic aid to Israel declines in the coming
decade. Israel must spend all but $400 million of its annual U.S.
aid appropriation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's new F-16s, to be delivered between 2002 and 2004, will
have better navigation systems and a longer flight range than their
predecessors. That will put Iran and Iraq well within strike range
and further strengthen an air force now considered more potent than
Italy's or Germany's.
</P>
<P>
   As Israel did in Lebanon last month, it is likely to use
punitive or pre-emptive bombing raids increasingly as its offensive
strategy of choice, as opposed to the high-risk border blitzkriegs
and commando raids of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wake of the Gulf War, and in the wake of Kosovo, Israel
is also putting more of its resources into air power,'' said Gerald
Steinberg, an Israeli military policy analyst at Bar-Ilan
University. ``Israel is at least as sensitive to casualties as the
United States is.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing the F-16, Israel ended a fierce corporate battle
here between Lockheed Martin, which builds the jet in Forth Worth,
Texas, and Boeing, which produces the F-15 at a subsidiary in St.
Louis. In both cities thousands of jobs were at stake.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two aerospace giants had competed aggressively for the
Israeli contract for more than a year, cutting prices and trumping
each other's offers of lucrative production-sharing contracts with
Israeli defense manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase announcement, delayed deliberately until Barak's
visit to Washington, was an unexpectedly timely piece of good news
for Lockheed Martin. The Maryland-based defense contractor was
shaken last week by an unexpected House defense subcommittee
recommendation to halt planned production of what was to have been
the biggest project in company history, the F-22 jet fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great news,'' Stout said, helping to assure continued
production of the F-16 in Fort Worth until production of a
successor aircraft begins there in 2007. ``We are grateful to the
government of Israel for its confidence in our product.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the decade, during the administration of Yitzhak
Rabin, Israel began shifting toward the Boeing F-15, which can fly
farther and faster with heavier armament. Boeing is now delivering
the final planes from Israel's initial order of 25, and the Seattle
aviation giant had offered generous technological and investment
inducements for a second purchase.
</P>
<P>
   After first promising Israel $500 million in production-sharing
business here, not all of it directly related to the F-15 order,
Boeing had recently increased its offer to $1 billion in local
investments, company officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But each twin-engine F-15 still costs $40 million compared with
$25 million for its recently improved single-engine rival, and
Israel concluded that 50 jets was a better strategic investment
than 30. Senior officers at the Israeli Defense Force,
contemplating aerial combat against large armored land forces, had
argued for the bigger fleet expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin also sweetened its local spending package, with
investment commitments said here to approach $900 million. About 25
percent of the expenditure on the planned new F-16I line _ the
designator ``I'' is for Israel _ will go to Israeli subcontractors,
Stout estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Louis, Boeing officials acknowledged that they had
expected the Israeli decision. ``The F-15 is the higher-end
strategic deterrent, but with the dollars available, the additional
planes and their force structure was the priority for them,'' said
Tom Downey, a spokesman for Boeing there.
</P>
<P>
   The contract loss puts the F-15's future into further doubt,
Downey said. Even before Israel's announcement, Boeing had
announced that it was laying off 7,000 workers in Missouri after a
March decision by the Greek Air Force to buy F-16s instead of
F-15s. Production of the aircraft is slated to cease _ perhaps
permanently _ next year.
</P>
<P>
   Arens said it remained unclear whether the new F-16s will be
equipped with their customary American-made Westinghouse radar or,
as Israel would prefer, an Israeli radar system that he and other
local military experts contend is more advanced. There has been
resistance in Congress to the substitution of Israeli technology in
the plane, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems primarily to be a commercial consideration,'' Arens
said. ``It's like the way that Microsoft pushes its browser down
your throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Arens, who served as defense minister three times, said he would
favor reducing Israel's military aid from the United States if more
of the remaining money could be spent on Israeli technology. ``That
is a solution that could be in both our interests,'' he said.

MCCAIN OUTLINES STRATEGY TO FORCE DEBATE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE
REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain, a sponsor of legislation to
overhaul the campaign finance laws, said Sunday that he would start
using parliamentary tactics this week to try to force the issue to
the Senate floor unless Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
agrees to set aside a ``reasonable period of time'' for the bill's
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Republican of Arizona, who has made his effort to reduce
the influence of money in politics the centerpiece of his long-shot
campaign for his party's presidential nomination, said he had begun
negotiations with Lott on Thursday and was awaiting a response.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McCain said he wanted ``a week of so'' of
Senate time devoted to the issue, with ample time for amendments to
be considered. Otherwise, he said he would look for opportunities
this week to attach the measure to unrelated legislation to force
it to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Lott of Mississippi has been a steadfast opponent of McCain's
bill. In an appearance on ``Fox News Sunday,'' he said it ``is not
the solution.'' He expressed interest instead in legislation to
make it harder for organized labor, generally a strong supporter of
Democrats, to use union dues for political causes.
</P>
<P>
   His spokesman, John Czwartacki, said he expected a proposal
``for how best we can address the campaign finance issue to be made
to Senator McCain sometime tomorrow.'' But in his television
appearance, Lott did not sound like he was prepared to schedule
debate soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to encourage him to find some other way to do
it or wait until the end of the year,'' he said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation that McCain sponsors with Sen. Russell D.
Feingold, D-Wis., would ban the unlimited and unregulated donations
to political parties known as ``soft money,'' which have
increasingly been used as a way around the contributions limits to
federal candidates that were enacted after the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also put limits in the period approaching
elections on issue advocacy commercials that are thinly veiled
attempts to support or oppose particular candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The legislaiton is fiercely opposed by Republican leaders who
say it encroaches on First Amendment guarantees of free speech. The
Republican Party traditionally raises more soft money than the
Democrats do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the legislation won a majority last year in both the
House and Senate. But while 52 senators voted for it, its sponsors
could not draw the additional eight votes needed to stop a
Republican filibuster against it.
</P>
<P>
   And this year its supporters have had difficulty getting the
legislation to the floor. In the House, the bill's sponsors had
hoped to put pressure on the Senate and give the issue momentum by
passing the legislation by Memorial Day. But Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert refused to allow the bill to the floor until sometime in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Now McCain said he has decided to try to spur Senate action.
McCain said he wanted to see if he could increase support for the
bill by making some changes through the amendment process. He said
he thought he might pick up votes if he were willing to increase
the current $1,000 limit on what an individual can give to a
federal candidate to take account of inflation. The contribution
limit has not been raised since it was enacted after Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate debate on campaign finance now would also serve to give
McCain a platform to amplify one of his presidential themes. In an
address in New Hampshire last month he called on Republican voters
to rise up against a campaign finance system that he described as
``an elaborate influence peddling scheme in which both parties
conspire to stay in office by selling the country to the highest
bidder.''

 &HT;    Family photographer remembers John Jr.'s days in Palm Beach
 &HT;    By Thom Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Once again the stars cross. Once again a
family that believed itself destined for greatness must face pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business of watching another Kennedy tragedy _ you just
say, `How many times can it happen?''' Bob Davidoff said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, Davidoff has been the Kennedy family's
unofficial photographer in Palm Beach. From near and far, he has
seen the family in celebration and in crisis, amazed by their
strength and resiliency. Now, while vacationing in New Jersey, he
sees it again, coordinating with his office in Palm Beach the
numerous requests for photographs from media around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Davidoff first saw John F. Kennedy Jr. when he was an infant,
shortly after his father's inauguration in 1961. As usual, a call
from Rose Kennedy summoned him to the Kennedy estate on North
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was put into a baby carriage and wheeled out into the shade
while he was asleep, but we got pictures,'' Davidoff recalled. The
family always liked pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``When John-John was old enough to walk, he was posing for
pictures,'' Davidoff said. ``(His sister) Caroline would grab his
hand and lead him around.''
</P>
<P>
   Years before John F. Kennedy became president, Davidoff
intentionally developed a rapport with family matriarch Rose
Kennedy, taking photographs of her and her husband, Joseph, at
charity events and other social affairs in Palm Beach. Soon he was
being invited to the house to shoot family gatherings _ birthdays,
Christmas, Easter. Throughout their relationship, the Kennedys
trusted Davidoff not to distribute scandalous or controversial
pictures to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Once, for example, he spied Jacqueline Kennedy coming from a
hair appointment at Saks Fifth Avenue, her hair in curlers. He
didn't take the picture. He was rewarded by being the only
photographer allowed for farewell photos of JFK at Palm Beach
International Airport. They became the last photos of the president
in Palm Beach County, taken five days before his ill-fated trip to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   His photos of John Jr. run from a playful child being hoisted
overhead by his father, to the shy youngster being shielded by his
mother as they passed through a throng of onlookers at St. Edwards
Church in Palm Beach, to the devil-may-care teenager being rescued
by his cousins after falling overboard from a sailboat in Hyannis
Port.
</P>
<P>
   Davidoff last saw John-John as a child at about age 12 when he
came to Palm Beach with his stepfather, Aristotle Onassis. The
family came aboard Onassis' yacht, Christina. Onassis purchased the
youngster a small powerboat so he could shuttle between the yacht
and the dock at the Sailfish Club.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the acquaintance was renewed at Donald Trump's
Mar-a-Lago Club, where John, promising young editor of George, was
the man of the moment at a reception for editors of Hachette
Filipacchi publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told he would be there, but not to make a big deal of
it,'' Davidoff said. ``But I caught his eye and he pointed and,
interrupting his conversation, said, `I remember.' Then he walked
over and we talked. He asked if I had sold any pictures to the
magazine, and I said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   John then introduced Davidoff to his fiance, Carolyn Bessette,
who was reluctant to be photographed among all the other guests.
They moved off to the side and posed for several shots together.
Then they posed with Trump and then wife Marla, with Marla's
mother, with actress Deidre Hall, with David Pecker (then Hachette
boss, now owner of the National Enquirer). With each shot, she
became more relaxed, Davidoff said.

   ``When he finished dinner, he took a little stroll past the pool
and he lit up a cigar,'' Davidoff noted. ``I teased him, asking if
he was smoking a Davidoff (a prestigious brand). He said,
`Naturally. They advertise in my magazine _ I always take care of
my people.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What I noticed most about the evening was that all of the
people there, all very sophisticated, publishers of national
magazines, and especially their wives _ all wanted me to take
pictures of them with him. It was like being at a party with Cary
Grant. He was definitely the star.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidoff had hoped to see John again this fall. The
International Museum in Sarasota will open an exhibit of 26 photos
of JFK by Davidoff. Kennedy family members have been invited to the
opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really never had an opportunity to get out there and show
what he could do,'' Davidoff said. ``With the magazine, it was
struggling but he pulled it up. He could have easily entered
politics and won a seat in Massachusetts, but he really wasn't
ready for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years more and I he would have made his mark.''

   ARLINGTON, Va. _ The steady stream of visitors across the
decades to the graves of President John F. Kennedy and his brother,
Robert, sadly quickened Sunday as the nation kept vigil for John F.
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they found his body yet?'' Xavjeir Goodfaith, a
15-year-old student, asked as he moved on from the eternal flame
marking the grave of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to carry on the Kennedy legacy; it can't just
disappear,'' the student said with considerable insistence, pausing
at Robert F. Kennedy's memorial stone, which bears a quotation from
Aeschylus, ``In our sleep, pain that can not forget falls drop by
drop upon the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors poured up the hill to the Kennedy graves here at
Arlington National Cemetery, the sweltering summer heat compounding
the day's dirgeful tinge as they left flowers and notes for the
missing Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world stands motionless and hearts are heavy with
sadness,'' declared one note lying near a photograph of John Jr. as
a small boy more than 35 years ago saluting his father on the day
he was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling my son the history of the Kennedys,'' said
Bob Sedlock, visiting from Pittsburgh with his son, David, 8. ``I
was my boy's age when President Kennedy was shot, and I remember it
all just like it was yesterday. It's tough being a Kennedy, to
begin with, but John Jr. did a lot on his own. He didn't sit on the
Kennedy name.''
</P>
<P>
   Small children posed with smiles for their parents' video
cameras as the visitor flow continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time, there's a kind of flashback,'' Ed Bonilla, an Army
sergeant, said of the way each new Kennedy tragedy recharges the
nation's sad memories of them. ``This is a person who has been
loved by the country since he was born,'' said the sergeant, who
was on leave from Korea and decided to come to the cemetery after
he heard the news of John Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, people's reactions were less focused than
those of the graveside visitors here. Many Americans remarked more
on the persistence of tragedy in the life of the Kennedys than on
John Jr. himself. Some questioned whether Kennedy was reckless in
flying his plane at dusk with such little experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kennedys live that dangerous life style,'' Steve Hout, a
customer outside the Highlander bar in Atlanta said. Across the
way, John Stewar, sat under a shade tree and when asked his
reaction, complained, ``The only thing I thought was, `God, I have
to watch this on TV for a week.' It's just the latest topic for the
lack of something better to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were hardly so uninvolved.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Barnes from Bristol, England, was visiting New York City.
The devout daughter of an Anglican priest, she decided to go to the
Roman Catholic Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. ``We wanted to be
here with their people,'' she said of the Kennedys. ``We certainly
did pray for them.''

BANNED BOOK GIVES DIFFERENT VIEW OF TURKISH WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A taboo fell in Turkey earlier this year when
a book appeared containing interviews with 42 army veterans, many
of them disillusioned by their role in fighting Kurdish insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which sold about 10,000 copies, gave readers a view of
the Kurdish war quite different from the official version. But
although many reviewers praised it, prosecutors declared the book
insulting to the military, issued an order banning it and seized
unsold copies.
</P>
<P>
   What many of the veterans had to say was explosive. Some said
that their commanders turned a blind eye to war profiteers and drug
smugglers. Others asserted that they saw soldiers mistreat Kurdish
civilians. Several said they went to war poorly trained and
believing the official line that their enemies were mindless
terrorists, but slowly concluded that the insurgents were actually
fighting for their rights and enjoyed wide popular support.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on this book was one of several steps the government has
taken recently to maintain its limits on what is written about the
Kurdish conflict. The arrest and conviction of the main Kurdish
rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, has not eased the government's
pursuit of such cases. It may even have convinced the authorities
that if they act vigorously now, they can wipe out Kurdish
nationalism once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Those who publish dissenting views of the war being waged in
southeast Turkey are often charged with abetting terrorism, a
charge for which scores of Turkish writers and politicians have
been imprisoned during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates often criticize laws that restrict
freedom of speech in Turkey. These laws have also been cited as one
reason for Turkey's failure to be named as a candidate for
membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfaction with the laws may be growing inside Turkey,
though. Several months ago Parliament moved to repeal one of them,
but dropped the idea after military commanders warned that a repeal
would hinder their efforts to fight terrorism and religious
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   The paperback at the center of the newest case is called
``Mehmet's Book,'' a reference to the nickname by which army
recruits are popularly known. In the country's repressive
atmosphere, the book's publication was the first time that the
views of ordinary war veterans had been presented to the public and
it undercut the fighters' official image as committed defenders of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did I do?'' said Nadire Mater, the journalist and human
rights advocate who conducted and transcribed the interviews. ``I
didn't even write this book. I just put a microphone in front of
these young men and let them talk.'' Although no case has yet been
filed against her for publishing these interviews, she expects one
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people don't like the army and wish it would go away,''
says one veteran who, like everyone else in the book, is identified
only by a first name. ``With their eyes they say, `Get out of my
sight or die.'''
</P>
<P>
   One veteran tells of soldiers who slice the ears off corpses to
prove their kills. Another says that his commander cut off water
supplies to a village for three months after a farmer complained
that a soldier had shot his dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we're fighting for,'' said one veteran.
``Who are we pointing our guns at? Those people have a reason to go
to the mountains. But me _ why was I in the army?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Mehmet's Book'' shows that at least some veterans of the
Kurdish war suffer symptoms of emotional stress that have also been
reported by Americans who fought in Vietnam and Russians who fought
in Afghanistan. ``Since I've been back,'' says one, ``every time I
get angry I think about shooting someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mater said: ``In the 15 years we have been living with this
conflict, everyone has had a chance to speak out except the young
men who are doing the fighting. Now they are telling their stories.
For letting them do it, I'm accused of insulting the military. It
makes me very angry. I love this country, but sometimes it is very
difficult to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   She has learned that Turkish journalists are not immune from
prosecution even if the words in their books belong to others.
Recently, a prominent columnist, Oral Calislar, was sentenced to 13
months in prison for publishing an interview with Ocalan, the
Kurdish leader, in 1993, even though Ocalan is now in a Turkish
prison under sentence of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to criticize the state in sensitive areas,
especially when it has to do with the Kurds,'' Calislar said.
``Every week, 15 dead soldiers are coming back to western Turkey.
In this situation, if you criticize the state you are considered a
traitor. They have plenty of laws to put you in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court recently upheld Calislar's sentence for
``publishing written propaganda aimed at undermining Turkey's
unity.'' The ruling led many of his colleagues to publish angry
columns in protest. One said: ``Does someone who interviews a
prostitute also become a prostitute?''
</P>
<P>
   Calislar was among the intellectuals and politicians jailed
after the 1980 military coup, and one of his fellow inmates, Bulent
Ecevit, is now prime minister. After the recent court ruling,
Ecevit described him as ``a journalist I have held in high esteem''
and said he was ``deeply saddened'' by the prospect that his old
friend might be returning to prison.
</P>
<P>
   A third journalist who has recently felt the weight of Turkish
law is Andrew Finkel, a British citizen who has lived in Istanbul
for more than a decade and reports for The Times of London, CNN and
Time magazine. Foreign correspondents here are not subject to
prosecution for articles they publish abroad, but until recently
Finkel also wrote columns for a Turkish newspaper. One of them has
led prosecutors to file a case against him.
</P>
<P>
   In a column published last year, Finkel wrote about his visit to
the embattled Kurdish town of Sirnak. He said progress had been
made over the years there, and that the army is now ``a long way
from behaving like an army of occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of that phrase, even in what seemed to be a positive
way, led prosecutors to charge Finkel with ``insulting state
institutions.'' If convicted, he could face up to six years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passages which were deemed to be insulting had been taken
out of context,'' Finkel said after his hearing in June. ``In
context they mean the diametric opposite of that suggested by the
indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first news story I ever wrote from Turkey was in 1986, a
piece for the Guardian newspaper in which I covered the appearance
of Bulent Ecevit in court,'' Finkel said. ``He was being charged
for having written an article in which, as a banned politician, he
supported a political party. The year is 1999. He is now prime
minister. I am now in court.''

VISITORS TO GRAVE OF FORMER PRESIDENT KENNEDY WORRY ABOUT FATE OF
HIS SON
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   By DAVID IVANOVICH
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ Mourners gathered at the grave of former
President John F. Kennedy in Arlington National Cemetery Sunday to
express their grief at the apparent loss of yet another Kennedy
son.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors laid flower bouquets, wooden crosses and sympathy notes
on the hillside grave of the murdered president, as they awaited
word of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and sister-in-law
Lauren Bessette. The three have been missing since late Friday when
their airplane disappeared off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless JFK Jr. and the Kennedy Family,'' read one note.
</P>
<P>
   Terry and Jim Somers, together with their daughter Hillary, were
visiting Washington from their home in Dublin, Ireland, when they
heard the news about the downing of John Jr.'s aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The Somers had already visited Arlington had planned to do a bit
of shopping Sunday. But they braved the sweltering July heat to
make another visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very upset at the news and decided to come and say a
prayer at the grave,'' Terry Somers said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland, Jim Somers said, John F. Kennedy is still known as
``President Kennedy.'' Many Irish saw John Jr. as the obvious heir
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most Irish people think that America would be very
lucky to get John Jr. as president,'' Jim Somers said.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters Eileen and Kathleen Daley grew up in a home on Long
Island in which a huge portrait of John F. Kennedy hung in the
living room. They were taking their nephews Sunday to visit the
nearby Iwo Jima memorial, but after hearing the news about John Jr.
decided they had to stop by the Kennedy grave site as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen, who lives in Manhattan, would sometimes spot John Jr.
walking his dog. ``He seemed like a real nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As wave after wave of visitors _ a mixture of grieving mourners,
summer tourists and scribbling journalists _ made their way to the
Kennedy grave site, it became readily apparent that American's
memories of John Jr. split largely along generational lines.
</P>
<P>
   Younger Americans think of a modern, cultural icon, riding
in-line skates through Manhattan or gracing the cover of People
magazine. ``He was gorgeous,'' said 22-year-old Lorrie Phillips of
Jasper, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Those old enough to remember the 1963 assassination and funeral
of President Kennedy recall John-John, a 3-year-old boy saluting a
father he would barely remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation saw him grow up,'' said Lee Grimes, who was
visiting Arlington with her grandchildren from their homes in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Dov Schwartz, a spokesman for the U.S. Army Military District of
Washington which operates Arlington cemetery, said he had noticed a
marked difference this weekend in the reactions of younger people
visiting the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That concern and anguish in the faces of younger people is
something you don't always see,'' Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dimming prospects Sunday, many visitors to the
Kennedy grave site refused to give up hope that somehow John Jr.,
and the Bessette sisters had somewhat survived the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're's always a little spark of hope with everybody
praying,'' said Blaine Tibbs of Warren, Ohio. ``It just might be.
I'm not counting him out until they find him.''

MOBSTER SAMMY THE BULL REVEALS LIFE IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
 PHOENIX-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 Copyright  1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _Salvatore Gravano, Mafia hit man and Phoenix-area
resident, eyed his visitor with a steely glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you're going to write about Sammy the Bull living here?''
he said in a semi-raspy voice. ``Do you know how many people will
get killed if you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed odd coming from someone responsible for 19 murders,
but the question had merit.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, the turncoat underboss who put John Gotti and 36 other
New York mobsters in prison, had managed to stay underground for
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   He was hiding in sunny Arizona from assassins, from Illinois
cops who offered a reward for sightings, from families of victims
who filed a lawsuit, from the media.
</P>
<P>
   He came for the same reason most everyone else does: to get a
new start.
</P>
<P>
   Most neighbors didn't know the middle-age guy next door was
notorious for robberies, loan-sharking, extortion and homicide.
Employees had no idea their boss once operated a corrupt New York
construction business, rigging bids and running unions.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gravano wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   But, over time, his secret life and identity slowly unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   It happened, in part, because Gravano is sometimes indiscreet.
He has a business, a publicist, a lawyer. U.S. marshals and FBI
agents watch over him.
</P>
<P>
   He tells some people his real name.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knew his identity would be exposed someday.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a modest bungalow, the sort of place a 20-something
bachelor would call home.
</P>
<P>
   There are no family photographs visible, nothing intimate or
interesting other than a life-size dummy used for a punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   A little dog growls and sniffs at strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wears a black muscle shirt, gray sweat pants and dark
shades in a low-light living room.
</P>
<P>
   After small talk, he wonders aloud why his story is worth
telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be so interesting about me? Running a legitimate
business. Being monitored by the government . . . I think it's
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he says, if word gets out, the New York media will
swarm into Arizona, ferreting out every detail of his new life. And
the Mafia might feel compelled to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mob, anytime anybody flips, there's an open contract on
him,'' Gravano says.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he downplays the danger.
</P>
<P>
   There's no real worry about getting whacked, Gravano says,
because he's become pals with FBI agents and U.S. marshals. They
drop by on vacations to Arizona. He talks to their wives by phone.
Besides, the Mafia has been so thoroughly infiltrated that the feds
would know who ordered a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mob is smart enough that when they do something, they
wanna get away with it,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, a stocky, muscular man who seems younger than his 54
years, oozes bravado. He says he doesn't look under his car or over
his shoulder, doesn't understand fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up in a lifestyle,'' he says. ``There's 30,000 cops
in New York. Every time you go out, you don't know if you're coming
back. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a boxer. I know what it's like to get hit. I know what
it is to fight. And you lose your fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go to Montana and live 20 years in a cabin and be
scared to death. Or I can live here, where I'm happy, five years. I
choose to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano pauses, smiles. ``When it happens, it happens. If they
start shooting, then I'll be a little scared.'' &QL; 
A NEW IDENTITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull arrived here as an inmate in the Federal
Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Upon release, he was given a new identity and background. He
rented an apartment, returned to the construction business, settled
in.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy with the haunting threat of a bullet in the head, life
was tolerable. Until two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The secret died at his construction office amid junkyards and
vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull stormed into the foyer, and with a clenched jaw
confronted an unexpected visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want?'' he demanded. Then, turning heel, he
grunted, ``Follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a back room, Gravano used indelicate terms to vent his
anger about being found out.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't worried about himself, but family members and
employees. Innocent people would suffer. Jobs would be lost,
reputations ruined.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's created a new life in the Phoenix area, and wasn't
going to start over, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia,'' he added. ``I'm
not running from the (expletive) media.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he might tell his story, under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knows about cutting deals. He traded testimony against
La Cosa Nostra for a shortened prison sentence. In 1995, he
completed the five-year term, entered a Witness Protection Program
and got some facial work.
</P>
<P>
   Then he blew the cover by appearing on TV to promote a book:
``Underboss, Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia.''
Coincidentally, a movie version of the story is being rebroadcast
tonight on NBC (Channel 12, KPNX).
</P>
<P>
   With celebrity came infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Gravano's murder victims have sued him for $25
million. The New York attorney general is pursuing book and film
profits. The John Gotti Tribute Page, an Internet site, warned that
Gravano ``may be living next door to you with the government's
blessing.'' And the Combined Counties Police Association of
Illinois posted a $500 reward for sightings of Sammy the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Association President John Flood said it's despicable that an
admitted murderer was unleashed on society after spending fewer
than five years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sammy left the world tomorrow, we could all sit down and
say, `Thank God,' '' Flood added. ``It would be no loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward money went uncollected. Gravano had vanished into
Arizona, the anonymous retirement mecca that attracted a number of
mob bosses over the years, including Joe Bonanno. &QL; 
BEST-KEPT SECRET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wasn't the only one who didn't want his secret out.
</P>
<P>
   Athia Hardt, a public relations woman who represents him, said
the FBI was concerned about his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt, who once worked for Arizona Govs. Bruce Babbitt and Rose
Mofford, also provided a reference: Supervising FBI Agent George
Gabriel, who handled Gravano during Gotti's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call from New York, Gabriel said blowing Gravano's
cover would have one outcome: ``He's a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardt said her client would talk if the newspaper agreed not to
reveal his new name or company, and if it would withhold
information on family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' agreed, on the condition that the deal
would be void if the newspaper found that Gravano or his company
had engaged in corrupt activity in Arizona. &QL; 
NO FEAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the 2{-hour interview in Gravano's apartment, Hardt sips
red wine. Attorney Thayne Lowe lies on the floor to ease the pain
of a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull lights a cigarette and worries aloud about family
members. He says they are the main reason he sought refuge here,
along with the weather and relatively mob-free environment.
</P>
<P>
   Though he hasn't been threatened here, Gravano figures the Mafia
knows his whereabouts. FBI agents agree, saying he is too casual
about his cover.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano quit the Witness Protection Program nine months after
getting out of prison. (``Too many restrictions. You couldn't have
contact with your family or anybody.'')
</P>
<P>
   And though he had plastic surgery, the face didn't change much.
(``I asked the doctor if I could look like Robert Redford, do it.
But he said, `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano settled for repairs to his boxer's nose and some minor
liposuction. The result: Strangers still recognize him on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come right over to me,'' Gravano says, proudly. ``Some
shake my hand and congratulate me for what I did. Some want an
autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that more than 300 Phoenix area residents know his
real identity. Sometimes, he even tells people.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says he recently ruined a business deal by coming clean
with a prospective partner. He shrugs, adding, ``We thought it was
ethical and right to let them know.'' &QL; 
A MORAL MAFIOSO? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ethical mobster.
</P>
<P>
   That theme is the fabric of Sammy the Bull's tale.
</P>
<P>
   He talks indignantly about the treachery of others. When told it
seems curious for a man who murdered 18 or 19 people to complain of
deceit, he interrupts to clarify the precise number _ ``It was 19''
_ then tells a story.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano and Gotti were trying to decide what to do about a Mafia
associate who was snitching to the cops. Gotti wanted to enlist a
homosexual who could destroy the traitor's credibility by accusing
him of being gay. Gravano was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `No, John, we don't do that. We're family. He's
one of us. We should just go kill him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano views his homicidal history in a cultural context, like
the moral relativism of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a guy (on TV) who dropped a bomb on Hiroshima,'' he
says. ``Killed 100,000 people in one day. What's that about?''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, in the 2{-hour interview, Gravano boasts that
each of his murders was coldblooded. It may seem repugnant to
mainstream American values, but he adhered to the oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never killed anybody in a fit of rage,'' Gravano says.
``Everybody I killed was planned. I'm a hit man, not a serial
killer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these things, I didn't want to do. I felt I did the
right thing in La Cosa Nostra. I was loyal to the life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was even a good person within the mob. I was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says the killing is behind him. As an ex-Mafioso, a
friend of the law, his code has changed.
</P>
<P>
   That transition came when Gravano realized that Gotti was
setting him up as a fall guy. Gravano insists that it was Gotti,
not him, who violated the brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never betrayed anybody in my life first,'' he adds. ``But if
I'm betrayed, I become a good betrayer. Go ask John.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says dozens of others took plea deals and testified,
helping to put 37 criminals behind bars. He seems puzzled about
getting all the credit, or blame.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sammy the Bull flashes a winking grin and says, ``I was the
smartest, best-looking, most charismatic of the underbosses who
flipped.'' &QL; 
MAN OF PARADOXES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gravano is an avid chess player.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys talking to young people, helping them with their
problems. He goes fishing and takes in a ballgame occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he works, rising at 5 a.m. and putting in 12-hour
days. Gravano says he's always been a workaholic with ideas racing
through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the wheeling and dealing, the business, the
whirlwind,'' he adds. ``I think up deals every other minute.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gravano is a contradictory goodfellow.
</P>
<P>
   Once a garrulous gangster, he lives alone with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   He traded Mafia cronies for law enforcement chums.
</P>
<P>
   He says the FBI doesn't need his help anymore. Then, moments
later, he declares, ``I have everything to offer the government.
They'd be totally retarded not to deal with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims not to care what people think of him, yet helped write
a book to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says life in the Mafia was always stressful. Prison was
intolerable, but it mellowed him. Now, he is content in a stuffy
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bunked in. See the brick on the walls? It's like a cell.
I'm comfortable again.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor knocks on the back door and delivers a cup of
Starbucks coffee. He smiles and talks of friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think good people, if they see you're really not a threat,
they'll protect you,'' Sammy the Bull adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy right now. I'm a boss. Of my family. Of my
friends. Of my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims he was offered an acting slot on ``The Sopranos,''an
HBO show that satirizes the New York mob. The script called for
Sammy the Bull to appear in several broadcasts as a hit man, then
get killed off. He turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   As for La Cosa Nostra, he says the government has delivered a
nearly mortal blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wrecked the mob all over the country. I don't think
they're anywhere near finished. They're letting up too early. But
they really hurt the mob.'' &QL; 
Sammy to the core
</P>
<P>
   Through all the changes, Gotti claims he's held true to
relationships and integrity. That's why he turned on Gotti, and why
he respects the FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were straight up people,'' Gravano says. ``I never caught
them in a lie, and I'm really good at that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Have my values changed? No. You can't change what you are
inside. A leopard doesn't change his spots.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site dedicated to Gotti uses a different mammalian
metaphor for Gravano: ``rat bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes a psychological evaluation that says Sammy the Bull
suffers from a ``severe character pathology: The likelihood of
violent behavior is substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano shrugs off the criticism, living day to day.
</P>
<P>
   He moves every eight or nine months.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for people to trust. Of all the hardships, he says
giving up his name was among the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I lost my identity for a while, but I found it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who is he today? Mobster, government informer, ex-con or
businessman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Sammy,'' he says with a wily smile. ``Sammy to the
core.'' &QL;

CAPRIATI, ON UPSWING, WINS A&AMP;P TENNIS CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAHWAH, N.J. _ Jennifer Capriati is on a roll. It is nothing
dramatic, perhaps, but given her tennis and personal histories,
things are looking up for the one-time prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   The week before the French Open in May, she won a tournament in
Strasbourg, France, her first WTA Tour title in six years. Sunday,
with a sound serve and a deep, punishing forehand, she won the A&AMP;P
Tennis Classic, an exhibition tournament she said helped her
prepare for next month's U.S. Open and other hardcourt tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In the final at the Crossroads Corporate Center, Capriati
overcame Chanda Rubin, 6-1, 3-6, 6-2, in 1 hour 34 minutes. As
Rubin put it, ``She hit hard, and once she gets on top of you in a
point, it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati is from Saddlebrook, Fla., Rubin from Lafayette, La.
Both are 23. Rubin is ranked 23rd in the world, Capriati 43rd, but
the outcome was not surprising because Capriati was on the upswing
and Rubin had been having trouble with her serve (nine double
faults Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   Capriati also won this title in 1991 and 1993 and Rubin won in
1995 and 1997. They played before a crowd of 6,300 on a court where
the temperature reached 105 degrees and the heat index 115.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Capriati became a tour sensation. Later, legal and
physical problems hurt her career, but improvement has come since
Harold Solomon, a former top-10 player, became her coach in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real good with my game,'' Capriati said after the
final, ``maybe 70 to 80 percent of where I want to be. I'm playing
better than I have. I'm in better physical shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I still have a way to go. I feel I can only go up and
get better. I went through a long-enough period when I did not play
well. I'm slowly getting it back at my own pace. I don't know if
I'm capable of winning a Grand Slam tournament yet. Right now, I'm
not putting much pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati said she did not look back at her roller-coaster life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look forward,'' she said. ``If I think about the past,
I think how it would help now. It's been up and down. I think that
comes with the territory, just being who I am. Everything I do is
known. If your life was taped, you'd be on a roller coaster, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this is an exhibition tournament, the players received
appearance money plus small bonuses for winning matches, but no
prize money and no points toward rankings. The format has allowed
John Korff, the tournament's owner and director, to choose the
players he and the crowds like.
</P>
<P>
   They are well rewarded, with appearance fees that Korff said
reached almost $200,000 for Steffi Graf, the world's third-ranked
player. Graf defaulted Thursday night in the third set of her
quarterfinal match against Capriati because of an upset stomach.
For their week here, Capriati earned about $45,000, Rubin about
$35,000.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong festivities were as much a happening as a sports
event. There was a concert with the rock group Chicago and another
with the Beach Boys and the Village People. There was a chili
cookoff and a hockey clinic.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the biggest happening began when they entered the
grounds and received an empty plastic bag. Then they started
walking through the rows of booths where tournament sponsors filled
the bags with shampoo, toothpaste, aspirin, suntan lotion, plastic
water bottles, high-energy bars and more.
</P>
<P>
   Many booths offered free drinks and nibbles _ apples, bananas,
peaches, fruit juice, coffee, iced cappuccino, iced tea, filtered
water, fruit salad, ice cream and cookies. For those who were
important or knew someone who was, there were corporate hospitality
tents offering endless food and drink. There was also tennis.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded DOROTHY BUNDY CHENEY of La Jolla, Calif., beat
Patricia Stuhler of Point Pleasant, N.J., 6-4, 6-0, in the final of
the U.S. National Women's 80s Invitational. Cheney is 82, Stuhler
80. The national title was Cheney's second in two days (she won the
doubles Saturday) and the 303rd of her career. Both players had
their sleep interrupted at 1 a.m. Sunday by a fire alarm at their
hotel (it turned out to be a false alarm). ``I walked down 15
flights,'' Cheney said. ``I was afraid my knees wouldn't make it.''
Stuhler said she lost that contest, too. ``I had to walk 16
flights,'' she said.

 &HT;    New Yorkers want their neighbor to come home
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John F. Kennedy Jr. is a New Yorker, and his fellow
residents want him home. One way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   They began gathering outside his Lower East Side home Saturday
night. Some stayed through the night. By noon Sunday, the crowd
held steady at 60 or 70. A bank of TV news cameras recorded the
comings and goings of people of all ages, but most young, late 20s,
early 30s, and most women.
</P>
<P>
   It was a United Nations of nationalities, but New Yorkers all.
They came to this city, said many, for the anonymity and
opportunity it affords its residents, even the famous.
</P>
<P>
   They came to 20 North Moore St. to light scented candles and
place flowers and notes and prayers on the stoop of one of their
own. The street was hot, the air heavy, sweetened by the lillies
and roses that began spilling down the steps and onto the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor of Kennedy's named Pete stood across the street in
the shadows of his own doorway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad the people are coming here,'' he said. ``It's a nice
thing, to come here and leave a flower, not an intrusion. This
isn't a Princess Di thing. Some say he's American royalty. Maybe he
is. But to us, he's a neighbor. Just a nice guy who's living his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete points to a TV crew videotaping an interview with a young
man who had just left Bubby's, a bistro down on the corner, where
eggs and toast cost $11 and Kennedy was known to grab a sandwich
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy with his face in the microphone? He's saying he knows
Kennedy. He doesn't. None of us know Kennedy. And those who do
aren't going to step up to a microphone today. You can live here
and not get hassled, no matter who you are. That's New York. Bob
DeNiro and Harvey Keitel live on the street. Nobody bothers them.
Kennedy is a Kennedy, sure. But he peeled himself away from all
those politician Kennedys. He became what he wanted, became who he
wanted. Here. In New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The flowers mound up across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the younger women say they are here not because John
Kennedy Jr. is the son of a president, son of an international
beauty, but because he is John Kennedy Jr. For these women, Kennedy
is his own legend. The past is not part of their perception.
</P>
<P>
   Some don't know the stories of his Aunt Kathleen Kennedy's 1948
death in an airplane crash. Or Uncle Joe Jr.'s death in a bomber
over the North Sea during World War II. The full scope of the
terrible ironies that run through Kennedy family history is lost on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Their Kennedy is not the heir, not the symbol of Camelot, not
one of the famous cousins, or nephew of Bobby and Ted. He's just a
nice guy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Pete the neighbor speaks for many of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped into Kennedy last week right there across the street.
He had his cast on. We said hello. One day he's going about his
life, the magazine, a walk in Central Park, a stroll to Bubby's.
Simple things. Life. And then, he's not here. You look up at his
apartment, and you think, there's probably a couple of dirty
sneakers near the door, some unopened mail, glasses near the sink.
It's sad. He should be here, not somewhere off Martha's Vineyard.
Right here, walking down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   On the clearest of nights, when conditions are just so, the
light of New York City is visible from the cliffs at Gay Head on
Martha's Vineyard. Gotham glows gold, low and seemingly beyond the
horizon to the far southwest; it burns and pulses with the energy
and life force of 5 million people and a billion white lights.
</P>
<P>
   But fog can lift from the cold ocean in a few minutes, or summer
haze can drop over the island like a heavy blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Garrabrant, a Nantucket resident and pilot who has flown the
islands and Cape Cod for 22 years, says flying on such a night is
like flying in an ink bottle.
</P>
<P>
   On such a night, in the space of a moment, New York's luminous
beacon evaporates into a blackness so thick even the shaft of
illumination from the Gay Head lighthouse _ a trusted guide for
mariners and aviators _ stabs with futility into nothingness. Its
beam dissipates and, finally, disappears, devoured by the night.
There is no horizon, no reference point.
</P>
<P>
   Turn your back to the Gay Head cliffs and look out upon the
moors and meadows of Gay Head, and you're looking right at the
window lights in the home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the home
John Jr. and his sister, Caroline, inherited when their mother died
_ the family summer haven; respite from the sweaty streets of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But when the haze descends, all the lights go out.
</P>
<P>
   Wreckage from Kennedy's plane washed up, almost literally, in
his mother's backyard on Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   Another New Yorker ponders that irony.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Belliveau knows Kennedy from the New York Athletic Club,
where they both work out. Belliveau and two friends were drinking
beer and cursing the Kennedy family curse Saturday night in a
little Upper West Side pub popular with investment bankers, doctors
and writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess either way, New York or Martha's Vineyard, he's home.
I just wish he was home here. New York is his city.

   CREEK (Seattle) _ Cane wielding, baseball cap wearing Nancy
Malmgren is a 70-year-old powerhouse leading the fight to save
urban creeks. For years she's worked tirelessly to restore the
natural habitat of northwest Seattle's Pipers Creek, restocking it
with salmon and organizing volunteers to replant vegetation along
the water's edge.

   TV-FALL (PASADENA, Calif.) _ Having Patrick Stewart play Scrooge
in a new film version of ``A Christmas Carol'' was a no-brainer.
Though better known to videophiles as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on
``Star Trek: The Next Generation,'' Stewart has spent much of the
last decade performing a one-man version of the Dickens classic on
stage. Stewart's next Scrooge will be in Robert Halmi Sr.'s latest
classic for the masses, airing Dec. 5 on TNT. Preview of the new
fall shows at the TV critics' press tour in Pasadena.

billion articles of clothing and gave the Salvation Army alone
several hundred million pieces, well over 100,000 tons. The glut is

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Renting a car in New York City can be pretty expensive,
especially if it's full size on a summer weekend. Imagine my
delight when Jenny at National Car Rental quoted me a price of only
$38 a day for a trip to Cape May, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, I called National on another matter and
mentioned the great price I had been quoted. After checking my
reservation in the computer, the agent told me, ``Sir, if you want
to pick up this car, you'll have to go to Manhattan, Kan., because
that's where the reservation was made.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Jenny seemed perplexed when I said I would have
the car back in just three days. But there was good news.
Embarrassed by the mistake, the agent told me that National would
still honor the $38 rate for a rental in ``my'' Manhattan. ``Jenny
is new,'' he explained. ``She'll need some extra training.'' And
maybe a map.

   Judith Grace, on a plane recently, was regaled by her Canadian
seatmate with the tale of what had happened to her on her recent
visit to New York.
</P>
<P>
   To answer her hail, the taxi cut across several lanes of traffic
on Broadway, and in doing so sideswiped a red Volkswagen standing
at the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers got out. The very large Volkswagen owner grabbed
the diminutive cabdriver by the shirt and hoisted him up to eye
level, letting his feet dangle. The giant repeatedly poked the
munchkin in the middle of his forehead with a finger and said,
``This is your lucky day.'' Finally, he released the little man and
said, ``Don't you want to know why this is your lucky day?''
</P>
<P>
   Without waiting for a reply, he supplied the answer: ``Because
I'm on the way to my court-appointed anger therapy group and I
don't want to go with blood on my shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   Late one night recently, I was waiting for the M4 bus on Madison
Avenue. After 15 minutes or so, I saw three buses coming. The M2
and M3 stopped but the M4, not having seen me, went whizzing by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darn,'' I said. ``Now I'll have to wait forever for another
one. And even if I run, I can't catch up to that one.''
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the M2 heard me through his open door and said:
``Get on. I'll catch him at 96th Street.'' He drove to 96th Street
and stopped his bus at an angle, effectively blocking the M4, which
was waiting at a light. I got off his bus and onto the M4. There
are nice bus drivers!

   Karolyn K. Wrightson was walking down the street at the end of
the school year last month when a school bus stopped to let off a
boy of about 9. He was laden with the contents of his locker and,
she noted, a large green costume covered with paper leaves and
vines.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must have been the Jolly Green Giant in a class play,''
she said jovially.
</P>
<P>
   The boy looked indignant. ``Have you ever heard of William
Shakespeare?'' he challenged, apparently without much hope of a
positive answer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wrightson hurried to correct her faux pas. ``Puck!'' she
exclaimed. ``You must have been Puck!''
</P>
<P>
   The boy beamed. The character he had played wasn't completely
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Courtyard cafe at the Morgan Library.
</P>
<P>
   Participants: Two elderly women _ one of whom looks academic,
the other stylish suburban _ discussing the problems of living
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Observer: Mary Ann Sternberg.
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``So what happens if you have an emergency?''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``I have the button you wear around your neck.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``Are you good about wearing it?''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``I never wear it.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``Do you keep it next to your bed?''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``Sometimes I remember to do that. But not much.
(Brightening) ``But my son did insist that I buy a _ you know, what
do you call it _ phone you use in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman: ``A cellular phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Second woman: ``Right, I keep it in the car. But I don't know
how to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   First woman (with no irony): ``Isn't it remarkable all the
modern inventions we have to keep us safe!''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   My bus ride to work is no longer serene;
</P>
<P>
   Portable cell phones are now on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The bus is now a giant cell phone dial,
</P>
<P>
   And privacy and quiet are no longer in style.
</P>
<P>
   Am I a curmudgeon 'cause I don't care
</P>
<P>
   That your beautician ruined your hair?
</P>
<P>
   Should I regret that your boyfriend has left you?
</P>
<P>
   Did you speak too loudly to him too?
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry your first appointment will have to wait
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd learn to whisper it would be great!
</P>
<P>
   Returning home, I hear `What's for dinner' and `I'm on my way.'
</P>
<P>
   Consideration, dear phoner, it's been a long day.
</P>
<P>
   You need to remember that you are not alone
</P>
<P>
   And your busmates would love it if you'd turn off the phone!

   On a recent Sunday evening, Mark Mehler and a friend were trying
vainly to hail a cab on Central Park South. A couple of hundred
yards away, on Columbus Circle, a line of fire engines was heading
uptown, their sirens piercing the din of traffic. At this point,
Mehler and friend were approached by four young people, two men and
two women, carrying backpacks and wearing concerned expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on?'' one of the women asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get a cab,'' Mehler replied without thinking.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-towners quickly began walking away, shooting puzzled
glances over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter with them?'' Mehler asked his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was asking about the fire engines,'' the friend
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the regular panhandlers near the Seventh Avenue subway
station in Park Slope recently set up a shoeshine business. ``Shine
your shoes? Shine your shoes?'' he called out to passers-by. Sidney
Jones was walking by in sandals. The man didn't miss a beat.
``Clean your toenails?'' he called out.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Golan, recalling his own efforts some decades ago,
thought ``Some things don't change'' as he looked at the two
youngsters who had set up a lemonade stand on the street. But
things do change. One of the boys called out his business name.
``We're lemonade.com,'' he said.

 &HT;    Ending of British Open simply unbelievable
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ You're not going to believe this. But let
me try, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 128th British Open, at Carnoustie, the much-acursed
course out of the rotation since 1975. Which is neither here nor
there or anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, this turns into a French comedy. ``Tin Cup'' with a
Parisian accent. Leading the tournament was a Frenchman, Jean Van
de Velde. This was his third day in the lead. Now, Frenchmen don't
lead the British Open. Frenchman, as a rule, are losers at golf.
Golf in France comes in somewhere behind bicycle racing, rugby,
soccer and Apache dancing. No Frenchman has ever come this close to
leading the British Open since the late, great Arnaud Massy in
1907. Teddie Roosevelt was our president. I don't know who theirs
was.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Jean Van de Velde hits his drive off the 18th tee. It's
wild and to the left, and he hits his second shot off a grandstand
and bounces back into deep rough. Here's where his caddie, who must
be his houseboy, should have handed him his wedge and said, ``Just
hit it back on the fairway, get on the green and you can win with a
double-bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jean Van de Velde tried to go for the green. Instead,
he reached the burn (or stream) that guards the green. Now the
comedy really gets rich.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I've been watching golf since before balls had dimples,
and I've never seen anything like what I was about to see. Van de
Velde sits on the bank, taking off his shoes and socks, going down
into the burn, and he puddles around in the water thinking about
trying to hit the ball and he thinks and he puddles around. He
reconsiders, dresses himself again, takes a drop and hits the ball
into a bunker by the green. He blasts out to five feet. Sink this,
and he gets into a playoff with Justin Leonard and Scottish
favorite, Paul Lawrie, who had been finished for an hour and 10
minutes and sitting around. Van de Velde has blown a three-shot
lead on the last hole when he had the British Open championship in
his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, dashing, well-tailored matinee-idol type has turned
into a comedic figure. Pure slapstick. Instead of finishing like a
French hero, he would have to play four more holes to win a title
he had in his knapsack coming into the finishing hole. Nothing like
this has ever happened in any kind of golf I have ever seen, not on
the Hooters tour, not on the Teardrop tour.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Van de Velde will never be remembered for anything but the
butchery at the 18th hole at Carnoustie. The sight of this nattily
attired Frenchman descending into the water at the burn to see if
he could salvage any honor for France.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tournament in which the course had made more news than
the players and players had made the worst of it. They so
distracted themselves with their howling and yowling that when they
looked up Saturday night, and the Frenchman was leading them, and
an upset the likes of which we had never seen was in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in the end the story worked out as fairy tales do. Paul
Lawrie, the Scot, won the the British Open, and no Scot had won the
British Open since Sandy Lyle in 1985, and he lived in England.
Paul Lawrie is a nice, round-faced man of 30 from Aberdeen, and he
walked into the press building holding claret jug to his breast to
a roaring applause from the appreciative Scottish press. Not Colin
Montgomerie, not Sam Torrance but Paul Lawrie, the least-suspected
Scot of them all. The scores were horrendous, the tournament
probably one of the less exhilarating British Open in decades, and
the outcome was something no self respecting movie producer would
try to foist on a gullible public. Sorrowfully, Jean Van de Velde
shall be forever remembered for the biggest choke job in all the
history of golf, and at least on this side of the water.

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ He was born Pedro Antonio Marin and took the
name Manuel Marulanda after he became a guerrilla half a century
ago. But all over Colombia, people know him simply as ``Tirofijo,''
which translates as ``Sureshot.'' He acquired that intimidating
nickname because of his military prowess, but in recent years his
political aim has proved nearly as unerring.
</P>
<P>
   Written off just a decade ago as in irreversible decline, the
guerrilla movement Marin leads, the left-wing Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, today operates in nearly half of
Colombia. Little more than a week ago, the 15,000-strong army
attacked more than a score of towns and military outposts,
prompting President Andres Pastrana to impose a curfew in 10 of the
country's 32 provinces.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Marin and his rebel group were scheduled to begin
formal peace talks with government negotiators in an effort to end
a conflict that has lasted more than 35 years. He was doing so from
a position of strength: No cease-fire has been declared, the
Colombian armed forces are resentful of concessions Pastrana has
made to get the insurgents to the table, and rebel leaders said
they intended to continue their military campaign even as the talks
took place.
</P>
<P>
   But late Saturday, the negotiations were indefinitely postponed,
the result of a dispute with the government over the role that
international observers were to play. Shortly after the
postponement, five soldiers and a guerrilla were killed when an
army patrol was ambushed in a working-class neighborhood of the
capital here, an action that seemed aimed at bludgeoning Pastrana
into further concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marulanda is a warrior, but it is important to remember that
he took up arms for political reasons,'' said Arturo Alape, a
writer and painter who is the author of ``The Lives of Tirofijo''
and two other biographies of the guerrilla leader written with
Marin's cooperation. ``The FARC practices politics through arms,
but it does have a political project, and that project is based on
Marulanda's conception of life and history.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin was born into a peasant family in a coffee-growing area of
west-central Colombia, in 1930 by his account, in 1928 by most
others. The oldest of five children, he received an elementary
school education before going to work as a woodcutter, butcher,
baker and candy salesman.
</P>
<P>
   His family supported the Liberal Party, and when a Liberal
President was assassinated here and civil war erupted in 1948,
Marin and a group of cousins took to the mountains. Although his
ideological loyalties have changed markedly since then, he has
never ceased being a man on the run.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``Marulanda's is the logic of the pursued,'' said
Alape. ``You flee, but there comes a time when you have to stop,
turn and strike a blow at your pursuer.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his peasant origins, the Colombian elite tends to
ascribe to him the personality traits they associate with poor
people from the countryside. In press accounts and interviews, he
is often described as canny but suspicious of outsiders, unlettered
and somewhat inarticulate but upright in his personal dealings.
</P>
<P>
   That image, with all the implicit class bias that flows from it,
appears to color the Colombian government's dealings with Marin,
even as he outwits generals and politicians alike. ``Tirofijo is a
peasant who still gives value to keeping his word, and I am not
going to do anything that puts mine in doubt,'' Pastrana said last
week, explaining why he was not calling off peace talks despite the
rebel offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Marin is credited with having helped Pastrana, a member of the
Conservative Party, win last year's election by meeting with him
during the campaign, implicitly endorsing prospects for peace.
Preliminary ``talks about talks'' between the two sides began in
January, but Pastrana was humiliated when he showed up at the
opening meeting and Marin failed to appear, sending an underling
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marulanda is a born leader,'' said Alfredo Rangel Suarez,
author of the book ``Colombia: War at the End of the Century'' and
a former national security adviser. ``He is not a theoretician by
any means, but he is very astute and has a great capacity for
command and organization.'' Having ``built an army with his own
hands,'' Marin ``has very clear objectives and fixed ideas,''
Rangel continued. ``His objective is to take power, and his ideas
are Marxism-Leninism of the most basic sort.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alape, who last met with the rebel leader about three months
ago, disagrees. ``His agenda is not a social revolution but only
the sort of social justice that globalization increasingly seems
not to take into account,'' he said. ``He is not asking for the
impossible, nor for a utopia.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rebel group's platform calls for the nationalization
of industry and would all but outlaw foreign investment. The group
has its own Web page, but has traditionally stressed self-reliance
and maintained an ironclad internal discipline, keeping a certain
distance even from Cuba and revolutionary movements in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their penchant for violence and sectarianism, the FARC
is, with the possible exception of Sendero Luminoso in Peru, the
closest thing that this continent has to the Khmer Rouge, with
Tirofijo as Pol Pot,'' said a Latin American diplomat here who has
studied the group. ``If they were ever to come to power, which is
never going to happen, Colombia would surely become the harshest
and most fanatical of revolutionary states.''
</P>
<P>
   There have already been some signs of an extremist bent in the
huge demilitarized zone that the Colombian government handed over
to the rebels in November as a good-faith gesture to jump-start the
peace talks. During the recent offensive, which was launched from
the zone, 11 residents of the rebel enclave were executed and 34
went missing, according to government estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three American environmentalists were captured and
executed by a FARC unit in March on suspicion that they were CIA
agents. The group blamed the killings on a local commander acting
improperly on his own authority, but most observers of the rebels
describe their command structure as ``vertical,'' with all power
flowing directly from Marin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on a personal level, ``Tirofijo is very conservative,'' said
Maria Jimena Duzan, a journalist and author who specializes in
national security issues and has spent time with FARC units. While
other leaders ``had bottles of cognac and other luxuries in their
homes,'' she said, ``Tirofijo lived in a peasant's dwelling, a
totally austere place,'' decorated only by spent cartridges and a
misspelled sign that warned ``no foul language is permitted here.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin, who has not been married as far as any of his biographers
can tell, reportedly has numerous children, including a daughter
who now lives in Paris, by liaisons with various women.
</P>
<P>
   Spending time around Marin in the mid 1980s, when he was in
charge of military affairs and Jacobo Arenas handled political
affairs, ``was like being in a medieval court,'' Ms. Duzan
recalled. ``A soldier would come in, snap to attention and announce
to Tirofijo that `Felipe the Fourth has arrived,' meaning that
Felipe from the fourth front was reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   After Arenas' death from a heart attack in 1990, Marin ascended
to the top spot, with his chief of security, Jorge Briceno Suarez,
becoming his right-hand man. Under their leadership, the military,
political and, thanks to taxes on cocaine and heroin production and
a wave of kidnappings, economic fortunes of the FARC have vastly
improved, and along with that, Marin's legend.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that the vast majority of Colombians dislike the
group and regard it as nothing but a terrorist band interested in
increasing its take from drug trafficking. Alape said Marin was
aware of the FARC's unpopularity, but had not given it very much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big failing that should be of concern to them and
make them change, because otherwise it will be very costly for
them,'' he said. ``With the structure and vision they have, it is
hard for them to open up. They are still acting on the basis of the
logic and arrogance of war.''

PLANNING AHEAD CAN SAVE LIVES IF VIOLENCE ERUPTS AT WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's column about preventing violence in the workplace
prompted a number of readers to call and ask the question: What
happens if, despite best efforts at heading off a violent incident,
someone storms the office with a gun? What do you do then?
</P>
<P>
   The tragic Columbine high school shooting is still a fresh
reminder that violence can and does happen anywhere. So how do we
protect ourselves?
</P>
<P>
   Although such incidents are rare, they are increasing, and
planning ahead can save lives, said Sgt. Larry Chavez, a
Sacramento-based police officer who was in Seattle in the spring to
train police throughout the region at the Western States Hostage
Negotiators Association meeting.
</P>
<P>
   People at work facing a hostage situation can take immediate
steps to defuse the situation and save their own lives while
waiting for police to arrive, said Chavez, who also has a
consulting business advising companies on ways to prevent workplace
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing a person facing a disgruntled or violent person
at work should do is immediately start dealing from that person's
perspective, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake that gets made most often is failing to listen,''
he said.``You have to understand their mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   You may believe, for example, that you've treated someone
fairly, but if they've come back and are pointing a gun at you, you
don't argue your position, you try to understand theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if he's wrong, he is acting on perceptions that are real
to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Respond immediately, don't stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant them dignity and privacy,'' he said. Tell the person he
(or she) has your full attention, and ask them to step into an
office where you can hear what they have to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is listen,'' he said. ``That's the only weapon
you have.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to defusing the situation after that is establishing
trust and respect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Make eye contact as a sign of respect. Speak in a calm voice.
Don't display fear or anger. Let the person vent.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the disgruntled person knows you're paying attention.
Don't doodle nervously, or stare off into space. Ask if you can
take notes to make sure you address all his points.
</P>
<P>
   Ask questions that allow for long answers, which allows the
person to feel he's getting his whole story out.
</P>
<P>
   Be truthful, he said. ``To lose credibility at this stage can be
catastrophic.''
</P>
<P>
   Allow the person to suggest a solution, and assure the person
that you will act on any injustices.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you make a concession, ask him to do likewise,'' he said.
``In the overwhelming number of cases, the person just wants
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't antagonize or belittle the person, minimize his concerns,
or dare him to shoot, he said. ``If he was intent on killing you,
he would have done so already.''
</P>
<P>
   In hostage situations, Chavez usually can gain a hostage-taker's
trust by pointing out that if police had wanted to kill him, they
could have done it already, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By treating the hostage-taker with dignity, and offering him
safety for his cooperation, the situation can often be turned
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never strip anybody of their dignity,'' he said. ``People
stripped of dignity have done some horrible things.''
</P>
<P>
   These techniques sound simple, but they're highly effective, he
said. Nationally, about 85 percent to 90 percent of hostage
situations or potential suicides are solved through negotiation
with no one getting killed.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez also recommended that companies develop a violence
prevention plan in conjunction with their local law enforcement
office before any violence erupts.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan could involve escape or evacuation routes, and
information that police would need to know to respond to an
incident, such as corporate layouts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Columbine situation, for example, having kids hide under
desks made them targets, Chavez said. With better awareness,
violence prevention training and an evacuation plan, more people
might have escaped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another step businesses can take to protect employees is to give
police plans or directions to their buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses are hard to find and, once inside, their offices
and buildings aren't well-marked, making it difficult for officers
to respond effectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, businesses should have clear procedures and
policies for employees to report their concerns about potential
violence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees shoul be able to report, anonymously if necessary,
threats, or concerns about others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing companies can do to protect themselves against
workplace violence is also the most often overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   It's taking threats seriously.

SCANT FACTS FAIL TO DETER TV BLITZ

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television, the medium that was thrust into the modern era of
wall-to-wall breaking news coverage by the 1963 assassination of
President John F. Kennedy, used all the tools it has mastered since
then to chronicle the scant facts and copious emotions about the
disappearance of the single-engine plane John F. Kennedy Jr. was
flying to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour after NBC's aviation correspondent, Bob Hager,
first reported that the airplane was missing at 8:06 a.m. on
Saturday, the three major broadcast networks, along with CNN, Fox
News Channel and MSNBC, scrapped their schedules. For the next 12
hours, aerial cameras panned large expanses of waters dotted with
Coast Guard search-and-rescue craft.
</P>
<P>
   Lending power to the images of empty ocean were alternating
images of Kennedy's life and heritage. As Kennedy said in a 1998
interview with NBC, which was broadcast on Sunday, ``The family
photo album in my head is shared with a lot of people.'' Throughout
the weekend, images from the cameras that had worshipped and
hounded him since his birth were offered to viewers, like visual
eulogies. The ubiquitous picture was the 1963 image that persists
above all others: a little boy, knees bare under a short coat,
saluting as his father's coffin goes by.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the various news outlets said no one there
hesitated about moving to wall-to-wall coverage, or about regarding
the disappearance of the plane carrying Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren G. Bessette, as a major
news event.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sesno, the Washington bureau chief of CNN, said in an
interview that the country's emotional connection to John F.
Kennedy Jr. was the essence of the news value. ``That little boy
grew up to be a responsible, contributing man,'' Sesno said. ``His
journey and fate touch the heart and soul of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The coverage drew its energy from the celebrity of Kennedy:
among those asking questions at a Pentagon press briefing about the
search for the missing aircraft was a reporter for People magazine,
which had featured Kennedy on its cover 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Reeves, a biographer of President Kennedy, said to
Dan Rather on CBS, ``The Kennedys had a lot to do with creating,
with exploiting the new age of celebrity.'' Retrospectives on
Kennedy's life dwelt on his modesty and self-effacing humor,
defining him as much by his low-key approach to life as by his
megawatt name.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go to continuous coverage and to make the
aircraft's disappearance the focus of Sunday morning shows, like
the ABC program ``This Week,'' meant scrapping planned guests, such
as Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is running for the
Republican presidential nomination. When there was programming the
networks wanted to keep, like ABC's broadcast of the British Open,
it was transferred to sister cable outlets, ESPN, for example (both
ABC and ESPN are owned by The Walt Disney Co.). By contrast, during
the proceedings on the impeachment of President Clinton, cable
channels carried the main news while their sister broadcast outlets
kept their regular programming.
</P>
<P>
   Although committed to wall-to-wall coverage, the news divisions
had few new facts. They passed on, with appropriate qualifiers,
unconfirmed reports that proved false, like the report that a
flight instructor had been on board the aircraft. Viewers saw the
realities emerge bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   Without firm answers, the news programs sought out aviation
experts, people with close ties to the Kennedys, and people like
Kyle Bailey, who saw Kennedy and his party board the aircraft in
New Jersey on Friday evening. Prominent among the commentators were
people like the historian Douglas Brinkley, who wrote for George,
the magazine Kennedy started three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts to fill in the blank canvas were marked by a desire
to distinguish the few facts from the rumors. Dan Rather of CBS
repeated his trademark cautions over and over. ``We don't want to
be all rumor all the time,'' he said early on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But, in news conference after news conference, the Pentagon, the
Coast Guard and the Massachusetts State Police added a few facts,
like a grim inventory of recovered debris, including headrests,
carpeting, a bottle of medication bearing Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy's name.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, dominant themes had emerged: the risks of
flying on a hazy night; the difference between using visual flight
rules and using instruments; how easily pilots can get disoriented
flying over water at night. Pictures of the Piper aircraft Kennedy
was flying were shown repeatedly, as were live shots outside the
Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., where the extended family
had gathered to celebrate the wedding of Rory E. Kennedy, the
youngest daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how much journalists like Sesno persisted in using the
present tense, many of their guests lapsed into the past tense when
speaking of Kennedy. In New York, the local NBC affiliate, WNBC,
showed photos of John and Carolyn bordered in black, saying in
symbols what no one would say in words.
</P>
<P>
   While all the commentators made reference to the Bessette
family's loss of two daughters, only the Fox News Channel was
willing to join the Bessette and Kennedy names in the signature
headline, attached to their coverage. While all the others went
with variations of ``JFK Jr.'s Plane is Missing.'' Fox on Sunday
labeled its coverage ``The Kennedy Bessette Tragedy.''

SPORTS COLUMN: PROVING IT'S OK TO SAY `PERFECT'
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The curse is officially over. Or should be. No announcer should
ever fear jinxing a pitcher who is en route to a no-hitter or
perfect game by uttering those words before the deed is done.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the MSG Network's Ken Singleton and Jim Kaat bandied
``perfect game'' and ``no-hitter'' and David Wells suffered no hex.
And Sunday, Channel 5's Tim McCarver and Bobby Murcer trotted out
the terms early, with no ill effects for David Cone.
</P>
<P>
   In his post-game remarks, McCarver made more history by breaking
the taboo against talking about what was hitherto not talked about
in polite but superstitious company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It refutes the adage of anyone who talks about the no-hitter
and perfect game in the fourth inning and it can't come true,'' he
said. ``But it did come true.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, from the bottom of the seventh inning on,
McCarver or Murcer said ``perfect'' nine times, ``no-hitter'' seven
times, counted down the number of batters ``retired in a row'' nine
times, and said ``has not allowed a baserunner'' once.
</P>
<P>
   The production for Cone's perfect game was made even more
special than last year's Wells broadcast by the presence of Don
Larsen, who pitched the first perfect game at Yankee Stadium,
during the 1956 World Series, and was in a luxury box Sunday for
the Yogi Berra Day ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen spent the bottom of the seventh in the Channel 11 booth,
recalling his experience; his comments formed the soundtrack to
Cone's anxious pacing in the Yankee dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Larsen discussed how none of his teammates talked to
him, Chili Davis was seen talking to Cone. ``Looks like only a d.h.
can talk to the pitcher,'' McCarver said.
</P>
<P>
   But Larsen played an even more important function, as one half
of a split screen: Larsen on the left, watching Cone from the
luxury box; Cone on the right, in the dugout. Having Larsen in
person was more than serendipity; it would have been like George
Mogridge, who pitched the first Yankee no-hitter in 1917, watching
Larsen on Oct. 8, 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The Larsen-Cone split screen was first used in the bottom of the
eighth. It showed up at a more dramatic juncture, to start the
Expos' ninth, as McCarver said, ``If you're just joining us, too
bad.'' It was employed for the last time before the Expos' final
batter, Orlando Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen's presence added to the tension produced by the rapid
cutting of close-ups in the game's final minutes. With one out in
the ninth, the sequence of tight shots started with Orlando
Hernandez on the Yankee bench, and moved quickly: to Cone on the
mound, to fans, to Chuck Knoblauch at second base, back to Cone, to
Davis, to Paul O'Neill in right field, to Cone, to Expos
pinch-hitter Ryan McGuire, to Cone, to Tino Martinez at first, to
Cone, to Don Zimmer in the dugout, to Knoblauch, to the pitch by
Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Larsen's face was the last one seen before Cone made
his last pitch to Cabrera, who popped out to end the game. Not
surprisingly, Larsen's face was seen shortly after Cone's teammates
mobbed him. In fact, it looked like Larsen was being congratulated.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be hard for announcers to say the right things in a
perfect game (especially now that the taboos against saying
you-know-what are gone). Murcer and McCarver did not disappoint,
although they could have told us Cone's pitch count more often.
</P>
<P>
   Murcer grasped the immediate significance of Knoblauch's
excellent eighth inning play and his laser beam of a throw, the
latter a rarity recently for the error-prone Yankee second baseman.
And just as the Yankees' eighth inning was growing a smidgen long,
Murcer and McCarver mused about whether Cone would prefer that his
team wrap it up and let him finish his business. Cone answered the
question during a post-game interview with Suzyn Waldman, saying,
``I was never happier to see Chili Davis hit into a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarver put the game in perspective. ``This is fun,'' he said,
with the stadium nearly empty. ``I'm not leaving.''

DUNN IS AN AMBASSADOR DOWN UNDER FOR RODEO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACKAY, Australia _ From a helicopter's view, the dilapidated
dog-racing track on this misty Saturday night resembled a small
island, a dirt, makeshift rodeo arena surrounded by a sea of
Stetson-capped fans.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 fans converged on the bull-riding show in
search of an entertainment diversion more captivating than
Australia's pastimes of lawn bowling, horse racing, and cricket. On
this rare occasion, they opted to bypass a late-night live
Wimbledon telecast to catch a glimpse of a world-champion athlete
closer to home: bull rider Troy Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, who ranches near Mackay and also has a Stephenville
residence, is on a mission to repair rodeo's tarnished image in his
homeland. He viewed the huge turnout at his bull-riding show, twice
the number expected, as a watershed moment for the sport. Just as
songs from Garth Brooks and George Strait helped revive
country/western music, Dunn is aggressively trying to raise rodeo's
profile Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn was among 35 Australian natives competing against eight
high-profile competitors from North America who made a 14-hour
flight to lock their monogrammed spurs in Mackay, a port city in
northeastern Australia bordered by small mountains, sugar-cane
fields and the Coral Sea. The show was co-sanctioned by
Professional Bull Riders, the world's toughest league for rodeo's
headline event.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike North America, which offers more than 700 rodeos
sanctioned by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association and a
29-city tour of marquee competitors sanctioned by the PBR, Aussie
rodeo riders have been pushed farther out than the Great Barrier
Reef.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, rodeo cowboys have been regarded as the black bull
of the family, drifters only a boot step away from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to change the image of the rodeo cowboy with this
bull-riding tour,'' said Dunn, who doubles as the key organizer of
Championship Bull Riders, a younger version of the PBR that has 26
scheduled stops across Australia this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people look down on cowboys, they think we're bums, a
bunch of no-gooders. And it's because cowboys will pull stunts such
as going into a big supermarket with big coats and loading up with
goods when the rodeo's in town. At the rodeos here, there's not
much money up, and the fellows do what they have to to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's wife, Jacqueline, who helps organize the bull-riding
shows in Australia, asserted: ``It's a minority of cowboys who give
the sport a bad image, but it's a substantial number, and it needs
to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Appleton, a resident of Arlington, the only other native of
Australia who wears a world-championship buckle, agrees that Dunn
faces a serious challenge changing the sport's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started competing in Australia and you said to somebody
that you were a rodeo cowboy, I don't know that being 40,000
leagues under the sea was any lower,'' Appleton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy had a successful event in Australia, but one of the
obstacles that he still will have to overcome is that cowboys are
not looked upon as honorable men. But he will do a great job with
changing that perception; he'll raise the bar.'' \Nsubheds:Growing
up tough The three-hour bull-riding show concluded with Dunn, who
was wearing a cast to protect his broken left arm, his free arm,
topping a snorting bull named Sudden Impact and snaring the title
by a point. His victory with a broken forearm was no surprise to
his mother, Marcia, who said she made a startling discovery of her
son's pain tolerance at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Troy was only 9 months old, he broke his arm, but didn't
cry about it,'' she said. ``In fact, we didn't even realize it was
broken until the next day when we noticed that it was flopping
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite competing with broken bones, pulled groins and aching
muscles, Dunn is bull riding's line-slashing, quarterback-pummeling
middle linebacker. Last year, he clinched the PBR's Bud Light Cup
Series title and pocketed $221,792 for enduring eight-second
showdowns against All-Star, 2,000-pound bulls that can, without
breaking a sweat, shatter a trio of Olympic weight-lifting
medalists as if they were bowling pins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mate, we're not playing pingpong here,'' Dunn said. ``In this
sport, you learn to deal with pain. When you get on the rankest
bulls in the world, you learn to ride hurt every weekend. The bulls
are so relentless these days that if you stub your toe, you'll get
your brains knocked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline, Dunn's mate of four years, said, ``I worry most not
when he's on top of the bull, but when he's on the ground at the
mercy of horns and feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, 29, grew up tough, the fourth of five children in a
struggling ranching family of the 1970s, when cattle prices plunged
in Australia. Dunn endured ``lots of long hours in the saddle''
gathering and punching the bawling herds, said his father, Robby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old saying here that the farther west that you grew
up in Queensland, the tougher you are,'' the elder Dunn said.
``Troy grew up inland around a tougher class of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn fit into rodeo as snugly as a hand-me-down duster, mounting
his first calf at nine. The ride abruptly ended after several jumps
when Dunn was whipped down and collided face first with the calf's
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a late starter,'' Dunn said. ``My dad wouldn't let us
get stomped before our time.''
</P>
<P>
   The knockdown didn't discourage Dunn from eventually learning
the ropes of staying aboard rampaging bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived in the bush, and there was not a lot for kids to do
but ride horses and roughstock,'' said Dunn's elder brother, Lance.
``When we were kids, Troy would sit around and read the Western
Horseman magazines. In school, Troy drew bulls in his books. Bull
riding was really all that he had on his mind.''
\Nsubheds:Fast-rising cowboy In rodeo, Dunn became the little
brother who could, ascending up Australia's junior, amateur and
professional ladders in championship form. Dunn snared four
Australian national titles, the 1989 bull-riding championship, the
1991 bareback-riding championship and the '89 and '91 all-around
crowns, his passport to the highly esteemed North American circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Rodeo's big belt buckles are lassoed in the United States and
Canada at Fort Worth, Cheyenne, Calgary and finally Las Vegas, the
ranch mansion for the National Finals Rodeo and the PBR
championships. But for aspiring Aussies, the transition to the
North American circuit has proved to be more challenging than going
from Texas high school football stardom to a freshman varsity
starter on a Big 12 also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn bucked the odds by first making a brief trip to North
America in 1990 on a scouting report. Then, in 1991, with only six
months on his visa and a mandate to excel in order get an
extension, Dunn survived by earning his first of two National
Finals Rodeo berths. He also pocketed $50,000 at the Calgary
Stampede, a winner-take-all prize in each event that traditionally
is awarded on the rodeo's final day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Dunn accelerated to another level, posting the highest
combined score at the PBR's world championships and finishing third
for the year. That same year, he qualified for the National Finals
and finished third in the PRCA.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Dunn entered the Las Vegas finals at the MGM Grand
with the title almost clinched after winning regular-season closer
shows in Calgary and Anaheim. Though Dunn suffered a dislocated hip
on the championships' opening show and was in a wheelchair for the
remaining four performances, the lead stood the acid test, and he
nipped newcomer Chris Shivers in the world buckle race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to win the world without having to get my bloody
backside dirty,'' Dunn said.

BASEBALL HALL OF FAME TO INDUCT ONE OF NEGRO LEAGUES' BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Had Joe Williams been white, he might be as legendary as Babe
Ruth. If Joe Williams had been white, he might have blown a high,
hard one by the Babe in the World Series. Had Joe Williams been
white, Nolan Ryan might be strutting into the Baseball Hall of Fame
next Sunday singing the praises of Texas' first tall, lanky
fireballer.
</P>
<P>
   Had Joe Williams been white, he and his family might have been
able to attend his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame some 50
years ago, instead of next Sunday, when few who knew him will be in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Williams, however, was black. And that changes everything.
</P>
<P>
   Smokey Joe Williams, perhaps the greatest pitcher never to play
in the major leagues because of his skin color, will finally take
his place at baseball's hallowed grounds in Cooperstown, N.Y., 85
years after he struck out 20 members of the New York Giants to earn
his nickname. Williams joins players Ryan, George Brett, Robin
Yount and Orlando Cepeda, manager Frank Selee and umpire Nestor
Chylak in this year's Hall of Fame class. Williams was selected by
the Veterans' Committee, which was authorized to choose one Negro
League player in a special election each of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan from Seguin was a giant by early-1900s standards. He
stood 6-foot-4 and weighed 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He threw so hard and so fast, he earned the nicknames
``Cyclone'' and ``Strikeout.'' Finally, as legend has it, after
Williams struck out 20 white New York Giants in a 1914 exhibition
game, one of those Giants players patted Williams on the rear end
and said: ``Nice job, Smokey.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that head-turning day, Smokey Joe Williams blasted into
baseball's living lore, even if Major League Baseball's color ban
kept him out of its leagues. In that grand year of 1914, records
show Williams compiled a 41-3 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Ty Cobb considered him to be a ``sure 30-game
winner'' had he been able to pitch in the major leagues. Records
show Williams outdueled the great Walter Johnson twice, some say
more, as well as Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Williams reeled
off a 20-7 record in exhibitions against white major-league
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the major leagues without Ken Griffey Jr., and so on
and so on and so on,'' said author John Holway, who has written
several books about the Negro Leagues, including ``Blackball
Stars'', which dedicates a chapter to Williams' career.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Williams' pitching statistics are difficult to verify
because Negro Leagues statistics are incomplete. Much of the rest
of his life also lacks documentation.
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Hall of Fame has been unable to find any living
relatives. Hall officials are still uncertain who will represent
him at the induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is believed to have been born on April 6, 1886, in
Seguin, a small town along Interstate 10 about 50 miles east of San
Antonio. After a long and winding baseball career in which he
played for 10 Negro Leagues teams, mostly on the East Coast, it is
believed Williams worked as a bartender in New York City after his
baseball career ended.
</P>
<P>
   The most often listed date of death is March 12, 1946, but
Holway says research in recent years indicates he likely did not
die until 1952 or later.
</P>
<P>
   His baseball tour of duty, which lasted from 1905-32, looked
like a who's who of Negro Leagues baseball, not uncommon to many of
the black stars of that day: San Antonio Black Bronchos, Chicago
Leland Giants, New York Lincoln Giants, Chicago American Giants,
Atlantic City Bacharach Giants, Brooklyn Royal Giants, Homestead
Grays and the Detroit Wolves.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is primarily remembered for his performances for the
New York Lincoln Giants (1911-1923) and Homestead Grays
(1925-1932). And like Ryan, Williams could still throw the heater
late in his career. On Aug. 2, 1930, as a 44-year-old pitcher for
the Grays, he struck out 27 Kansas City Monarchs and threw a
one-hitter in a 12-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   Such monstrous outings prompted Satchel Paige, widely considered
to be the greatest Negro Leagues pitcher, to laud Williams as the
greatest pitcher he had ever seen. Had Williams been white, he
might have been teammates with Walter Johnson or even the Babe. He
might have challenged Johnson as the strikeout king of their
generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often wonder,'' Holway said, ``if Babe could have hit 60
home runs if he had to face some of the better black pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   At least now, Williams will finally join Johnson and Ruth in his
rightful place, in the Hall of Fame. / nn

UMPIRES ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THE INCOMPETENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not about respect, as umpires' union chief Richie Phillips
_ who is even more malodorous than his players' union counterparts
Don Fehr and Gene Orza _ keeps insisting.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even about money. These are things we could understand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this is about Phillips' convincing the decent and good
umpires in the game to lay their jobs on the line to protect the 20
or so who stink and who don't belong in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips knows that baseball's move to put umpires in both
leagues under one office, overseen by Sandy Alderson, is the
precursor to Alderson's cleaning out the bad umpires and replacing
them with new, younger umpires with better attitudes and better
work ethics.
</P>
<P>
   This is where I have a problem with unions: They protect the
dreadful along with the excellent, bringing the overall product
down in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is playing a dangerous game, though. Unless the umps
quickly rescind their offer to resign, there is every likelihood
that baseball will happily accept the resignations, weed out the
bad umps and offer jobs to the good ones. Those who want to work
can. Those who don't can try to live off their severance packages,
which will average about $225,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Don't kid yourself, though. If the major-league umpires aren't
out there in September and during the postseason, the quality of
umpiring will drop significantly. No one knows this better than the
managers and players who have seen replacement umps work before.
It's not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   This is baseball's chance to win a labor war, though, and this
time it might be willing to take the short-term hit in order to
restructure a system that has gotten out of control.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:First-class move While Diamondbacks All-Stars Matt
Williams, Jay Bell, Luis Gonzalez, Randy Johnson and their wives
were being whisked from Phoenix to Boston aboard owner Jerry
Colangelo's private jet, Rangers' All-Stars were boarding a red-eye
puddle-jumper from San Diego to Los Angeles, then flying all night
from LAX to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After the All-Star Game, the Arizona players immediately boarded
Colangelo's jet for a flight to Texas so they could spend all day
Wednesday resting.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' players? They were up early Wednesday morning for
an 8:15 a.m., four-hour commercial flight to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Rangers owner Tom Hicks, who was host to a Saturday night
party for the team at La Jolla Beach Club in San Diego, has a
luxurious private jet reputed to be even nicer than Colangelo's _
the same one that Hicks made available to fly Johnson back and
forth to Texas when the Rangers were futilely courting him as a
free agent.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Zim's the man Rangers rookie Jeff Zimmerman, one of
the biggest stories at the All-Star Game, was constantly mobbed by
the media and said later it was tough to enjoy it because of all
the attention. ``I was being pulled from one place to another,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman even taped a six-minute interview for ABC's ``World
News Tonight'' on the night of the game, something even Nolan Ryan
never accomplished while he was with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:And in this corner ... Mets players are still buzzing
about another confrontation and near fight between manager Bobby
Valentine and outfielder Bobby Bonilla during the team's series
with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Seems that Roger Clemens had buzzed both Robin Ventura and Roger
Cedeno with pitches after Mike Piazza hit a three-run homer when
Bonilla, who had been watching the game on television in the
clubhouse, as he usually does, came storming into the dugout,
screaming at his teammates that they had to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Irritated, Valentine is reported to have told Bonilla to ``get
your fat butt back in the clubhouse where you've been for the last
two weeks.'' Bonilla invited the former Rangers skipper and
Arlington resident to join him, ``so we can settle this ourselves,
between you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine wisely didn't leave the dugout. Bonilla returned to
the clubhouse, ripped up a lineup card and threw it at the
manager's door.
</P>
<P>
   That'll show him who's boss.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Petty, petty The Yankees-Mets series featured lots of
pettiness, including an edict by Mets general manager Steve
Phillips banning Yankees' players who drove to Shea Stadium from
parking in the Mets' player lot. That was in retaliation for George
Steinbrenner's doing the same thing to Mets players during the
series at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees also are convinced the Mets were trying to mess with
pitcher Hideki Irabu's head by altering the radar-gun readings on
the Shea scoreboard. Irabu, who normally throws around 90 mph,
noticed his readings were being posted at 85 and 86 while
40-year-old Mets starter Orel Hershiser was consistently hitting 88
and 89.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw how slow I was throwing and thought to myself, `I better
not throw any more fastballs,' '' Irabu said afterward. He still
gave up just three runs in seven innings, and the Yankees won.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:The W-word Three days into his first minicamp, Lee
Nailon, who led TCU to the NIT quarterfinals last season, already
is having his commitment questioned by Charlotte Hornets coach Paul
Silas. Insiders in Charlotte say Nailon and his nonchalant attitude
are paving his way to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players who might beat him out of a job: Eddie
Robinson, who played for Division II Central Oklahoma and scored
more than 40 against the Frogs in a game last season.
</P>
<P>
   Silas says he's trying to figure out how hard Nailon is willing
to work.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coaches who all but begged Nailon to take more of a
leadership role on the Frogs over the past two years, could
probably supply the short answer:
</P>
<P>
   Not very.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Hey, Stars, `yoo-hoo' The Stars debuted their
1998-1999 Stanley Cup season video at Dallas' Granada Theater last
week, complete with a tanned and rested Mike Modano, just back from
vacationing at Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Note to Stars management: Yoo-hoo, there are plenty of Stars
fans west of the Trinity, too. Least you could have done is show
the video somewhere in Fort Worth or Arlington at the same time.
We'd have happily settled for Conn Smythe winner Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Bahama mamas A dedicated snoop and e-mailer reports
spotting Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and wide receiver Michael Irvin
snuggling together at the blackjack tables in the Bahamas recently.
</P>
<P>
   A cabbie says Jones and Irvin spent several hours conducting
serious discussions in a conference room. So how would the cabbie
know? Hey, cabbies know everything.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Vlad to be going Vladimir Jaksic, the TCU basketballer
who was supposed to spend the summer back in Zagreb, Croatia,
delayed his trip because he got married in June to Vicky Kozich, a
TCU grad. The happy couple will honeymoon in Croatia in early
August.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of the Niagara Falls of eastern Europe, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Rangers stuff A major-league official on former
Rangers minor-leaguer Warren Morris, traded to Pittsburgh for
Esteban Loaiza last season: ``He's better than \RMark\S McLemore
right now.'' Loaiza, meanwhile, has won a total of three games over
parts of two seasons since coming to Texas. ... Both Boston and St.
Louis phoned Doug Melvin inquiring about Mike Simms before he
underwent surgery on his left heel.

   Definition of abomination: A Barbie Doll impersonator is
scheduled to sing ``Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' at Tuesday's
Cubs' game at Wrigley Field. I swear I can hear Harry Caray
belching in his grave at the very thought.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Randy Johnson can't win a game any more. At least he
still has those movie-star good lucks to fall back on if times get
really tough.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits have already dubbed Seattle's new $517 million Safeco
Field as ``The Safe,'' which seems appropriate considering it's the
most expensive playground ever built.
</P>
<P>
   Former Cowboys tight-ends coach Robert Ford, now working for
Jimmy Johnson in Miami, has highlighted two key areas for the
Dolphins' success: ``If we can keep our receivers healthy and out
of jail, we should be fine.'' Hey, it's not like he hasn't had
experience along those lines.

THIS SEASON WILL DECIDE NFL'S `TEAM OF THE '90s' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When NFL training camps begin next week, several teams will have
made the final turn in serious contention to be ``Team of the
'90s.'' With three Super Bowl titles in four seasons, 1992-95,
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and company remain slightly ahead of a
field that includes the Denver Broncos, San Francisco 49ers and
Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, however, are gaining. They have won the past two
Super Bowls. And despite the retirement of quarterback John Elway,
they should be in the hunt to become the first team in league
history to win three consecutive Super Bowl titles.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. The Broncos and 29 other teams must
begin preparations for the title chase in the white-knuckle heat of
training camp, where the summer figures to provide plenty of
telltale story lines that should shape the league's 80th season.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: Can the Broncos win with Bubby Brister?
</P>
<P>
   With 2,000-yard running back Terrell Davis, All-Pro tight end
Shannon Sharpe and one of the best offensive lines in the game,
Broncos coach Mike Shanahan has too much talent for his club to
collapse. In replacing Elway at quarterback, all Brister has to do
is avoid mistakes, and the Broncos are shoo-ins to win the AFC
West. Brister, in fact, was 4-0 in games he started in place of
Elway last season. But Elway, no doubt, will be missed. Brister is
not as adept at throwing the ball deep, and he certainly lacks
Elway's late-game chutzpah. It would have been tough enough for the
Broncos to three-peat _ it has never been done before, and it will
be nearly impossible for the Broncos to pull off the feat with
Brister.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine new head coaches this season, which one has the most
work to do this summer?
</P>
<P>
   The obvious answer is Cleveland's Chris Palmer, who'll have to
make do with an expansion Browns outfit that returns to the league
for the first time since 1995. But at least Palmer works for an
experienced front office in team president Carmen Policy and
football-operations director Dwight Clark, both formerly of the
49ers.
</P>
<P>
   No, the new coach with the most work ahead this summer is
Philadelphia's Andy Reid. In 1998, the Eagles ranked dead last in
these offensive categories: passing yards, total yards, and points
per game. To the anger of its fans and even Philadelphia's mayor,
the club passed up selecting Heisman Trophy-winning running back
Ricky Williams to draft quarterback Donovan McNabb, the first of
many pieces this club needs to make a return to .500 football.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on with running backs Barry Sanders and Jamal
Anderson?
</P>
<P>
   Money is not the issue with Sanders. The Lions running back is
just tired of losing. Detroit Lions coach Bobby Ross gave Sanders a
June 1 deadline to notify the club whether he intends to play this
season. Ross still has not heard from Sanders and is not sure
whether he will be at training camp. Sanders has raised the
possibility of retirement, and if he does not play another down,
he'd finish 1,458 yards short of passing Walter Payton as the NFL's
all-time career leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Anderson, the Pro Bowl running back for the
Atlanta Falcons, wants the defending NFC champions to renegotiate
his contract to include an $8 million signing bonus and guaranteed
annual salaries. Falcons coach Dan Reeves has made Anderson a
counteroffer but said the deal is off if Anderson does not report
to training camp. Anderson, by the way, will be 27 the day after
the Falcons play their third game. So, if you look at the careers
of most running backs, Anderson has just a year or two of his prime
left. This is a fact not lost on Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   What draft picks can we expect to make a huge impact this
season?
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, running back Ricky Williams already is the
starter. He will be asked to carry an offense that averaged 83
yards rushing per game in 1998, which was dead last in the NFL. In
Indianapolis, running back Edgerrin James, whom the Indianapolis
Colts picked before Williams, must make fans forget about Marshall
Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   Also watch quarterbacks Akili Smith in Cincinnati, Tim Couch in
Cleveland, and McNabb in Philadelphia. Each was drafted to become
his club's franchise quarterback. It is not a matter of ``if'' they
will eventually become starters, but ``when.''
</P>
<P>
   Who are the early favorites to get to Super Bowl XXXIV?
</P>
<P>
   In the NFC, you have to pick Minnesota. The Vikings come into
the season angry after having been upset by the Falcons in the NFC
Championship Game. There are questions on defense, but in this
league, defense doesn't win championships any more. Offense brings
home the rings, and with rookie-of-the-year wide receiver Randy
Moss, quarterback Randall Cunningham, 1,000-yard rusher Robert
Smith, and the best offensive line in the conference, the Vikings
can outscore any team.
</P>
<P>
   In the AFC, the Jacksonville Jaguars, Denver, the Seattle
Seahawks and the New York Jets have the kinds of offenses to
compete for a world championship. But if the Miami Dolphins can get
a few things to fall right for them on offense _ mainly to have
available newly acquired wide receiver Tony Martin, who faces a
trial on money-laundering charges _ Jimmy Johnson could very well
be taking his second team to a Super Bowl.

A SPECIAL CASE FOR A SPECIAL SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Jay Hayes, the search for the private plane carrying John F.
Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister,
Lauren Bessette, was a jarring mixture of the familiar and the
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar was the pain, the uncertainty, of sudden loss. On
Christmas Eve, 1996, a Learjet piloted by a brother, Patrick Hayes,
and the copilot Johan Schwartz disappeared from radar in the
airspace above a municipal airport in Lebanon, N. H.
</P>
<P>
   In their final communication with the control tower, tower
officials said, they appeared to have been lost, disoriented. Then
there was silence as their jet disappeared from the sky without a
trace. No sign of them has been found.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising, Hayes said, is the extensive search for the Kennedy
plane. Although his brother's missing jet was the target of what
has been described as the largest search in New Hampshire history,
it bore little resemblance to the vast rescue effort mounted this
weekend off Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of the nation, Hayes and his family were transfixed by
the tragedy, and stung with grief for the Kennedy family, who have
lost so much, so often. And yet it served only as a reminder that
their efforts to find closure for their own tragedy have been
fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes disagreed with the many suggestions that the search for
Kennedy might be excessive. ``The government is doing for him what
they should have done for anyone else,'' he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   As Hayes recalled it, his family's frustration began almost
immediately. When his brother's plane disasppeared, in an area
bounded by deep wilderness and mountains and dotted by lakes and
swamps, New Hampshire officials told him that a search mission
would not begin for 36 hours. Exasperated family members began
their own search on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   When the official search began, four planes from the New
Hampshire Civil Air Patrol, as well as helicopters from the State
Police and New Hampshire National Guard, and a corps of volunteers,
searched a 30-square-mile area, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The search for his brother's plane, long suspended officially,
has carried on with the help of hundreds of volunteers, many of
them recruited via the Internet. Volunteers plan a new 10-day
search of a treacherous area of New Hampshire mountainside in the
next few weeks, Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials deny that there is anything out of the ordinary in the
Kennedy investigation. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee
declared Saturday that his agency works each case ``as if it were a
member of our own family,'' and representatives of other agencies
also deny that the Kennedys are getting special treatment, except
perhaps from the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board investigates about
3,000 aviation accidents a year. But it is unusual indeed to find
its presidentially named head traveling to Martha's Vineyard to
monitor the investigation of a crash with three victims, or to see
the head of the board's regional office in Parsippany, N.J.
personally directing the inquyiry.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who has been in personal contact with Coast
Guard officials in Boston spoke briefly Sunday of the inspiration
to public service, and of the private sacrifices, of the Kennedy
family. No clearer signal could have been sent that this accident
is receiving the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   This is not without precedent. French officials did not respond
to the death of Princess Diana as if it were just another traffic
fatality. A crash killing Diana is a special case; a plane crash
with John F. Kennedy Jr. aboard is a special case.
</P>
<P>
   It is out of character, in a sense. The Kennedys have a
reputation for fighting for equal treatment for all, and there is
no indication that they have sought special treament in this case.
The massive search has been prompted, instead, by a perfectly
appropriate outpouring of sympathy for all they have endured, all
they have given. But it has to sting for those who have also
suffered sudden loss, and found themselves left to cope with so
much less support.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of those aboard Kennedy's plane are no more valuable
than those of Patrick Hayes and Johan Schwartz. Yet the private
lives of the Kennedys have long been treated as public property,
and the Kennedy family members as American royalty. In presumed
death, as well, their tragedy inevitably becomes a national
obsession. For the government, as well as the public, some lives
mean more than others.

FOR RUSSIANS, CAMELOT UNDER SIEGE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The legend of Camelot is alive and well _ in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, and her
sister has Russians, like commentators around the world,
contemplating the tragic fate of the fabled American family.
</P>
<P>
   But the news that Kennedy's plane had apparently crashed into
the Atlantic Ocean Saturday has also, perhaps oddly, evoked in some
Russians nostalgia for the president who is still seen here as a
romanticized version of an American leader.
</P>
<P>
   While little is known in Russia about the younger Kennedy, his
father, the 35th president of the United States was _ and continues
to be _ a sort of cult figure here.
</P>
<P>
   President John F. Kennedy ``was everything that our leaders were
not _ charismatic, young, and glamorous,'' said Andrei Piontkowski,
59, a Moscow political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a kind of Kennedy-mania in the Soviet Union in the
1960s,'' Piontkowski said. ``He was young, energetic, and there was
a kind of romantic aura about him. I think we loved him even more
than the Americans loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   For Russians of Piontkowski's generation, the lasting image of
John F. Kennedy Jr. is the famous 1963 photo of the little toddler
saluting the coffin of his slain father.
</P>
<P>
   That image was played repeatedly on Russian television Sunday,
and the popular Itogi weekly news program lead its broadcast with a
report on the search for John Kennedy Jr.'s plane that included
footage of ``John-John'' crawling around the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as if an evil fate follows this family,'' host Yevgeny
Kiselyov said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy mystique is not confined to the United States and,
despite Cold War tensions, managed to penetrate the Iron Curtain,
even though Kennedy was repeatedly slammed in the Soviet press as
the instigator of the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction to Kennedy is particularly strong with those
Russians, now in their 50s, who came of age during his presidency _
which coincided in the Soviet Union with a brief liberalization
under Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev, a period known as ``the
thaw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked President Kennedy very much and I wasn't alone. Most
of my generation adored him,'' said Viktor Krivulin, 55, a renowned
Russian poet who lives in Russia's second city, St. Petersburg.
``He was the first American president that we saw as a good and
humanitarian person. In fact, many of us sympathized with Kennedy a
lot more than with Krushchev.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kennedy was killed, I realized that history will not
tolerate a political leader with a human face,'' said Krivulin, who
was a teenager when Kennedy was assassinated. ``The first thing I
thought when I heard the news Saturday'' of Kennedy Jr.'s
disappearance ``was: `My God, that poor family.' I am certain they
are cursed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian fascination with the elder Kennedy permeates the
upper echelons of power. At a summit meeting in Germany last month,
when President Boris N. Yeltsin wanted to show he intended to mend
relations with the United States that were frayed during the war in
Yugoslavia, the Russian leader handed President Clinton some 80
documents from the Kremlin archives about Kennedy's assassination
and about Lee Harvey Oswald.
</P>
<P>
   Historians said the documents did not shed any new light on the
United States' most notorious murder case. Yeltsin offered his own
theory, suggesting, on the basis of a report from an officer with
the KGB secret police to the Soviet Communist Party Central
Committee, that Kennedy was assassinated by a conspiracy of Texas
oil magnates.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians, the Kennedy cult lived on even among those who
were too young to remember the slain president.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people of my generation, Kennedy was a romantic hero,''
said Tatyana Korebanova, 39, a language teacher. ``The absolute
best compliment a girl could give a boy was to tell him that he
looked like John F. Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Russians know less about Kennedy Jr., although his celebrity
romances made the news here.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, where private aviation is still a rarity, some
expressed consternation that a glamorous member of a wealthy family
was flying his own plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, couldn't he get someone to fly for him?,'' said Lena
Furmanova, 24, a cashier at a Moscow supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Added Anna Danielevskaya, 27, a recent university graduate: ``It
is very sad that a person who had everything in life should die in
such a foolish manner.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSEILLES, France _ Water shortage is far from anyone's mind on
the banks of the mighty Rhone River as it surges from the high
glaciers of Switzerland down through eastern France. Along its
500-mile route, it is fed by numerous tributaries until the river
spills, largely untapped, into the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   But along the same sea, scarcity of fresh water is an
increasingly nagging issue farther west, in the arid regions of
eastern Spain. Planners predict that in the area around Barcelona,
Spain's second-largest city and the main seat of industry, the
shortage of drinking water may become severe.
</P>
<P>
   So Barcelona has developed a daring plan: to build a pipeline
through southern France and the Pyrenees to bring water from the
Rhone River to Spain. The 200-mile aqueduct could provide water for
more than 4.5 million people, who would pay for the project with
higher water bills. Although the plan is still far from approved,
it is the first time that a pipeline of this scale to carry water
from one country to another has been seriously considered in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Experts point to the scheme as a foreshadowing of things to come
along the Mediterranean, where the climate is turning measurably
drier and warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Along Europe's southern shores, from Greece to the tip of
Portugal, agricultural lands of old are being reclassified as arid.
The population keeps rising, encouraged by tourism, while water
supplies dwindle. Because of the dryness, forest fires and water
rationing are becoming ever more common.
</P>
<P>
   The Barcelona scheme is one option, but there are others. Italy
has been considering delivering water to its parched south by
building a pipeline under the Adriatic Sea to pump in supplies from
Albania. The Spanish island of Majorca has drawn up plans to build
underwater pipes to the mainland because during the summers, extra
drinking water has to be brought in by tanker.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, policy-makers have spent ample funds to figure out
the reasons for the droughts and the subsequent erosion and loss of
arable land. Numerous studies have revolved around the question: Is
the Mediterranean climate becoming drier because of global warming?
But as water shortages loom larger, planners are focusing more on
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona's water agency asked a French panel two years ago to
study the viability of a great aqueduct bringing water from the
Rhone. The panel of hydrologists, lawyers and environmentalists
published their conclusions last month, saying an aqueduct would
have only a ``negligible'' effect on the enormous volume of the
Rhone.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Desbordes, a professor of hydrology at Montpellier
University and chairman of the panel, said the Rhone stood apart
from the other main waterways flowing into the Mediterranean. ``It
is the most robust of the big rivers and also the least utilized,''
he said. ``In fact it's the last great source of untapped fresh
water in the Mediterranean Basin.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that only 1 percent of the river water is used and the
rest spills into the sea. The Nile, he said, which has a similar
great volume of water, loses close to 95 percent of it, mostly to
agriculture. About half the flow of the Po River in Italy and the
Ebro River in Spain are siphoned off, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rhone is also remarkably clean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline to Barcelona would tap about 1 percent of the
Rhone's normal volume. The pipe, 8 feet in diameter, would start
above Montpellier, reach the Camargue delta, run along the French
coast and pierce through the rocks of the Pyrenees. The cost has
been estimated at $1 billion, depending on whether the pipeline
would also be used to provide water to French towns along the way,
such as Beziers, Carcassonne and Narbonne, which occasionally have
water problems. The report estimates that the construction costs
could be earned back in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   For Barcelona water users, this might mean domestic water prices
three to four times higher than today's. The Barcelona water agency
points out that higher charges would reduce waste and lead to the
repair of leaks.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan fails, Barcelona will have to build an aqueduct to
the Ebro River, which, while closer, would cost 10 percent more
because of the more difficult terrain involved. Moreover, the level
of the Ebro can drop dramatically, and its water rights have often
been the subject of intense political fights.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Planners believe that negotiating the water rights for a new
aqueduct may serve as a model for other European projects.
``Building the pipeline is technically easy because it will run
through the Languedoc Plain,'' said Jacques Labre, an official at
Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux, one of the companies involved in the plan.
But among the hurdles, he said, are legal and political intricacies
and, not least, French farmers.
</P>
<P>
   France's farmers, a powerful group, have regularly staged
protests against their Spanish colleagues, put up roadblocks and
destroyed Spanish produce, which they see as undercutting French
prices.
</P>
<P>
   To send French water to Spain, even water that otherwise would
be spilled into the sea, may be seen on the Gallic farms as aiding
and abetting the competition.

 &HT;    Magazines move to cover Kennedy story
 &HT;    Staff report
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the wake of news that John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane
had disappeared, the nation's three newsweeklies busted deadlines
and remade their issues, which are due on newsstands today. Time
and Newsweek put Kennedy on their covers; U.S. News and World
Report, recognizing that the tragedy did not involve Kennedy alone,
chose a picture of him and his wife, Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   All the magazines, in some form or another, referred to Kennedy
and his two passengers, Carolyn and her sister Lauren, in the past
tense.
</P>
<P>
   In Time, the devotion to Kennedy begins with a letter from
managing editor, Walter Isaacson, noting that ``John F. Kennedy Jr.
was one of the least cynical people I've met.'' The list of
contributors includes Arthur Schlesinger Jr. who says Kennedy
learned to fly because he was ``as determined as his mother to
protect his personal privacy. Once he got his flying license, he
seemed a liberated man, free to travel as he wished without
suprefluous demands on time and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Margaret Carlson writes about Caroline Kennedy
Schlossberg: ``If it was hard to be the son of JFK, imagine how
hard it is to be the daughter of the valiant widow.. . . Caroline
had some of the remote, mysterious quality of her mother. When I
met her for the first time, I expected to hear that whisper. . .
but found instead someone with a firm voice, incredibly
self-posessed and with a day to dayness about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek senior editor Jonathan Alter reports that Kennedy might
well have run for the U.S. Senate from New York in 2000 if First
Lady Hillary Clinton had not begun a campaign. It was only a matter
of time before he ran for something, Alter writes.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the chilling news that Carolyn preferred to drive
up and take the ferry because she was frightened to get in a plane
with her husband. On the Fourth of July weekend, she did fly with
him _ but with a flight instructor aboard, writes assistant
managing editor Evan Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek contributor Douglas Brinkley, writes that since he and
Kennedy are both Sagittarians, born in 1960, ``He recently told me
about visiting an esteemed astrologist in China who read our chart:
for the next 18 months, John was told, we would be `stuck in a rut
of indecisiveness.' Then, supposedly in September 2000, we would
burst forth to `accomplish important things.' This was encouraging
news, I quipped, except that we had a brutal year and a half of
purgatory in front of us. 'Yeah,' he smiled, `but from then on it's
all blue skies'.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report, features the words ``The Kennedy
Curse'' on its cover, focusing on just that _ the tragedies that
seem to have unfairly been heaped upon this one family. Another
story, entitled ``The Boy Under the Desk,'' refers to the famous
picture of Kennedy peeking out from the secret door in the front of
his father's Oval office desk.
</P>
<P>
   And in an eerie coincidence, Life magazine's August issue, on
newsstands today, was designed to commemorate the fifth anniversary
of the death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The cover photo is of
Jackie and Caroline, but inside photos, taken by six of the former
First Lady's favorite photographers, show more than a dozen
pictures of Jackie as a newly-married bride, on the campaign trail
in 1959 and with her children in Hyannis Port, Mass. and in her New
York apartment.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine, which in 1988 anointed Kennedy ``The Sexiest
Man Alive,'' will devote its next cover, out this Friday, to him.
</P>
<P>
   On the web: Aside from the news organization websites, the only
standout in coverage was Salon.com, which posted pieces by
Christopher Hitchens and a number of other Salon columnists, on
Saturday, and was adding to its roster of essays on Sunday as well.
</P>
<P>
   International coverage: Thetragedy dominated headlines Sunday in
world papers, many of which ran the famed 1963 photo of
``John-John'' saluting the coffin of his slain father, President
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inexplicable curse of the Kennedys,'' London's The Sunday
Telegraph said in a headline for a story that ran over three pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragedy without end: John F. Kennedy Jr. Crashes,'' ran the
headline in the Sunday edition of Frankfurter Allgemeine.
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland, the home of Kennedy ancestors, state TV and radio
channel, RTE, sent its Washington correspondent to Massachusetts to
cover what it described as a tragedy for ``the Irish-American
political dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's disappearance became the main lead item in most of
Ireland's Sunday newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Kennedy's disappearance led all the radio and
television reports and headlined most of Sunday's daily newspapers,
which included pictures of the family and ``family trees'' of
Kennedys who died young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy curse strikes again'', said the Sunday Times of
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kennedy family again meets the vicious curse,'' opined
Hong Kong's Chinese-language daily Oriental Daily News.

FUTURE DIM FOR KENNEDY BRAINCHILD GEORGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crash Friday night is
likely to take one more casualty _ George, the magazine that was
his brainchild and professional mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the accident, industry analysts were predicting that
the magazine's parent company, Hachette Filipacchi, might not renew
its contract with Kennedy, which was due to expire at the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' one analyst, who asked not to be identified, said
Sunday, ``I don't think George is long for this world.''
</P>
<P>
   A former senior staffer with George, who also talked Sunday on
condition of anonymity, agreed: ``I don't think that it can
continue without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy unveiled George with great fanfare in September 1995,
backed by a $20 million commitment from Hachette Filipacchi, one of
the world's largest magazine empires. Newsstands were sent a
half-million copies of the first issue, which was crammed with an
impressive 300 pages of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But it has gone downhill ever since _ in recent times, steeply
so.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising pages are down 30 percent compared with this time
last year. Ad revenue is down 20 percent. Circulation, which had
remained flat around 400,000, dipped by 5 percent to 380,000.
Losses are reported to exceed $4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The general consensus is that things would be much worse if the
magazine did not possess the panache of the Kennedy name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising is more emotional than people think,'' said an
editor at another magazine. ``The thrill of having lunch with John
Kennedy Jr., or having him come beseech you for ads, is a very
powerful tool. People with big ad budgets get off on that sort of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy not only linked his name to the magazine _ he actually,
to the surprise of many, ran it.
</P>
<P>
   The first managing editor, Eric Etheridge, now vice president
for programming at deja.com, left George after three issues. A
friend of his, who is also in the magazine business, said, ``Eric
figured that he'd be working for a figurehead. Then John decided he
wanted to do it himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge agreed. ``He was intimately involved in virtually all
aspects of putting the issues together,'' he said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Noah, a columnist for Slate, who wrote two articles for
George, called Kennedy ``a very hands-on editor.'' One article,
about House majority whip Tom DeLay, was assigned by Kennedy
himself last summer. Noah said, ``He had a very sharp sense that
DeLay was going to be a big story before a lot of other people
did.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kennedy unveiled George he proclaimed it would be a
``post-partisan'' magazine that would treat politics ``as another
aspect of popular culture.''
</P>
<P>
   David Pecker, who was then Hachette Filipacchi's CEO and very
much Kennedy's corporate patron, exclaimed at the time, ``George
doesn't fall into any niche. George will create its own niche.''
</P>
<P>
   A former senior staffer on the magazine said Sunday _ as have
many people in the years since its debut _ that one problem with
the magazine is that it never quite did just that. Kennedy never
figured out how to balance the political and the cultural, or the
serious and the frivolous, in a compelling way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't know how to be very involved in the magazine and, at
the same time, to let it develop a life of its own,'' the
ex-staffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The current issue contains profiles of New Hampshire Senator Bob
Smith, the mayor of Dunmore, Pa., and the 10 toughest bosses on
Capitol Hill _ but also feature articles on Ricky Martin, Salma
Hayek, and professional wrestling, capped by a Q&AMP;A with Daisy
Fuentes, host of ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' on what she
would do if she were president (outlaw taxes, bomb Castro out of
power, and legalize Cuban cigars).
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kliger, the current boss at Hachette _ which publishes 29
magazines, including Elle, Premier, and Car &AMP; Driver _ has been
less personally involved with Kennedy than Pecker was. Earlier this
year, Kennedy met with Conde Nast president Steve Florio to discuss
taking George under its wing _ but no agreement resulted. More
recently, Kliger spoke with some investment bankers about infusing
George with more money; Hachette's initial $20 million investment
is all spent. According to Sunday's New York Post, Kennedy was
talking with philanthropist John Tudor Jones about running George
under the auspices of a foundation _ in the same way that the
MacArthur Foundation bankrolls Harper's and Paul Newman's
foundation supports The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   However, several people in the industry say, without Kennedy's
name and ardor, none of these options will come to pass.

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ More than a week after the signing of a
cease-fire accord to end the war in Congo, the fighting continues,
the rebels say they have captured more territory and the countries
embroiled in the year-old conflict are trading accusations that the
agreement has been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the negotiators' insistence that the deal has taken
effect, the refusal by the two main rebel groups to sign the accord
appears, in effect, to have prevented it from being carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western countries have been trying
to rally all the parties by applying pressure directly on the
rebels and indirectly on their backers, especially Rwanda, said a
Western diplomat involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As the enthusiasm inspired by the July 10 signing ceremony is
eroded by reports of continuing battles in the thick Congo jungles,
the enormous costs of keeping the peace are also becoming clearer
to an international community acutely conscious of the burdens of
Kosovo and of past failed peacekeeping missions in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the big powers that would commit the money and the
logistical support, it's a period of wait and see,'' said an
international relief official here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   According to the agreement, the signing should have been
followed quickly by a visit to Congo by international observers and
the formation of a joint military commission of the warring
parties.
</P>
<P>
   No visit has taken place, and it was unclear whether the joint
military commission required for instituting the cease-fire, would
be in place.
</P>
<P>
   Didier Mumengi, the minister of information, said the commission
would not be set up until the rebels signed the accord. But the
foreign minister of Zimbabwe, the chief ally of Congo and its
president, Laurent Kabila, said the signers would meet in Zambia on
Monday to establish the military commission.
</P>
<P>
   Mumengi, in an interview on Friday, accused the rebels of
refusing to sign on the orders of their sponsors, Rwanda and
Uganda. ``Their goal remains the same,'' he said, speaking of
Rwanda's strongman, Paul Kagame. ``Kagame still wants to overthrow
this government and put in place a Congolese president who will be
a puppet of Rwanda.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of one of the two main rebel groups, the Movement for
the Liberation of Congo, asserted his autonomy last week,
attributing the failure to sign the accord to dissension in the
other rebel organization, the Congolese Rally for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leader, Jean-Pierre Bemba, whose organization occupies
Congo's northern territories and is backed by Uganda, said the
Kabila government and its allies had made the accord meaningless by
unprovoked attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila signed the accord and he started violating it
himself,'' Bemba said by satellite phone. ``The problem is not on
our side. It's on his.''
</P>
<P>
   Bemba said he was in Gemena, a town in the north that he said
his forces had seized. Mumengi denied that assertion, saying there
was still fighting in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war began nearly a year ago, Congo has been gradually
carved up, with the rebels and their backers now controlling the
eastern and northern areas and the government and its allies
holding the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades of state neglect under the late dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko had turned most of the country into a no man's land where
various rebel groups from neighboring countries and militias roamed
freely.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire agreement calls on the warring parties to disarm
the militias, including the interahamwe, the hard-core Hutu
fighters who were largely responsible for the massacres in Rwanda
in 1994 _ and who ultimately fled into neighboring Congo _ in which
half a million people were estimated to have been killed in 100
days.
</P>
<P>
   International peacekeepers would eventually take over that
responsibility, according to the agreement. Most of the
peacekeepers would be African, with the West providing the money
and logistical support.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the operation _ which the United Nations Secretary
General, Kofi Annan, said may require 20,000 troops and needs
approval by the U.N. Security Council _ has not been assessed, but
it is expected to be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Few expect the United States to send troops, but as the nation
that would have to shoulder the biggest financial share, it will
play a critical role in shaping a peacekeeping force, which the
American officials contend could be kept to 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   From its start, this civil war has put the United States in a
delicate position. Things had been clearer during the 1997 war, in
which Rwanda and Uganda picked Kabila to head a rebellion that
ultimately toppled Mobutu. Back then the Clinton administration,
which had held up Rwanda's and Uganda's leaders as representatives
of a new generation of African leaders, was ready to embrace
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   But Kabila showed little regard for democracy and severed his
ties with Rwanda and Uganda. Last August, those two nations opened
the current attempt to depose Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan officials and their allies in eastern Congo _ many of
whom, unlike members of the Kabila government, were educated in the
United States, speak English and are ``more like us,'' in the words
of an American diplomat here _ lobbied intensely in Washington and
New York.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that their actions were based on their fear of a
repeat of the 1994 genocide. The Kabila government, they said, was
unwilling to address their security concerns, including the
continuing presence of the interahamwe. And in the course of the
war, the Kabila government gave substance to their concerns by
enlisting the interahamwe in its fight.
</P>
<P>
   But there are indications now, after a year in which the civil
war has sucked in at least half a dozen countries and destabilized
all of Central Africa, that Rwanda's actions are being more closely
scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many, many in the international community who are
skeptical of the Rwandans,'' the American diplomat said. ``There
are some people who feel that the genocide card has been played by
Rwanda and that it's getting old.''
</P>
<P>
   If the cease-fire timetable is followed, a national debate will
take place, involving Kabila's government, the rebel factions and
the numerous political parties in the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But lasting peace in Congo will come only when Rwanda's internal
problems, rooted in the longstanding conflicts between the Hutu and
Tutsi, are resolved. Rwanda's government is dominated by Tutsi,
though they are a minority in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may even be able to get the interahamwe to disarm,'' the
international relief official said. ``But the Hutu resolve to get
its share of power, that will not die down.''

NEW UMPIRE TALENT OVERDUE

<TEXT>
<P>
   When informed that Major League Baseball might tell his group to
take its maladjusted strike zone and cram it down their chest
protectors after the announcement of a Sept. 2 mass
``resignation,'' umpire union boss Richie Rich Phillips bellowed:
``They risk having 25 years of inferior umpiring ahead of them in a
game in which they will be presenting a very, very watered-down
product. That's a real risk.''
</P>
<P>
   For the love of the game, the risk here would be renewing a
contract with a bunch of inferiority-complexed, Dunkin'

Hiring a bunch of up-and-comers more hungry to succeed and make the
game better instead of the hell-bent Hallions we have now doesn't
sound too risky.

FUTURE DIM FOR KENNEDY BRAINCHILD GEORGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crash Friday night is
likely to take one more casualty _ George, the magazine that was
his brainchild and professional mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the accident, industry analysts were predicting that
the magazine's parent company, Hachette Filipacchi, might not renew
its contract with Kennedy, which was due to expire at the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' one analyst, who asked not to be identified, said
Sunday, ``I don't think George is long for this world.''
</P>
<P>
   A former senior staffer with George, who also talked Sunday on
condition of anonymity, agreed: ``I don't think that it can
continue without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy unveiled George with great fanfare in September 1995,
backed by a $20 million commitment from Hachette Filipacchi, one of
the world's largest magazine empires. Newsstands were sent a
half-million copies of the first issue, which was crammed with an
impressive 300 pages of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But it has gone downhill ever since _ in recent times, steeply
so.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising pages are down 30 percent compared with this time
last year. Ad revenue is down 20 percent. Circulation, which had
remained flat around 400,000, dipped by 5 percent to 380,000.
Losses are reported to exceed $4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The general consensus is that things would be much worse if the
magazine did not possess the panache of the Kennedy name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising is more emotional than people think,'' said an
editor at another magazine. ``The thrill of having lunch with John
Kennedy Jr., or having him come beseech you for ads, is a very
powerful tool. People with big ad budgets get off on that sort of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy not only linked his name to the magazine _ he actually,

WORLD MEDIA RESPONDS TO KENNEDY STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ There is no story in the world more
captivating it seems than the one unfolding here and across the
chilly waters of Vineyard Sound on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr.'s disappearance and the belief that he is
dead has sent shockwaves around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many media outlets have slashed their news
budgets, dozens of newspapers and television stations from Europe,
Canada, Japan, and Australia have sent a small army of crews to
cover what has become the dominant story on several continents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big news in France,'' said Mamadon Niang, a reporter for
France Television. ``The Kennedys have been a mythical icon in the
life of American politics, which has influenced the rest of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Niang, as well as several other foreign correspondents, said
John F. Kennedy Jr. captured the hearts of people across the world.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 million people, Niang said, will watch his broadcast
from Hyannis Port, including viewers in French-speaking countries
in Africa as well as in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Niang is in one of four French news crews covering the story.
</P>
<P>
   Als Johnsen, who is reporting for Verdens Gang, Norway's largest
daily newspaper, sat wearily on a stone fence Sunday. Johnsen tried
to get a flight to Martha's Vineyard Sunday morning, but all were
booked.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, he filed the story from his hotel room and then
returned and waited with the 350 reporters crowded outside the
Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Norwegian angle to the story,'' Johnsen said.
``This story is global. There are no boundaries to it. When it
comes to the Kennedys, it becomes a smaller world.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnsen said his paper with a circulation of 380,000 devoted as
many pages to the story as The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   As with Princess Diana's death last summer, foreign news outlets
have broadcast updates 24 hours a day on television, radio, and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As far away as Australia, news of the massive search in the
waters of Martha's Vineyard was the lead news story.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Doublet, a reporter for Agence France-Presse, said: ``My
understanding is that there are twice as many reporters on the
Vineyard, but if you want to know what the Kennedys have to say,
this is the place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He whittled away the time by speaking to another French-speaking
reporter, Robert Plouffe of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Plouffe arrived here without a camera crew, but has transmitted
live updates by telephone to Le Canal Nouvelles (The News Channel)
in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can not close our eyes to what happened here,'' Plouffe
said. ``Everyone around the world is touched by what happened.
(John F. Kennedy Jr.) is the one who could have carried on the
Kennedy legacy. He could have one day become president.''

   ARLINGTON, Va. _ The steady stream of visitors across the
decades to the graves of President John F. Kennedy and his brother,
Robert, sadly quickened Sunday as the nation kept vigil for John F.
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they found his body yet?'' Xavjeir Goodfaith, a
15-year-old student, asked as he moved on from the eternal flame
marking the grave of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to carry on the Kennedy legacy; it can't just
disappear,'' the student said with considerable insistence, pausing
at Robert F. Kennedy's memorial stone, which bears a quotation from
Aeschylus, ``In our sleep, pain that can not forget falls drop by
drop upon the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors poured up the hill to the Kennedy graves here at
Arlington National Cemetery, the sweltering summer heat compounding
the day's dirgeful tinge as they left flowers and notes for the
missing Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world stands motionless and hearts are heavy with
sadness,'' declared one note lying near a photograph of John Jr. as
a small boy more than 35 years ago saluting his father on the day
he was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling my son the history of the Kennedys,'' said
Bob Sedlock, visiting from Pittsburgh with his son, David, 8. ``I
was my boy's age when President Kennedy was shot, and I remember it
all just like it was yesterday. It's tough being a Kennedy, to
begin with, but John Jr. did a lot on his own. He didn't sit on the
Kennedy name.''
</P>
<P>
   Small children posed with smiles for their parents' video
cameras as the visitor flow continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time, there's a kind of flashback,'' Ed Bonilla, an Army
sergeant, said of the way each new Kennedy tragedy recharges the
nation's sad memories of them. ``This is a person who has been
loved by the country since he was born,'' said the sergeant, who
was on leave from Korea and decided to come to the cemetery after
he heard the news of John Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, people's reactions were less focused than
those of the graveside visitors here. Many Americans remarked more
on the persistence of tragedy in the life of the Kennedys than on
John Jr. himself. Some questioned whether Kennedy was reckless in
flying his plane at dusk with such little experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kennedys live that dangerous lifestyle,'' Steve Hout, a
customer outside the Highlander bar in Atlanta said. Across the
way, John Stewar, sat under a shade tree and when asked his
reaction, complained, ``The only thing I thought was, `God, I have
to watch this on TV for a week.' It's just the latest topic for the
lack of something better to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were hardly so uninvolved.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Barnes from Bristol, England, was visiting New York City.
The devout daughter of an Anglican priest, she decided to go to the
Roman Catholic Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. ``We wanted to be
here with their people,'' she said of the Kennedys. ``We certainly
did pray for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, as at the cemetery here, attendance increased at the
Brookline house where President Kennedy was born, now a national
historic site. Bouquets and a vigil candle were left outside. ``A
lot of people have been saying, `Not again.''' David Kratz, a
worker at the site, noted of the sense of cyclical Kennedy tragedy
that prompted visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin, where the Kennedys long have been proudly claimed as
Ireland's own, the main news Sunday was of the death of Donal
McCann, the nation's leading actor. But the second story, amply
reported by the network's Washington correspondent at Hyannis Port,
was of the Kennedy plane disappearance. ``What is God trying to
tell that family?'' one Dubliner asked.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the missing plane was front-page news, with heavy
emphasis on what was being headlined as ``the curse of Camelot.''
The Observer, like all the major papers, offered multiple stories
about ``America's tragic and glamorous `royals.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Zuni, a restaurant in mid-Manhattan, the Yankee game was on
the television through the afternoon, and no one asked to switch to
the latest Kennedy news, according to bartender Britton
Herring.``It seemed like a foregone conclusion that they were
gone,'' he said. ``Also, I've been staying away from it because of
the way the press is talking about it. There's so little new
information, there's nothing to say. So, they get to the point of
talking about nothing, and it becomes a little ghoulish.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Robert Wiggins, a chef for Amtrak, waited at a bar
in the Port Authority Bus Terminal and was dismayed at the Yankee
game on the tube and the lack of Kennedy update. ``Way back an old
poet said, `Every man's death diminishes me, for I am a part of
mankind,''' he said. ``If you made a comparison, John F. Kennedy
Jr. is the closest thing we have to a prince and as such, we should
look upon this as a death in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery visitors here identified with the Kennedys for offering
the painful lesson over the years that all families must persevere
in the face of suffering. ``John Jr.'s especially sad because he
had his childhood taken away along with his father,'' said Clara
Johnston of Raphine, Va., alluding to the celebrity spotlight that
dogged the boy until he managed to turn it into a tool for his
publishing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to have his own life, and I think he became more
grown up when he lost his mother,'' she said, typifying the level
of intimacy and affection visitors to the grave site expressed
about the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Hollywood kind of person, gawking at celebrities,
but their lifestyle is impressive,'' said John Sapp. He was born
five years after the Kennedy assassination but said that he, like
all Americans, has been absorbing chapters of the Kennedys'
bittersweet story across his life. ``It's the elegance of Jackie,
the flamboyance of the family _ JFK being so dashing and daring,''
he said in summary as he headed down the hill from the Kennedys'
graves.

WORLD MEDIA RESPONDS TO KENNEDY STORY

   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ There is no story in the world more
captivating it seems than the one unfolding here and across the
chilly waters of Vineyard Sound on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr.'s disappearance and the belief that he is
dead has sent shockwaves around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many media outlets have slashed their news
budgets, dozens of newspapers and television stations from Europe,
Canada, Japan, and Australia have sent a small army of crews to
cover what has become the dominant story on several continents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big news in France,'' said Mamadon Niang, a reporter for
France Television. ``The Kennedys have been a mythical icon in the
life of American politics, which has influenced the rest of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Niang, as well as several other foreign correspondents, said
John F. Kennedy Jr. captured the hearts of people across the world.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 million people, Niang said, will watch his broadcast
from Hyannis Port, including viewers in French-speaking countries
in Africa as well as in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Niang is in one of four French news crews covering the story.
</P>
<P>
   Als Johnsen, who is reporting for Verdens Gang, Norway's largest
daily newspaper, sat wearily on a stone fence Sunday. Johnsen tried
to get a flight to Martha's Vineyard Sunday morning, but all were
booked.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, he filed the story from his hotel room and then
returned and waited with the 350 reporters crowded outside the
Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Norwegian angle to the story,'' Johnsen said.
``This story is global. There are no boundaries to it. When it
comes to the Kennedys, it becomes a smaller world.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnsen said his paper with a circulation of 380,000 devoted as
many pages to the story as The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   As with Princess Diana's death last summer, foreign news outlets
have broadcast updates 24 hours a day on television, radio, and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As far away as Australia, news of the massive search in the
waters of Martha's Vineyard was the lead news story.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Doublet, a reporter for Agence France-Presse, said: ``My
understanding is that there are twice as many reporters on the
Vineyard, but if you want to know what the Kennedys have to say,
this is the place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He whittled away the time by speaking to another French-speaking
reporter, Robert Plouffe of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Plouffe arrived here without a camera crew, but has transmitted
live updates by telephone to Le Canal Nouvelles (The News Channel)
in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can not close our eyes to what happened here,'' Plouffe
said. ``Everyone around the world is touched by what happened.
(John F. Kennedy Jr.) is the one who could have carried on the
Kennedy legacy. He could have one day become president.''

SIDEWAYS GLANCE: MAYBE DECK ISN'T STACKED AGAINST DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine the reaction Los Angeles Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson would get if he admitted that tarot cards will be
used to help him fill out his lineup card from now on.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, imagine the results.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics beware: The ``Baseball Tarot Book &AMP; Card Set'' by Mark
Lerner and Laura Philips (Workman Publishing; $20) has been
strategically placed with other sports books at the local Borders
and B. Dalton. It could mysteriously end up in your shopping basket
at check-out time.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing the concept that baseball is a metaphor for life, this
78-card tarot set replaces its traditional symbols with those from
the grand ol' game that best equate.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, you're probably entering an area of complete
naivete, but the 324-page companion book will take you through the
process of using the cards and interpreting them for those up to
the spiritual challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to see if this hocus pocus works.
</P>
<P>
   First step: Construct a clear question and then concentrate on
it. Ours was simple. The Dodgers have not lived up to expectations
so far this season, so what is the real problem here?
</P>
<P>
   We created a positive vibe _ the Dodgers-Angels game was on TV _
fanned the cards out on the floor, lit a candle and began the
process of drawing cards. How many? Up to you. Our original thought
was to pick two _ Tommy Lasorda's number _ but for some reason we
took a third.
</P>
<P>
   The result (and we're not making this up):
</P>
<P>
   __ The first card was XIII Slump, from the 22-card family known
as ``The Majors.'' The book explained this choice: ``While Slump
conveys the idea of a `reversal of fortune' and experiencing feels
of martyrdom and self-sacrifice, there are benefits to be gained.
The astute and contemplative player, while down and demoralized,
may begin to understand what's been going wrong. There is a
comforting realization that there's no way to go but up, so with
renewed dedication, hard work and help from coaches, that's the
direction in which the player heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Major suit also contains cards called the
Manager, the All-Star, the Rookie and the Coach, blame could have
been placed anywhere. This implies to us it's simply a run of bad
luck.
</P>
<P>
   __ The second card was Twelve of Balls/Wild Pitch. The
explanation is that this is a signal to ``slow down. Calm down. You
have extraordinary powers available to you . . . you're in danger
of squandering the gift of your energy by indulging your impatience
and sense of self-importance.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The third card was Five of Mitts/Error. The explanation is
that this is a signal to ``accept that perfection is not a workable
goal . . . seek support from others to keep your hope for the
future alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Still don't believe it? We took the cards down to a psychic on
Ventura Boulevard. She looked at the information we presented. She
looked at the cards. She flipped through the book.
</P>
<P>
   She looked confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball . . . I don't understand the connection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good enough endorsement for us.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to pick the next card, Davey?

BESETTE FAMLY FRIENDS SHOW LOVE, SUPPORT

   GREENWICH, Conn. _ At an overflowing church just a few hundred
feet from the high school Carolyn Bessette Kennedy attended, former
neighbors and classmates of Carolyn and her sister Lauren came
together Sunday to pray.
</P>
<P>
   Some brought flowers, others clutched rosary beads. Their sorrow
was plain as they knelt, some with eyes tear-filled, and bowed
their heads for Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two daughters, and not knowing their whereabouts. It's just
terrible,'' said Debbie Lamoureux, who graduated from St. Mary High
School in Carolyn's class.
</P>
<P>
   The Bessettes are not world-famous like the Kennedys. But it was
clear Sunday at the special Mass at St. Michael the Archangel
Church, they are much loved by the people who know them.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoureux said she remembers Carolyn, 33, as ``always smiling,
always laughing, very lovely.'' Others in the crowd of 200 people
at the standing-room only service had personal connections to the
Bessette sisters, who lived in Greenwich. Several, like Lamoureux,
were schoolmates of Carolyn from St. Mary's, Class of 1983.
</P>
<P>
   During the Mass, the Rev. Michael R. Moynihan reminded the
congregation several times to pray for the Bessettes' relatives and
Carolyn's husband, John F. Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes into the service, Moynihan called all the
children in the church up to the altar, where they sat cross-legged
on the light green carpet as the priest explained why Sunday was
different from other Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're praying in a special way today for three people who were
in a plane accident,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Neumann, who attended the 9:45 a.m. Mass with his wife and
children described Lauren, 35, as very dedicated, very
professional.
</P>
<P>
   The two used to work together in Hong Kong for Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, the Manhattan-based investment banking firm where
Lauren is a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn and Lauren's family chose to grieve in private Sunday.
The sisters' mother and stepfather, Ann and Richard Freeman, had
asked police to block everyone except residents from entering their
private road in Old Greenwich. The short street, which dead ends
into the Long Island Sound, is lined with maple and birch trees,
white picket fences, and well-kept houses that are modestly sized
for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland native Olive Curran wore sunglasses in the front center
pew as she clutched her rosary beads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken,'' said Curran, a friend of Jean Kennedy
Smith, sister of the late president and a former ambassador to
Ireland. ``I love them.''

CLINTON CITES KENNEDYS' LEGACY OF GIVING, SUFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Steps from the Rose Garden where he shook President
John F. Kennedy's hand in 1963, President Clinton made his first
public remarks Sunday on the disappearance of JFK's son,
summarizing the Kennedy family legacy as one of having ``suffered
much and given more.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke after returning from Camp David, where he had been
in telephone contact with Coast Guard officials conducting the
search for John Kennedy Jr.'s plane. He spoke only briefly,
addressing the personal and public undercurrent of the event: the
image of the assassinated president, and the children who were
supposed to carry on the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 40 years now the Kennedy family has inspired
Americans to public service, strengthened our faith in the future
and moved our nation forward,'' Clinton said. ``In recent years in
particular, John Kennedy Jr. and Caroline have captured our
imagination and won our affection . . . We hope the families of
these fine young people will feel the strength of God, the love of
their friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's words seemed to reflect a pall that has been cast over
Capitol Hill since early Saturday, when politicians raised in the
shadow of JFK began fearing the worst for his son.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties reacted to news of the disappearance of
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his
sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, in solemn terms. On the Sunday
morning Fox news show, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut
said JFK Jr. ``took the words . . . that mark his father's
presidency: Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you
can do for your country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The torch has passed to a new generation,'' said Lieberman, a
Democrat. ``But he expressed that ideal of citizenship and public
service in a largely nonpartisan and nontraditional political
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Vice President Al Gore canceled a presidential
fundraising brunch and attended church, where, he said, he prayed
for the passengers on the missing plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, we are reminded of the sacrifices of the Kennedy
family, and how precious and fragile life is,'' Gore said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   And in Massachusetts, Representative Edward J. Markey said it
was clear that the disappearance had hit far more than just
political chords. The impact was on ``not just Washington,'' he
said, but on a generation still captivated by the family legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prayed for him at Mass . . . this morning,'' Markey said of
John Kennedy Jr. ``Hundreds of millions of people in this country
and around the world are sad today. JFK's picture is still on the
walls of homes across the country, and JFK Jr. represents the
continuation of a commitment to inclusiveness and diversity, and
the contemporary engagement of the issues of the time.''

POLLS ON TAX CUTS FIND VOTERS' MESSAGES MIXED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (js) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly two-thirds of all Americans think their
taxes are too high. But few of them worry much about it, and most
people would rather have the government spend money on popular
programs than cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   These somewhat contradictory findings from a review of public
opinion polls help explain why Republicans and Democrats have such
different views on tax cuts. Each side can find something in the
polls to justify its position.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress expect to approve large tax cuts this
summer. Among the steps Republicans are considering are reduced
income-tax rates, a lower capital gains tax, abolition of the tax
on inheritances, new tax breaks for retirement savings and more
favorable tax treatment of married couples.
</P>
<P>
   These measures are opposed by most Democrats in Congress, and
President Clinton has promised to veto them. The president favors a
much smaller tax cut focused largely on retirement savings. The
president and the Democratic lawmakers also favor spending more on
health and education programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a Gallup Poll this spring, 65 percent of those questioned
said their taxes were too high. Over the last 30 years, through
good economic times and bad, that figure has not changed a great
deal.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, when CBS News asked people in a poll last
week what they thought was ``the single most important problem for
the government _ the president and Congress _ to address in the
coming year,'' only 5 percent named taxes, putting the issue behind
health care, Social Security, the national debt, education and
Medicare and Medicaid in terms of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar vein, when Gallup asked people in March whether
they favored a tax cut or ``increased spending on other government
programs,'' three-quarters opted for the tax cut. But on an
alternative question, when people were asked whether they preferred
a tax cut or more spending to ``fund new retirement savings
accounts, as well as increased spending on education, defense,
Medicare and other programs,'' three of every five respondents
favored financing of the specified programs.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of cutting taxes ``has only moderate priority when you
test it against spending,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew
Research Center, a nonpartisan polling operation. ``The reason is
not that people don't think their taxes are too high, because they
do, but they think tax breaks won't benefit them and the country as
much as the spending, and they think that when taxes are cut, the
rich guys are the ones who are going to make out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a poll by Gallup, CNN and USA Today in April found that
66 percent of the public believes ``upper-income people'' already
pay too little in taxes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When they debate tax policy, Republicans and Democrats rely on
the polling results that bolster their separate doctrines.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in an interview last week why polls showed little clamor
for tax cuts among voters, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the
Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,
replied: ``We know from long-term polling data, over a long period
of time, that people believe they are overtaxed. People do not say
we are taxed too little. They say government spends too much and
that we are taxed too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Ways and Means Committee debate on tax legislation
last week, Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., insisted that people
understood the Republican bill would mainly benefit the rich. The
Republicans ``would rather help multimillionaires and special
interests rather than enable seniors to obtain affordable
prescription drugs,'' Stark declared.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, when the Pew Research Center asked voters in a
poll last month whether they thought Republicans or Democrats would
do ``a better job'' on taxes, the outcome was a dead heat: 38
percent said Republicans and 38 percent said Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   One reason tax cuts are so important to Republicans is that this
is a matter on which two main strands of the party, business
interests and religious conservatives, agree.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that many issues that used to be central to
Republican dogma like anti-communism and inflation-fighting are not
relevant today. And many others like welfare, crime and balanced
budgets have been co-opted by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Among voters, tax cuts are a significantly higher priority for
Republicans than for Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   In a Gallup Poll, 69 percent of Republicans said a candidate's
position on the ``amount Americans pay in federal taxes'' was an
important factor in how they voted, but fewer than half of
Democrats and independents gave that response.
</P>
<P>
   And not surprisingly, the more money people make and thus the
more they pay in taxes, the more they favor tax cuts. Gallup found
that 62 percent of those with annual incomes above $75,000 regarded
taxes as a high or top priority in deciding whom to vote for, while
that was true of less than half of the people with incomes below
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the public may generally be skeptical about tax cuts
is that most people pay considerably more in Social Security and
Medicare payroll taxes than they pay in income taxes, and no one
nowadays is talking about reducing payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a couple with $50,000 in income, all of it from wages,
paid $7,650 in payroll taxes. Their employers paid another $7,650
as their share of the payroll taxes. But assuming one child and
itemized deductions of $10,000, the couple paid $4,800 in income
taxes.

SCROOGE ROLE ON TNT FITS PATRICK STEWART LIKE A STOCKING CAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By   
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Having Patrick Stewart play Scrooge in a new
film version of ``A Christmas Carol'' was a no-brainer. Though
better known to videophiles as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on ``Star
Trek: The Next Generation,'' Stewart has spent much of the past
decade performing a one-man version of the Dickens classic on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's next Scrooge will be in Robert Halmi Sr.'s latest
classic for the masses, airing Dec. 5 on TNT. Stewart, who also
played Ahab in Halmi's ``Moby Dick'' last year, said Halmi was on
the set of ``A Christmas Carol'' one day and said, `Patrick, how
would you like to play Napoleon?'''
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of playing Scrooge in a grimy dressing gown, Stewart
said he had dreamy visions of ``magnificent uniforms, beautiful
women with swelling breasts and see-through skirts, fantastic
horses and hundreds of thousands of troops.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Yes, Robert, yes! I'll play Napoleon!''
</P>
<P>
   So, on Oct. 3, also on TNT, you'll hear Stewart as the voice of
Napoleon the pig in Halmi's version of ``Animal Farm.''
</P>
<P>
   _ As a college course, ``The History of Sex'' might have a
waiting list longer than a starlet's eyelashes. Next month, The
History Channel is hoping for that kind of response to its
five-part series of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The History Channel has discovered sex, and
Charles Maday, who oversees its historical documentaries, says
viewers can expect to see some naughty bits on ``The History of
Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were careful not to use a lot of moving images that were
very sexually explicit,'' Maday told TV critics gathered in
Pasadena on Saturday. ``(But) there are explicit drawings, there
are explicit scenes, some artwork. ... It's probably more explicit
than anything I've seen on public television or Discovery or A&AMP;E.''
</P>
<P>
   James Petersen, author of ``The Century of Sex: Playboy's
History of the Sexual Revolution'' and a contributor to the series,
put it in context for regular viewers of The History Channel. ``You
will be watching five hours of History Channel,'' he said, ``and
see only one exploding battleship.''
</P>
<P>
   No word on whether the exploding battleship is metaphorical.
``The History of Sex'' will air Aug 16-20.
</P>
<P>
   _ If ``The History of Sex'' fails to cover recent developments
in politics, Comedy Central's got it covered. Having earned its
stripes in the 1992 and '96 presidential campaigns, the network
that smirks will dispatch a team of correspondents for its
``Indecision 2000'' initiative. Asked to evaluate Republican
front-runner George W. Bush, team member Jon Stewart, who hosts
``The Daily Show,'' said, ``When we find out what George W. Bush is
really about, he's going to make Clinton look like a scoutmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart added that, while Clinton might be remembered for his
creative use of tobacco products, Bush is the type to use
``exploding cigars.''
</P>
<P>
   _ With arch-conservative Pat Buchanan back in the presidential
race, CNN's ``Crossfire'' has dropped him from its panel and
replaced him with Repubican loyalist Mary Matalin, prompting
arch-liberal Bill Press to issue this welcome. ``I don't think we
could have done any better than finding Mary Matalin to fill Pat's
seat. Mary's got the three qualities that are absolutely essential
for the show: She is smart, she is sassy and she is dead wrong on
all the issues.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CORTONA, Italy _ A loud voice pierced the dreamy stillness of
Frances Mayes' rose-and-lavender-filled Tuscan garden. ``Is this
the house?'' an American tourist hollered up from the iron gate
below. With sudden awe, he added, ``Is that Ed?''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Mayes, the husband of Frances Mayes, the author of two
best-selling memoirs about restoring their villa in Tuscany,
politely made his way down a steep path lined with grapevines where
the unexpected visitor, Les, a film teacher from Syracuse, and
three friends stood waiting. One of the men fell to his knees and
performed a mock salaam.
</P>
<P>
   Les from Syracuse excitedly yelled at his cringing girlfriend to
get the camera, and then turned back to explain the intrusion. ``We
came to Tuscany for one reason,'' he said. ``To search out this
house.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Mayes signed their copies of her book on the road
outside her gate, Les pursued his vicarious intimacy with Ed.
(``Ed, do you still have the Alfa?'' he asked. Mayes, nonplused,
explained he had replaced it with a newer model.)
</P>
<P>
   The visitors craned for a better look at Bramasole, the
apricot-colored 18th-century villa below an Etruscan wall, the
center of the odyssey that turned a middle-aged creative writing
teacher at San Francisco State University into a best-selling
author and cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   She said her role model is the French novelist Colette, and
quotes Octavio Paz and Homer in her books. She bristles at
analogies to Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't identify with her particularly, except that I've
always loved houses,'' Mrs. Mayes said in her soft Georgia way.
``The metaphor of the house as the self.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day in the high season, 30 to 40 tourists, Americans, and
also devotees from Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and other
countries, stop at the iron gates, hungry to savor her lyrical
account of replastering walls, beams, clearing ivy, cajoling
Italian contractors and finding the perfect olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   In the central square of the Renaissance hill town of Cortona,
two miles away, acolytes retrace Mrs. Mayes' shopping route the way
medieval pilgrims once followed the Stations of the Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Tuscan Sun'' was published in 1996 (Broadway). This
year's sequel, ``Bella Tuscany,'' (Broadway) is a travel memoir
that includes descriptions of Venice and Sicily. Mrs. Mayes' books
do not try for sophisticated analysis of Italian culture. (``I
don't understand why the Mafia can't be stopped,'' she wrote in
Sicily.)
</P>
<P>
   Rather, crammed with her musings, descriptions of waxing stone
floors, gardening and recipes for bruschetta and wild mushroom
lasagna, the books read like a poetic home improvement magazine.
Even prosaic Italian words like armadio, which means closet, are
lovingly italicized.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mayes' discovery of Cortona has done for Tuscany what Peter
Mayle's best-selling books about Provence did for the south of
France.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mayes and Mayle are often compared, and sometimes confused
(Mrs. Mayes said she recently got a fan letter addressed to Frances
Mayle) but they have never met.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mayes said she sat two tables away from him at a recent
book fair in Nice, France. ``He never looked my way,'' she said.
``I thought it was very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Tuscan Sun'' has sold more than 900,000 copies, and
the sequel is now on The New York Times' best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Her books have prompted many copycat books, including ``The
Hills of Tuscany,'' (Albatross Publishing, 1998) by Ferenc Mate, a
painter and a writer from New York who bought and fixed up a villa
near Montepulciano (about 30 miles southwest of Cortona), and
``Private Tuscany,'' a coffee-table book about the interiors of
villas of aristocrats and fashion designers written by Elizabeth
Helman Minchilli, an American writer who lives in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   This American fixation with crumbling villas and recipes for
toasted bread delights and bewilders Cortona's 23,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bramasole is a nice house, but it has no real architectural
significance,'' said Emmanuele Rachini, mayor of Cortona, which
boasts art works by Fra Angelico and Luca Signorelli, a Renaissance
cathedral and admirers like Montesquieu and Henry James. ``I
haven't read Mrs. Mayes' book, but I am told it discusses very
nicely the atmosphere here, our people and our way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Under the Tuscan Sun'' and its sequel have been
translated into 14 languages. English, French, German and Dutch
editions are in every bookstore window in Cortona. Mrs. Mayes said
she was in negotiations for an Italian-language edition, but so
far, no contract has been signed. Many major Italian publishing
houses turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear Americans are now crazy about Italian coffee and can
tell the difference between olive oil from Umbria and Le Marche,''
said Marco Vigevani, editorial director for fiction and nonfiction
at Mondadori, Italy's largest publishing house. ``But it is
difficult for us Italians to see Tuscans as exotic animals.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Italian readers would be more interested in a similar
memoir of New England. ``I should commission an Italian writer to
do an `Under the Vermont Snow,''' Vigevani said wryly.
</P>
<P>
   His version would highlight leaf-peeping (sbirciare le foglie)
and varieties of maple syrup (sciroppo d'acero).
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Mayes' books tap another American obsession besides
lifestyle: midlife crisis. Mrs. Mayes, who is in her 50s, decided
to buy a house in Tuscany after a long marriage ended in a bitter
divorce. Using her settlement, she bought the house with her new
boyfriend, Ed Kleinschmidt, a younger poetry teacher at San
Francisco State University, where they both still teach. After
their marriage in the spring of 1998, he took her surname.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a big change in midlife, and a lot of people,
especially women, find themselves stuck _ they enjoy reading about
someone making a big change,'' Mrs. Mayes said.
</P>
<P>
   Her most ardent fans are middle-aged divorced women who
fantasize about such a triumphant second act.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has been reading `Under the Tuscan Sun' to me in the
car as we drive,'' Alexander Cherney, 71, a tourist from Montreal,
said a bit wearily as he sat in a cafe. ``But we did find a good
recipe in there for pasta with pancetta and porcini mushrooms.''

PHYSICAL CLUES LEAVE LITTLE DOUBT   ABOUT PLANE'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A wheel. A headrest. A piece of support. As the weekend wore on,
the different pieces of airplane that washed ashore on Martha's
Vineyard were the sole physical clues to the fate of John F.
Kennedy Jr.'s flight.
</P>
<P>
   But experts in airplane crashes said those bits of debris, and
the radar signals that tracked Kennedy's plane just before it
disappeared Friday night, are enough to confirm a much-feared fact:
that a plane could not have survived such a crash intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're finding the airplane in parts, that means it has
come apart,'' said Arthur Alan Wolk, a Philadelphia pilot and
lawyer who specializes in air crash cases. ``It's no longer a
single airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's plane followed a familiar trajectory as it fell into
the ocean, Wolk said _ so common that air crash investigators have
given it the macabre name ``graveyard spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   It begins, Wolk said, when one wing dips down and the plane no
longer generates upward lift. The nose points downward as the plane
begins to plunge at ever-increasing speed.
</P>
<P>
   To escape such a catastrophic dive, Wolk added, a pilot must try
to level the wings, reduce speed, and lift the nose back above the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy, who had already started his descent toward Martha's
Vineyard, had less than 30 seconds, according to Wolk's
calculations of radar records of the doomed flight, to do all this
before he hit the water _ not enough time to pull out of a steep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   His plane would have been traveling at least 4,500 feet per
minute when it crashed, Wolk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like landing on pavement at that point,'' said Len
Carroll, operations manager at Wiggins Airport in Norwood, Mass..
</P>
<P>
   Finding more debris or any signs of Kennedy, his wife, and
sister-in law might take some time, Carroll said. In similar
crashes off the Martha's Vineyard coast, Carroll said, locating
wreckages has sometimes taken weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Tides and currents can carry debris far from a crash site, he
said. And the depth of the water _ 25 feet to 100 feet _ where
Kennedy's plane is believed to have plunged makes a search more
difficult. From above the water's surface, it is hard to see
objects that have sunk below 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators cautioned Sunday that the search could
take months and that the cause of the crash might never be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop amateur pilots from speculating over what
could have gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Intense discussion has focused on Kennedy's relative
inexperience in the cockpit, the difficult visibility on a hazy,
moonless night and Kennedy's recent upgrade to a more powerful
plane than the one he'd used for flight training.
</P>
<P>
   But Wolk believes the facts, so far, suggest that airplane
malfunction was as likely a potential cause of the crash as pilot
error.
</P>
<P>
   A sudden change in altitude after a seemingly normal flight
could indicate, Wolk said, one of several mechanical errors: a
malfunction of the autopilot, the ``artificial horizon'' that feeds
information to the autopilot, or the vacuum pumps that drive the
plane's gyroscopic information.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these small planes have a long history of malfunction
of various components,'' Wolk said. Kennedy's plane may have
crashed, he said, because of ``something that suddenly overcame
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll said physical malfunctions are far less common than
pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanical things don't happen a lot,'' he said. ``Most of
it's something a pilot does.''

 &HT;    Meltdown at the 72nd hole
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ When they mention Carnoustie 1999 far
into the next century, the reference point won't be that high,
punishing rough and those narrow fairways after all.
</P>
<P>
   It will be of Jean Van de Velde and the day he became The Claret
Jughead.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Paul Lawrie, the 30-year-old Scot who won the 128th
British Open in a three-way playoff Sunday, is certain to be the
one shortchanged through the years. Carnoustie won't be remembered
as the Open that Lawrie won, but the Open that Frenchman Van de
Velde blew at the 18th hole, with a three-shot lead, through a
comedy of errors unmatched in modern golf history.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde's cluster of pratfalls made Greg Norman's 1996
collapse at the Masters seem a mere hiccup. In the space of 487
yards and about 30 minutes, Van de Velde came forth with a
slapstick display of course management. Needing only a double bogey
to secure the win, Van de Velde instead scored a triple-bogey 7 of
nearly unfathomable proportions, barely tying Lawrie and Justin
Leonard at 6-over-par 290 on a sickening 77 to make a threesome for
the four-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Van de Velde basically lost the tournament once again as
he and Leonard finished at 3-over for the playoff to Lawrie's
even-par. He birdied the 17th and 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie's lasting vision will not be of Lawrie hoisting the
claret jug, but of Van de Velde standing in the burn, his shoes and
socks off, holding up his hands in dismay.
</P>
<P>
   The combatants were as stunned as the gallery at the Carnoustie
Golf Links and a worldwide TV audience, who are still wondering
today why a) Van de Velde would first hit a driver off the 18th tee
with a three-shot lead; and b) choose a 2-iron for his second shot
with 185 yards to carry the water _ regardless how good fo a lie he
drew 0 instead of merely hitting out to the fairway with a wedge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he allowed later, ``I should have laid up. . .It
wasn't something absolutely mad I was trying to do. It just came
out to be a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly composed after the ordeal, the 33-year-old Frenchman
said, able to smile at his misfortune, ``Next time I hit a wedge,
OK, and you all forgive me. . . The thing is, I never stopped
trying. I tried very hard and I gave it my best shot. . . You don't
have to focus on the bad things that happened. There were a lot of
good things that happened this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Not at the 18th. The Frenchman drove wildly to the right rough,
short of Barry Burn; blocking his second shot way right off the
bleachers and into high rough; plunking his third into the burn;
and his fifth into a greenside bunker. Blasting out, he sank a
6-footer to get into the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie, who needed a 4-under back nine in qualifying Monday just
to get into the Open, started the final round 10 shots off the
lead, shooting a closing 67. It was the largest final-round
comeback margin by any player in major championship history.
</P>
<P>
   While it began as a playoff that seemed unlikely to identify any
champion _ all three players drove into the gunch _ only Lawrie
steadied himself. It was all Van de Velde could do to focus after
the nightmare at 18. Leonard never found a rhythm, stunned to be in
the playoff after hitting in the burn at 18 in an attempt for
birdie when it appeared the Frenchman had it clinched.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bad as I feel,'' said Leonard, who was trying to win his
second Open in three years, ``he feels worse. That's tough to have
a lead like that on the last hole and not be able to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Jean had the tournament in his pocket,'' said
Lawrie. ``He chips it down the 18th fairway, hits it on the green,
makes 5, he's the Open champion. . . I'm not here to criticize him.
I feel sorry for him. He really should have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to Van de Velde, the most depressed fellow on the grounds
had to be Craig Parry, who triple-bogeyed the 12th and doubled the
17th. When the Australian holed out from the bunker at the 18th, it
left him a stroke out of the playoff at 7-over.
</P>
<P>
   His own misery notwithstanding, Parry said, ``I was really
feeling for Jean. I could see him throwing the tournament away.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Tiger Woods was not a totally happy camper, either. As
it evolved after all the wackiness of the finish, Woods only would
have needed a 1-under-par 70 to join the playoff. Instead, Woods
could not get a putt to drop all day during a 74 that put him at
10-over 294, tied with Sea Island's Davis Love III, who closed with
a 69.

BARAK SETS 15-MONTH DEADLINE FOR REACHING PEACE ACCORD WITH ARABS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, has set a target
deadline of 15 months for achieving a comprehensive framework for
peace in the Middle East, a timeline chosen in part to dovetail
with the American political calendar and the presidential election,
Israeli officials said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight hours of talks with President Clinton in Washington
on Thursday, Barak told the president of his plans for starting
simultaneous talks with the Palestinians, the Syrians and the
Lebanese, the Israeli officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He specifically discussed the 15-month target with Clinton, and
the president agreed with Barak's ``sense of urgency,'' a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's emphasis on a specific timetable rather than just a
promise of talks was motivated primarily by two factors, his aides
said. In order to get a result from the negotiations, they said, it
is considered vital to establish momentum. Second, in the early
fall of 2000, the presidential election campaign will be reaching
its height, marking the beginning of months of what the Israelis
view as a political ``timeout'' in the United States, when Clinton
would probably lack the clout to influence negotiations
substantially and when attention in the United States would be
diverted from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a maximum of 15 months he will tell the Israeli people, `I
have done my best but it's impossible,' or he will say `We're going
to make it,''' said Gadi Baltyansky, a spokesman for the Israeli
Foreign Ministry who is traveling with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did not necessarily mean that peace treaties with all the
details would actually be signed by September or October of next
year, but rather that the hard compromises with both the
Palestinians and the Syrians would be near to hand, Israeli
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months would be ``enough time'' to assess whether peace
was possible with the president of Syria, Hafez al-Assad,
Baltyansky said. New negotiations with Assad would begin against
the backdrop of nearly four years of talks that broke off in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had also discussed his 15-month timetable with the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, during a telephone call to
Arafat on Friday in which Barak kept him abreast of his meetings
with Clinton, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   By giving a timetable, Barak was setting a stark contrast with
his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, who derided deadlines as
raising unnecessary expectations. Barak was also making a contrast
to the last round of talks with Syria, which dragged on for four
years, with more than 20 shuttle trips by former Secretary of State
Warren Christopher between Israel and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's senior advisers, who will most likely be involved
in the Syrian talks, said in New York, where Barak spent most of
the weekend before a White House dinner Sunday night, that the
prime minister hoped Assad understood that ``speed is of the
essence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, opposition Likud Party members of the Parliament
quickly criticized Barak for defining a time period that could
prove too short for a complex set of negotiations on different
fronts at once.
</P>
<P>
   They said that announcing a time line in advance would give
Israel's neighbors too much leverage, allowing them to resist a
deal until the final weeks and then force Israel to make
unnecessary concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Likud Party members said they were prepared to file a motion of
no-confidence in Barak on Monday because he had spent too much time
traveling to Arab countries and the United States. The motion is
likely to fail since Barak controls a large majority of the
Parliament, but the quick response to the prime minister was seen
as an opening shot by the right-wing opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is setting out to achieve a comprehensive settlement that
would encompass implementing the land-for-security deal signed at
the Wye Plantation, Md., last November, final status arrangements
with the Palestinians that would decide the borders of a
Palestinian entity and an agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has said he will abide by the Wye agreement _
a stipulation laid down by Arafat _ but has also said he would like
to fold the implementation of the Wye accords into the final status
talks which will tackle the toughest issues, including the
disposition of Jerusalem and the right of return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stressing speed and pledging a complex set of talks was not the
only contrast between Barak and Netanyahu. The prime minister flew
from Washington to New York for the weekend Friday afternoon and
cut a different profile from the very public doings of Netanyahu's
time here.
</P>
<P>
   He decided against going to synagogue on Saturday, an event for
Netanyahu that always attracted photographers, sidewalk banter with
the press and diverted traffic for New Yorkers. Asked why Barak was
not attending synagogue, a spokesman told the Israeli press: ``This
is not a public relations trip.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Barak held a Sabbath dinner at the Waldorf
Astoria Hotel, where he was staying. The guests included the
Israeli reporters who accompanied him on his five-day trip to the
United States and officials from the Israeli Policy Forum, a group
formed in 1993 to focus American Jews attention on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu largely ignored the Forum, preferring to invite
officials of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations to his private events.
</P>
<P>
   At two separate back-to-back meetings on Sunday, Barak saw
members of the Conference of Presidents and the Forum at the
Waldorf. Afterwards, leaders of the organizations said that Barak
had stressed the need for unity in the American Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted the American Jewish community to send an
unequivocal message in support of the peace process,'' Michael W.
Sonnenfeldt, the chairman of the Forum, said. Disputes within the
American Jewish community had prevented this unity on the peace
process in the last several years and it was now time to move
forward together, Barak told the group, according to Sonnenfeldt.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference of Presidents has been perceived as supportive of
Netanyahu and its new leader, Ronald S. Lauder, has close ties to
Netanyahu, prompting some nervousness about how the meeting would
go.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But the executive director of the Conference, Malcolm Hoenlein,
said the prime minister was even handed in his comments and had
stressed the need for ``creating an atmosphere'' in the United
States that the Israeli leader considers important to conclude
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also conducted another ritual meeting for a new Israeli
prime minister in New York _ an encounter with the mayor. This
time, the meeting was fraught with senatorial campaign politics
involving Mayor Rudolf Giuliani and the first lady, Hillary Rodham
Clinton. In contrast to the heavy press coverage given to the
meetings between Netanyahu and Guiliani, the meeting between Barak
and the mayor on Sunday was a low-key affair.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said this was in part because Barak did not
want to be seen as paying too much attention to Guiliani, Mrs.
Clinton's potential Republican challenger in next year's Senate
race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, who gave an effusive assessment of his time with
Barak last Thursday, Barak's aides appeared to be pleased, and a
little surprised, at the chemistry between the two leaders. One of
Barak's closest associates said that much of the roughly eight
hours the two leaders spent together was spent closeted alone, and
the remainder with their wives, calling the stretch of time
extraordinary in itself.
</P>
<P>
   The associate put the apparent bonding down to several factors.
The two men, he said, are of a similar age _ Barak is 57, Clinton,
52 _ and both have patience for delving into multiple subjects.
</P>
<P>
   And while he was at Camp David last Thursday night with Clinton,
Barak was able to make one of his key points, his press spokeswoman
Mera Parsi Zadok said.
</P>
<P>
   In recounting some of the history of the Camp David peace talks,
the prime minister was able to tell Clinton that when questions got
too hot between the United States, Israel and Egypt, former
President Jimmy Carter ``bypassed everyone and made things
happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's goals during this trip, Israeli officials have
said, was to establish a rapport with Clinton so that they could
deal with each other person-to-person and not through their staffs.

IN STARTLING TURNAROUND, LAWRIE WINS BRITISH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ It was an astonishing victory, made
possible by a horrific collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely winner of the British Open on Sunday was Paul
Lawrie of Scotland, who started the day 10 strokes off the lead,
but pulled off the greatest final-round comeback ever in a major
championship. The loser was Jean Van de Velde of France, who
started the day with a 5-stroke lead, and who had the tournament
virtually won before he experienced every athlete's worst
nightmare. He succumbed to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Leading by three strokes as he reached the par-4, 18th hole, Van
de Velde did the unfathomable. He triple-bogeyed. He hit bad shots.
He made terrible decisions. And he allowed what should have been
the greatest moment of his career to become the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde's collapse at No. 18 led to a four-hole, three-man
playoff that included Lawrie and Justin Leonard, who nearly won his
second British Open in three years.
</P>
<P>
   With the Scottish gallery cheering on its 30-year-old native
son, Lawrie birdied the final two playoff holes, sending Scotland
into celebration, and ending a bizarre, exciting and unpredictable
week that added to the legend of Carnoustie, one of the world's
most famous and difficult courses.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting even par (17) during the four pressure-packed playoff
holes, Lawrie prevailed by three strokes over Leonard and a
heartbroken Van de Velde, who tied for second.
</P>
<P>
   All three players had finished at 6-over-par 290 for 72 holes,
the tournament's highest winning score since Sam Snead won with a
290 at St. Andrews in 1946. It was the first major championship for
Lawrie, who shot a brilliant final-round 4-under-par 67, and who
became the first Scottish player to win the British Open since
Sandy Lyle in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie's comeback from 10 strokes down was the biggest swing in
the final day of a major since Jackie Burke Jr. won the 1956
Masters, coming from eight strokes down to defeat Ken Venturi, an
amateur, by one shot.
</P>
<P>
   But this tournament will be remembered most for the way Van de
Velde self-destructed at No. 18. A bogey would have been wonderful.
A double-bogey would have worked. But a triple-bogey was shocking.
And while he smiled on the outside and bravely answered questions
when it was over, the pain in his voice told the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next time I'll be better able to handle the pressure,''
said Van de Velde, who has not won a tournament since 1993, and who
had never been in contention before at a major. ``It's difficult,
but there are worse things in life. I read the newspaper like you
all did this morning, and some terrible things are happening to
other people. It's a golf tournament. I gave it my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for many years Van de Velde will replay No. 18 repeatedly in
his mind, and he should have played it differently. Leonard and
Lawrie were already in the clubhouse at 6 over par. Lawrie was at 3
over par, needing only a 6 or better on the par-4, 487-yard hole to
win.
</P>
<P>
   But Van de Velde was shaking, and it showed. His tee shot
drifted more than 20 yards right of the fairway, yet he got a break
when the ball sailed over the water in Barry Burn and landed safely
on dry ground, sitting up on low rough. At this point, Van de Velde
made a crucial strategic error. He could have safely taken a wedge
and chipped back into the fairway, and then hit an approach shot
onto the green, followed by two putts for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he went for the green with a 2-iron. ``I only had 185
yards to carry the water,'' Van de Velde said. ``The ball was lying
so good. Maybe I should have hit a wedge. Next time I hit a wedge,
OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde's 2-iron sailed wildly right, hit the grandstand in
front of the creek, and then ricocheted backward about 25 feet
behind the creek into knee-high rough. Now Van de Velde had real
problems. He still had not cleared the water, and his ball was
buried terribly, limiting the option of pitching into the fairway
with his next shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't go backward,'' Van de Velde said. ``The only thing
I could do was try to go forward. I had to hit it hard. Obviously I
didn't hit it hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
   As the gallery gasped in horror, Van de Velde's next shot flew
weakly out of the deep rough and landed in the water. It was now
clear he could lose the tournament. Leonard rushed to the driving
range to warm up for a possible playoff. And Lawrie, who had been
in the clubhouse for more than 90 minutes, realized that he could
still win as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him hit the grandstand, then chip in the water,'' Lawrie
said. ``Your mind is racing, you don't know what to think.
Obviously, Jean had the tournament in his pocket. He chips it on
the 18th fairway, hits the green, makes 5, he's the Open champion.
I'm not here to criticize him. I feel sorry for him. He really
should have won. Thankfully for me, he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde had to scramble just to make the playoff. With his
third shot at No. 18 in the water, he had two options. He could
either take a penalty stroke and a drop, or avoid the penalty
stroke and play the ball from the water. As the crowd roared, Van
de Velde removed his shoes and socks, raised his pants legs over
his knees and climbed into the water.
</P>
<P>
   It was a remarkable scene, with photographers climbing down the
creek bank trying to take pictures, and marshals trying to control
a huge crowd that had stormed the 18th fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde seriously considered trying to hit a 60-yard pitch
shot from the water onto the green, but as he stepped into the
water, his ball sank lower. ``I could see the ball sinking, telling
me, `Hey you silly man,''' Van de Velde said. ``The ball was
underneath the water 2 inches. There was no hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde was forced to take his drop and penalty stroke,
once again in deep rough about 60 yards from the pin. His pitch
shot cleared the water, but it landed in the front green-side
bunker. If Van de Velde failed to get up and down from there, he
knew he wouldn't even make the playoff. But he hit a nice bunker
shot from about 25 feet that rolled 6 feet past the cup, and then
made the pressure putt to secure his spot in the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All three players started the playoff poorly at No. 15, hitting
drives left of the fairway. Van de Velde's was the worst, and he
hit a provisional second tee shot in case his first shot couldn't
be found. The ball was located, but Van de Velde made a
double-bogey, while Leonard and Lawrie bogeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lawrie took the lead for good at the difficult 17th hole,
hitting a beautiful 4-iron from 225 yards that landed about 25 feet
left of the pin. Lawrie made the putt for birdie to take a 1-stroke
lead, and Van de Velde also made a 26-foot birdie putt at No. 17,
tying him with Leonard, one stroke behind Lawrie as they went to
No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Then Lawrie clinched the title. His drive was in the middle of
the fairway, as was Leonard's. But knowing he probably needed a
birdie to keep the tournament going, Leonard went for the green on
his next shot, but it was short and sailed into the water. Van de
Velde's second shot was short of the water, and then Lawrie ended
the suspense with another terrific 4-iron from 221 yards that
stopped 3 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   As Lawrie walked to the 18th green, his supporters shook the
grandstand with noise. After Leonard and Lawrie both bogeyed,
Lawrie sank the clinching birdie putt, and the fabled claret jug
given to the winner belonged to him.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who won the British Open in 1997 at Royal Troon, will
regret not having played better in the playoff. And he also hit
into the water twice for two bogeys at No. 18 _ once in regulation,
and once in the playoff. But Leonard knew his heartache could not
compare to Van de Velde's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically lost the British Open twice in one day, which is
maybe twice as hard to take,'' said Leonard, who scrambled to a
final-round 72 on Sunday. ``As bad as I feel, Jean feels worse, to
have a lead on that hole and not be able to win. It had to be a
sick feeling for him, in the playoff as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde hoped that one day, he would be in position to win
a major again. But at least on Sunday night he could still find
something to laugh about. ``I made plenty of friends, because a
Scottish man won,'' Van de Velde said. ``At least that's
something.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTIS AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE, Mass. _ After a second day
searching for John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife and sister-in-law,
the Coast Guard announced Sunday that it may have detected a single
`ping' from an emergency beacon in waters off Martha's Vineyard,
where Kennedy is believed to have crashed his single-engine plane
late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The ping, heard late Sunday afternoon by a C-130 plane as it
passed over a field of debris some four-and-a-half miles south of
Aquinnah Beach, seemed to mark a dramatic turning point in what had
otherwise been a long, mostly fruitless day of searching.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials warned they had no way of knowing whether the
signal came from the Kennedy plane, the Rude, a research vessel
equipped with special sonars, was immediately diverted from another
part of the search area to find the source of the signal. And Coast
Guard officials, who maintained all day that they were still
searching for survivors, faced the decision of whether to declare
that rescue is no longer likely. They seemed to be heading in that
direction at dusk, when they announced at a news conference that
the National Transportation Safety Board, the accident
investigation agency, was now in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're searching in the right area,'' said Rear Adm. Richard M.
Larrabee, the Coast Guard commander in Boston. ``Now the question
is how much longer do we search and what are we looking for.''
Referring to questions about whether a search for survivors had
become futile, Larrabee said: ``At some point, the questions that
have been asked today are logical questions. Those are the kinds of
things that we're going to reassess. My sensitivity is to the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hyannis Port, the Kennedy family spent another long day
waiting and praying in their compound of white clapboard houses
overlooking Nantucket Sound. In the morning, three priests arrived
to say a private Mass for family members under the same white tent
where Rory Kennedy was to have been married Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the ceremony, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy could be seen
holding the communion chalice, offering wine to Ethel Kennedy, the
widow of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, their daughter Rory
Kennedy and other family members. In the afternoon, Sen. Kennedy
took several family members for a sail into the Atlantic on his old
blue wooden-hulled sloop, Maya.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I have a hard time deciding whether to refer to
them in the past tense or the present tense,'' John Perry Barlow, a
friend of John Kennedy's for more than 20 years, said late Sunday
afternoon. ``That's very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The family of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister,
Lauren Bessette, 34, also spent the day in seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, President Clinton returned to the White House
from Camp David and gave a short, somber address as his wife and
daughter looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 40 years now the Kennedy family has inspired
Americans to public service, strengthened our faith in the future
and moved our nation forward,'' Clinton said. ``Through it all they
have suffered much, and given more.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering his prayers and support, Clinton added: ``At this
difficult moment, we hope the families of these three fine young
people will feel the strength of God, the love of their friends,
and the prayers of their fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The clues on Saturday had seemed to point toward a rapid
conclusion to the hunt, with luggage and a prescription belonging
to Kennedy's passengers washing ashore on Martha's Vineyard.
Sunday, a plane's insulation and headrest were added to the
catalog, but searchers working by land, air and water found no firm
evidence of the fate of Kennedy, 38; his wife of nearly three
years, or his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that underscored the size and complexity of the
evolving search and accident investigation, a ``unified command''
was established at Otis Air Force base on Cape Cod. The command
included representatives of the Coast Guard, the National
Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration,
the Navy, the Transportation Department, the National Oceanographic
and Atmospheric Administration and a variety of state agencies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   More reinforcements were on the way. A second NOAA survey ship,
the 163-foot Whiting, was diverted from Delaware Bay and was
expected to arrive Monday. A Navy salvage vessel, the Grasp, was
expected to arrive on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard responds to 50,000 distress calls a year, and
rescue officials gamely insisted they were not giving special
treatment to the Kennedys. But in some respects, this search was
different, starting with the tremendous scrutiny from an
international contingent of reporters and photographers and from
the highest levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Coast Guard officials here on Saturday night to
express his concern. Massachusetts Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci called
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The search gave a schizophrenic air to the grassy, rose-rich
island of Martha's Vineyard. Vacationers lapped black raspberry ice
cream and ambled in sandles, while camera crews barged past as they
scrambled for position, and divers prepared for the possible
recovery of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The island's mood was described in a simple message scrawled on
a chalk board overlooking the beaches where the first debris washed
up on Saturday. ``Moshup Beach and Aquinnah Beach our prayers are
with you John-John, Carolyn, Lauren,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Taylor Scherer, 40, who lives in the village of West
Tisbury, walked barefoot on the beaches of Martha's Vineyard
Sunday, but she did not take her usual swim. ``It seems like their
resting place _ not some place I should be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, people here and across the nation were in search of
resolution Sunday. For most of them, none was to be had.
</P>
<P>
   The area of the search seemed to expand and contract and shift
with each new shred of information or rumor.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, after luggage from the Kennedy plane
washed ashore near Philbin Beach at the southwest tip of Martha's
Vineyard, the search area was narrowed to 550-square miles.
</P>
<P>
   But when the search resumed at full force at 5:30 a.m. Sunday,
the Coast Guard sent helicopters, airplanes and a small flotilla of
cutters and inflatable boats across an expanded search zone of
1,200-square miles. Still, Coast Guard officials seemed confident
they would soon find the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer looking for a needle in a haystack,'' Larrabee
of the Coast Guard said at a 9 a.m. briefing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But as the hours ticked past, the searchers met only with
maddening results.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers scoured the dunes and shoreline for more debris with
small all-terrain vehicles. They found nothing. The probed the
ocean floor with ultra-sensitive sonars aboard the Rude, the same
research vessel that had helped locate wreckage off Long Island
from TWA Flight 800. Again, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Private boats and beach-combing tourists grimly joined the
effort in what Larrabee described as a ``tremendous outpouring of
sympathy.'' As Melissa Epstein, a tourist from Brooklyn, wandered
the beach with a friend, their thoughts were very much on the
Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just looking at the cliffs and hoping they find them
safely,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 10 scuba divers was kept on alert in the town of
Menemsha, but the divers sat idle as there was no promising area of
the ocean for them to search.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long tedious job out there, and sometimes it's very
frustrating when they're not hitting anything,'' said one diver,
Sgt. William Freeman of the Massachusetts State Police.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the time comes, Freeman said, the diving team has
the ability, using inflatable bags, to lift from the depths a plane
the size of Kennedy's, a single-engine Piper Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Though the water temperature was a chilly 68 degrees _ making
survival a remote possibility, especially since the plane was not
equipped with a life raft _ Coast Guard officials pressed on
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they said, survival statistics show that the average person
cannot withstand more than 12 hours in such water. And yes, they
said, the statistics gave little reason for comfort after a second
day with no sign of life.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, said Larrabee early Sunday, ``We have all read
miraculous stories of people surviving under these types of
conditions, and that's what gives us hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the going was slow. The Rude began searching at 7 p.m. on
Saturday night. By mid afternoon Sunday, it had completed a
painstaking sweep of just five square miles.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, after the local harbormaster ran computer
models of how wreckage might be affected by winds and tides, Capt.
Robert Bird, a spokesman for the state police, announced that his
agency was focusing its search in the waters around Nomans Island,
which is about three miles south of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   But by noon, the searchers had very little to show for their
efforts. Three miles south of Martha's Vineyard, they recovered a
headrest, like the one that washed ashore on Saturday. A fuel slick
was spotted far outside the primary search area, but it was quickly
discounted as having any connection to the Kennedy plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not find a lot,'' Larrabee glumly reported at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, word came of the day's first significant finding
_ bits of foam insulation that were scattered over a mile of beach.
Bird said the insulation was ``consistent'' with insulation that
would surround an airplane cockpit. In response to a reporter's
question, he acknowledged the obvious: That it likely would take an
impact of great force to produce such debris.
</P>
<P>
   But with the detection of the ping at about 3:45 P.M., the tone
shifted rapidly from official words of hope to outright
resignation. James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, for one, began his first press briefing late Sunday
afternoon by saying, ``I deeply regret having to come before you on
such a difficult case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone was any talk of miracles. Hall introduced Robert Pearce,
the NTSB investigator appointed to lead the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, a former military pilot who has investigated hundreds of
crashes involving small planes during his seven years with the
NTSB, offered new details about Kennedy's flight.
</P>
<P>
   After taking off at 8:38 p.m. without incident from Essex County
Airport in Fairfield, N.J., Kennedy's plane was tracked on radar as
it climbed to 5,600 feet passing north of the Teterboro Airport in
New Jersey, and then heading east toward Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:26 p.m., the craft was west of Rhode Island, and still at
5,600 feet, though it soon began to descend. At 9:40 p.m., when it
was 17 or 18 miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport, the plane
was at 2,500 feet. Over the next 29 seconds, it dropped another 700
feet, a rate of descent that Pearce said was ``within the
airplane's capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, with the plane still 16 miles from the airport,
radars lost contact. Pearce explained that the plane was below an
altitude where it could be detected by radar.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he expected the investigation to be completed within
nine months. In addition to examining radar data, NTSB
investigators were interviewing those familiar with Kennedy's
flying abilities, reviewing weather data and pulling all
maintenance records associated with the craft, though there were no
immediate indications of mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the very beginning stages of what will be a
painstaking, detailed investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But veteran pilots repeatedly speculated that Kennedy, a
relatively inexperienced pilot, may have crashed after losing his
visual orientation in the haze and darkness over Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning that such speculation can be hurtful for family
members, Hall asked people to refrain from hasty conclusions about
the cause of the plane's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is simple,'' Hall said. ``At this point we do not
know. We will not know for some time. There is even a possibility
we will never know.''

BARAK SETS 15-MONTH DEADLINE FOR REACHING PEACE ACCORD WITH ARABS

 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, has set a target
deadline of 15 months for achieving a comprehensive framework for
peace in the Middle East, a timeline chosen in part to dovetail
with the American political calendar and the presidential election,
Israeli officials said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight hours of talks with President Clinton in Washington
on Thursday, Barak told the president of his plans for starting
simultaneous talks with the Palestinians, the Syrians and the
Lebanese, the Israeli officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He specifically discussed the 15-month target with Clinton, and
the president agreed with Barak's ``sense of urgency,'' a senior
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's emphasis on a specific timetable rather than just a
promise of talks was motivated primarily by two factors, his aides
said. In order to get a result from the negotiations, they said, it
is considered vital to establish momentum. Second, in the early
fall of 2000, the presidential election campaign will be reaching
its height, marking the beginning of months of what the Israelis
view as a political ``timeout'' in the United States, when Clinton
would probably lack the clout to influence negotiations
substantially and when attention in the United States would be
diverted from the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a maximum of 15 months he will tell the Israeli people, `I
have done my best but it's impossible,' or he will say `We're going
to make it,''' said Gadi Baltyansky, a spokesman for the Israeli
Foreign Ministry who is traveling with Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did not necessarily mean that peace treaties with all the
details would actually be signed by September or October of next
year, but rather that the hard compromises with both the
Palestinians and the Syrians would be near to hand, Israeli
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months would be ``enough time'' to assess whether peace
was possible with the president of Syria, Hafez al-Assad,
Baltyansky said. New negotiations with Assad would begin against
the backdrop of nearly four years of talks that broke off in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had also discussed his 15-month timetable with the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, during a telephone call to
Arafat on Friday in which Barak kept him abreast of his meetings
with Clinton, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   By giving a timetable, Barak was setting a stark contrast with
his predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, who derided deadlines as
raising unnecessary expectations. Barak was also making a contrast
to the last round of talks with Syria, which dragged on for four
years, with more than 20 shuttle trips by former Secretary of State
Warren Christopher between Israel and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's senior advisers, who will most likely be involved
in the Syrian talks, said in New York, where Barak spent most of
the weekend before a White House dinner Sunday night, that the
prime minister hoped Assad understood that ``speed is of the
essence.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, opposition Likud Party members of the Parliament
quickly criticized Barak for defining a time period that could
prove too short for a complex set of negotiations on different
fronts at once.
</P>
<P>
   They said that announcing a time line in advance would give
Israel's neighbors too much leverage, allowing them to resist a
deal until the final weeks and then force Israel to make
unnecessary concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Likud Party members said they were prepared to file a motion of
no-confidence in Barak on Monday because he had spent too much time
traveling to Arab countries and the United States. The motion is
likely to fail since Barak controls a large majority of the
Parliament, but the quick response to the prime minister was seen
as an opening shot by the right-wing opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is setting out to achieve a comprehensive settlement that
would encompass implementing the land-for-security deal signed at
the Wye Plantation, Md., last November, final status arrangements
with the Palestinians that would decide the borders of a
Palestinian entity and an agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has said he will abide by the Wye agreement _
a stipulation laid down by Arafat _ but has also said he would like
to fold the implementation of the Wye accords into the final status
talks which will tackle the toughest issues, including the
disposition of Jerusalem and the right of return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stressing speed and pledging a complex set of talks was not the
only contrast between Barak and Netanyahu. The prime minister flew
from Washington to New York for the weekend Friday afternoon and
cut a different profile from the very public doings of Netanyahu's
time here.
</P>
<P>
   He decided against going to synagogue on Saturday, an event for
Netanyahu that always attracted photographers, sidewalk banter with
the press and diverted traffic for New Yorkers. Asked why Barak was
not attending synagogue, a spokesman told the Israeli press: ``This
is not a public relations trip.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, Barak held a Sabbath dinner at the Waldorf
Astoria Hotel, where he was staying. The guests included the
Israeli reporters who accompanied him on his five-day trip to the
United States and officials from the Israeli Policy Forum, a group
formed in 1993 to focus American Jews attention on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu largely ignored the Forum, preferring to invite
officials of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations to his private events.
</P>
<P>
   At two separate back-to-back meetings on Sunday, Barak saw
members of the Conference of Presidents and the Forum at the
Waldorf. Afterwards, leaders of the organizations said that Barak
had stressed the need for unity in the American Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted the American Jewish community to send an
unequivocal message in support of the peace process,'' Michael W.
Sonnenfeldt, the chairman of the Forum, said. Disputes within the
American Jewish community had prevented this unity on the peace
process in the last several years and it was now time to move
forward together, Barak told the group, according to Sonnenfeldt.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference of Presidents has been perceived as supportive of
Netanyahu and its new leader, Ronald S. Lauder, has close ties to
Netanyahu, prompting some nervousness about how the meeting would
go.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But the executive director of the Conference, Malcolm Hoenlein,
said the prime minister was even handed in his comments and had
stressed the need for ``creating an atmosphere'' in the United
States that the Israeli leader considers important to conclude
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also conducted another ritual meeting for a new Israeli
prime minister in New York _ an encounter with the mayor. This
time, the meeting was fraught with senatorial campaign politics
involving Mayor Rudolf Giuliani and the first lady, Hillary Rodham
Clinton. In contrast to the heavy press coverage given to the
meetings between Netanyahu and Guiliani, the meeting between Barak
and the mayor on Sunday was a low-key affair.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said this was in part because Barak did not
want to be seen as paying too much attention to Guiliani, Mrs.
Clinton's potential Republican challenger in next year's Senate
race in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, who gave an effusive assessment of his time with
Barak last Thursday, Barak's aides appeared to be pleased, and a
little surprised, at the chemistry between the two leaders. One of
Barak's closest associates said that much of the roughly eight
hours the two leaders spent together was spent closeted alone, and
the remainder with their wives, calling the stretch of time
extraordinary in itself.
</P>
<P>
   The associate put the apparent bonding down to several factors.
The two men, he said, are of a similar age _ Barak is 57, Clinton,
52 _ and both have patience for delving into multiple subjects.
</P>
<P>
   And while he was at Camp David last Thursday night with Clinton,
Barak was able to make one of his key points, his press spokeswoman
Mera Parsi Zadok said.
</P>
<P>
   In recounting some of the history of the Camp David peace talks,
the prime minister was able to tell Clinton that when questions got
too hot between the United States, Israel and Egypt, former
President Jimmy Carter ``bypassed everyone and made things
happen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's goals during this trip, Israeli officials have
said, was to establish a rapport with Clinton so that they could
deal with each other person-to-person and not through their staffs.

ALL NORMAL WITH KENNEDY FLIGHT _ UNTIL A SUDDEN DESCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just after dusk on Friday, John F. Kennedy Jr., hobbled by a
broken foot, limped to the flight line of a small airport in
Fairfield, N.J. to inspect his Piper Saratoga HP airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied with the plane's condition, Kennedy eased himself into
the left pilot's seat and prepared for the routine 125-mile flight
to an airport near his late mother's homestead on Martha's
Vineyard. His wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her older sister,
Lauren Bessette, climbed aboard the six-seat plane.
</P>
<P>
   The engine turned. The instruments came to life. Within minutes,
the powerful single-engine plane roared down Runway 22 and climbed
into the hazy evening sky.
</P>
<P>
   No one has seen it since.
</P>
<P>
   Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine, the series of
decisions Kennedy made that night _ flying a complex aircraft
without a flight plan, choosing not to have his flight instructor
accompany him in marginal weather conditions, and piloting an
airplane with a foot injury _ have grown in significance against
the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way
just off Aquinnah, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Piper Saratoga vanished from radar screens after a rapid
descent at 9:38 p.m. Friday, about an hour into his flight and
about 17 miles away from Martha's Vineyard airport. Sunday,
searchers recovered bits of the aircraft's fuselage and interior;
on Saturday, they had found a wheel strut and a piece of canvas
luggage with one of Lauren Bissette's business cards attached.
</P>
<P>
   While Kennedy had not mastered all the intricacies of the
plane's equipment, officials hope he was familiar with at least
one: the cockpit voice recording equipment that had been installed
in the Saratoga by its first owner in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy on-off switch,'' said Munir Hussein, its second
owner, who sold the plane to Kennedy through a broker in April for
$300,000. ``I used it several times and it worked perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the recorder, which captures the words of a
pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit, can shed
light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29
seconds and apparently plunge into the Atlantic Ocean just off
Aquinnah, known as Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   The details of what happened in the hour before Kennedy's plane
disappeared may not be known until _ or unless _ the aircraft is
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators do know the flight seemed routine until the
very end, according to the review of radar tapes from at least a
half-dozen Federal Aviation Adminsitration facilities along the
south coast of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had intended to make a daytime flight Friday, but was
delayed when his sister-in-law couldn't leave work early enough,
and he encountered traffic coming out of New York, the Associated
Press quoted a friend as saying. But family friends told the Globe
they believed Kennedy had planned to leave when he did.
</P>
<P>
   After takeoff, Kennedy cruised eastward, flying at 5,500 feet, a
standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight
rules, procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly
by what they can see.
</P>
<P>
   As he flew through gathering darkness, only a few stars emerged
through the haze, and a slim crescent moon glowed in the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Two other pilots familiar with Kennedy's flight experience _
fewer than 100 hours of time alone _ shook their heads as his plane
lifted off. They knew that Kennedy was learning to fly the Saratoga
by instruments alone, but that he wasn't yet qualified to do it on
a solo flight.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kennedy told a business associate in Canada last Monday
that for the time being, he'd rather fly with a copilot because his
broken foot made it difficult for him to operate pedals controlling
the plane's rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Radar stations along the southern New England coast tracked the
plane. But because Kennedy chose not to file an official flight
plan, and had no contact with air-traffic controllers after leaving
New Jersey, no one knew his precise route _ or that he was piloting
the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Morningstar, a private pilot and spokesman for the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said it was not unusual for
a pilot to fly without filing a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morningstar said, ``a flight plan is really an insurance
policy, not an air traffic control document.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would a VFR flight plan have started search and rescue
earlier?'' he said. ``Yes, it probably would have.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most of Kennedy's flight, everything went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:39, nearly an hour after it had taken off from New Jersey,
Kennedy's plane was about 10 minutes away from the Martha's
Vineyard airport when it began a sudden and steady descent. Over
the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped 700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It then disappeared from all radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Sunday that the air controllers at the
Martha's Vineyard airport did not realize that Kennedy's plane was
overdue until sometime Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The air-traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard airport was
scheduled to leave at 10 p.m. Friday, and the airport's runway
lights were dimmed. To brighten them, an approaching pilot must
tune his or her radio to the tower frequency and click the
microphone five times in five seconds, or seven times in seven
seconds to reach their maximum wattage.
</P>
<P>
   Until the plane's sudden drop, the radar tapes from the FAA
facility used to guide planes in and out of T.F. Green Airport
airspace in Rhode Island indicate a normal flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plot on him, we were able to determine which plane
was his and he was flying at 5,500 feet,'' said Howard Barte, the
controller's union local president in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came within 17 miles west of Martha's Vineyard, and then in
the last few minutes he seemed to descend rather steeply for that
airplane. The last hit was at 1,800 feet and then we lost contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just over the last couple of minutes of the flight that
this happened,'' Barte said. ``Maybe in five more minutes he would
have contacted the Martha's Vineyard tower and begun his descent,
but this rate of descent was not normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see something like this, you have to ask: Was there
something wrong with the plane, or with the pilot? Because that is
all there is.''

SPECULATION ARISES OVER FUTURE OF GEORGE MAGAZINE
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: KENNEDY-RDP, KENNEDY-PILOT, KENNEDY-VIGIL,
KENNEDY-VOICES, KENNEDY-TV, KENNEDY-MAGS-REACT, KENNEDY-COLUMN) 
(sw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of question on peoples' minds is what will happen
to George, the political magazine John F. Kennedy Jr. founded and
built into a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Kennedy had been seen at the offices of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. where, an executive close to the talks said,
he was discussing with advisers strategic options for the magazine.
In particular, the executive said, Kennedy was interested in
finding a financial partner and had come up with a list of
companies he was interested in approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Since last spring, there have been rumors about what would
happen to George once the publishing contract between Paris-based
Hachette Filipacchi and Kennedy's Random Ventures expired at the
end of this year. It was reported then that Kennedy had met with
the chief executive of Conde Nast, Steven T. Florio, among others.
But more recently, the executive said, Kennedy had expanded his
universe of potential possible investors, including Henry Kravis, a
partner at the leveraged-buyout firm of Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of advertising and circulation, George is not faring
well. Total advertising pages have declined precipitously, falling
by nearly one-third, to 247 for the first six months of this year,
compared with 360 for the first six months of 1998, according to
the Publishers Information Bureau. And newsstand sales of copies _
the closely monitored gauge of public enthusiasm for a magazine _
fell by 28.2 percent, to 90,867 copies an issue, in the last six
months of 1998. During that same period, total paid circulation
dropped 5 percent, to 405,894.
</P>
<P>
   From its debut in 1995 until earlier this year, George had an
enthusiastic supporter in David J. Pecker, who was the president
and chief executive officer of Hachette Filipacchi, the company
that publishes the magazine. But Pecker left Hachette in March, and
executives there say that his replacement, Jack Kliger, has not
been as confident in George or in Kennedy's skills as a journalist.
Kliger, through a spokesman, declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Still the mere appearance of Kennedy always guaranteed an
infusion of publicity, which is more than most magazines can expect
from an editor in chief. In March, at a press conference to
announce that the former New York Republican senator, Alfonse
D'Amato, would serve as a George advice columnist, Kennedy caused a
flurry in the press when he floated the possibility that he might
run for mayor of New York City. And in May, he again attracted a
healthy round of publicity when he invited Larry Flynt, the
publisher of Hustler magazine, to sit at the George magazine table
at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.

`UNIFIED COMMAND' TIGHTENS FLOW OF NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after 6 p.m. Sunday, Massachusetts State Police appeared
at Martha's Vineyard Airport to announce that they had clamped shut
the information spigot for a throng of reporters covering the
search for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very limited in what I can tell you now,'' said Captain
Robert Bird, the State Police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The task of controlling the flow of information had just been
handed to the National Transportation Safety Board, which had
earlier briefed news media from around the globe at Otis Air Force
Base on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   To some reporters on the ground, the sudden shutdown on news
from the omnipresent Bird seemed to be the result of an Alexander
Haig-like grab for control by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Bird, whose 24 hours on Martha's Vineyard beginning
Saturday afternoon was one of his longest days as a press liaison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual. They're invoking the so-called unified
command system,'' Bird said. ``They're the agency mandated by the
federal government to investigate all aircraft crashes, so it's
just natural.''
</P>
<P>
   But as natural as that transition may have been, alternative
sources of information all but dried up with the arrival of the
NTSB. When the nation woke Saturday to learn that Kennedy's plane
was overdue and had possibly crashed at sea, official-speak from
the US Air Force to the US Coast Guard to small Vineyard police
departments was being fed at irregular intervals to the gathering
news horde.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters became confused, and questions over who had the best
information _ and where that would be disseminated _ became even
more clouded when Bird co-directed a news conference Saturday
evening with Michael O'Keefe, first assistant district attorney for
the Cape and Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Although the district attorney's office will become involved if
and when bodies are recovered, O'Keefe's presence at the news
briefing prompted questions about whether the incident was being
used to promote his career.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe could not be reached for comment Sunday night, but Bird
stressed that the prosecutor's participation was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief from Gay Head and the chief from West Tisbury were
grateful to have me speak to the press,'' Bird said. ``And then the
DA and I did that press conference together Saturday evening. He
had been here all day and I hadn't, so it was just very natural.
Everything was a cooperative effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird, who updated the progress of this excruciating
investigation for news outlets worldwide, said he had never before
faced the volume of reporters that converged on Martha's Vineyard
over the weekend. As a result, Bird became the name and face that _
for one day _ told the story to news organizations worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't change the job we do,'' Bird said, just before he
headed off-island and handed the communication baton to the NTSB.

KENNEDY ON CRUTCHES DURING BUSINESS MEETING LAST WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. hobbled on crutches and admitted to being
shy when he met with a Toronto businessman in Canada last week.
</P>
<P>
   But to the businessman, Keith Stein, those scarely seemed
liabilities for this handsome young pilot with a promising future.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, Stein met with Kennedy in Toronto to discuss a
possible deal involving the purchase of shares in ``George''
magazine, which Kennedy published.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a co-pilot, Kennedy flew the same Piper
Saratoga II HP to Toronto that disappeared off the coast of
Martha's Vineyard Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stein said Kennedy, who had recently broken his foot in a
paragliding accident, said he used a copilot because ``he needed
help with the pedals because of his foot.''
</P>
<P>
   When he picked Kennedy up at the airport, Stein said he told
Kennedy that he would not need his crutches because it was only a
few short steps from the car to the restaurant where they would
have lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said Kennedy insisted on bringing his crutches anyway,
and tossed them in the back of Stein's car.
</P>
<P>
   During the next four or five hours _ in the car, during lunch
and over milkshakes _ Stein said he and Kennedy discussed George
magazine and the life of its famous young publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Stein said Kennedy was unhappy with his original investment
partner in ``George'' and was interested in other ownership
arrangements. But Kennedy did not want to sell any of his personal
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also talked about the paragliding accident that left him
with a broken foot, Stein said. Kennedy told Stein that he had
angered his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, by taking off from a
place she did not consider safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little reckless and broke his foot by ignoring her
advice,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Nontheless, Stein added, Kennedy's future seemed wrapped up with
hers. He ``sort of alluded to having kids,'' Stein said, and talked
about ``how he and his wife dream of someday escaping New York.''

COMMENTARY: IS LIFE UNFAIR? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Life is unfair,'' said President John F. Kennedy
when asked about the resentment that reservists, who had ``done
their time,'' felt about being called up for Vietnam service.
</P>
<P>
   In his most philosophical extemporaneous comment, he ruminated
aloud: ``There is always inequity in life. Some men are killed in a
war and some men are wounded, and some men never leave the country.
... It's very hard in military or personal life to assure complete
equality. Life is unfair. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Kennedy family saga has been marked by more than
its share of violent tragedy. Joe, the eldest son, died a World War
II combat hero; John and Robert were felled by assassins; and Ted's
life was marred by the accidental death at Chappaquiddick, from
which he has spent the last 30 years redeeming himself both in
politics and as the binding patriarch of the Kennedy clan.
</P>
<P>
   In light of all that suffering, Ted Kennedy once wondered if a
curse had been laid upon the family. Ever since, whenever death or
shame rained on one of its many members, ``the Kennedy curse'' was
evoked. As dynasty was denied, writers likened the series of
national and personal disasters to Shakespearean dramas, while
clergy turned to passages from the Book of Job.
</P>
<P>
   That seeming curse pervaded the media coverage of the search for
the missing plane with John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife and her
sister, and of the sad vigil at the famed Kennedy compound. Fusing
this tragedy to all the others accentuated its historic resonance.
Not just did a famous man and his accomplished companions, the
Bessettes, die, but the Kennedy dream seemed to have died again.
All the what-ifs returned.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe in curses or any other form of predestination.
Owning the Hope diamond or opening King Tut's tomb brought nobody
bad luck. Allowing for genetic breaks, we are free to make much of
our own fate.
</P>
<P>
   This accident was apparently brought on by a lack of judgment.
If what we know is true, a pilot with one year's experience and a
recently broken ankle tried to fly over an expanse of black water
on a foggy night. Other pilots say that's taking an unnecessary
risk.
</P>
<P>
   To confront this fact draws the anguished ire of some of his
good friends, which is understandable in an emotion-laden moment.
</P>
<P>
   But I recall an article by the New York Times columnist Tom
Wicker, long, long ago, entitled ``Kennedy Without Tears.'' In it,
he passed over the sentiment that befogged so many assessments of
JFK to deal realistically with the gains and pains of his brief
administration.
</P>
<P>
   To me, that carried more weight _ and more instruction about the
use of an appealingly cool style to shape substance _ than all the
press panegyrics about special grace or misty memories of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
   Now a lost destiny is being imposed on his son. ``He was more
than our `Prince Charming,' as the New York tabs called him,''
writes Jonathan Alter in Newsweek. ``We etched the past and the
future on his fine face.'' And: ``he wore his royalty lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine face he surely had, handsomer than his father's, with
less of its cool detachment. I hear he had a good mind and an easy
acceptance of inherited fame. Newsweek now reports he was
considering a run for the New York Senate seat until Hillary beat
him to it. (If he had been serious, that would have been some
Democratic primary.) But the reference to royalty, with no irony,
reminds us that we have no American royalty, nor will celebrity
roll out the carpet to any Restoration.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr. deserves better from the media than the
Princess Di treatment. Will no friend or loyalist do a new
``Kennedy Without Tears''?
</P>
<P>
   He started a magazine, ``George,'' that earned a readership and
employed people, even Republicans. He took a serious look at
political unseriousness and upset his clan from time to time.
Taking only sensible risks, he might have become an important
publisher or a genuine leader.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not fall victim to any ``Kennedy curse.'' The
icon-busting Book of Job teaches that God does not micromanage the
universe, and that free-willed human beings are responsible for
actions and injustices. That's why life is unfair.
</P>

CONE PITCHES A PERFECT GAME TO BEAT THE EXPOS 6-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBA-CONE-HIGHLIGHTS, BBA-YANKS-CONE, BBA-RHODEN-COLUMN,
BBA-YANKS-PLAY) 
(th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an improbable setting, David Cone performed an
improbable feat Sunday. He pitched the Yankees' second perfect game
in little more than a year, playing in front of Don Larsen, who
pitched a perfect World Series game for the Yankees in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen was at Yankee Stadium to help celebrate Yogi Berra Day,
and after Larsen threw the ceremonial first pitch to Berra, Cone
took command of the mound and retired all 27 Montreal batters he
faced as the Yankees clubbed the Expos, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Following David Wells' perfect game against Minnesota by one
year, two months and one day, Cone made the Yankees the first team
to pitch perfect games in successive seasons. He also became the
first pitcher to pitch an interleague no-hitter in the three-year
history of interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably have a better chance of winning the lottery than
this happening today,'' an exuberant Cone said. ``What an honor.
All the Yankee legends here. Don Larsen in the park. Yogi Berra
Day. It makes you stop and think about the Yankee magic and the
mystique of this ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   When the popup lofted by Orlando Cabrera, the ninth batter in
the Expos' lineup, on Cone's 88th pitch of the day descended softly
into Scott Brosius' glove just on the foul side of the third base
line for the 27th out, Cone dropped to his knees and grabbed his
head, ``in disbelief,'' he said later. Joe Girardi, the catcher,
was the first to reach him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just put a bear hug on him and took him down,'' Cone said.
``I didn't want to let go. Somebody dragged me off him. I wasn't
going to let go. That's how good I felt about Joe Girardi and what
he means to me not only professionally but personally.''
</P>
<P>
   After hugs and high-fives all around, Girardi, Chuck Knoblauch
and Chili Davis hoisted Cone into the air and carried him toward
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the roar of the crowd of 41,930, Cone thrusting
first his right hand holding his cap into the air and then his left
with his glove still on it.
</P>
<P>
   When the 36-year-old right-hander reached Manager Joe Torre's
office, he was handed the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boomer's on the phone,'' Cone related, meaning Wells, with
whom he became close as teammates. ``He welcomed me to the club and
said he was going to fly in and party with me tonight so I'm
expecting him any minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the previous 15 perfect games, including Larsen's, the only
one ever pitched in the World Series, none could have been any
crisper than the one that unfolded in the heat and haze of the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Working in 95-degree heat, Cone had the Expos' hitters lunging
at sliders the entire game. Unable to hit his sliders or his
fastballs with any authority, they struck out 10 times and hit 13
balls into the air, nine to the outfield, four that remained in the
infield. The Expos made only four outs on grounders.
</P>
<P>
   But the fourth grounder was the one that nearly shattered Cone's
brilliant, dominating performance. With one out in the eighth
inning, Jose Virdo, the Montreal second baseman, rapped a grounder
up the middle that had every chance to scoot into the outfield for
a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went 2-0 on him,'' said Cone, who had not thrown two balls
with his first two pitches to any other batter. ``I said I gotta go
for it here. I'm just going to challenge him. I got the better part
of the middle of the plate and he hit it hard up the middle and I
thought there it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   But second baseman Chuck Knoblauch ranged far to his right,
speared the ball with a backhanded grab and traveled another four
steps on momentum before he stopped, turned, planted his feet
deliberately and, unlike many times this season, fired a perfect
throw to first for the 23rd out.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer, the next batter, took a strike, fouled off the
next pitch with a checked swing, then took strike three for the
third out of the eighth inning. The fans roared as Cone walked
slowly to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had scored five runs in the second inning against
Javier Vazquez on two monstrous home runs, the first, with two on,
by Ricky Ledee, who hit the ball well up the third tier in right
field. The other came from Derek Jeter, with one on, and the ball
landed deep into the Yankees' bullpen in left-center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees started scoring again in their half of the eighth,
and the Expos made a pitching change. The inning threatened to
become extended, but Chili Davis grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been happier to see a double play hit by one of our
guys,'' said Cone, who had sat through a 33-minute rain delay
earlier in the game and didn't want to sit through a long inning
now.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widger, the Expos' catcher, began the ninth inning the way
Fullmer ended the previous one, striking out on three pitches,
though he swung at the third one and missed. Ryan McGuire, a
left-handed hitter, then batted for the right-handed Shane Andrews
and hit the ninth outfield fly induced by Cone.
</P>
<P>
   The ball popped into left field, and Ricky Ledee came running in
for it hesitantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was worried that he might have lost it,'' Cone said. ``There
are a lot of white shirts. The sun's in and out, a hazy day. I
thought he'd get to it because he has great speed, but I wasn't
sure if he picked it up or lost it for a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to worry. Ledee caught the ball, even using two hands to
make sure the ball stuck in his glove.
</P>
<P>
   With 26 outs from 26 batters, Cone looked around the stadium,
soaking in the scene as he prepared to face No. 27, Cabrera.
</P>
<P>
   Before the inning, Cabrera, a 24-year-old Columbian, did some
quick figuring. ``If he throws the perfect game,'' he said to some
teammates, ``I'm going to be the last guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera, the last batter between Cone and his dream, swung and
missed, took the second pitch for a ball, then hit yet another ball
into the air. ``I was glad it went up and not down,'' Brosius said.
``I was glad to see a popup and not some kind of weird ground
ball.'' Larsen, Wells and now Cone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to be a habit, huh?'' Larsen said as he rode the
elevator to get to the Yankees' clubhouse, where he threw his arms
around Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Cone said later that around the middle of the game he fought the
urge to think about what he was accomplishing. But then came the
sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out in the sixth,'' he related, ``and said the heck
with it; I'm going to throw fastballs and try to get through the
inning quickly and it happened. Then I'm thinking, OK, here we go,
the last three innings. That's when you really pick it up a notch
and try to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 13-year career, Cone has won the Cy Young award once and
has been a 20-game winner twice, but he has also experienced the
downside of a career. His worst time occurred early in the 1996
season, when he was found to have an aneurysm in the upper part of
his right arm. Surgery eliminated the problem, but he had no
guarantee that he would continue his career or continue to be
successful in it.
</P>
<P>
   That September he returned and pitched seven innings against
Oakland without allowing a hit. But he was not allowed to try to
complete the no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wondered if I'd ever get a chance again,'' Cone said
Sunday. ``Going into the latter innings today, that was running
through my mind, about how many times I've been close and how this
might be the last chance I get. My heart was pumping. I could feel
it through my uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Throwing quick biting sliders like he said he used to throw,
Cone achieved his quest. He didn't surprise Felipe Alou, the Expos'
manager. Asked when he thought Cone might do something special,
Alou said, ``When I wrote the lineup and saw that we didn't have
anybody who faced him.''

MOBSTER SAMMY THE BULL REVEALS LIFE IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
 PHOENIX-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 Copyright  1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _Salvatore Gravano, Mafia hit man and Phoenix-area
resident, eyed his visitor with a steely glare.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you're going to write about Sammy the Bull living here?''
he said in a semi-raspy voice. ``Do you know how many people will
get killed if you do that?''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed odd coming from someone responsible for 19 murders,
but the question had merit.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, the turncoat underboss who put John Gotti and 36 other
New York mobsters in prison, had managed to stay underground for
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   He was hiding in sunny Arizona from assassins, from Illinois
cops who offered a reward for sightings, from families of victims
who filed a lawsuit, from the media.
</P>
<P>
   He came for the same reason most everyone else does: to get a
new start.
</P>
<P>
   Most neighbors didn't know the middle-age guy next door was
notorious for robberies, loan-sharking, extortion and homicide.
Employees had no idea their boss once operated a corrupt New York
construction business, rigging bids and running unions.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gravano wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   But, over time, his secret life and identity slowly unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   It happened, in part, because Gravano is sometimes indiscreet.
He has a business, a publicist, a lawyer. U.S. marshals and FBI
agents watch over him.
</P>
<P>
   He tells some people his real name.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knew his identity would be exposed someday.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in a modest bungalow, the sort of place a 20-something
bachelor would call home.
</P>
<P>
   There are no family photographs visible, nothing intimate or
interesting other than a life-size dummy used for a punching bag.
</P>
<P>
   A little dog growls and sniffs at strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wears a black muscle shirt, gray sweat pants and dark
shades in a low-light living room.
</P>
<P>
   After small talk, he wonders aloud why his story is worth
telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would be so interesting about me? Running a legitimate
business. Being monitored by the government . . . I think it's
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he says, if word gets out, the New York media will
swarm into Arizona, ferreting out every detail of his new life. And
the Mafia might feel compelled to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mob, anytime anybody flips, there's an open contract on
him,'' Gravano says.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he downplays the danger.
</P>
<P>
   There's no real worry about getting whacked, Gravano says,
because he's become pals with FBI agents and U.S. marshals. They
drop by on vacations to Arizona. He talks to their wives by phone.
Besides, the Mafia has been so thoroughly infiltrated that the feds
would know who ordered a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mob is smart enough that when they do something, they
wanna get away with it,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, a stocky, muscular man who seems younger than his 54
years, oozes bravado. He says he doesn't look under his car or over
his shoulder, doesn't understand fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up in a lifestyle,'' he says. ``There's 30,000 cops
in New York. Every time you go out, you don't know if you're coming
back. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a boxer. I know what it's like to get hit. I know what
it is to fight. And you lose your fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go to Montana and live 20 years in a cabin and be
scared to death. Or I can live here, where I'm happy, five years. I
choose to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano pauses, smiles. ``When it happens, it happens. If they
start shooting, then I'll be a little scared.'' &QL; 
A NEW IDENTITY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull arrived here as an inmate in the Federal
Correctional Center.
</P>
<P>
   Upon release, he was given a new identity and background. He
rented an apartment, returned to the construction business, settled
in.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy with the haunting threat of a bullet in the head, life
was tolerable. Until two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The secret died at his construction office amid junkyards and
vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull stormed into the foyer, and with a clenched jaw
confronted an unexpected visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you want?'' he demanded. Then, turning heel, he
grunted, ``Follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a back room, Gravano used indelicate terms to vent his
anger about being found out.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't worried about himself, but family members and
employees. Innocent people would suffer. Jobs would be lost,
reputations ruined.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's created a new life in the Phoenix area, and wasn't
going to start over, no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia,'' he added. ``I'm
not running from the (expletive) media.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he might tell his story, under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano knows about cutting deals. He traded testimony against
La Cosa Nostra for a shortened prison sentence. In 1995, he
completed the five-year term, entered a Witness Protection Program
and got some facial work.
</P>
<P>
   Then he blew the cover by appearing on TV to promote a book:
``Underboss, Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life in the Mafia.''
Coincidentally, a movie version of the story is being rebroadcast
tonight on NBC (Channel 12, KPNX).
</P>
<P>
   With celebrity came infamy.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Gravano's murder victims have sued him for $25
million. The New York attorney general is pursuing book and film
profits. The John Gotti Tribute Page, an Internet site, warned that
Gravano ``may be living next door to you with the government's
blessing.'' And the Combined Counties Police Association of
Illinois posted a $500 reward for sightings of Sammy the Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Association President John Flood said it's despicable that an
admitted murderer was unleashed on society after spending fewer
than five years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Sammy left the world tomorrow, we could all sit down and
say, `Thank God,' '' Flood added. ``It would be no loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The reward money went uncollected. Gravano had vanished into
Arizona, the anonymous retirement mecca that attracted a number of
mob bosses over the years, including Joe Bonanno. &QL; 
BEST-KEPT SECRET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wasn't the only one who didn't want his secret out.
</P>
<P>
   Athia Hardt, a public relations woman who represents him, said
the FBI was concerned about his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Hardt, who once worked for Arizona Govs. Bruce Babbitt and Rose
Mofford, also provided a reference: Supervising FBI Agent George
Gabriel, who handled Gravano during Gotti's prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call from New York, Gabriel said blowing Gravano's
cover would have one outcome: ``He's a dead man.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardt said her client would talk if the newspaper agreed not to
reveal his new name or company, and if it would withhold
information on family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' agreed, on the condition that the deal
would be void if the newspaper found that Gravano or his company
had engaged in corrupt activity in Arizona. &QL; 
NO FEAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the 2{-hour interview in Gravano's apartment, Hardt sips
red wine. Attorney Thayne Lowe lies on the floor to ease the pain
of a back problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy the Bull lights a cigarette and worries aloud about family
members. He says they are the main reason he sought refuge here,
along with the weather and relatively mob-free environment.
</P>
<P>
   Though he hasn't been threatened here, Gravano figures the Mafia
knows his whereabouts. FBI agents agree, saying he is too casual
about his cover.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano quit the Witness Protection Program nine months after
getting out of prison. (``Too many restrictions. You couldn't have
contact with your family or anybody.'')
</P>
<P>
   And though he had plastic surgery, the face didn't change much.
(``I asked the doctor if I could look like Robert Redford, do it.
But he said, `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano settled for repairs to his boxer's nose and some minor
liposuction. The result: Strangers still recognize him on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come right over to me,'' Gravano says, proudly. ``Some
shake my hand and congratulate me for what I did. Some want an
autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that more than 300 Phoenix area residents know his
real identity. Sometimes, he even tells people.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says he recently ruined a business deal by coming clean
with a prospective partner. He shrugs, adding, ``We thought it was
ethical and right to let them know.'' &QL; 
A MORAL MAFIOSO? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ethical mobster.
</P>
<P>
   That theme is the fabric of Sammy the Bull's tale.
</P>
<P>
   He talks indignantly about the treachery of others. When told it
seems curious for a man who murdered 18 or 19 people to complain of
deceit, he interrupts to clarify the precise number _ ``It was 19''
_ then tells a story.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano and Gotti were trying to decide what to do about a Mafia
associate who was snitching to the cops. Gotti wanted to enlist a
homosexual who could destroy the traitor's credibility by accusing
him of being gay. Gravano was horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `No, John, we don't do that. We're family. He's
one of us. We should just go kill him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano views his homicidal history in a cultural context, like
the moral relativism of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a guy (on TV) who dropped a bomb on Hiroshima,'' he
says. ``Killed 100,000 people in one day. What's that about?''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, in the 2{-hour interview, Gravano boasts that
each of his murders was coldblooded. It may seem repugnant to
mainstream American values, but he adhered to the oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never killed anybody in a fit of rage,'' Gravano says.
``Everybody I killed was planned. I'm a hit man, not a serial
killer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these things, I didn't want to do. I felt I did the
right thing in La Cosa Nostra. I was loyal to the life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was even a good person within the mob. I was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says the killing is behind him. As an ex-Mafioso, a
friend of the law, his code has changed.
</P>
<P>
   That transition came when Gravano realized that Gotti was
setting him up as a fall guy. Gravano insists that it was Gotti,
not him, who violated the brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never betrayed anybody in my life first,'' he adds. ``But if
I'm betrayed, I become a good betrayer. Go ask John.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says dozens of others took plea deals and testified,
helping to put 37 criminals behind bars. He seems puzzled about
getting all the credit, or blame.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sammy the Bull flashes a winking grin and says, ``I was the
smartest, best-looking, most charismatic of the underbosses who
flipped.'' &QL; 
MAN OF PARADOXES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gravano is an avid chess player.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys talking to young people, helping them with their
problems. He goes fishing and takes in a ballgame occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly he works, rising at 5 a.m. and putting in 12-hour
days. Gravano says he's always been a workaholic with ideas racing
through his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the wheeling and dealing, the business, the
whirlwind,'' he adds. ``I think up deals every other minute.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gravano is a contradictory goodfellow.
</P>
<P>
   Once a garrulous gangster, he lives alone with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   He traded Mafia cronies for law enforcement chums.
</P>
<P>
   He says the FBI doesn't need his help anymore. Then, moments
later, he declares, ``I have everything to offer the government.
They'd be totally retarded not to deal with me.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims not to care what people think of him, yet helped write
a book to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano says life in the Mafia was always stressful. Prison was
intolerable, but it mellowed him. Now, he is content in a stuffy
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bunked in. See the brick on the walls? It's like a cell.
I'm comfortable again.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor knocks on the back door and delivers a cup of
Starbucks coffee. He smiles and talks of friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think good people, if they see you're really not a threat,
they'll protect you,'' Sammy the Bull adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy right now. I'm a boss. Of my family. Of my
friends. Of my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims he was offered an acting slot on ``The Sopranos,''an
HBO show that satirizes the New York mob. The script called for
Sammy the Bull to appear in several broadcasts as a hit man, then
get killed off. He turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   As for La Cosa Nostra, he says the government has delivered a
nearly mortal blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wrecked the mob all over the country. I don't think
they're anywhere near finished. They're letting up too early. But
they really hurt the mob.'' &QL; 
Sammy to the core
</P>
<P>
   Through all the changes, Gotti claims he's held true to
relationships and integrity. That's why he turned on Gotti, and why
he respects the FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were straight up people,'' Gravano says. ``I never caught
them in a lie, and I'm really good at that. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Have my values changed? No. You can't change what you are
inside. A leopard doesn't change his spots.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site dedicated to Gotti uses a different mammalian
metaphor for Gravano: ``rat bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes a psychological evaluation that says Sammy the Bull
suffers from a ``severe character pathology: The likelihood of
violent behavior is substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravano shrugs off the criticism, living day to day.
</P>
<P>
   He moves every eight or nine months.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for people to trust. Of all the hardships, he says
giving up his name was among the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I lost my identity for a while, but I found it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So, who is he today? Mobster, government informer, ex-con or
businessman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Sammy,'' he says with a wily smile. ``Sammy to the
core.'' &QL;

 TRAGEDY REVISITS THE KENNEDYS  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 19:
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Americans, watching television this weekend was
an act of haunting sadness. The nation seemed caught in yet another
enactment of a news documentary we first saw almost 36 years ago _
the media massed outside the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, the
family gathered inside to comfort, to pray, and to hope against
hope that it would not have to mourn yet another young and
promising life cut short.
</P>
<P>
   As viewers, we were witnesses again to one of the singular facts
about this singular family, that it is a family of unfinished
journeys, of magnetic personalities cut down far too early. First
there was Joe Kennedy in World War II and Kathleen just after. Then
President Kennedy in 1963, followed by Bobby, then two of Bobby's
sons and now John F. Kennedy Jr., apparently killed along with his
wife and her sister when his single-engine plane plunged into the
Atlantic short of its destination at Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   In this chronicle, the JFKs, father and son, seem joined now as
symbols of a kind of familial and national loss that strikes with
cruel abruptness. An assassin prevented Jack Kennedy from
completing the nation-changing journey that he had charted for the
American people on the twin frontiers of space and social justice.
Now the son and namesake who as a 3-year-old saluted his father's
coffin appears to have been lost as well. That the son's departure
appears to have been accidental rather than criminal makes it less
an affront to civic order, but if anything the sense of
incompleteness, of opportunity denied, may be sharper.
</P>
<P>
   The accident comes in the anniversary month of signature events
in the Kennedy saga _ the landing on the Moon and the incident at
Chappaquiddick in July of 1969. In a televised address shortly
after the accident that killed Mary Jo Kopechne, Sen. Edward
Kennedy asked whether there was ``some awful curse that hangs over
all the Kennedys.'' The theory that some malevolent force singled
out the Kennedys for special privilege and special punishment will
get new life now. One cannot help but note, as former Gov. Mario
Cuomo did, ``the almost inexplicable concentration of tragedy, the
reiteration of it in the Kennedy family, which, perhaps because of
their celebrity, seems almost unique.'' Even so it would be
premature to say that the family's political narrative is over,
given the powerful hold the Kennedys exercise over the national
consciousness and, no less important, their proven resilience. Any
number of commentators observed yesterday that after each new
calamity, the Kennedys mourned together in Hyannis Port and then
regrouped, determined to go on.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy Jr.'s life spanned large and important moments
in the life of this country, events his father helped shape and
presage at home and abroad. It would have been interesting to see
whether Jack Kennedy's son could have developed his father's gifts
for hard politics and inspirational leadership. At 38, he did not
feel ready for elective office, but his magazine venture, George,
suggested a strong interest in public service that might have grown
into something larger. His diffidence was appealing. Given his name
and good looks, he could not humanly isolate himself from a
celebrity culture that the Kennedys themselves had helped create.
But he kept his dignity and sense of humor about the mixed
blessings of inescapable fame, and he did not misuse his advantages
in a cheesy or frivolous way.
</P>
<P>
   There remains the question of whether he should have chanced the
flight at all. Surely one does not wish to condemn him now for poor
judgment, only to observe that the Kennedys have always been risk
takers, in play, politics and war. At its best, there is a certain
nobility to the Kennedys' refusal to let life intimidate them. But
there is no escaping the hardness of this news, because of the
apparent loss of three young lives and because of the broken place
it touches in America's heart.

 By JOHN TIERNEY  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, shortly after immigrants from Austria and
Korea deposited bouquets of flowers, two middle-aged American
social workers left votive candles burning on the sidewalk outside
the home of John F. Kennedy Jr. in TriBeCa. They said they had
never done anything like that before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in my life I've ever felt this sort of
emotion,'' said Mary Jo McLean, a native of Rhode Island who lives
in Park Slope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just grateful that Jackie isn't here for it,'' said her
friend Diane Neville, a Long Island native who lives in Stuyvesant
Town. ``To lose a son is every mother's worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel for Caroline,'' Ms. McLean said. ``She's lost
her father, her mother and now her baby brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the other people at the vigil on North Moore Street, they
talked about what a normal, unpretentious guy John Jr. was _ a
typical New Yorker, as people said over and over, although
strangers do not start talking to each other on the street when a
typical New Yorker is lost. Kennedy was different, and not merely
because of his fame.
</P>
<P>
   What set him apart was that everybody knew his family. New
Yorkers who had never laid eyes on their best friends' parents had
grown up watching his. Immigrants who had never met some of their
own cousins knew the most intimate gossip about his. People too
busy to make it to their own families' gatherings devoted the
weekend to watching reports from the Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys became everyone's surrogate family, a balm for the
many rootless people here and across America. Like Britain's
royals, the Kennedy clan provided a continuing domestic drama for
those who didn't have one of their own. Their personal lives gave
everyone something to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   And in their political lives the Kennedys addressed some of the
same needs for a sense of community. They preached the liberal
version of family values: make America into a family that takes
care of all its members. They promoted social programs by appealing
to the same sort of visceral emotions aroused by the famous picture
of John-John saluting the father he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Since that picture was taken, the fatherless child has become a
far more common phenomenon in America, as the rates of divorce and
illegitimacy have soared. The rest of the country has become more
like Manhattan, which has long been an island filled with unmarried
people living far from their parents. The size of households has
been shrinking across America, and people have been moving away
from the neighborhoods where they grew up, often into isolated
homes in remote suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that some of the most popular shows on
television have been ones creating new kinds of communities for
people without traditional extended families. ``Cheers'' celebrated
a bar where ``everybody knows your name'' and everyone seems to
congregate every night to discuss their personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Seinfeld'' and ``Friends,'' the characters are in constant
touch, casually dropping by neighbors' homes and and continually
running into friends on the sidewalks of New York. The shows are
urban myths with huge appeal, especially to suburbanites living in
developments without sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is America's longest-running family television
drama, the Kennedys, the clan that somehow survived tragedies and
infidelities and divorces. Their problems became everyone's
problems. John Jr. became the national son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I knew him his whole life,'' Ms. McLean said. ``We
grew up together, and it was such a relief that he turned out to be
such a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the son who turned out right, who grew up gracefully to
become independent _ but not too independent. He died on the way to
the family compound, trying to reach a haven that does not exist in
many other families anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so tragically ironic that he was going to a wedding,''
Ms. Neville said. ``A marriage represents rebirth and life. I feel
so sorry for the bride. You know, Rory is the one who was in her
mother's womb when her father was killed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Ms. McClean said, ``the one thing to be thankful for
is that they were all there for each other when they got the news
at the compound. The family was together.''

LAWRIE BECOMES A LOCAL HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Having started the day 10 strokes behind
Jean Van de Velde, Paul Lawrie was asked if he really believed he
would win the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously at 10 shots back, I didn't think I had a chance,''
Lawrie said. ``But strange things happen, especially when the
course is so tough.''
</P>
<P>
   And with one glorious round, on one improbable day, Lawrie was
transformed from being a steady player on the European Tour to
being the new Open champion. His last victory was at the Qatar
Masters earlier this year, but with Sunday's victory Lawrie's life
will never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   An hour after winning, Lawrie had still not spoken to his wife,
Marian, who was at home in Aberdeen with the couple's two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously she has put the phone on answer machine, because
everybody is trying to ring her,'' said Lawrie, the first
non-American to win the British Open since Nick Price of South
Africa in 1994. ``I would imagine the phone is red-hot right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as hot as Lawrie was on the golf course. Including
the four-hole playoff, Lawrie made eight birdies and just two
bogeys in 22 holes at Carnoustie, one of the world's toughest
courses. Lawrie teed off 70 minutes before the final twosome of Van
de Velde and Craig Parry, and on the calmest day of the tournament,
with the wind hardly blowing, Lawrie displayed the talent that has
made him a consistent money-winner on the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Lawrie clinched a spot on the European Ryder
Cup team that will face the United States in Brookline, Mass, in
September. Many thought Colin Montgomerie would be the next
Scottish player to win a major, but Montgomerie shot a 74 on
Sunday, finished tied for 15th, and is still looking for his first
major.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a few Opens when I was younger; my father took me,''
Lawrie said. ``Every kid dreams about winning. It's a huge thing
for anyone to win the Open, but obviously special for me, being an
hour up the road by car. The playoff was just incredible. It was a
circus, everyone shouting your name out. To birdie the last two
holes is a fairy-tale story.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Another Disaster
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed by the collapse of Jean Van de Velde was the demise
of Craig Parry, an Australian, who finished tied for fourth place
with Angel Cabrera (7 over par), one stroke behind Paul Lawrie.
Parry, who shot a 71 on Sunday, led the tournament by one stroke as
he reached the 12th hole, but he made a triple-bogey at No. 12,
bogeyed No. 13, and then made a three-putt double-bogey at No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   For Parry, the stumble down the stretch meant goodbye victory,
hello fourth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew it on the 12th hole,'' Parry said. ``At No. 17, I lost
my concentration, frustrated with the mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing with Van de Velde, Parry had a firsthand view of the
Frenchman's final-hole collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really feeling for Jean on No. 18,'' Parry said. ``I
could see him throwing the tournament away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Woods Crumbles, Too
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods needed a great round to win, starting the day seven
strokes back. Instead, he shot a 74 and finished tied for seventh
place (10 over par). After making 11 consecutive pars, Woods
double-bogeyed No. 12 to fall out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three days, I missed a lot of putts, and you can't
afford to do that,'' said Woods, who made only one birdie in the
final two rounds. ``You can't play the weekend in a major and only
make one birdie and expect to win.''

KENNEDY SCHLOSSBERG KEEPS VIGIL IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg was home Sunday, not at her
family's famous Hyannis Port compound -- surrounded by television
lights and reporters -- but on Long Island, N.Y. with her husband
and children, suddenly her only immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   As her brother's disappearance and presumed death saddened
citizens around the world, dominated media attention and
conversations among strangers, Caroline, 41, seemed apart and
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The most private member of the family, she is now left to
publicly carry on her parents' considerable legacy. And to face
that task without the company of the brother she adored and
protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she was very close to her mother and brother and having
lost both of them in such a short time is a terrible blow,'' Bishop
Sean O'Malley, who celebrated a mass in John's name at St. Francis
Xavier in Hyannis, Mass., said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   She has lived through her father's assassination and her
mother's losing battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet mother, lawyer and author, she always seemed glad to let
sibling John monopolize the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, she flew to New York from a rafting trip out
west, avoiding reporters and cameras who staked out airports in
Massachusetts, waiting for her arrival. She is holed up in her home
in Bridgehampton, the secluded Long Island summer spot of sandy
beaches and quiet wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Although it remains unclear why Kennedy Schlossberg did not plan
to attend Rory Kennedy's wedding in Hyannisport, the event that
lured her brother in his single-engine plane, she has often seemed
slightly removed from the rest of the clan.
</P>
<P>
   Like her mother, she was protective of her children: aged 12, 9,
and 6. Today (July 19), Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg,
mark their 13th wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that she was not scheduled to be at Rory's wedding,
there was a message that, yes, there are parts of my life that are
Kennedy, but there's parts that are not,'' said Greg Payne, a media
observer from Emerson College in Boston. ``There's a real media
saviness on Caroline's part. I'm not saying it's deliberate that
she's not at the compound, but there's a symbolic part of her that
needs some space to grieve because she's the last surviving
member.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a position she has carefully cultivated since her
introduction to public life came _ unpleasantly _ at age two.
</P>
<P>
   Her father returned to Hyannis Port from the Democratic
Convention, triumphant in his nomination as the party's
presidential candidate. The toddler ran to the door to greet him
and recoiled when flash bulbs popped furiously. She turned to run.
He quickly scooped her up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid darling,'' the president told his daughter.
``They won't hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   But in her 1,000 days living at 900 Pennsylvania Avenue, even
her chicken pox made news. So did her first words, which supposedly
were daddy, at, car, shoes, thank you and airplane, the dreaded
machine that frequently carried her father away and, ultimately,
has apparently claimed her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She generally avoids press attention but she now is going to
rise in prominence as the sole surviving member of that family,''
said Darrell West, a political science professor at Brown
University, John's alma mater. ``She is going to attract a lot of
press attention whether she wants it or not. About the only time
she has sought press attention was when she wrote a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Title of that work: ``The Right to Privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But she never shied away from the Profile in Courage Award, the
annual event at the John F. Kennedy Library Musuem in Boston,
personally calling the recipients to inform them they had won the
honor, which the family created to focus attention on the
president's life, rather than that fateful day, Nov. 22, 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy Schlossberg also serves as the president of the Kennedy
Library Foundation, which supports education and cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very devoted to the misssion of the library. Mrs.
Onassis was equally devoted. It was the national memorial to
President Kennedy. . . . She wanted it to be a vital, living
center,'' said one person familiar with her work. (Caroline) is a
very private person who is very committed to this part of her
father's legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, John focused on the Institute of Politics at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, which was also set
up as a memorial to the slain president. His son had served as a
member of the board since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has come and done forum events and things at the school,''
said Catherine McLaughlin, the institute's executive director,
adding that John was more hands on than his sister. ``We're not
sure how that's going to change right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline and John were very close. He was born a few days before
she turned three and the proud sister told people she got a brother
for her birthday. Even as a little girl she was said to have a warm
and protective attitude toward him.
</P>
<P>
   At five, Caroline was already being described as poised, smart
and independent, still fitting adjectives today, according to those
who know her.
</P>
<P>
   Hers has not be an easy life, as death brushed by her more than
once.
</P>
<P>
   An English nanny broke the news of her father's assassination to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy has been shot and they took him to the hospital but they
couldn't make him better,'' her tearful governess Maud Shaw
tenderly explained while reading a bedtime story. ``God swept him
up in his arms and carried him away to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Caroline cried herself to sleep that night. Her sixth birthday,
days away, was canceled as the nation mourned with her.
</P>
<P>
   She lost another brother, Patrick, two days after he had been
born. Cubans were suspected of plotting her kidnapping as a girl.
And when she was 18, studying Oriental art at a Sotheby's program,
a terrorist bomb meant for British officials exploded outside the
London residence where she was staying. The blast killed a doctor
who happened to be walking by.
</P>
<P>
   She then went on to Harvard, yet another family tradition, and
briefly worked at the New York Daily News as an editorial
assistant. Understanding the press from the indside out, however,
did not stem Kennedy Schlossberg's retreat into her own world.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, her mother ingrained some of that distance,
shielding her from the rowdier side of the family as much as she
shielded her from the press. But others say Caroline has always
seemed somewhat alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other difference between her and the other Kennedy kids
...is her isolation,'' a friend of Caroline's who attended boarding
school with her at Concord Academy told a reporter years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One of Rory Kennedy's would-be wedding guests disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not all alone,'' said the person, who asked not to be
identified. ``It's a large, supportive family but in a nuclear
sense, yes (she's alone).''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop O'Malley remembered Caroline's grandmother, Rose, and
hopes she too can be strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for her faith,'' O`Mallely said. ``I hope this new
generation of Kennedys, that their faith will be able to sustain
them.''

CONE'S FINAL VICTIM HAD A PREMONITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBA-YANKS-EXPOS, BBA-YANKS-WELLS, BBA-RHODEN-COLUMN,

 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He was the last Montreal Expo batter to face David
Cone in the Yankee's perfect game Sunday, and afterward, Orlando
Cabrera dispensed of the false bravado. Sure, Cabrera admitted, the
prospect of making the final out crossed his mind _ in the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera shared his premonition with several teammates in the
Expos' dugout during the eighth. ``You know, if he throws a perfect
game,'' Cabrera remembered telling others, ``I'm going to be the
last out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera could be forgiven for his sense of fatalism; any of the
Expos could be. Felipe Alou, the Montreal manager, was careful to
credit Cone after the game, saying he could've pitched a perfect
game against anybody with the stuff he had Sunday, his jack-knifing
slider and a fastball juiced with adrenalin _Cone's velocity
increased from 85-87 in the first three innings to 88-91 in the
last six innings.
</P>
<P>
   But Alou knew when he wrote out his lineup card before the game
that Cone was capable of doing something special against his lot of
inexperienced hitters. Not one player in the entire Montreal lineup
had ever batted against Cone in a regular-season game. Not one.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a single member of the Expos to walk up and down
the dugout to talk about what Cone was throwing, to suggest how
they might recognize Cone's mesmerizing breaking ball before it
spun two feet out of the strikeout, to calm the Expos. It was as if
the Expos faced Cone with cerebral blindfolds.
</P>
<P>
   When hitters and pitchers face for the first time, conventional
wisdom is that the advantage usually belongs to the pitcher,
because he controls the action and knows what he's going to throw.
Without intelligence gleaned from teammates or from experience, the
hitter is left to guess. This is particularly true in a matchup of
Cone against the young and aggressive Montreal batters, Alou
acknowledged, because Cone throws so many different types of
pitches from so many different angles.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widger, the Montreal catcher, said that once Cone started
throwing his slider _ and on Sunday, Cone had exceptional command
of this pitch, which breaks sharply down and away from right-handed
batters _ all the Expos hitters prepared themselves for it, and
then Cone would pump a fastball past them. ``And that's one of the
best sliders in all of baseball,'' said Widger.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 5-0, and after Vladimir Guerrero flied out to
lead off the fifth inning, Cone threw a strike to Jose Vidro and
followed this with a splitter out of the strike zone _ perhaps the
first sign Cone had that he had a chance for the no-hitter. Most
pitchers challenge batters with fastballs when they have a five-run
lead, but here was Cone trying to trick every Montreal batter.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro flied out, and so did Brad Fullmer, and the Yankee Stadium
crowd of 41,930 stood and roared, fully integrated into the
fascinating possibility. The Expos, too, were quite aware of what
Cone was doing to them. ``By the time we got to the fifth and sixth
inning,'' Widger said, they all knew, ``because we hadn't even had
any good swings against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera, 24 years old and playing his 180th game in the big
leagues, fouled out to end the sixth inning, and to close the
seventh inning, Cone struck out Rondell White, the most formidable
hitter in the Montreal lineup. Six more outs and the Expos would be
the victims of a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Expos in the dugout conjured a perfect scenario to
end the perfect game: Hit the ball to Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankees'
second baseman, who has 16 errors. They had heard about Knoblauch's
throwing problems, Cabrera said, and seen the highlights of his
wild throws bouncing past first base. Hit the ball to Knoblauch,
they agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Guerrero popped out to start the eighth inning,
bringing Vidro to the plate, bearing a .315 batting average.
Working carefully, Cone fell behind two balls and no strikes, the
second and last time in the game an Expo had reached a ball-strike
count considered favorable to the batter. Knoblauch edged to his
left, figuring Cone would throw him a fastball and Vidro might slug
the ball into the hole between him and first baseman Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro did smash the ball in Knoblauch's direction, and as he
made contact, Vidro thought he had his team's first hit. But he saw
Knoblauch dart to his right, and Vidro knew Knoblauch was in a good
position to field the ball. ``As soon as Knoblauch made that
play,'' said Cabrera, ``I was like, `We're done.' He made the catch
and made the perfect throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer whiffed to end the eighth, the Yankee Stadium fans
standing and screaming for Cone. It was so exciting, said Shane
Andrews, Montreal's third baseman. ``It's a game I would've loved
to watch if I hadn't tried to hit in it,'' said Widger, who would
lead off the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal bench was mostly silent as Cone prepared to pitch
the ninth inning, a few guys raising their voices in aborted
moments of exclamation. Cone threw a slider low and outside to
Widger, and Widger waved at it, virtually helpless. ``The pressure
is more on the Expos'' in that situation, Chili Davis mused later,
``than on him, because they're the ones having the game thrown
against them. They've got to go up there and be a little selective
and aggressive at the same time. It's a tough situation to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone threw a fastball for strike 2, Widger watching, before
Widger waved at another slider. Two outs to go.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan McGuire pinch-hit for Andrews and for only the fourth time,
a Montreal player batted Cone to a 2-ball count _ 2 balls and 2
strikes. All day, the Yankees' left fielder, Ricky Ledee, had
fretted about the awful glare, telling teammate Luis Sojo that he
couldn't see the ball coming off the bat. McGuire, left-handed,
swung and looped a ball his way.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee began moving, heard the third baseman Scott Brosius
yelling and motioning for him to come in for the ball _ and on the
dead run, he caught the ball awkwardly. One out to go.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera walked to the plate, aware of the stakes. He could make
the last out and be remembered in baseball history, or, if he got a
hit, ``All the security is going to have to take me to the hotel.
The fans, they were into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera took a strike, a ball. Cone threw a slider _ ``The
frisbee he throws, it's amazing,'' Cabrera said _ and Montreal's
diminutive shortstop popped up, toward third base. Cabrera moved
deliberately toward first base, realizing the ball would be foul,
realizing he would be the last out. Cabrera watched the ball come
down, watched Brosius prepare to make the catch; he wanted to see
this, to be part of this, even if he was on the other side of
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius caught the ball, Cone dropped to his knees, his
teammates enveloped him. Returning to the dugout, Cabrera walked
past, staring at the pile of happy humanity. ``It's just like the
World Series,'' Cabrera said later, shaking his head and smiling.

 &HT;    Braves fall 3-2 as close play goes Jays' way
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ As odd as it was to have 11-game winner Kevin Millwood
outpitched by one-game winner Joey Hamilton, in the Braves' minds
this 3-2 loss on Sunday came down to one play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the tying run, Brian Jordan sped home in the eighth
inning behind Keith Lockhart on a Gerald Williams grounder. He slid
head-first into the plate, where he appeared to arrive easily ahead
of the tag of catcher Darrin Fletcher. Television replays from
several angles indicated he was safe.
</P>
<P>
   But plate umpire Tim Tschida ruled Jordan the third out, leading
to manager Bobby Cox getting ejected for the sixth time this season
arguing the call, and Blue Jays closer Billy Koch took care of the
Braves in order in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bust your tail and play hard and stuff like that
happens,'' said Jordan, who had singled off Hamilton and taken
second on a double steal. ``I don't know if Tschida didn't expect
it, or if he was out of position. I was clearly across the plate
before he tagged me. My whole arm was across the plate. . . . I
jumped up because I was safe and I saw him looking for the ball and
I'm like `You've got to be kidding me.' . . . That's the difference
in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The day had already been ruined for Millwood, who saw his
five-game winning streak snapped by the third most productive
lineup in the American League. The Blue Jays had six doubles in the
first six of their eight hits off him.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fernandez, who entered the game second in the American
League with a .366 batting average, gave Millwood an indication of
the work he was in for in his first two at-bats. He drew 24
pitches, and fouled off 17. In the first at-bat, Millwood struck
Fernandez out on the 13th pitch to strand runners at first and
second.
</P>
<P>
   But the second time up, Fernandez drove a 3-2 pitch, the 11th of
the at-bat, into the left-center gap. It was the third consecutive
double of the inning and put the Jays up 2-0, a lead they wouldn't
lose.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood needed 128 pitches to get through six innings, more
pitches than he'd thrown in a game all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a battle for me from the first inning on,'' Millwood
said. ``I never really made it easy on myself. . . . My curveball
stunk, but I still had a good slider, fastball and mixed in some
change-ups. When I made a mistake, they hit it.''

KENNEDY WAS PUSHING THE BOUNDS OF SAFETY, PILOTS SAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   So far, federal aviation officials have found no rule or
regulation that was broken during John F. Kennedy Jr.'s ill-fated
flight from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   And National Transportation Safety Board investigators said
Sunday that there was as yet no evidence whether pilot error, a
mechanical flaw or something else caused John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
single-engine plane to vanish shortly before reaching the
Massachusetts island.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, acquaintances and fellow pilots described Kennedy as
someone who loved to fly and who took the avocation seriously,
displaying no recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   But several pilots familiar with the route, including one who
shared a flight instructor with Kennedy and another who frequently
spoke with him about planes and flying, said he pushed the bounds
of safety when he chose to fly to the small island after dark in
hazy conditions.
</P>
<P>
   They added that they have often pushed those same bounds,
calling it a fairly common practice among the ranks of weekend
pilots who flee New York City for beaches or islands every summer
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on information released by officials about his route and
the weather on that night, it appeared that Kennedy made a series
of decisions that added risk to the flight, according to many
pilots familiar with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   First, the stakes rise whenever a pilot chooses to fly after
dark, said Bruce Landsberg, the executive director of the American
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association Air Safety Foundation, a
group that promotes the training of private pilots and publishes
safety data.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Landsberg said, one fatal accident occurs in small
private planes for every 100,000 hours they fly. For flights after
dark, the rate of fatal accidents more than doubles, to 2.4 per
100,000 hours of flying, he said. On Friday night, conditions were
also made difficult by the weather, with heat and humidity at the
ideal level for creating a smudge of haze that obscures the
horizon, a key feature of the landscape that allows a pilot to keep
a plane flying straight and level.
</P>
<P>
   Without a horizon, a pilot must rely on cockpit instruments that
use a gyroscope to display an ``artificial horizon,'' which allows
a plane to be flown in rain or clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving land and venturing over water amplifies the problem,
said Aron Wolf, a flight instructor in Los Angeles with 25 years of
teaching experience who used to train pilots in Warwick, R.I.,
often flying to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're far enough out, flying over water at night _ haze or
no haze _ is like flying in the middle of a black void,'' Wolf
said. ``It's like being in a soup can.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the conditions, many private pilots on a similar route
tend to take the precaution of contacting air-traffic controllers
and requesting what is called an ``over-water watch'' or ``flight
following,'' in which the radar transponder on the plane is
assigned a code and the flight is tracked more closely than other
noncommercial flights, according to several pilots. Kennedy did not
make such a request on Friday, with no radio contact detected from
his plane for the duration of the flight, according to federal
aviation officials.
</P>
<P>
   The risk taken by Kennedy when he chose to fly on Friday was a
common, and not unreasonable, one, several pilots who knew Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, a 38-year-old investment banker from Manhattan, set
out for Nantucket the same day while there was still daylight. He
said he encountered five miles of visibility with a layer of haze
while still over Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   The limit for pilots without a license for instrument flying is
three miles of visibility in haze, he said. Neither he nor Kennedy
had obtained the instrument rating yet. He was legally able to fly,
but it was a close call, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pushing it then and he was certainly pushing it after
dark,'' he said of Kennedy. ``But this happens all the time. A
hundred other guys probably flew that night and made it just
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of people doing this, people who are young
and _ knock on wood _ have had a little success,'' said the pilot,
in a telephone interview from his weekend home on Nantucket. He
spoke only on the condition that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work hard all week and you want to get there for the
weekend,'' the pilot said. ``The weather's legal. You've got a
well-maintained airplane, so you go.''
</P>
<P>
   His account was echoed by several other people who make the
weekend run from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy obtained his pilot's license last year after extensive
instruction, including several months spent at the Flight Safety
Center in Vero Beach, Fla., which is considered one of the
country's top training grounds for the use of single-engine planes
like the Piper Saratoga piloted by Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   He accumulated hours at the controls of both in his first plane,
a lightweight Cessna 182, and his Piper Saratoga, a more powerful
single-engine craft that he bought in April.
</P>
<P>
   But he had not yet become licensed to fly using only cockpit
instruments, a skill level required for flying in bad weather or
low visibility, and so was legally limited to flying in conditions
where he could see the world around him.
</P>
<P>
   Several veteran pilots who live on Cape Cod and often fly in and
out of Martha's Vineyard lamented that Kennedy had tried to fly in
the conditions that prevailed on Friday night, particularly given
the lack of a license for flying by instruments alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risky, and it's not good judgment to fly at night into
Martha's Vineyard in haze,'' said Frank Joy, 77, of Orleans, Mass.,
who has been flying since 1942 when he piloted torpedo bombers in
the Navy in World War II. For years, Joy flew construction crews
from Hyannis to Martha's Vineyard to work for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Several pilots said the haze over the Cape at 9:40 p.m. on
Friday when Kennedy was approaching Martha's Vineyard was thick
with summer humidity, almost like a black fog, obscuring the
horizon ahead for a pilot looking for lights after a flight over
the open ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went out to shut up my chickens at that time I could
barely see the moon,'' said Joy. ``In that kind of situation, you
can get vertigo,'' Joy said. ``You think you are turning, or in
control, and you are not. You need visual contact with a
landmark.''
</P>
<P>
   To Joy, the disappearance of the Kennedy plane is another sad
chapter in the difficult flying conditions around Cape Cod and the
islands, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. ``It's been a history of
taking off in the fog, landing in the fog, and boom, a lot of good
guys got lost,'' he said.

 &HT;    Lopez's knee passes
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toronto _ The experiment with Javy Lopez's sprained right knee
has begun. The catcher, a key element in the Braves lineup, caught
for the first time on Sunday since he injured his knee on June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, who played the first three games of this road trip in New
York as a designated hitter, caught the entire game Sunday vs. the
Blue Jays and showed no striking limitations behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel any pain,'' Lopez said. ``I put all the pressure
from my body on my left knee and after the game my left knee was
bothering me a little. That's something I might get used to.
(Otherwise) it was pretty much the same. I blocked pitches all
right. But it's still uncomfortable. I feel like RoboCop.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is wearing a bulky brace on his right knee and a
knee-saving pad behind both of his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   During warm-up pitches and when Lopez was calling pitches, he
shifted most of his weight to the left side in his crouch, and then
once the pitch was made, he shifted toward the middle. He plans to
stay low as much as possible, throwing the ball back to the pitcher
from his left knee to save his right knee some wear.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising sign came in the fifth inning on Sunday when
he blocked a pitch by Kevin Millwood, sprung up and retrieved it a
few feet away and then fired to third base to nail a fast Shannon
Stewart trying to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to feel uncomfortable,'' Lopez had said
before the game. ``If I still feel that way in a week, maybe I
shouldn't play that way. Maybe I've got to do something about it
because it's not worth it, it's not helping the team.... If I feel
uncomfortable, that's one thing, but if I can't block pitches in
the dirt, that can cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter ankle
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter aggravated his sore left ankle rounding second and
screeching to a stop during Saturday's game in New York. But he was
able to continue playing. He said Sunday that's the kind of thing
that he expects to happen fairly regularly, but he plans to fight
through it.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who first sprained the top area of his ankle last month
in Houston, has had some fluid collect now in the back of his
ankle. The Braves wanted to give him a cortisone shot before the
All-Star break, but Hunter, who said, ``I have a problem with
needles,'' opted not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one of those pains that will last for the
rest of the year,'' Hunter said. ``You know it's going to be two
minutes of serious pain and then it's going to go away.Smoltz set
for Saturday
</P>
<P>
   After two more successful innings with the Greenville Braves in
Jacksonville on Saturday night, John Smoltz is largely upbeat about
making his start in Philadelphia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz went two innings, allowed two runs on five hits, struck
out three and walked one, and came away feeling positive about his
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went pretty good,'' Smoltz said. ``I didn't have any pain.
I threw the ball OK. It wasn't great. The major part of not
throwing in pain is what I was looking for. I don't know how long
it will last, but it's good enough for now.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first rehabilitation outing on Thursday, Smoltz pitched
two perfect innings, with four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time throwing was almost too perfect, too good too
quick,'' Smoltz said. ``I tested it a little more (on Saturday),
threw it a little harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz is headed to Fort Lauderdale today, where he will join
the Braves on Wednesday.

 &HT;    As 18th unfolded, Lawrie got in gear
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Paul Lawrie was hanging around the
putting green Sunday while the world came crashing down upon Jean
Van de Velde in the 128th British Open. At 6-over and finished,
expecting to be driving home in nearby Aberdeen to see his wife and
7-month-old within the hour, the 30-year-old Scot suddenly perked
up while watching the Frenchman on a big-screen TV near the
practice ground.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde hit the grandstand with his second shot, then found
the burn with his third. The game was about to be on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was telling me what was going on and your mind is
racing and you don't know what to think,'' Lawrie said. ``Adam
Hunter (my caddie) was fantastic. He got me hitting putts and got
me focusing on what I need to do. He said, `Hit your putts, do your
thing. If we get in a playoff, we've got to be ready here.' . . . I
was set to go. My focus was good.''
</P>
<P>
   And, despite a poor opening drive at the first playoff hole,
Lawrie played accordingly, finally clinching the title with a
221-yard 4-iron to the 18th hole and a closing birdie from 3 feet.
Being 10 shots behind the leader when Sunday began was only half of
it. Lawrie, 30, made the tournament as a qualifier and had missed
the cut in five of his previous events on the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially living an hour up the road, it's a huge thing to
win the Open,'' Lawrie said. ``Here it's extra special for me,
being close to home. . . . The playoff was just incredible. It was
just a circus. Everyone was inside the ropes and shouting your name
out. It's really hard to try and focus on one shot at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Love too late again
</P>
<P>
   It's becoming an all too familiar scenario for Davis Love III in
the British Open. After three days of uneventful, sometimes
frustrating play, he suddenly finds the missing ingredient when
nobody is watching him. For the third consecutive year, Love
managed a superb final round in the Open, shooting a 2-under 69 and
finishing at 10-over 294 to tie for seventh. ``Well, I tamed the
monster at last,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   His round was as hilly as the dunes surrounding Carnoustie. He
made seven birdies and five bogeys. A Sea Island resident, he was
3-under after seven holes, then bogeyed the 8th, 9th and 10th to
cancel the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a day to put up a great score, but it was a bit too
much (to overcome),'' said Love, who started the day 13 shots off
the lead. ``I was trying to hang on for a top 10 and get a few more
Ryder Cup points to solidify my position.''
</P>
<P>
   Love put together rounds of 74, 74 and 77 prior to the 69. Last
year at Royal Birkdale, he finished with a 68 after rounds of
67-73-77. At Royal Troon in 1997, Love went 67-71-74-67.
</P>
<P>
   Etc. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Scott Dunlap managed his best finish in a major championship, a
tie for 10th at 11-over, after a final-round 70 . . . Lawrie won
350,000 pounds for his win, or about $560,000. . . . Van de Velde
surely would have paid handsomely to possess the shot of his
playing partner at the 18th green to end regulation. Craig Parry
holed out from the bunker for birdie, but finished at 7-over, a
stroke out of the playoff. . . . It was the first win by a
non-American at the British Open in five years. The last Scot to
win was Sandy Lyle in 1986.

 &HT;    Martin wears down as Aussies advance
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ A sick feeling came over Todd Martin on
Sunday morning, but no one who mattered would believe him. It
sounded too lame, like last-minute chicanery to get Pete Sampras in
the U.S. singles lineup before it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Denied a doctor's excuse 30 minutes before the match, Martin
showed up for work, refreshed after taking fluids intravenously,
and won the first two sets against No. 2-ranked Patrick Rafter. In
what would've been his finest hour, Martin was up a service break
twice in the fifth set, but the Australian had the faster legs in
the end and won his 11th consecutive five-set match, 4-6, 5-7, 6-3,
6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's win clinched the Aussies' 4-1 victory, and Lleyton
Hewitt defeated Alex O'Brien 7-5, 6-4 for the final point in a
Davis Cup quarterfinal that will be remembered as the one in which
Sampras, fresh off his sixth Wimbledon championship, wouldn't hear
of playing singles.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's complaint, as it turned out, was unplanned, the result
of feeling woozy after practicing 30 minutes with Jim Courier two
hours before match time.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter believed Martin's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never once saw Todd trying to pull something over on me,''
Rafter said. ``He didn't look great. He looked very pale in the
very beginning, but as the match got along I knew that I was in a
lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin came out slugging, breaking Rafter's serve in the opening
game with three clean return winners. He then struck two aces and a
service winner to go up 2-0 and finished his four winning service
games in the set with either aces or service winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategy was very simple,'' Martin said, citing fear of
dehydration. ``Do as little work for as good a result as possible.
Any ball that I could stand in one place and set up for, I tried to
hit if not for a winner, close to a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin captured two service breaks in the second set in similar
fashion, with backhand winners up the line off Rafter's serve.
</P>
<P>
   Martin opened the third set with the shot of the match, an
overhead with his back to the net beyond the baseline for a winning
pass. But Rafter came back from 15-40 to hold, got a break in the
next game and served out the set.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Martin appeared to tire. A key point came while
serving at 2-3 and 40-30. Martin stretched for a high backhand
volley that should've gone into the open cross court for the game.
Instead, he steered it wide for deuce, and Martin would make two
more errors on game points. He didn't win another game that set.
</P>
<P>
   Martin got two breaks in the fifth for leads of 2-0 and 4-2,
ripping backhand return winners on break points. But Martin's serve
got slower and his legs heavier. After winning 75 percent of
first-serve points in the first three sets, he won barely 50
percent in the final two.

RAFTER DEFEATS MARTIN TO CLINCH AUSTRALIAN VICTORY OVER U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ His own captain declared Todd Martin an
invalid on Sunday before he limped out for his confrontation with
Patrick Rafter. But it took 3 hours 14 minutes before Martin
finally gave up the ghost in the brutal five-setter that clinched
this Davis Cup quarterfinal for Australia.
</P>
<P>
   With an ill-aimed backhand return of the spry serve Rafter sent
his way at triple match point, a miserable Martin conceded the
match and the round on a 128-degree hardcourt in front of 5,300
disappointed fans at the Longwood Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   For Martin, who took intravenous fluids before the match, it was
a distressing end to a debilitating day. He had informed Tom
Gullikson, the United States captain, that he felt sick and
disoriented after his morning practice session and doubted that he
could give Rafter a fair fight. If Martin had been found unable to
play, Gullikson could have substituted Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   But over the objections of Gullikson and the United States team
doctor, Martin was deemed fit to compete by the event's neutral
physician, Richard Paul, an orthopedist and a longtime Longwood
member. Martin was then ordered to play by Stefan Fransson of
Sweden, the event's neutral referee.
</P>
<P>
   For the Australians, Rafter's victory, which gave them an
insurmountable 3-1 lead, was a just result to a competition tainted
by controversy _ about the location, the court surface and the
possible scheme to bring in Sampras as a singles ringer.
</P>
<P>
   While the gray-haired Martin slumped down in his changeover
chair under a shroud of cold towels, the pony-tailed Rafter raised
his fists in the steamy air, ripped off his shirt, and was raised
on the shoulders of his hooting and hollering teammates as they
celebrated his comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know why he's won the U.S. Open twice,'' Gullikson said
about Rafter. Speaking about Martin, who assumed the lead singles
role many felt should have belonged to Sampras, Gullikson was
properly grateful. ``I thought he played a heroic match,''
Gullikson said.
</P>
<P>
   After Rafter clinched the three-of-five-match competition,
Lleyton Hewitt, the 18-year-old rookie defeated Martin on Friday,
completed a 4-1 victory for Australia by defeating Alex O'Brien,
7-5, 6-4. O'Brien, Sampras' doubles partner Saturday in the United
States' only match victory, filled in for Jim Courier, who opted
not to play because of a slight leg strain.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, who won his five-setter against Martin despite trailing
by 4-2 in the final set, said, ``My body might not want to last,
but my mind and everything else wants me to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-ranked Rafter improved his record in five &UR; - &LR; set
matches to 12-2, and has now won 11 five-setters in a row, five of
them after trailing by two sets to none.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `` &LR; When I get into a five &UR; - &LR; set match, I know that record,''
Rafter said. ``I know I'm gonna be the one there last.''
</P>
<P>
   What Rafter did not know until 20 minutes before the match
whether his opponent would be Martin or Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   He did not comment on Gullikson's reasons for trying to use
Sampras, but he made it clear that he believed Martin's
apprehension about putting his body through another workout in the
sauna-like heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get a better sportsman in the world than
Todd,'' Rafter said. ``I have a lot of respect for Todd; I never
once saw Todd trying to pull something over on me. I saw him out on
the court and he didn't look great. He looked very pale in the
beginning. But as the match got along, he got more and more into
it, and I knew then that I'm in a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Martin had a 3-0 lead in the fifth set, he slowly
frittered it away. A doublefault at break point closed the gap to
4-3, a strong hold by Rafter tied the set at 4-4. In the last two
games, Rafter pushed himself to a competitive zone Martin was too
weary to reach. Rafter seized his pivotal break to 5-4 in the final
set with a searing crosscourt backhand volley after Martin
doublefaulted to break point. Rafter then zoomed out to a 40-0 lead
as he served for the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick outplayed me,'' said the  &UR; eighth &LR; -ranked Martin, who
was told before the match by the U.S. doctor, David Altchek, that
he was unfit to play due to lingering effects of heat prostration
from his loss on Friday to Hewitt. Suspicion about Martin's
fitness, coupled with the availability of Sampras, made for a
Byzantine morning at Longwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's entitled to his opinion,'' Martin said of Dr. Paul. The
Australian captain, John Newcombe, who said that Martin seemed
reasonably fit, added: ``We are not into mind games. He played
three and a half hours of pretty good tennis in the heat, had Pat
two sets to love and two breaks in the fifth. I think that speaks
for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said that his pre-match intravenous treatment had helped
him but that he had not taken to the court voluntarily. ``I didn't
know that I was really fit to play the whole match until near the
end of the match,'' Martin said. ``I was actually very distracted;
I had a tough time controlling my emotions. I went out and played
two very good sets and three okay sets and lost.''

RESORT SHAKEN BY ITS FAMOUS FAMILY'S LATEST TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ Leo Convery's family has lived in this
handsome old whaling town for six generations. He and his kin have
seen all manner of celebrities over the years _ Jimmy Cagney, Mia
Farrow, and, of course, the vast, energetic Kennedy clan.
</P>
<P>
   Like them or not, every Kennedy moment _ the deaths, accidents,
and celebrations _ has somehow intersected with Convery's life.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered where he was when President John F. Kennedy was
assassinated, and when the president's brother, Robert, was gunned
down.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday, Convery stood not 50 feet from the Chappaquiddick
ferry crossing where an accident involving Senator Edward M.
Kennedy claimed the life of Mary Jo Kopechne, exactly 30 years ago
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Convery was running a pancake breakfast fund-raiser for local
charities that islanders look forward to every year. The mood was
amicable enough, but even people who pride themselves on averting
their eyes when they see the many celebrities that visit this
island could not avoid discussing the fate of John F. Kennedy Jr.,
his wife, and his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is horrible,'' Convery said. ``It casts a pall over
everything. Last night I woke up in the middle of the night
absolutely upset because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Steele lives on a boat in Edgartown Harbor this time of
year so she can rent out her house to summer visitors. Behind her,
tourists and locals did what they do every summer weekend _
wandered about the dockside, drinking coffee and snapping photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes can't get over the contrast between the happy
times people have here and all the tragedies involving that poor
family,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she was on the water for the Wianno Sailing
Regatta, watching the festive canvases snapping in the breeze as
the little vessels tacked along the southern coast of the island.
</P>
<P>
   But toward the Gay Head area she and all the other boaters could
not take their eyes off of the red-and-white helicopters and gray
Coast Guard cutters carrying out their search for Kennedy's
single-engine plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just happens over and over,'' Steele said. ``I wonder if
any other family of that size has that level of tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Carroll, who owns a gift basket shop in Vineyard Haven,
doesn't think so. Thirty years ago she helped truck around
reporters who descended on the island following the Chappaquiddick
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have this little island and all those tragedies,'' she
said, her voice trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was inundated with e-mails overnight from friends across
the country. ``Everyone wanted to know what it was like here,'' she
said. ``Everyone was saying how sad they were. ''
</P>
<P>
   Even relative newcomers have memories of the Kennedys and other
notable visitors to this famous resort.
</P>
<P>
   Helio De Oliveira, who emigrated from Brazil three years ago and
runs a laundry service, was unloading his van in Edgartown Sunday
and stopped to recall seeing John F. Kennedy Jr. at the Vineyard
Haven Airport earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like a very nice man, he said. ``I hope I will see
him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pasted on the back of his van was a magazine photo of another of
the many celebrities he has encountered in his short time here:
Chelsea Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope she and her family will come here again this summer,''
he said. ``But I don't know. There is so much sadness here now.''

   HYANNIS PORT, Mass. _ From her front porch, Carolyn Quinn
surveyed the police barricades and phalanxes of TV crews that stood
between her shingle-sided summer home and her anxious neighbors
inside the Kennedy compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could we complain about this when that family has suffered
such tragedy?'' she said Sunday, waving a dismissive hand at the
media circus. ``My heart just aches for them. And all this is just
what happens when it's a Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy clan largely remained secluded in their cluster of
white houses overlooking Hyannis Bay, conferring with officials
overseeing the huge land and sea search for the plane carrying John
F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette, and her older sister,
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   The family issued no statement after being notified by the Coast
Guard that chances of the trio's survival were neglible, and that
the status of operations were being changed from ``search and
rescue'' to ``search and recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   John's sister, Caroline, staying at a family residence on New
York's Long Island, likewise made no statement.
</P>
<P>
   The scene inside the Kennedy compound here included ``a lot of
tears and hugs,'' Mary Medeiros, a family baby sitter, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   At Ethel Kennedy's house in the compound, a Mass was held at
which she reportedly handed out the communion wafers and her
brother-in-law, Sen. Edward Kennedy, served the communion wine to a
dozen or so relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some family members, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., walked the
beach. Later, Robert went sailing with his mother, Ethel, and other
relatives. Joining the excursion was Robert's sister, Rory, and her
fiance Mark Bailey, whose Saturday wedding was postponed as the
search continued.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 275 guests who had gathered for the wedding began
leaving the compound Sunday by a back entrance, away from the mass
of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the compound's front gate, where an American flag still
flew hopefully at full mast, the normally quiet neighborhood of
multimillion-dollar homes bustled with activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally weird,'' said Kate Floyd, 14. ``We don't think
about them as celebrities or anything. But then you see all this
stuff and realize something's up.''
</P>
<P>
   A new generation of Kennedy children now roams these winding,
shady streets and sails on the startling blue water beyond their
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're friends with the fourth generation. Joe's kids. Kate
Townsend,'' said Rick Mayfield, 15, referring to the daughter of
Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The original Kennedy brothers _ Joe Jr., Jack, Bobby and Teddy _
were the first to play touch football on the spacious yard. Then
came ``the cousins'' _ their children and those of their sisters.
Now the yard is the playground of the great-grandchildren of the
family patriarch, the late Joseph Kennedy Sr.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually ride our bikes down that street a thousand times a
day,'' said Nat Bacon, 14, pointing to a barricaded street. ``They
have pools and a really big yard where we play capture the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than complaining about the satellite trucks parked in
front of their houses and the police checkpoints, the neighborhood
children cashed in on the situation Sunday by selling bottled water
and soft drinks to the sweltering reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The children said John Jr. and his wife were frequently seen in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw John-John on the docks one time,'' said Cap Bacon, 16.
``My friend didn't know who he was at first. He told him, 'Yo,
you're chosen to take us bowling.' Then John-John made this cool
motion with his hands and grinned at us.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the neighborhood has crown accustomed to the
occasional inconveniences generated by their most famous residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned for the wedding, but this turned into something
quite different,'' said John Finnegan, police chief of Barnstable,
the jurisdiction that includes Hyannis Port and seven other
villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighbors have really been very good about it,'' said
Finnegan. ``We've only gotten a few complaints about the satellite
trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   During their formative years, the other Kennedy cousins spent
much more time in Hyannis Port than did John Jr. and Caroline, said
Margery Eagan, a Boston Herald reporter who grew up in the area.
Caroline and John spent more time at the summer home of their
mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, on the nearby island of
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she kind of segregated them,'' said Eagan. ``Ethel's
and Bobby's kids were kind of wild.''

THE RANGERS' NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Assuming they announce the expected signing of
Sylvain Lefebvre on Monday, the Rangers will have added six free
agents in two weeks. This is a remarkable recruiting effort that
will dramatically change their roster and affect the economics of
their sport. They have become older and more expensive and probably
better.
</P>
<P>
   But how much better? They are still thin at center, the
second-most-important position after goalie. With a payroll of
about $60 million, they will be the team with the highest payroll
in the National Hockey League, having one comparable to those of
baseball. After missing the Stanley Cup playoffs for two
consecutive seasons and three times in the last seven years, they
just might be back in the tournament next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Muckler seems optimistic. That is partly why Muckler
is about to accept a one-year contract extension to guarantee his
employment through the 2000-1 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about it,'' Muckler said. ``I am quite
pleased. Being here a year and a half, seeing the improvement in
the club last year and what the organization and ownership have
done this year to add personnel to make us better, I'm excited
about this coming season and I think everything is progressing in
the right fashion and we're going in the right direction. We are
building into a good club.''
</P>
<P>
   But aren't they also building an old club? Lefebvre, a
defenseman from the Colorado Avalanche, will turn 32 in October.
Stephane Quintal, another new defenseman, was signed from Montreal
and will turn 31 in October. Theo Fleury, the right wing signed
from Colorado, just turned 31. Valery Kamensky, the left wing from
Colorado, is 33. Tim Taylor, the center from Boston, is 30. Kirk
McLean, the backup goalie from Florida, is 33.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 12 months, the Rangers have re-signed three players
_ Brian Leetch, Adam Graves and Mike Richter _ before they could
get away as free agents. Their ages are 31, 31 and 32. They may
have some good seasons left, but it is hard to imagine them getting
better in their second decades as professionals. Returning regulars
include Kevin Stevens, 34, and John MacLean, 34. For a team, how
old is too old?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it depends on what you call old,'' said Muckler, 65, the
second-oldest coach in the league. ``Thirty-one is not old, with
the number of teams in the NHL now. We're expanding to 30 teams. I
think you will see older players stay around longer than they have
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   This is true. In the 1980s, when the league was a stable circuit
of 21 teams, most good teams were packed with players in the their
mid-20s. Last month, Dallas won the cup with the oldest team in the
league. But even with so many players over 30, the Stars were led
by Derian Hatcher, 27, and Mike Modano, 29.
</P>
<P>
   Most winning hockey teams have a core of elite athletes in their
20s who still have something to prove. The only Ranger who fits
this description is Petr Nedved, 28, the first-line center. Behind
him are Taylor and Manny Malhotra, 19. Muckler and everyone else
can see the need in the middle. Someone will have to replace the
retired Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to add a center-ice man,'' Muckler said. ``If not, I
would imagine Todd Harvey would get an opportunity to play there.
He has played some center. It's not what you want to do, but it's
the best alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, 24, is primarily a right wing, and missed much of last
season with injuries. Neil Smith, the president and general
manager, tried to trade him to the Islanders in the Zigmund Palffy
deal, which fell apart. But without another center, Muckler would
have to play Nedved against an opposing team's top center. This
contributed to the injuries that put Nedved out of action during
last season's final, failed drive for a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a healthy situation,'' Muckler said.
</P>
<P>
   Also lacking has been internal competition. Since the Stanley
Cup championship of 1994, won by a team that Smith built and Mike
Keenan coached, the last five Ranger teams have been heavy with
veteran players whose high salaries limit their tradability. Their
job security has not been threatened by emerging young talent.
Muckler said he hoped that would change with the competition from
young forwards like Harvey, Malhotra, Johan Witehall, Pavel Brendl
and Jan Hlavac.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great we've got competition from within,'' Muckler said.
``We didn't have that for a year and half. If the youth can
contribute, they're going to push each other. You need a strong
blend to win. We have a lot of questions, but I think some of those
questions are going to be answered. I'm excited and looking forward
to the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Muckler took over in February 1998 after Smith dismissed Colin
Campbell as coach. In more than a decade as boss of the Rangers,
Smith's trade and draft history is spotty. The same goes for his
free-agent hirings. MacLean produced well last season, but Mike
Keane and Brian Skrudland failed to last a full season in 1997-98.
Gretzky, an expensive addition in 1996, finished his career in
Madison Square Garden with three of his least effective, but best
compensated, seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Since the lockout of 1994, the average NHL salary has risen from
$558,000 to $1.3 million a year. One key condition of the
collective bargaining agreement reached then was free agency for
veterans. Although long-term security and high salaries might not
damage their motivation, some older players tend to wear down in an
82-game season followed by up to two months of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The average Ranger salary next season will be about double the
league average. In the Garden's corporate culture, several people
have to approve those paychecks and then hope to count playoff
receipts. Smith's immediate supervisor, David Checketts, the
Madison Square Garden president, came from the basketball side of
the operation. Because of the Knicks' regular-season strife and
surprising playoff success, Checketts and the Cablevision ownership
may have been preoccupied. Perhaps this bought Smith more time to
spend more money on more free agents. But he could be running out
of approaches and time.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ The steady stream of visitors across the
decades to the graves of President John F. Kennedy and his brother,
Robert, sadly quickened Sunday as the nation kept vigil for John F.
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have they found his body yet?'' Xavjeir Goodfaith, a
15-year-old student, asked as he moved on from the eternal flame
marking the grave of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to carry on the Kennedy legacy; it can't just
disappear,'' the student said with considerable insistence, pausing
at Robert F. Kennedy's memorial stone, which bears a quotation from
Aeschylus, ``In our sleep, pain that can not forget falls drop by
drop upon the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors poured up the hill to the Kennedy graves here at
Arlington National Cemetery, the sweltering summer heat compounding
the day's dirgeful tinge as they left flowers and notes for the
missing Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world stands motionless and hearts are heavy with
sadness,'' declared one note lying near a photograph of John Jr. as
a small boy more than 35 years ago saluting his father on the day
he was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling my son the history of the Kennedys,'' said
Bob Sedlock, visiting from Pittsburgh with his son, David, 8. ``I
was my boy's age when President Kennedy was shot, and I remember it
all just like it was yesterday. It's tough being a Kennedy, to
begin with, but John Jr. did a lot on his own. He didn't sit on the
Kennedy name.''
</P>
<P>
   Small children posed with smiles for their parents' video
cameras as the visitor flow continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time, there's a kind of flashback,'' Ed Bonilla, an Army
sergeant, said of the way each new Kennedy tragedy recharges the
nation's sad memories of them. ``This is a person who has been
loved by the country since he was born,'' said the sergeant, who
was on leave from Korea and decided to come to the cemetery after
he heard the news of John Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, people's reactions were less focused than
those of the graveside visitors here. Many Americans remarked more
on the persistence of tragedy in the life of the Kennedys than on
John Jr. himself. Some questioned whether Kennedy was reckless in
flying his plane at dusk with such little experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kennedys live that dangerous lifestyle,'' Steve Hout, a
customer outside the Highlander bar in Atlanta said. Across the
way, John Stewar, sat under a shade tree and when asked his
reaction, complained, ``The only thing I thought was, `God, I have
to watch this on TV for a week.' It's just the latest topic for the
lack of something better to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were hardly so uninvolved.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Barnes from Bristol, England, was visiting New York City.
The devout daughter of an Anglican priest, she decided to go to the
Roman Catholic Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral. ``We wanted to be
here with their people,'' she said of the Kennedys. ``We certainly
did pray for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, as at the cemetery here, attendance increased at the
Brookline house where President Kennedy was born, now a national
historic site. Bouquets and a vigil candle were left outside. ``A
lot of people have been saying, `Not again.''' David Kratz, a
worker at the site, noted of the sense of cyclical Kennedy tragedy
that prompted visitors.
</P>
<P>
   In Dublin, where the Kennedys long have been proudly claimed as
Ireland's own, the main news Sunday was of the death of Donal
McCann, the nation's leading actor. But the second story, amply
reported by the network's Washington correspondent at Hyannis Port,
was of the Kennedy plane disappearance. ``What is God trying to
tell that family?'' one Dubliner asked.
</P>
<P>
   In London, the missing plane was front-page news, with heavy
emphasis on what was being headlined as ``the curse of Camelot.''
The Observer, like all the major papers, offered multiple stories
about ``America's tragic and glamorous `royals.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Zuni, a restaurant in mid-Manhattan, the Yankee game was on
the television through the afternoon, and no one asked to switch to
the latest Kennedy news, according to bartender Britton
Herring.``It seemed like a foregone conclusion that they were
gone,'' he said. ``Also, I've been staying away from it because of
the way the press is talking about it. There's so little new
information, there's nothing to say. So, they get to the point of
talking about nothing, and it becomes a little ghoulish.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Robert Wiggins, a chef for Amtrak, waited at a bar
in the Port Authority Bus Terminal and was dismayed at the Yankee
game on the tube and the lack of Kennedy update. ``Way back an old
poet said, `Every man's death diminishes me, for I am a part of
mankind,''' he said. ``If you made a comparison, John F. Kennedy
Jr. is the closest thing we have to a prince and as such, we should
look upon this as a death in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery visitors here identified with the Kennedys for offering
the painful lesson over the years that all families must persevere
in the face of suffering. ``John Jr.'s especially sad because he
had his childhood taken away along with his father,'' said Clara
Johnston of Raphine, Va., alluding to the celebrity spotlight that
dogged the boy until he managed to turn it into a tool for his
publishing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to have his own life, and I think he became more
grown up when he lost his mother,'' she said, typifying the level
of intimacy and affection visitors to the grave site expressed
about the Kennedys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a Hollywood kind of person, gawking at celebrities,
but their lifestyle is impressive,'' said John Sapp. He was born
five years after the Kennedy assassination but said that he, like
all Americans, has been absorbing chapters of the Kennedys'
bittersweet story across his life. ``It's the elegance of Jackie,
the flamboyance of the family _ JFK being so dashing and daring,''
he said in summary as he headed down the hill from the Kennedys'
graves.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ There have been plenty of great hitting tandems over
the years: Ruth and Gehrig, Foxx and Simmons, Mantle and Maris,
Mays and McCovey.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three days, with the New York Mets benefiting from
the use of a designated hitter, Rickey Henderson and Roger Cedeno
have been a superlative twosome devoted to speed. They have clicked
at the top and bottom of the Mets' batting order.
</P>
<P>
   ``They create some havoc, back to back, no doubt about that,''
Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said in Tampa Bay on Friday night
after Henderson and Cedeno had run the Mets to a 9-7 victory over
the Devil Rays. ``Having them like that probably maximizes our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Tuesday night's game here at Camden Yards, the two
will not have a chance to hit consecutively, ninth and first,
anymore this season unless the Mets make the World Series, and then
only when they play in the American League park. The interleague
portion of the Mets' schedule will be over, and with it the ability
to use the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   With their speed, Henderson, 40, who hits leadoff, and Cedeno,
24, who has been batting ninth, have been as dangerous, in their
own way, as some of the better twosomes who have played the game.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine has compared the two to Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco
in their Bash Brothers days with Oakland. The difference is
Henderson and Cedeno do it with their legs.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday night's game against the Orioles, Cedeno led the
major leagues in stolen bases with 50. Henderson, who is fifth in
the National League with 27 steals, has set 100 as the goal for
Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem a bit much for someone who had 23 career steals
over parts of four major-league seasons coming into this year, and
never more than nine in any one season.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone think Henderson does not know what he is talking
about, not only is he the major leagues' career leader in stolen
bases at 1,324, but he has stolen 100 or more bases three times
during his 20-year career, and 50 or more a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was recently asked, can Cedeno get to 130?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say never,'' Henderson said of the single-season
record he set in 1982. ``But not this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson was laughing at the time, just as he was when he told
Cedeno he might bring a rifle to the park if Cedeno gets close to
130. But one thing is almost certain: Cedeno, if he stays healthy,
will shatter the Mets' team record of 58 stolen bases, which Mookie
Wilson set in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know I had the record,'' said Wilson, who is the
Mets' first-base coach.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno praises Wilson long and hard for his development into one
of the best base stealers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk a lot,'' Wilson said this weekend. ``But I think
Roger's being a little more generous than he should be. He's a
student, and he realizes that can be a strength. And that's good.
Kids don't want to do that anymore. It's too much hard work, I
guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the Dodgers were thinking when they traded
him to us. It's amazing how much he's progressed. And Rickey's been
a big help. What's helped as much as anything is Rickey being there
to verify some of the things we've talked about. And he's been able
to look at Rickey and think: `He's successful. It works.'''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly has worked for the Mets.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Cleveland Indians have been the most ferocious dogs on the
major-league block this year, chewing up and spitting out opposing
pitchers en route to the best record in baseball.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their bark preceded their arrival in Houston, but Sunday their
bite was no more vicious than that of Tiny the Chihuahua _ the
Beanie Baby that helped lure 50,299 fans to the Astrodome, the
largest crowd the Astros have entertained since opening day.
</P>
<P>
   The flock might have turned out to get a Chihuahua, but it was a
Bulldog who stole the show. Mike ``Bulldog'' Hampton buried the
Indians' bats like bare bones, tossing a four-hit shutout in the
Astros' 2-0 victory in the opener of a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio, who was 3-for-4, scored one run and drove in the
other as the Astros stretched their season-best winning streak to
seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God we had Hamp and Bidge,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell
said. ``Otherwise, we would have been in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Astros were able to increase their National League
Central lead to two games over Cincinnati, which lost in extra
innings to Detroit on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The previous six victories in the Astros' streak came against
Kansas City and Detroit, but the bar was significantly raised when
the Indians brought an imposing .297 team batting average to town.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Hampton didn't notice. He made the Indians look like
every other team in the American League Central _ bad. The All-Star
lefthander faced the minimum number of batters through four innings
and allowed only two balls to leave the infield in the first six
innings _ and just five in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (12-3), whose two complete games this year have been
shutouts, struck out eight batters and recorded 15 ground-ball
outs. The Indians, who lead the majors with 586 runs, put men on
base in just four of their nine innings of torture.
</P>
<P>
   As a testament to Hampton's endurance, he retired 10 of the last
11 batters he faced. A strikeout of first baseman Richie Sexson
ended the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as good a game as I've ever seen Hampton pitch,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``A lot of people around
baseball who have to deal with the Indians will look at this box
score and say, `Hampton is an All-Star, no doubt about it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This was no accident. He was throwing the ball really well.''
</P>
<P>
   In typical Hampton fashion, he deflected praise to his teammates
and even referred to himself as ``just a lefty with a pulse.'' In
truth, he and Biggio were the closest things the Astros had to a
pulse. But they didn't need much more.
</P>
<P>
   Indians starter Jaret Wright (7-6) and relievers Tom Candiotti
and Paul Assenmacher combined to limit the Astros to four hits.
Glen Barker, who started in center field and reached on an infield
single in the second, was the only Astro other than Biggio to
collect a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the way we were swinging the bats, we needed Hamp
big-time today,'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Hampton's trip to last week's All-Star Game validated
him as a big-time pitcher and erased the label of inconsistency
that has haunted him throughout his career. Of late, there is
nothing inconsistent about the Astros' results when Hampton takes
the mound. They have won 22 of his last 28 starts dating to last
season, including 16 of 19 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do what Hampton did, it says a lot about his ability
to pitch,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said. ``He was awfully
good. Here's a guy who is 12-3. He's done this to a lot of people
besides the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's 2.81 ERA is second in the NL only to Arizona's Randy
Johnson, who is at 2.80. The Astros lefty hasn't allowed more than
three runs in any of his last seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to work both sides of the plate today, and I kept
the ball down for the most part,'' said Hampton, who began his
previous start with seven shutout innings. ``When you're facing the
Indians, you have to be at your best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to expect that you're going to shut them out,
because everyone on that team can hit. I left everything on the
field. When I got that last out, that was everything I had.''
</P>
<P>
   After Barker's speed netted a two-out infield single in the
second, Hampton drew a walk, and Biggio drove Barker home with a
single off Wright, who left after five innings because of tightness
in his right shoulder blade.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's most significant threat came in the sixth, when Omar
Vizquel and Roberto Alomar walked with two out. But Hampton got out
of the jam by striking out major-league RBI leader Manny Ramirez
for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton got a little breathing room when Biggio led off the
bottom of the eighth with his major-league-leading 39th double and
scored on Richard Hidalgo's groundout.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't nearly as dramatic or action-packed as the previous
day's 3-2 extra-inning victory over the Tigers, but the Astros will
take a win any way they can get one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tribute to our players that we're as far over .500 (17
games) as we are with all the injuries we've had,'' Dierker said.
``Honestly, I think we're doing it based on deep-down confidence
and the fact we expect to win.''

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BOSTON _ Apparently, Todd Martin is a better tennis player than he
is an actor. Sunday at Longwood Cricket Club, he wasn't good enough
at either.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There will be no Oscar for Martin for his last-minute attempt to
feign heat exhaustion and get out of the match. There also will be
no Davis Cup awarded to the United States after Martin surrendered
a two-set lead, losing 4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   With that victory, the second singles match became irrelevant as
Australia had the three points necessary to advance to the
semifinal round against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard not to be suspicious when Martin suddenly took ill
before the match and the Americans asked to be allowed to
substitute Pete Sampras for the first singles match against Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Tom Gullikson had hinted Martin might not be fit
enough to return after one day's rest and that Sampras might make
an appearance. Davis Cup rules allow substitution only in case of
illness or injury, not as a last-ditch attempt to avoid
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed (by Gullikson's comments Saturday),''
Martin said. ``I was very upset. I wanted to play. I didn't think I
was in bad enough shape not to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until Sunday, anyway. They tried. They failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was clearly suffering from effects of the heat, and he
shouldn't play,'' Gullikson said before the match.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies weren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been in the cards,'' Australian coach Tony
Roche said. ``We've always half-suspected this would happen. I'd be
awfully disappointed if Todd Martin is not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't the only ones with suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   It was dramatic enough. After about 30 minutes of warming up,
Martin went into the locker room and reported he felt too ill to
play. Heat exhaustion, they called it, thanks to an air temperature
of 96 degrees and on-court thermometer that reached 128 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit for about a half hour, and I felt exactly the way I did
when I walked off the court against Lleyton (Hewitt),'' Martin
said. ``I walked into the locker room and unfortunately sat in
front of the mirror. I didn't like the way I looked. I didn't like
the way I felt with five minutes of rest.''
</P>
<P>
   That was good enough for the U.S. team doctor, who was more than
willing to allow Sampras to substitute. Gullikson scurried to the
telephone to summon Sampras to the club. When Sampras arrived, he
immediately went to center court and began warming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommended that he should not play,'' U.S. team physician
Dr. David Altchek said of Martin. ``He definitely had the effects
of heat exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   But they had to pass inspection from a neutral doctor, whose
word is final. In this case, it was Dr. Rich Paul, a member of
Longwood Cricket Club (the International Tennis Federation does not
import doctors but uses local help). Paul offered a different
opinion on Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was examined by the neutral doctor here, and the doctor
looked at him and declared him able to play,'' said referee Stefan
Fransson.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's concern was for which opponent to prepare, information
that didn't reach him until 20 minutes before the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting fed up,'' Rafter said. ``I just wanted to know
who in the hell I was playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get a better sportsman in the world than
Todd. I have a lot of respect for Todd. I never thought Todd was
trying to pull one over on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some intravenous fluids must have done the trick, because Martin
didn't seem to be suffering early as he broke Rafter's first two
serves to surge to a 4-0 lead and eventually take the first set in
only 33 minutes. He looked fine as he broke Rafter in the 11th game
of the next set to take a two-set lead.
</P>
<P>
   But if he didn't become ill soon after, he certainly was by
match point, three hours and 14 minutes later. Not only did he lose
that lead, he also lost 3-0 and 4-2 edges in the fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was out there, I was obviously fit,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's fitness was never in question. The Aussie hasn't lost a
five-setter since 1994. He has won 11 consecutive since. In every
five-set win, he has come back to win the final two sets, one of
those coming against Martin at the 1998 Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get into that fifth set, I feel confident,'' Rafter
said. ``Although I'm down, I know I can go out and accomplish what
I need to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics weren't drastically different. Rafter had a few
more winners and not quite as many unforced errors. The bigger
difference came on the serve. The 6-7 Martin, who counts on his
serve as a weapon, was outaced by Rafter 21-9. Rafter handled
Martin's first serve well, allowing the American only a 67 percent
success rate. Rafter won 80 percent of his first serves.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Rafter was riding out on his teammates' shoulders.
Martin was sobbing in his towel as U.S. tennis took yet another
hit. The Americans, though, seem the only ones unaware.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister gave me a little message yesterday,'' Martin said.
``It talked about the procedure being more important, or the
process being more important than the end, and that is how I feel.
I feel like we should walk out of here with our heads held high.
Hopefully, we did some good for American tennis.''

SPECULATION ARISES OVER FUTURE OF GEORGE MAGAZINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Refiling for new lead; subs byline)  (See also: KENNEDY-RDP, KENNEDY-PILOT, KENNEDY-VIGIL,
KENNEDY-VOICES, KENNEDY-TV, KENNEDY-MAGS-REACT, KENNEDY-COLUMN) 
(jw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before John F. Kennedy Jr. took off in his plane on Friday,
the future of George, the political magazine that he founded and
built into a brand name, was in question. Now, with news that he is
reported lost and presumed dead, the fate of the magazine is even
more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Kennedy had been seen at the offices of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., an investment bank, where an executive close
to the talks said he was discussing with advisers strategic options
for the magazine. In particular, the executive said, Kennedy was
interested in finding a financial partner and had come up with a
list of companies he was interested in approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Since last spring there have been reports about what would
happen to George once the publishing contract between Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines and Kennedy's Random Ventures expired at the
end of this year. It was reported that Kennedy had met with Conde
Nast chief executive Steven Florio, among others. More recently,
the executive said, Kennedy had expanded his list of potential
investors, including Henry Kravis, a partner in Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &AMP; Co., the leveraged-buyout firm.
</P>
<P>
   In advertising and circulation, George is not faring well. Total
advertising pages have fallen by nearly one-third, to 247 for the
first six months of this year, compared with 360 for the first six
months of 1998, the Publishers Information Bureau reported. And
newsstand sales _ the closely monitored gauge of public enthusiasm
_ fell by 28.2 percent, to 90,867 copies an issue, in the last six
months of 1998. In that same period, total paid circulation dropped
5 percent, to 405,894.
</P>
<P>
   From its debut in 1995 until earlier this year, George had an
enthusiastic supporter in David Pecker, president and chief
executive officer of Hachette Filipacchi, the Paris company that
publishes the magazine. But Pecker left Hachette in March, and
executives say his replacement, Jack Kliger, has not been as
confident in George or in Kennedy's skills as a journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Still the appearance of Kennedy guaranteed publicity, which is
more than most magazines can expect from an editor. In March, at a
press conference to announce that former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
D-N.Y., would serve as a George advice columnist, Kennedy caused a
flurry of media attention when he floated the possibility that he
might run for mayor of New York. And in May he attracted more
publicity when he invited Larry Flynt, Hustler magazine publisher,
to sit at George's table at the White House Correspondents
Association dinner.

<P>
   AQUINNAH, Mass. _ As she walked up from the beach on Martha's
Vineyard Sunday, Patricia Lennon admitted she felt uncomfortable
lapping up the sun on the same sandy stretch where pieces of the
plane carrying John Kennedy Jr. , his wife and sister-in- law had
washed ashore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels kind of funny being here,'' said Lennon, a 34-
year-old lawyer from Pembroke, Mass., who was visiting the
fashionable resort island with her companion, John Gould.
</P>
<P>
   Gould and Lennon echoed the general sentiment of many here who
suddenly found their vacations interrupted by helicopters buzzing
overhead and the hordes of media chasing the story of the summer on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   They expressed sadness and disbelief that once again America's
most famous family had suffered another tragedy. But they also
wondered why the 38-year old novice pilot had chosen to fly on a
hazy night when the visibility was poor and others had chosen not
to chance it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not invincible,'' sighed Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   Even before search officials acknowledged Sunday night there was
little chance of finding Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy
and her sister Lauren alive, many people were already assuming the
worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. who was here this weekend to
attend a Democratic Senate campaign event, spoke of the former
president's son in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a gentleman without pretension,'' said Torricelli,
before he departed from the island's airport that had also been
turned into a makeshift media center.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy's uncle, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., was supposed
to join the dozen senators to talk strategy for the upcoming 2000
election. But as he has done so many times in the past when tragedy
has struck this close knit clan, the senator remained at the family
compound at Hyannis Port.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncomfortable humidity that that has hung over the
area, there were relatively few bathers on Philbin Beach, where
much of the plane debris has washed up. While the beaches were not
closed, officials blocked some of the road entrances to the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Police on small dune buggy-like vehicles rode up and down the
rocky terrain looking for more signs from the plane. Helicopters
hovered overhead and boats cruised back and forth near the
shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Propped up at one entrance to the beach was a chalkboard with
the words, ``Our prayers are with you John John, Carolyn and
Lauren.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tom and Melanie McGlade said they abandoned hope that the
three were alive the day before when they witnessed a severely
damaged wheel wash up on the sand in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of had a sinking feeling. They hit the water pretty
hard,'' said Tom McGlade, a 39-year-old broker from Darien, Conn.
Melanie McGlade also remembered how poor the visibility was on
Friday night, when the Kennedy plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   McGlade said they had gone for a walk on the beach but missed
the turn-off to their house because it was so dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so hazy we couldn't see anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy was a familiar face to many summer residents here,
particularly those who lived on the southwest tip of the island
known as Gay Head. His mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onnasis, owned a
house up from Philbin Beach and her son had continued to visit it
even after her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a regular guy,'' said Danny Johnson, one of the
few people who came out to the beach on Sunday. A female friend,
who asked not to be named, said she was stunned by the plane crash.
</P>

   ``I thought Caroline and John John were immune from the Kennedy
curse,'' she said. ``I thought they were survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this like the most epochal Greek tragedy ever,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys likely felt at home on this island where people
believe it is in poor taste to gawk at the many movers and shakers
who make their summer homes here. This is the same place where
President Clinton sought solace last summer after he admitted to
the nation that he had had an affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people looked at him as a celebrity. He was just
part of the community,'' said Tony Tavis, 21, a student from
Smithfield, R. I., who spends his summers here driving a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   But Tavis conceded that Kennedy's likely death has caused a stir
even in this low key place.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Wyman, a 29 year old web site designer from Boston lounging
on Philbin Beach, said he had been turned off by the media circus
surrounding the Kennedy crash. Wyman said he witnessed some
tourists rushing up the television cameras to give their reactions.
</P>
<P>
   But Wyman also conceded that some might find it strange that he
returned to the site of the media frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have been ghoulish by going to the beach,'' he said.
``But life goes on.''

COSTUME DESIGNER PATRICIA ZIPPRODT DIES AT 74
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va., Ill., Mass.)  (jw) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patricia Zipprodt, the Tony award-winning costume
designer whose career extended from theater to dance to opera to
film and television, died Saturday at her home in Greenwich
Village. She was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to her sister, Constance Zonka
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, as a headline writer once put it, Ms. Zipprodt had
the gift of garb. In her youth she studied art, and then one day at
the ballet she discovered her calling. She wanted to make the
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll design for the ballet,'' she recalled telling herself.
``I'll paint with fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later she described a play as a painting that moved.
``Instead of it holding still and you look at it, you hold still
and it scrolls by,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she realized her early dream of designing costumes for
ballet, she also designed for scores of Broadway shows, won Tony
awards for ``Fiddler on the Roof'' (1964), ``Cabaret'' (1966) and
``Sweet Charity'' (1985), along with many other prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Her costumes graced musicals like ``Pippin'' (1972) and
``Chicago'' (1975), Broadway plays like ``Plaza Suite'' (1968),
``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' (1983) and ``The Glass Menagerie''
(1983).
</P>
<P>
   Off-Broadway, her credits included ``Our Town'' (1959), ``The
Balcony'' (1960), ``Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the
Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad'' (1962) and ``The Blacks'' (1962).
She did wardrobes for the Boston Opera, the New York City Opera and
the Metropolitan Opera and for American Ballet Theater, the New
York City Ballet, the Houston Ballet and Ballet Hispanico.
</P>
<P>
   In Hollywood she left her imprint on ``The Graduate'' (1967). On
television she designed costumes for productions like ``The Glass
Menagerie'' on ABC in 1973 and ``Alice in Wonderland'' on WNET in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing Ms. Zipprodt's talent recently, the actor Joel Grey,
who worked with her in ``Cabaret'' in 1966, said: ``Her hands were
all over the work, whether or not it had to do with making a diaper
for Father Time or this very tattered but elegant
master-of-ceremonies tail coat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zipprodt's costumes for ``The Blacks'' brought her to the
attention of Jerome Robbins, who hired her when he made his debut
as a director with ``Oh Dad, Poor Dad.'' He called on her again for
his next show, the hit ``Fiddler on the Roof.'' From Robbins, she
said, she learned how to use color to help the audience track the
main characters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, she spent six months researching and designing more
than 300 costumes for the 38-member cast of ``Shogun,'' the musical
based on the James Clavell novel about a shipwrecked 17th-century
English navigator who is pivotal in a power struggle among Japanese
overlords.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a million-dollar budget, the assignment, Ms. Zipprodt
said, was harder than her work on ``Sunday in the Park With
George'' (1984), when the challenge was to design costumes that
suggested pointillism without actually using dots; or on the 1977
Metropolitan Opera production of ``Tannhaeuser,'' which called for
more than 200 people to appear onstage at one point.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Shogun,'' Ms. Zipprodt traveled to Japan, studied the
weaving industry in Kyoto that dated back to the world of
``Shogun'' and visited and photographed Kabuki theaters,
samurai-movie studios, gardens, castles and textile mills.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, she sought out Japanese women to consult on
tradition and custom and experimented in a workshop on West 22nd
Street with ways to duplicate ancient decorative techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Zipprodt was born in Chicago on Feb. 24, 1925. She was
the eldest of three daughters of Agnes Irene Turpin and Herbert
Edward Zipprodt, an advertising executive. In 1947, Ms. Zipprodt
received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in
Massachusetts. After graduation, she returned to Chicago and fell
in love with Lt. Col. Robert O'Brien Jr., an Army cavalryman, but
she declined his proposal because she felt she had to go to New
York and find out if she had any artistic talent.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, Ms. Zipprodt was living the bohemian life in New
York, where she painted at the Art Students League, studied at the
Fashion Institute of Technology and waited tables at Schrafft's
until her visit to the ballet altered her life forever.
</P>
<P>
   About seven or eight years ago, after O'Brien had married,
retired and become a widower, he came across a biography of Ms.
Zipprodt in a copy of Playbill in Washington. It mentioned that she
was an artist in residence at Brandeis University's theater
department. O'Brien called Brandeis and asked for her phone number,
which the university would not give out. So he told the university
to call her and pass along a message: ``Bob O'Brien called, and I
want to marry her.'' The university did as instructed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zipprodt and the colonel were married on June 5, 1993. She
lived in Upperville, Va., and in New York. O'Brien died in 1998.
Ms. Zipprodt was inducted into the Theatrical Hall of Fame in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   As meticulous as she might be, as committed to researching
history, assessing color, collecting swatches, cords and tassels
and overseeing the construction of costumes, Ms. Zipprodt never
forgot that her quest for authenticity and beauty was in the
service of the hectic and sometimes harrowing institution of show
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velcro,'' she once said, ``is our favorite word.''

WHITLOW WYATT, 91, PITCHER WHO STARRED WITH DODGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Mich., Ill., Ohio, Pa., Wis., Tenn.)  (cb) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whitlow Wyatt, a key figure in the Brooklyn Dodgers' celebrated
1941 National League pennant victory and a leading pitcher of the
early 1940s, died Friday at a hospital in Carrollton, Ga. Wyatt,
who lived in Buchanan, Ga., was 91.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling for a decade with three American League teams,
Wyatt, a hard-throwing and often intimidating right-hander,
flourished in Brooklyn, N.Y., in his mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   He won 22 games for the 1941 team that captured the Dodgers'
first pennant since 1920, touching off a huge victory parade. He
led the league in shutouts that season with seven, started in the
All-Star Game and finished third in the balloting for the league's
most valuable player, behind his fellow Dodgers Dolph Camilli and
Pete Reiser.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-game World Series remembered ruefully by Brooklyn fans
for Mickey Owen's disastrous passed ball, Wyatt posted the Dodgers'
only victory over the Yankees, outpitching Spud Chandler to win
game two by 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt won 70 games for the Dodgers from 1940 to 1943 and would
be remembered for pitching duels with the St. Louis Cardinals' Mort
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could sculpt a statue of what a pitcher should look like,
for form and grace and style, it would look like Whitlow Wyatt,''
Reiser once said.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitlow Wyatt, a native of Kensington, Ga., and the son of
a railroad engineer, made his big-league debut in 1929 with the
Detroit Tigers after attending Georgia Tech, which envisioned him
as a football star. He developed arm and elbow problems that
required surgery, and he won only 26 games in parts of nine seasons
with the Tigers, Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt considered retiring to his 700-acre farm in Buchanan, but
then won 23 games for Milwaukee of the American Association in
1938. The Dodgers' general manager, Larry MacPhail, collecting
veteran players as he rebuilt the franchise, obtained Wyatt for
$40,000 and three players.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt won his first four starts for the Dodgers in 1939, then
tore knee cartilage in a collision at first base while running out
a bunt against the Cincinnati Reds. He ended the season only 8-3,
and then had surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1940, having developed a slider to go with his fastball,
Wyatt posted a record of 15-14 and tied for the league lead in
shutouts with five.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, misadventure arrived again. One sultry afternoon in
June, Wyatt was in a scoreless encounter with the Reds' Paul
Derringer at Crosley Field. In the eighth inning, he reached for a
drink to wash down salt tablets. But suddenly his stomach was
afire, because the cup held not water, but mouthwash. Wyatt managed
to hit a home run in the 11th inning for a 1-0 lead, but became
sick to his stomach rounding the bases and had to leave the game.
Hugh Casey, relieving on short notice, promptly lost the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the year the Dodgers won a pennant behind a
pitching threesome from Dixie _ Wyatt, his fellow Georgian Casey,
an ace reliever, and the South Carolinian Kirby Higbe, also a
22-game winner. Wyatt pitched the pennant clincher, a shutout of
the Braves, after coming within two outs of a perfect game against
Boston in August.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt kept batters wary in an effort to gain an edge. He would
recall how Manager Leo Durocher gave him ``two or three hundred
dollars on top of my locker after knocking somebody down.''
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Cardinal shortstop Marty Marion was trying to
get the best of Wyatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion was in the box, smoothing out the dirt, taking his
time,'' Reiser remembered. ``Wyatt's standing out there, watching
him with those big green eyes. When Marion's finally set, Whit
yells, `You ready?' Wyatt winds up, fires it in, and down Marion
goes. I guess he was expecting it, because he got up laughing. Next
pitch _ wham! _ right in his ribs.
</P>
<P>
   ```Don't laugh when I'm on the mound,' Wyatt says.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt retired after the 1945 season _ his last year was spent
with the Philadelphia Phillies _ and had a career record of 106-95.
He later served as the pitching coach for the Phillies and the
Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves and managed in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, John Jr., of Cedartown, Ga.; a
daughter, Ellen Holstein, of Taylorsville, Ga.; two brothers, Jack,
of Chickamauga, Ga., and Harold, of Cedartown; two sisters, Eleanor
McCallie of Chattanooga, Tenn., and Leila Mullin of Cedartown; five
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt did not mellow when he became a pitching coach. Dismayed
when Robin Roberts, the future Hall of Famer of the Phillies,
refused to brush back hitters, Wyatt took the occasion to espouse
his baseball philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you ought to play it mean like Durocher did,'' Wyatt
said. ``They ought to hate you on the field. If it was my own
brother, I'd knock him down.''

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S NUCLEAR DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 19:
</P>
<P>
   Budget cuts and political changes have so weakened Russia's
once-formidable armed forces that Moscow's military planners now
feel obliged to rely on nuclear weapons to defend their frontiers
against even a non-nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   That alarming shift in planning was underscored by the extensive
war games Moscow recently conducted, the largest such maneuvers
since 1991. Faced with a simulated invasion by an unnamed Western
foe, Russian forces first responded with conventionally armed
defenders. But when these failed to halt the attacker's progress,
Russian commanders felt compelled to order nuclear strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has historically been responsible about nuclear weapons
use. Still, Americans should be concerned about the new defensive
plans. Russia has 6,000 nuclear warheads that can reach American
soil and thousands more available for use in Europe. The deep
nuclear weapons cuts of the late 1980s and early 1990s have halted
in recent years. While Russia and America now have only about half
as many intercontinental nuclear warheads as they did at the Cold
War's peak, that is still nearly three times as many as military
experts think they need.
</P>
<P>
   Even the treaty negotiated by President George Bush and
President Boris Yeltsin, which would cut both sides to about 3,500
warheads, has not yet been ratified by Russia's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the way around that obstacle may be to negotiate
deeper cuts, as the Clinton administration is now prepared to do.
Under the last treaty, Russia would have to replace multiwarhead
missiles with costly new single-warhead missiles to reach the
ceiling of 3,500. A new treaty that set ceilings at between 2,000
and 2,500 warheads would spare Russia much of this expense. Given
Moscow's desperate financial plight, the lower ceiling could
attract many parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
   The new administration position was announced when President
Clinton and Yeltsin met in Germany last month. It came as part of a
broader agreement that also included a new willingness on Russia's
part to discuss changes in the treaty restricting defensive missile
systems. Despite lingering tensions on other issues, this may be a
promising moment for progress on arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin are nearing the end of their terms. Both
could enhance their records by completing a major nuclear arms
reduction treaty. Yeltsin, who earlier did so much to turn Russia
away from the Cold War nuclear arms race, should not leave office
with Moscow's finances drained by a bloated nuclear arsenal and
Russia's generals tempted to use the weapons.

would not allow him to set the date on the clock of his Toshiba
510CDT laptop past 2079. So he performed a dangerous experiment: He
set the time to 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31, 2079, and let the clock roll
over to 2080. ``It was a big mistake,'' says Andre, a graduate

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John F. Kennedy Jr., a scion of the nation's most
celebrated political dynasty, was reported lost and presumed dead
in an accident that resounded this weekend with echoes of the
family's many misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, has been missing since Friday night after the plane
he was flying to a cousin's wedding on Cape Cod failed to arrive on
Martha's Vineyard. His disappearance in the prime of his life, like
the deaths of his father, two uncles, an aunt and two cousins
before him, only added to the perception that his larger-than-life
family has been besieged by a near-biblical blight.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, son of the 35th president, was touched by both the
Kennedy charisma and its curse. The public ached in 1963 as it
watched him, in his blue dresscoat and short pants, salute his
slain father. It cheered as he emerged with his dazzling bride from
their secret wedding in 1996. And as he sought a measure of privacy
even while forsaking a career in law or government for a role in
publishing, the public never ceased dwelling on his future and the
swings of his family's fortunes between triumph and disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding his life was a scriptural passage, Luke 12:48, that was
voiced frequently by his grandmother Rose and paraphrased by his
father: ``Of those to whom much is given, much is required.''
Kennedy taught English to underprivileged children, aided people
who were homeless and disabled, and was a patron of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   But like many sons of famous fathers, Kennedy still seemed to be
searching for his place in the public constellation, the
expectations for him as great as his father's legend was gripping.
And he was conscious of his burden as an American icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to talk about a legacy or a mystique,''
Kennedy said in a 1993 interview. ``It's my family. The fact that
there have been difficulties and hardships, or obstacles, makes us
closer.''
</P>
<P>
   He was most recently founder and editor of George, a glossy
journal of politics, but some of his family's admirers still hoped
his venture into publishing was merely a prologue to a career in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   While he helped the Democratic Party raise money, he never ran
for office. He made his political debut at the 1988 Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, where he introduced his uncle, Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. Invoking his father's inaugural speech,
which called a generation to public service, he received a
two-minute standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras swarmed after him wherever he went, whether it was as a
toddler playing under his father's desk in the White House, or as a
young lawyer and avid athlete who was often photographed shirtless.
In 1988 People Magazine called him ``the sexiest man alive.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. was born on Thanksgiving Day, Nov.
25, 1960, just three weeks after his father, John Fitzgerald
Kennedy, was elected president. He was the first infant to live in
the White House since 1893.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy's funeral was held on his son's third
birthday. In one indelible moment of family heartache and American
history, the boy stood outside St. Matthew's Cathedral in
Washington with his mother and sister, raising his hand in a salute
as he squinted in the sun while his father's coffin rolled by. His
mother, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, had leaned down and whispered
to him in advance to salute, a gesture the boy had seen many times
as military escorts greeted the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   After his father's death, his mother moved the family to an
apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Security was always
a major preoccupation. When her son was six, Mrs. Kennedy commented
on his maturity, adding, ``Sometimes it almost seems that he is
trying to protect me instead of just the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   He attended a Catholic elementary school and was so rambunctious
that Secret Service agents gave him the code name ``Lark.'' But his
mother worried about her children's safety, especially after Robert
F. Kennedy, their uncle, was assassinated in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets,''
Jacqueline Kennedy said at the time. ``I want to get out of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 20, 1968, she married Aristotle Socrates Onassis, a
Greek shipping magnate who was 29 years her senior, in part because
of his ability to provide the family security.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Onassis, one of the world's most fabled women, sought
desperately to give her children a normal life. Once when John was
13 and mugged in Central Park, his mother said it was a good
experience for him.
</P>
<P>
   According to family files recently made public, Mrs. Onassis
told her bodyguards that her son ``must be allowed to experience
life,'' and that ``unless he is allowed freedom, he'll be a
vegetable.''
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, John made a point of taking public transportation
in New York. ``I have a pretty normal life, surprisingly,'' he told
Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Collegiate School for Boys in New York but enrolled
in 11th grade at Philips Academy in Andover, Mass. Breaking with
family tradition, he went to Brown University instead of Harvard,
graduating in 1983. He majored in American history and was a member
of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   He once appeared to aspire to be an actor, and participated in
numerous amateur theater productions, but his mother worried that
the stage life would expose him too much to the media from which
she had tried to shelter him. Eventually, he enrolled in law school
at New York University, mostly, friends said, to please his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He failed the New York bar exam twice before passing, which
allowed him to keep his job as a prosecutor in the office of Robert
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. ``I'm clearly not a
major legal genius,'' he said after the New York tabloids labeled
him the ``Hunk Who Flunked.''
</P>
<P>
   After four years as an assistant district attorney, and a
perfect 6-0 conviction record, he let it be known that the law
bored him. As he left the district attorney's office, he told a
friend, ``I don't want to be just another passenger on a liner.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At 34, he started George magazine in a joint venture with
Hachette Filipacchi, a media conglomerate. For the scion of
America's most illustrious political dynasty, the magazine was a
vehicle that both connected him to his family's past and enabled
him to strike out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who did not use either his middle initial or Jr. on his
business cards, observed in a 1998 interview with USA Today, ``I
think everyone needs to feel they've created something that was
their own, on their own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in George as both an interviewer and essayist. In a
much-discussed George essay published in August 1997, he described
his first cousins Joseph and Michael as ``poster boys for bad
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to enjoy being provocative, posing semi-nude in George
and inviting Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt to be his
magazine's guest at the annual White House correspondents' dinner
in Washington last spring. Last March, he visited the imprisoned
boxer Mike Tyson, whom Kennedy pronounced ``a friend'' who was
``much different'' from his public image.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, 1996, he married a fashion publicist, Carolyn
Bessette, on a barrier island off the coast of Georgia. The couple
lived in Manhattan. He served on the boards of several family
foundations and a number of nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989 he had headed Reaching Up, a nonprofit group that
provides educational and other opportunities for workers who help
people with disabilities. William Ebenstein, executive director of
Reaching Up, said, ``He was always concerned with the working poor,
and his family always had an interest in helping them.'' Ebenstein
said Kennedy helped expand the organization.
</P>
<P>
   He also pursued his family's enthusiasm for all types of
athletic endeavors. The 6-foot-1, 190-pound fitness enthusiast
liked to bicycle, rollerblade, dance and throw footballs.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, he flew to South Dakota to visit Mount Rushmore.
Officials at the national shrine refused his request to rappel down
the monument, although he was permitted to climb onto the 60-foot
faces of Jefferson, Roosevelt, Lincoln and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He was sidelined after he broke his ankle over Memorial Day
weekend on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Although he repeatedly played down expectations that he would
one day mount his own political climb, the dream persisted. A few
months ago, Alfonse D'Amato, the former Republican senator from New
York who signed on as a contributor to George, said Kennedy would
make a strong candidate for mayor in New York City, a suggestion
that Kennedy laughed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A public career is _ it's a lot to bite off,'' he said in a
televised interview four years ago. ``And you better be ready for
it, and you better have your life set up for it, and you better be
prepared to do it for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is survived by his sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg,
of Manhattan.

   Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, whose marriage to John F. Kennedy Jr.
catapulted her and her understated glamour to fame, was reported
lost and presumed dead on a flight Friday to Martha's Vineyard,
Mass., along with her husband and her sister Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   She was 33.
</P>
<P>
   Until shortly before her marriage, Ms. Bessette Kennedy was an
executive at Calvin Klein Ltd. in New York. Her rise there _ from
saleswoman in Boston to director of publicity for Klein's flagship
line, the collection _ had been fast, but her achievements were
quickly overshadowed by her relationship with Kennedy, whom she
married in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After her marriage, she quickly became a fashion icon herself,
on the cover of numerous magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Since her marriage, she had distanced herself from the fashion
world, and settled into the role of Kennedy wife, with all the
public appearances and public attention that entailed. But she kept
a deliberately quiet profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very private woman,'' John F. Kennedy Jr. told USA
Today in 1998. ``It's like you go from having a life you've built
on your own terms, and all of a sudden it's being snatched away
from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bessette-Kennedy grew up amid the affluence of Greenwich,
Conn. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Her mother,
Ann, a teacher and administrator, later married Richard Freeman, an
orthopedic surgeon; the couple now live in New Canaan, Conn. Ms.
Bessette-Kennedy's father, William Bessette, an architectural
engineer, lives in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bessette-Kennedy had two sisters, Lauren and Lisa Ann,
identical twins who were born 18 months before her.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, who graduated from Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., was a
principal in the investment banking division at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. She joined the company in 1993 and spent several years in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette graduated from St. Mary's High School in
Greenwich in 1983 and went on to Boston University, where she
majored in elementary education. She graduated in January 1988, and
was briefly a nightclub promoter. She then began working at Klein's
Boston store.
</P>
<P>
   A Calvin Klein executive brought her to the fashion house's
headquarters in New York. She was hired to outfit the ``personals''
_ friends of the house, among them celebrities and socialites, who
bought wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wilmot, the former director of publicity for Calvin Klein
who hired her, said he was immediately struck by her intelligence
and poise. She easily juggled the demands of the job, he said,
which required both a keen fashion sense and attention to countless
administrative details.
</P>
<P>
   She was promoted to director of publicity of the ``collection,''
a job that entailed working with fashion editors as well as
coordinating the shows for the line.
</P>
<P>
   She began dating Kennedy in 1994. Their relationship was
relentlessly chronicled in the tabloid press, but their wedding, in
front of 40 people in a rundown church on a secluded island off
Georgia, was carefully scripted to elude publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Usually dressed in black, she had carefully colored blond hair
that she often wore slicked back into a bun, and she favored simple
clothing designers, such as Prada and Yohji Yamamoto.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons to her mother-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, were frequent _ the two shared a Roman Catholic heritage,
a thin, athletic physique, a cultivated mystique, and a fierce
possessiveness of their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Since her marriage, Ms. Bessette-Kennedy had largely shunned the
fashion world, as well as the press. Along with her husband, she
lent her presence, and sometimes her name, to numerous benefits and
cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she particularly missed being in the fashion
industry,'' said John Perry Barlow, a friend of the couple. ``She
still had plenty to do to adjust to being Mrs. John F. Kennedy
Jr.''

<HEADLINE>
SPORTS COLUMN: DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN ON BERRA'S MAGIC DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yogi Berra stayed away from Yankee Stadium for 14
years. On Sunday, Berra, easily one of the most popular players and
the greatest catcher in Yankee history, returned to Yankee Stadium
for an overdue tribute.
</P>
<P>
   He came for a day dedicated in his honor. This was an afternoon
filled with plaques and plaudits, antique banners, a trip to Italy,
an audience with the Pope, even a $100,000 contribution to the Yogi
Berra Museum. But for someone like Berra, a player whom former
teammate Bobby Richardson said had a knack for attracting good
fortune, this day called for something beyond gifts. This day
called for magic.
</P>
<P>
   So with tears dried, emotions under control, Berra settled down
on this great day and watched David Cone pitch a perfect game. He
not only watched, but watched with Don Larsen, his silver-haired
former teammate, who pitched the only perfect game in World Series
history. Berra caught it.
</P>
<P>
   Berra watched the game from Suite 332, Larsen from
Steinbrenner's private box, but they were on the same wavelength in
two dimensions at once. They were here at Yankee Stadium in the
moment with Cone, but they were transported back to Oct. 8, 1956,
when they had stronger arms and unfailing legs. Larsen pitched and
Berra caught a perfect game in Game 5 of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   On that day Mickey Mantle homered and made a hit-robbing catch
in the outfield. On Sunday Paul O'Neill made a great catch and
Chuck Knoblauch, the Yankee second baseman, made an outstanding
stop and throw to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was great,'' Berra said standing in the back of Joe
Torre's office. ``My day and Don Larsen's here, this was great.
Those pinstripes make you do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Berra said that both in 1956 and on Sunday afternoon he didn't
begin thinking perfection until late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing went through my mind until the seventh inning,'' Berra
said. ``That's when you always think about it. A guy has a
no-hitter, you don't think about it until you get by the seventh;
if you get by the seventh, then you start thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in Suite 332 on Sunday and behind the plate 43 years ago
Berra said the nerves hit at the start of the eighth inning. ``You
always think about it after that; you only need six more outs.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, holding court outside the office, talked about his great
day in 1956 and the effect the perfect game had on his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing this,'' he said, ``people don't care about the
mistakes you made. All they think about are the good things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Expos stood on the top step of their dugout like gawking
Little Leaguers on Sunday. Many of the Expos applauded as Yankee
legend after legend was introduced. The cheers for 70-year-old
Whitey Ford, who played his final game in 1967, were as loud as
those for 38-year old Don Mattingly, who retired in 1995. The
cheers underlined the sort of unbroken succession of tradition that
makes institutions great.
</P>
<P>
   And this was why Berra's official return was so crucial. Crucial
for Berra at a personal level, but absolutely crucial for
Steinbrenner, the Yankee boss who carelessly tossed Berra away 14
years ago when he had Clyde King deliver the news to Berra that he
was fired as Yankees manager. Berra vowed never to step back in the
stadium while Steinbrenner was the owner, and for 14 years he kept
his vow.
</P>
<P>
   Part of me wishes that Yogi had held out longer, made a
permanent stand against the reckless weight Steinbrenner so
carelessly throws around. For 14 years Yogi Berra held the Yankees
at bay, like the mom-and-pop firm that bravely resists corporate
takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   As you sat and watched legendary Yankee after Yankee honor Yogi
you realized how desperately George Steinbrenner needed Yogi Berra
back on board. Here amid these great former Yankees, Berra
graciously ended a rightful grudge. But this day also makes you
realize that the reach of this organization is greater than single
moments, the arrogance of a particular owner, personal grudges,
even great individual moments like Cone's perfect game. Progress
often depends on anesthetizing the past.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, there is life and business to attend to. Last week
Berra signed a two-year deal to join the advisory board of
AcuBid.com, an online auction house specializing in collectibles.
Berra will appear in a commercial for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Berra's son, Tim, manages a Web site that by the end of this
month will begin selling stuffed toy bears bearing Berra's
autograph for $450 apiece. The best-selling item so far is the ``It
Ain't Over Till It's Over'' baseball autographed by Berra.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me that ultimately, as great as Sunday was for
David Cone, even Cone's perfect game will be absorbed by a great
Yankee foundation already made up of world championships and
pennants and perfect games. David Wells threw a perfect game last
year. Now he's pitching for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   What actually framed this day, what will give Cone's moment
resonance, is Berra's presence and Berra's dramatic, emotional
return. Without Berra, the perfect game would simply be another
great moment. Yogi is larger than a moment. He flows easily in the
vocabulary of our cultural bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   How pervasive is Berra's influence? In the last week, an article
about a chess tournament in Oregon, an article about a fight over a
new law school in Florida and a critique of an abstract art exhibit
all used Berra's ``deja vu all over again'' remark. Sen. Bob Smith
of New Hampshire used Berra's line ``When you come to a fork in the
road, take it.'' A story about congestion in the Hamptons recalled
Berra's 1959 gem about a popular restaurant: ``Nobody goes there
any more; it's too crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was one of those perfect days when the kid in the sandlot
discovers the Holy Grail. Yogi Berra and Don Larsen sat back and
enjoyed Joe Girardi and David Cone and for two hours they were in
blissful yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   This was indeed deja vu all over again.

OFFICIALS CALL OFF SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS IN KENNEDY CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF AND JENNIFER BABSON AND  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Forty-eight hours after John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane
plunged into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, federal officials
Sunday ended their search for survivors, effectively declaring
Kennedy, his wife and her sister the victims of a fatal crash.
</P>
<P>
   The move came as an announcement by Coast Guard officials that
the intensive, multiagency mission had shifted from ``search and
rescue'' to ``search and recovery,'' a bureaucratic way of saying
hope had ended of finding them alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the result that we were looking for. This is not
the result we were hoping for,'' said Coast Guard Rear Admiral
Richard Larrabbee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Larrabbee said divers from the Massachusetts State
Police would begin work Monday investigating two ``potential
targets'' identified by sophisticated sonar as unusual objects on
the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   He strongly cautioned that, based on the information available
Sunday night, the targets ``don't in any way represent an aircraft
or any parts of it.'' He said the objects were in 60 feet to 80
feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabbee said the decision to end the rescue efforts were made
in consultation with the National Transportation Safety Board and
had been communicated to Kennedy's family and the family of his
passengers: his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister,
Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent some very painful moments with the families
tonight,'' a somber Larrabbee said. ``It was very difficult for me
to share the information with them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the move was based on four factors: the expected length
of survival time in the 68-degree waters is just 12 to 18 hours;
the plane had no emergency survival equipment; the two days of
searching found nothing to indicate anyone had survived; and the
NTSB's experience in assessing the probability of survival in this
type of crash.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, federal safety investigators said a rare feature
aboard Kennedy's small plane _ a voice recorder _ might provide
clues to the Friday night crash.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, questions arose whether search and rescue
operations might have begun five hours earlier had proper
procedures been followed when a Martha's Vineyard Airport employee
tried to alert authorities that the flight was overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Larrabee's announcement, the mood grew increasingly
somber at the Kennedy family's Hyannis Port compound, where three
priests clad in white celebrated Mass under a white tent. Senator
Edward M. Kennedy held a wine chalice while one of the priests
distributed Communion wafers. Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F.
Kennedy, also served consecrated wine to the dozen or so people who
attended the service.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon press briefing, the chairman of the NTSB
cautioned that the investigation into the crash would take six to
nine months, and the cause might remain elusive. ``At this point we
do not know. We will not know for some time. There is even a
possibility we will never know,'' NTSB Chairman James Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Coast Guard searchers turned up only bits of a headrest
and foam insulation they believe came from Kennedy's single-engine
airplane. The insulation, in pieces ranging from 2 to 10 inches in
diameter, were found along a mile-long stretch of beach by
Aquinnah, an area known as Gay Head. Coast Guard officials said
widespread reports of an oil slick near the search area Sunday were
unrelated.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, investigators found a seat, a headrest, a nose
wheel, several other airplane parts, a suitcase belonging to Lauren
Bessette, and a prescription bottle belonging to Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's six-seat Piper Saratoga II HP did not have ``black
boxes,'' devices required on all commercial planes that record
cockpit conversations and radio transmissions as well as many
parameters of an airplane's performance. However, Kennedy's plane
did have a manual voice recorder, a device that is mostly unheard
of on all but the most recent models of private planes.
</P>
<P>
   The voice recorder, installed after the plane left the factory,
would capture any radio transmissions and possibly some of
Kennedy's utterances to his passengers, but would have had to be
turned on by the pilot for it to operate.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the recorder would yield much
information. An official with the NTSB, which assumed control of
the investigation Sunday, said a review of radio traffic showed
that ground controllers received no communications or distress
calls from the plane in the last 40 minutes it was known to have
been in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investigators were hoping that Kennedy turned on the
recorder before he taxied out to takeoff and that it might capture
something that air traffic controllers never heard _ a mayday call,
or something that would reveal details of the final moments of the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB assigned an investigator to track down the person who
installed the device in an attempt to learn more about it, federal
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the response time of the search effort were
prompted by the actions Friday night of Adam Budd, a ramp attendent
at the Martha's Vineyard Airport. Budd, 21, of Sharon, Mass., said
he waited with a couple and their young daughter for the Kennedy
plane to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 p.m., the anticipated arrival time, Budd said, he
checked with the tower but was told there was no sign of the plane
and there was no indication that Kennedy had radioed a request to
land.
</P>
<P>
   Budd said he then telephoned Bridgeport Automated Flight Service
Station in Connecticut, an FAA-run facility where pilots sometimes
file their flight plans. Kennedy was not required to file a flight
plan, and had not done so.
</P>
<P>
   Budd said he talked to an operator at the Bridgeport station,
whose toll-free number is well-known to area pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him the tail number (of Kennedy's plane), and I asked
them if they had the tail number'' on a flight plan, Budd said. The
operator was unresponsive, Budd said: ``He just didn't want to talk
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   George Mackie, an operations supervisor at the Bridgeport
station, said Sunday that Budd's call should have triggered a
search by the center.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a pilot is flying under visual flight rules, as Kennedy
was, and has not filed a flight plan, the flight service is
expected to begin searching for an aircraft once it has been
identified as late, Mackie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone calls us and tells us an airplane is late, we will
begin a search that usually starts with telephone calls,'' he said.
The telephone inquiry usually consists of contacting small airports
in the area, the FAA, and, eventually, the Air Force's Air Rescue
Coordination Center in Virginia, Mackie said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, a search was not initiated until after a
Kennedy family friend called the Coast Guard at Woods Hole at about
2:15 a.m. Saturday. The first search vessel was launched at about
4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA, which oversees the Bridgeport center, has declined to
comment on the investigation and the response time.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement that the plane might have been found was triggered
Sunday when Coast Guard officials said a beacon signal was heard at
about 3:30 p.m. by a huge Air Force C-130 that has been providing
in-flight air control for the intensive air, water, and land search
that began early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard immediately dispatched the Rude (pronounced
Rudy), a 90-foot ship belonging to the National Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration that is equipped with sonar capable of
creating detailed images of objects beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, however, Larrabbee said the beacon signal appeared
to have been a false alarm, possibly set off by a marker the Coast
Guard had placed in the water to keep track of areas already
searched.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier beacon signal picked up before dawn Saturday off
Montauk, Long Island, also was said to be unrelated to the Kennedy
search.
</P>
<P>
   The tent at the Kennedy compound where the Mass was said had
been intended for 275 guests invited to the wedding of Rory
Kennedy, the youngest daughter of RFK. John F. Kennedy Jr., 38, and
his 33-year-old wife had planned to attend the wedding Saturday
after dropping off Lauren Bessette, 34, on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding was postponed indefinitely, and would-be wedding
guests began trickling into Barnstable Municipal Airport in Hyannis
Sunday to catch flights home. A friend of the Kennedy family said
hope had dimmed by Saturday evening, and talk of survivors had been
replaced by discussions of memorial services.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the compound at Hyannis Port, where so many of the
family's joys and tragedies have been played out, the Kennedys had
no illusions about the news from Martha's Vineyard, family friends
and associates said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing as they always do: getting through this and
dealing with it,'' said Robert Shrum, a friend and adviser of
Edward Kennedy. ``It is obviously very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, NTSB officials gave the most complete account to
date of Kennedy's fateful flight.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pearce, an NTSB regional director who is heading the
Kennedy investigation, said the plane took off at 8:38 p.m. from
Runway 22 at Essex County Airport in Fairfield, N.J. Kennedy had to
make an immediate 180-degree turn to point his plane in a
northeasterly direction.
</P>
<P>
   He headed north at an altitude of 5,600 feet along the
Connecticut coast. He passed over Westerly, R.I., at 9:26 p.m., at
that same altitude. He then began his descent toward Martha's
Vineyard, though Pearce said his precise rate of descent was not
clear.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:40 p.m., two radar stations at Cape Cod picked up the plane
at 2,500 feet, 17 or 18 miles west of Martha's Vineyard Airport,
which means he was about 10 or 11 miles off the island's coast.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped from 2,500 to
1,800 feet. After that point _ at 9:40:29 p.m. _ the plane
disappeared from radar.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John F. Kennedy Jr., a scion of the nation's most
celebrated political dynasty, was reported lost and presumed dead
in an accident that resounded this weekend with echoes of the
family's many misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, 38, has been missing since Friday night after the plane
he was flying to a cousin's wedding on Cape Cod failed to arrive on
Martha's Vineyard. His disappearance in the prime of his life, like
the deaths of his father, two uncles, an aunt and two cousins
before him, only added to the perception that his larger-than-life
family has been besieged by a near-biblical blight.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, son of the 35th president, was touched by both the
Kennedy charisma and its curse. The public ached in 1963 as it
watched him, in his blue dresscoat and short pants, salute his
slain father. It cheered as he emerged with his dazzling bride from
their secret wedding in 1996. And as he sought a measure of privacy
even while forsaking a career in law or government for a role in
publishing, the public never ceased dwelling on his future and the
swings of his family's fortunes between triumph and disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Guiding his life was a scriptural passage, Luke 12:48, that was
voiced frequently by his grandmother Rose and paraphrased by his
father: ``Of those to whom much is given, much is required.''
Kennedy taught English to underprivileged children, aided people
who were homeless and disabled, and was a patron of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   But like many sons of famous fathers, Kennedy still seemed to be
searching for his place in the public constellation, the
expectations for him as great as his father's legend was gripping.
And he was conscious of his burden as an American icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to talk about a legacy or a mystique,''
Kennedy said in a 1993 interview. ``It's my family. The fact that
there have been difficulties and hardships, or obstacles, makes us
closer.''
</P>
<P>
   He was most recently founder and editor of George, a glossy
journal of politics, but some of his family's admirers still hoped
his venture into publishing was merely a prologue to a career in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   While he helped the Democratic Party raise money, he never ran
for office. He made his political debut at the 1988 Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta, where he introduced his uncle, Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. Invoking his father's inaugural speech,
which called a generation to public service, he received a
two-minute standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras swarmed after him wherever he went, whether it was as a
toddler playing under his father's desk in the White House, or as a
young lawyer and avid athlete who was often photographed shirtless.
In 1988 People Magazine called him ``the sexiest man alive.''
</P>
<P>
   John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. was born on Thanksgiving Day, Nov.
25, 1960, just three weeks after his father, John Fitzgerald
Kennedy, was elected president. He was the first infant to live in
the White House since 1893.
</P>
<P>
   President Kennedy's funeral was held on his son's third
birthday. In one indelible moment of family heartache and American
history, the boy stood outside St. Matthew's Cathedral in
Washington with his mother and sister, raising his hand in a salute
as he squinted in the sun while his father's coffin rolled by. His
mother, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, had leaned down and whispered
to him in advance to salute, a gesture the boy had seen many times
as military escorts greeted the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   After his father's death, his mother moved the family to an
apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Security was always
a major preoccupation. When her son was six, Mrs. Kennedy commented
on his maturity, adding, ``Sometimes it almost seems that he is
trying to protect me instead of just the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   He attended a Catholic elementary school and was so rambunctious
that Secret Service agents gave him the code name ``Lark.'' But his
mother worried about her children's safety, especially after Robert
F. Kennedy, their uncle, was assassinated in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets,''
Jacqueline Kennedy said at the time. ``I want to get out of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 20, 1968, she married Aristotle Socrates Onassis, a
Greek shipping magnate who was 29 years her senior, in part because
of his ability to provide the family security.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Onassis, one of the world's most fabled women, sought
desperately to give her children a normal life. Once when John was
13 and mugged in Central Park, his mother said it was a good
experience for him.
</P>
<P>
   According to family files recently made public, Mrs. Onassis
told her bodyguards that her son ``must be allowed to experience
life,'' and that ``unless he is allowed freedom, he'll be a
vegetable.''
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, John made a point of taking public transportation
in New York. ``I have a pretty normal life, surprisingly,'' he told
Larry King.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Collegiate School for Boys in New York but enrolled
in 11th grade at Philips Academy in Andover, Mass. Breaking with
family tradition, he went to Brown University instead of Harvard,
graduating in 1983. He majored in American history and was a member
of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   He once appeared to aspire to be an actor, and participated in
numerous amateur theater productions, but his mother worried that
the stage life would expose him too much to the media from which
she had tried to shelter him. Eventually, he enrolled in law school
at New York University, mostly, friends said, to please his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He failed the New York bar exam twice before passing, which
allowed him to keep his job as a prosecutor in the office of Robert
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. ``I'm clearly not a
major legal genius,'' he said after the New York tabloids labeled
him the ``Hunk Who Flunked.''
</P>
<P>
   After four years as an assistant district attorney, and a
perfect 6-0 conviction record, he let it be known that the law
bored him. As he left the district attorney's office, he told a
friend, ``I don't want to be just another passenger on a liner.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At 34, he started George magazine in a joint venture with
Hachette Filipacchi, a media conglomerate. For the scion of
America's most illustrious political dynasty, the magazine was a
vehicle that both connected him to his family's past and enabled
him to strike out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who did not use either his middle initial or Jr. on his
business cards, observed in a 1998 interview with USA Today, ``I
think everyone needs to feel they've created something that was
their own, on their own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in George as both an interviewer and essayist. In a
much-discussed George essay published in August 1997, he described
his first cousins Joseph and Michael as ``poster boys for bad
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to enjoy being provocative, posing semi-nude in George
and inviting Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt to be his
magazine's guest at the annual White House correspondents' dinner
in Washington last spring. Last March, he visited the imprisoned
boxer Mike Tyson, whom Kennedy pronounced ``a friend'' who was
``much different'' from his public image.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 21, 1996, he married a fashion publicist, Carolyn
Bessette, on a barrier island off the coast of Georgia. The couple
lived in Manhattan. He served on the boards of several family
foundations and a number of nonprofit organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989 he had headed Reaching Up, a nonprofit group that
provides educational and other opportunities for workers who help
people with disabilities. William Ebenstein, executive director of
Reaching Up, said, ``He was always concerned with the working poor,
and his family always had an interest in helping them.'' Ebenstein
said Kennedy helped expand the organization.
</P>
<P>
   He also pursued his family's enthusiasm for all types of
athletic endeavors. The 6-foot-1, 190-pound fitness enthusiast
liked to bicycle, rollerblade, dance and throw footballs.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, he flew to South Dakota to visit Mount Rushmore.
Officials at the national shrine refused his request to rappel down
the monument, although he was permitted to climb onto the 60-foot
faces of Jefferson, Roosevelt, Lincoln and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He was sidelined after he broke his ankle over Memorial Day
weekend on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Although he repeatedly played down expectations that he would
one day mount his own political climb, the dream persisted. A few
months ago, Alfonse D'Amato, the former Republican senator from New
York who signed on as a contributor to George, said Kennedy would
make a strong candidate for mayor in New York City, a suggestion
that Kennedy laughed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``A public career is _ it's a lot to bite off,'' he said in a
televised interview four years ago. ``And you better be ready for
it, and you better have your life set up for it, and you better be
prepared to do it for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is survived by his sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg,
of Manhattan.

   Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, whose marriage to John F. Kennedy Jr.
catapulted her and her understated glamour to fame, was reported
lost and presumed dead on a flight Friday to Martha's Vineyard,
Mass., along with her husband and her sister Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   She was 33.
</P>
<P>
   Until shortly before her marriage, Ms. Bessette Kennedy was an
executive at Calvin Klein Ltd. in New York. Her rise there _ from
saleswoman in Boston to director of publicity for Klein's flagship
line, the collection _ had been fast, but her achievements were
quickly overshadowed by her relationship with Kennedy, whom she
married in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After her marriage, she quickly became a fashion icon herself,
on the cover of numerous magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Since her marriage, she had distanced herself from the fashion
world, and settled into the role of Kennedy wife, with all the
public appearances and public attention that entailed. But she kept
a deliberately quiet profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very private woman,'' John F. Kennedy Jr. told USA
Today in 1998. ``It's like you go from having a life you've built
on your own terms, and all of a sudden it's being snatched away
from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bessette-Kennedy grew up amid the affluence of Greenwich,
Conn. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Her mother,
Ann, a teacher and administrator, later married Richard Freeman, an
orthopedic surgeon; the couple now live in New Canaan, Conn. Ms.
Bessette-Kennedy's father, William Bessette, an architectural
engineer, lives in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bessette-Kennedy had two sisters, Lauren and Lisa Ann,
identical twins who were born 18 months before her.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren, who graduated from Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., was a
principal in the investment banking division at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. She joined the company in 1993 and spent several years in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Bessette graduated from St. Mary's High School in
Greenwich in 1983 and went on to Boston University, where she
majored in elementary education. She graduated in January 1988, and
was briefly a nightclub promoter. She then began working at Klein's
Boston store.
</P>
<P>
   A Calvin Klein executive brought her to the fashion house's
headquarters in New York. She was hired to outfit the ``personals''
_ friends of the house, among them celebrities and socialites, who
bought wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wilmot, the former director of publicity for Calvin Klein
who hired her, said he was immediately struck by her intelligence
and poise. She easily juggled the demands of the job, he said,
which required both a keen fashion sense and attention to countless
administrative details.
</P>
<P>
   She was promoted to director of publicity of the ``collection,''
a job that entailed working with fashion editors as well as
coordinating the shows for the line.
</P>
<P>
   She began dating Kennedy in 1994. Their relationship was
relentlessly chronicled in the tabloid press, but their wedding, in
front of 40 people in a rundown church on a secluded island off
Georgia, was carefully scripted to elude publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Usually dressed in black, she had carefully colored blond hair
that she often wore slicked back into a bun, and she favored simple
clothing designers, such as Prada and Yohji Yamamoto.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons to her mother-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, were frequent _ the two shared a Roman Catholic heritage,
a thin, athletic physique, a cultivated mystique, and a fierce
possessiveness of their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Since her marriage, Ms. Bessette-Kennedy had largely shunned the
fashion world, as well as the press. Along with her husband, she
lent her presence, and sometimes her name, to numerous benefits and
cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she particularly missed being in the fashion
industry,'' said John Perry Barlow, a friend of the couple. ``She
still had plenty to do to adjust to being Mrs. John F. Kennedy
Jr.''

WELLS HAS A QUICK WELCOME BY PHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After David Cone was joyously carried off the field
by his teammates, after he finished hugging everyone in a Yankee
uniform and after he pointed to different corners of Yankee Stadium
to thank the fans who supported every emotional pitch of his
perfect game, he returned to the clubhouse, and a telephone call
was waiting. It was David Wells, and the perfect pitcher had
perfect timing.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who pitched a perfect game 14 months ago for the Yankees
on another memorable Sunday, was pitching batting practice to his
son, Brandon, at the Skydome in Toronto when a clubhouse attendant
told him Cone had a perfect game through seven innings. So Wells
stopped playing and watched the last two innings of the masterpiece
on television and then wanted to be the first non-Yankee to
congratulate his friend. Wells succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got bigger goose bumps than you do,'' shouted Wells.
``I'm glad you did it. Welcome to the club.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wells pitched his perfect game against the Minnesota Twins
on May 17, 1998, he explained how Cone had relaxed him late in the
contest by telling him that it was time to use a knuckle ball.
While other players were partaking in the baseball tradition of
avoiding Wells as he worked on achieving perfection, Cone sat
beside Wells and helped calm him. Instead of being able to calm
Cone, Wells called and drained a beer in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a thing of beauty,'' said Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's overcome a lot of obstacles in his career and for him to
do it in New York, where he is well loved, he is the man of New
York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone, who is expected to receive a key to the city from Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani this week, is poised to become a man of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   By the seventh inning Sunday, Andrew Levy, who runs Wish You
Were Here Productions and is the vice president of the David Cone
Foundation, had received two calls from memorabilia companies that
wanted to bid for the exclusive rights to Cone's autograph. Three
hours after Cone's perfect game, Levy said a total of six
memorabilia companies had already contacted him. He expected even
more during normal business hours Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said that Wells was inundated in the same manner and
eventually signed a one-year autograph deal. If Cone, 36, did the
same thing, he could make more than $1 million for just signing his
name, according to one person who is familiar with the memorabilia
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cone would have to agree to sign exclusively for one company and
would then put the date of 7/18/99 and ``p.g.'' for ``perfect
game'' on every item. But Cone has been long wary of accepting
money for autographs, so he would likely try to align any contract
with his charitable foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be done the right way and the way David wants it,''
said Levy. ``I don't know his feelings about it yet, but, any time
he has done anything involving autographs, he has always wanted it
to involve his charitable programs. I know how he's said in the
past that people can get an autograph if they make a donation to
the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to companies seeking Cone's autograph, several
television shows also want him as a guest. ``This Morning'' and the
``Regis and Kathy Lee'' show called about booking Cone this week,
and he is tentatively scheduled to do the ``Late Show with David
Letterman'' on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen restaurants called Levy and offered to play host to
Cone, his wife, Lynn, and the Yankees for a celebration Sunday
night, but Cone declined. Actor Kevin Costner called to
congratulate Cone, Kraft Foods is interested in using him as a
spokesman and an outfit called Wow Wings, which sells chicken wings
in Long Island, also inquired about using Cone to endorse its
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone hasn't stopped ringing,'' said Levy. ``It's been
hectic.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Mets watched Cone, the former Met, finish off the 27 Expos
in the visitors' clubhouse at Camden Yards in Baltimore on Sunday.
After Cone retired Orlando Cabrera on a pop out to third base to
end the game, John Franco asked Jay Horwitz, the Mets' public
relations director, to send his former teammate a bottle of Dom
Perignon champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't is funny how the Mets don't have one no-hitter and two
ex-Mets go to the Yankees and get a no-hitter, one a perfect
game,'' Franco said, referring to Cone and Dwight Gooden, who
pitched a no-hitter in May 1996. ``I knew they shouldn't have let
Coney go.''

ALL NORMAL WITH KENNEDY FLIGHT _ UNTIL A SUDDEN DESCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Makes altitude 5,600 feet thruout)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just after dusk on Friday, John F. Kennedy Jr., hobbled by a
broken foot, limped to the flight line of a small airport in
Fairfield, N.J. to inspect his Piper Saratoga HP airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied with the plane's condition, Kennedy eased himself into
the left pilot's seat and prepared for the routine 125-mile flight
to an airport near his late mother's homestead on Martha's
Vineyard. His wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her older sister,
Lauren Bessette, climbed aboard the six-seat plane.
</P>
<P>
   The engine turned. The instruments came to life. Within minutes,
the powerful single-engine plane roared down Runway 22 and climbed
into the hazy evening sky.
</P>
<P>
   No one has seen it since.
</P>
<P>
   Although his trip to Massachusetts was routine, the series of
decisions Kennedy made that night _ flying a complex aircraft
without a flight plan, choosing not to have his flight instructor
accompany him in marginal weather conditions, and piloting an
airplane with a foot injury _ have grown in significance against
the backdrop of a massive search-and-rescue operation under way
just off Aquinnah, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Piper Saratoga vanished from radar screens after a rapid
descent at 9:38 p.m. Friday, about an hour into his flight and
about 17 miles away from Martha's Vineyard airport. Sunday,
searchers recovered bits of the aircraft's fuselage and interior;
on Saturday, they had found a wheel strut and a piece of canvas
luggage with one of Lauren Bissette's business cards attached.
</P>
<P>
   While Kennedy had not mastered all the intricacies of the
plane's equipment, officials hope he was familiar with at least
one: the cockpit voice recording equipment that had been installed
in the Saratoga by its first owner in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy on-off switch,'' said Munir Hussein, its second
owner, who sold the plane to Kennedy through a broker in April for
$300,000. ``I used it several times and it worked perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say the recorder, which captures the words of a
pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit, can shed
light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29
seconds and apparently plunge into the Atlantic Ocean just off
Aquinnah, known as Gay Head.
</P>
<P>
   The details of what happened in the hour before Kennedy's plane
disappeared may not be known until _ or unless _ the aircraft is
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators do know the flight seemed routine until the
very end, according to the review of radar tapes from at least a
half-dozen Federal Aviation Adminsitration facilities along the
south coast of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had intended to make a daytime flight Friday, but was
delayed when his sister-in-law couldn't leave work early enough,
and he encountered traffic coming out of New York, the Associated
Press quoted a friend as saying. But family friends told the Globe
they believed Kennedy had planned to leave when he did.
</P>
<P>
   After takeoff, Kennedy cruised eastward, flying at 5,600 feet, a
standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight
rules, procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly
by what they can see.
</P>
<P>
   As he flew through gathering darkness, only a few stars emerged
through the haze, and a slim crescent moon glowed in the night sky.
</P>
<P>
   Two other pilots familiar with Kennedy's flight experience _
fewer than 100 hours of time alone _ shook their heads as his plane
lifted off. They knew that Kennedy was learning to fly the Saratoga
by instruments alone, but that he wasn't yet qualified to do it on
a solo flight.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kennedy told a business associate in Canada last Monday
that for the time being, he'd rather fly with a copilot because his
broken foot made it difficult for him to operate pedals controlling
the plane's rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Radar stations along the southern New England coast tracked the
plane. But because Kennedy chose not to file an official flight
plan, and had no contact with air-traffic controllers after leaving
New Jersey, no one knew his precise route _ or that he was piloting
the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Morningstar, a private pilot and spokesman for the
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, said it was not unusual for
a pilot to fly without filing a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morningstar said, ``a flight plan is really an insurance
policy, not an air traffic control document.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would a VFR flight plan have started search and rescue
earlier?'' he said. ``Yes, it probably would have.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most of Kennedy's flight, everything went smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:39, nearly an hour after it had taken off from New Jersey,
Kennedy's plane was about 10 minutes away from the Martha's
Vineyard airport when it began a sudden and steady descent. Over
the next 29 seconds, the plane dropped 700 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It then disappeared from all radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Sunday that the air controllers at the
Martha's Vineyard airport did not realize that Kennedy's plane was
overdue until sometime Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The air-traffic controller at Martha's Vineyard airport was
scheduled to leave at 10 p.m. Friday, and the airport's runway
lights were dimmed. To brighten them, an approaching pilot must
tune his or her radio to the tower frequency and click the
microphone five times in five seconds, or seven times in seven
seconds to reach their maximum wattage.
</P>
<P>
   Until the plane's sudden drop, the radar tapes from the FAA
facility used to guide planes in and out of T.F. Green Airport
airspace in Rhode Island indicate a normal flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a plot on him, we were able to determine which plane
was his and he was flying at 5,600 feet,'' said Howard Barte, the
controller's union local president in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came within 17 miles west of Martha's Vineyard, and then in
the last few minutes he seemed to descend rather steeply for that
airplane. The last hit was at 1,800 feet and then we lost contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just over the last couple of minutes of the flight that
this happened,'' Barte said. ``Maybe in five more minutes he would
have contacted the Martha's Vineyard tower and begun his descent,
but this rate of descent was not normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see something like this, you have to ask: Was theresomething wrong with the plane, or with the pilot? Because that is
all there is.''
</P>

KNOBLAUCH RESCUES A PERFECT GAME AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With BBA-YANKS-EXPOS, BBA-YANKS-CONE, BBA-RHODEN-COLUMN,

(mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone will get his line in the record books for
a perfect game right below David Wells'. Anyone who wants to read
between the lines, though, will see Chuck Knoblauch's name there.
</P>
<P>
   In as bizarre a development as two perfect games 14 months apart
could produce, Knoblauch figured prominently in preserving both
with plays at the same time of the game.
</P>
<P>
   When Wells was working on his perfect game against Minnesota on
May 17 last season, he had one out in the eighth inning when Ron
Coomer rapped a hard grounder toward Knoblauch near second base.
Knoblauch knocked the ball down, retrieved it and threw to first
for out No. 23.
</P>
<P>
   As Cone was working on his perfect game against Montreal Sunday,
he had one out in the eighth inning when Jose Vidro rapped a hard
grounder to Knoblauch's right. Knoblauch darted toward second,
fielded the ball backhanded and threw to first for out No. 23.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance, the grounder came the closest of any play to
being a hit as the pitcher neared perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the count 2-0,'' Knoblauch said, discussing Vidro's
grounder, ``I moved a little to my left expecting him to maybe pull
it, and he hit it up the middle. In that situation, I'm thinking of
diving for it, but I was able to get to it on my feet and just
planted and threw.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who has had great difficulty making accurate throws
to first base this season, took an extra second to make sure he had
good footing. ``I think I was on the grass,'' he explained. ``In
that situation you don't want to have your feet slip out from under
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Wells game, the second baseman recalled, ``That ball was
more right on me. It was hard hit and took a high hop on me.''
</P>
<P>
   There might not have been a need for a heroic eighth-inning play
Sunday if Paul O'Neill had not made a sterling play of his own on
the second batter of the game. Terry Jones hit a sinking line drive
to right-center field, and O'Neill made a diving catch, then
tumbled along the ground. ``You can't see the ball off the bat,''
O'Neill said. ``It's hazy out there. I was glad that play was in
the first inning and not the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee had a similar experience in the ninth inning with
one out. Shane Andrews lofted a fly ball to medium left field, and
Ledee seemed to come in for it hesitantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said before the inning if the ball comes to me, I might have
trouble because of the glare,'' he said. As an example of what he
meant, he said he never saw the ball when Vidro hit the grounder
that Knoblauch snared.
</P>
<P>
   But after the game, Cone was grateful for Ledee's effort. ``He
thanked me like 700 times,'' the left fielder said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone also was grateful for something Chili Davis did, although
it was not a defensive play because Davis, the designated hitter,
does not play defense. When Cone went out to warm up for the
seventh inning, no one was behind the plate to catch his pitches.
Joe Girardi had been the on-deck hitter when the sixth inning ended
and had to put on his equipment. So Davis reluctantly donned a
mask, grabbed a catcher's glove and went to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go out there, but there was no one else and
he was just standing out there,'' Davis said. ``I didn't want to
break up the karma between him and Girardi. I'm looking over,
thinking come on, Joe, I don't want to be out here. David threw
three pitches and Girardi came out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cone appreciated the gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put on the mask and sat back there,'' Cone said. ``He said,
`You can go ahead and let it go now. I used to catch in the minor
leagues.' It might not sound that funny, but some little comment
like that helps break the ice and gets you talking a little bit. It
can help. It was nice that Chili was there. He wasn't afraid to say
something to me and I appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was told that Davis did not want to break the pattern he
had with Girardi, Cone said: ``I wasn't aware of it, but the
important thing is not to leave me standing out there. Someone's
got to come out and play catch with me. I'd rather Chili come out
than me just sort of hanging out there waiting.''

over to 2080. ``It was a big mistake,'' says Andre, a graduate
student in computer science at the University of California at

the Democratic Party. Already, a few of the Republicans that Forbes
deserted when he switched parties on Saturday have been dropping

COMPLEX TELEPHONE TAKEOVER BATTLE ENDS IN COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the fiercest takeover battles in recent years has ended
in a gentlemen's agreement, with the telecommunications rivals
Qwest Communications International Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd.
agreeing to split the spoils between them.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest said Sunday that US West Inc., the smallest of the
regional Bell companies, had agreed to a $36.5 billion strategic
merger. Global Crossing said, in turn, that it would continue with
its pending $11 billion acquisition of Frontier Corp., a
long-distance carrier. Originally, the two rivals had each hoped to
acquire both US West and Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it was Qwest and Global Crossing's two largest
shareholders _ power brokers in their own right _ who hammered out
the basis for a compromise that would appease both companies.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the spring, Frontier and US West had agreed to merge
with Global Crossing, a fledgling telecommunications concern based
in Bermuda and founded by financier Gary Winnick. Global Crossing,
which has few of its own telecommunications assets, hopes to build
a global fiber optic network to transmit data via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on June 13, Global's main rival, Qwest _ which already has
its own, extensive fiber optic network _ tried to pry US West and
Frontier from Global's embrace by announcing hostile bids for them.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, many investors and industry experts saw the
battle as a test of wills and personalities between Joseph Nacchio,
Qwest's chief executive, and Robert Annunziata, chief executive of
Global Crossing. But in reality, the real maneuvering was between
Winnick and Philip Anschutz, the reclusive Denver financier whose
39 percent stake in Qwest makes him the largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the talks, representatives for
Global Crossing approached advisers to Anschutz a few weeks ago to
gauge his thinking. Through these emissaries, Winnick wanted to
know if Anschutz's interest in US West was genuine and whether
Anschutz might be willing to drop Qwest's bid for Frontier. ``Each
side wanted to see what the appetite was for a compromise,'' a
person close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups of advisers met two weeks ago at the O'Hare
Airport Hilton in Chicago. Nacchio did not attend that meeting,
people close to the talks said. Although no agreement was reached
then, Winnick and Anschutz had a series of telephone discussions
over the following days. And by July 9, the two came to an informal
understanding: Winnick would not stand in Anschutz's way if he
wanted to negotiate a deal with US West, as long as Qwest was
willing to drop its offer for Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Executives for Frontier would not comment Sunday. But in a
telephone interview, Nacchio, Qwest's chief executive, said Qwest
shareholders had not been keen on his company's plan to buy
Frontier, and that on Sunday Qwest formally dropped its bid for
Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 days ago, executives and advisers for Qwest and US
West, aware of the discussions between Winnick and Anschutz, began
discussing merger details in earnest. The group met daily at the
law offices of Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell in New York to resolve issues
that included the fate of Solomon Trujillo, US West's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the creation of an office of the chairman for the
new company, which will be called Qwest Communications. This office
will consist of Anschutz, who remains chairman of Qwest's board;
Nacchio, who will continue as chairman and chief executive of
Qwest, and Trujillo, who will be named co-chairman but will report
to Nacchio. Trujillo will also be president of the combined
company's broadband local and wireless service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how such a structure would work. Trujillo
had been demanding a co-chief executive title with Global Crossing
in its bid for US West. And it was not until last Wednesday that he
and Nacchio met to discuss the merger, the two men said.
</P>
<P>
   US West also extracted other concessions from Qwest, including
equal representation on the board of directors and a provision that
would allow US West to walk away if Qwest's share price traded
below $22 a share for 20 days prior to the deal closing.
</P>
<P>
   The companies expect the Qwest-US West merger to close in about
a year.

CANDIDATE, ER, FIRST LADY HOLDS ELEGANT DINNER FOR BARAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (cb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Demonstrating just how valuable the platform of the
White House can be for a Senate candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton
helped give a dinner here on Sunday night for Ehud Barak, the prime
minister of Israel, overseeing a gala that could only increase the
goodwill toward Mrs. Clinton among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his wife invited nearly 500 people, twice
the number they normally invite for official dinners, many of them
influential in the Jewish community in New York. The throng was so
large _ it was believed to be the biggest sit-down dinner in the
Clinton administration _ that they held the banquet in a vast tent,
studded with sprays of dark blue delphinium, on the South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the first lady's office is charged with deciding
whom to invite to such White House functions, and her Senate
campaign could not have been far from her thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the guests was Leah Rabin, widow of the assassinated prime
minister, who in an interview sought to put to rest any concern
that some Jewish voters might have about Mrs. Clinton's statement
that Palestinians should eventually have their own state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any argument with her,'' Mrs. Rabin said. ``I
probably wouldn't have made the statement myself because we feel
that the final declaration of a Palestinian state should be in the
framework of our agreement. So an official person in Israel would
not have said it, but in fact the process has already brought about
_ it feels as if a Palestinian state will be inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Barak visit was evident not only to guests here
but also to New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's
likely Republican opponent in the Senate race, who met for 40
minutes Sunday morning with the prime minister at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an excellent meeting,'' the mayor said later. ``We
talked about the peace process, as you would expect, in some
detail. But we also talked about the reduction in crime in New
York. He was very interested in how we brought it about so they
could apply some of those same practices in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also said they talked about the economic resurgence of
New York and how the quality of life had improved during Giuliani's
tenure. ``It was a very, very, good, very good conversation,'' the
mayor said. ``And I encouraged him and told him that I am a very
strong supporter, have always been, of the state of Israel and if
he needs any help or any assistance, he should feel free to call on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was apparently initiated by officials at the Israeli
consulate, who told the prime minister, ``You come to New York, you
meet the mayor of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a hot commodity is Barak that news of his meeting with the
mayor Sunday morning was a topic of conversation at the White House
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giuliani had an interview today with Barak for a half hour and
wouldn't let him go,'' said David Steiner, vice chairman of the
National Jewish Democratic Council and past president of the
American-Israel Political Action Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he had his shot, too, today, and this is only fair,''
Steiner said, gesturing to the ornate White House setting. Steiner
sat at Mrs. Clinton's table along with the prime minister. At the
president's table was Rep. Nita Lowey, the New York Democrat who
declined to run for the Senate once Mrs. Clinton's intentions
became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Steiner, his wife, said of the happy accident that the
first lady and the Senate candidate were one and the same: ``I
would say it's a plus. It generates a warm feeling. Everyone's
happy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat and something of a
New York mentor to candidate Clinton, agreed. ``I think this would
have happened whether she's running or not,'' he said of the huge
dinner. ``But this certainly helps her. The fact that she's first
lady, the fact that this administration is on the same wavelength
with the new Israeli administration, it all creates an era of good
feeling and good will, so that's how it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   By happy coincidence for Mrs. Clinton, many of the guests were
top fund-raisers in New York with strong Jewish ties and some were
from the Orthodox groups that lean toward Giuliani. They included
Ronald Perelman, chairman of Revlon; Ronald Lauder, chairman of the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations,
and Daniel Crown, chief executive of Crown Theaters and a partner
in the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the guests shrugged off the suggestion that Mrs. Clinton
might derive some political benefit from inviting to the White
House so many well-connected New Yorkers to rub shoulders and pick
at seared arctic char with the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does she gain by it?'' asked former Mayor Ed Koch, a guest who
said he intended to campaign for Mrs. Clinton. ``I guess, but
that's not the consideration. Not in my book. This is one of our
closest allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Ornstein, a political analyst and also a guest, agreed
that the benefit to Mrs. Clinton was minimal. ``It doesn't hurt to
be first lady and have the prime minister come,'' he said. ``But
one of the better benefits to her is that Barak got elected in the
first place because it will further the peace process and that will
look good for everybody.'' &QL;

 DONAL McCANN, 56, IRISH ACTOR WITH POWERFUL STYLE  
(lb) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Donal McCann, whose often understated but
emotive, transfixing style won him widespread recognition as
Ireland's best actor, died on Saturday at Our Lady's Hospice here.
He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer of the pancreas, which he had had since
1997, Irish national radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent most of his career at the Abbey and Gate
theaters here, his reputation grew in England and the United States
in the last decade. In 1997 he won praise for his performance at
New York's Brooklyn Academy of Music in Sebastian Barry's ``Steward
of Christendom'' as a Lear-like, senile Roman Catholic Dublin
police chief torn between loyalty to Britain and the emerging
independent Irish Free State.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said Sunday that since McCann became ill, he ``had a sense
of completion of his work on the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said he was probably never better than as Gabriel
Conroy, the kind but unloved and unloving husband in John Huston's
film adaptation of James Joyce's story ``The Dead'' (1987). He
performed to wide acclaim in several plays by his friend Brian
Friel, widely considered Ireland's best living playwright.
</P>
<P>
   While McCann appeared in many films, he considered himself
primarily a stage actor, particularly a character actor. But his
roles were large in plays like Friel's ``Faith Healer'' and Samuel
Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot,'' in which he was Estragon.
</P>
<P>
   His work included a film of the Royal Shakespeare Company's
production of Strindberg's ``Miss Julie.'' He also had the lead
role in Hugh Leonard's ``Da'' and in 1988 began to win recognition
in New York as Capt. Boyle, the comic-tragic drunkard coward in
Sean O'Casey's ``Juno and the Paycock.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were moved at the end of the play, as described by Frank
Rich in The New York Times in 1988: `` McCann passes out on the
floor, a grimy sack of a man tossed into the night, an unnerving
double for the men we'll step around in the street as we make our
way home from Sean O'Casey's play to the safety of home.''
</P>
<P>
   After one performance of ``Juno,'' Katharine Hepburn went
backstage in tears and said, ``How did you learn to do that?''
McCann, as quick-tongued offstage as on, said, ``By watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Colgan, the artistic director of the Gate, said:
``Donal's genius is that he always proves the writer right, proves
the director right and proves the audience right just for being
there. That is why he's the greatest actor we've ever had. He is
both a devil and a saint, and he has suffered for it. But that's
also where he gets his great power.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry, the author of ``Steward,'' said McCann's style was
``extravagant minimalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Stafford-Clark, who directed him in ``Steward,'' said, ``He
has a huge emotional range, not only access to emotions that
English actors find very hard, but enormous technique.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Irish television in 1998, shown again this
month as a national farewell, McCann said: ``I always took myself
for a character actor. An actor's job is to serve writing. It's not
self-advertisement.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Guardian in Britain he said: ``There is
a suggestion that everyone would like to be a Hollywood actor, that
doing well-paid rubbish is what we all aspire to. It's ludicrous.
I'm not going to hire a soapbox to denounce the whole thing, but
this desire to be known, I just don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   In another interview he said: ``My method? Read. Read. Read.
Trust the play. In the `Steward' I found myself discovering new
things the 20th time I read it.''
</P>
<P>
   Donal McCann was born in Dublin on May 7, 1943. His father,
John, was a member of the Irish Parliament, lord mayor of Dublin
and a minor playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Donal studied architecture, then changed his mind and began
thinking of himself as an actor. ``If you don't do anything else,''
he said in 1998, ``you can say you're anything you like.'' In an
amateur production he tried out for Hamlet, but was given Polonius.
In a production of ``King Lear'' he was Cordelia.
</P>
<P>
   He worked as a copy boy at a newspaper, The Irish Press, run by
his father's political party, Fianna Fail, until he began to play
noticeable roles, including that of an Irish swashbuckler in the
film ``The Fighting Prince of Donegal.''
</P>
<P>
   His work was interrupted by depressions and by his alcoholism
until he stopped drinking in the late 1980s. He could joke wryly
about it. ``It was worth having something to get away from,'' he
said in 1998, ``but nobody made me drink.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was a devout Christian but did not consider
himself Roman Catholic, the predominant religion of his countrymen.
``God takes my life forward,'' he said, after his cancer was
diagnosed. ``I would like to leave the theater for a while. I'm not
in a panic to do anything. I'm not ambitious for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly compelling in plays by Friel. After he
played the role of Frank, the traveling charlatan-miracle worker in
``Faith Healer,'' McCann recalled, as he left the stage
half-blinded by the lights and entered the wings, that he felt
something hot on one cheek and something cold on the other: Friel
was kissing him on one cheek and holding a gin and tonic against
the other.
</P>
<P>
   McCann's greatest critical success in recent years was in
``Steward.'' Stalking his room in a mental hospital in dirty long
johns, the actor gripped audiences when he told himself, ``I must
not talk to shadows.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Billington, the English critic, wrote in 1995: ``McCann,
never off the stage and rarely silent, gives an astonishing
performance. The cropped head, the stubbly beard, the staring eyes
evoke the bewildered pathos of solitary confinement. There is no
more moving piece of acting in London.''
</P>
<P>
   He also played the lead in an adaptation of Patrick Kavanagh's
comic novel ``Tarry Flynn.'' His films, some made for television,
included ``Illuminata,'' produced by John Turturro in 1997; ``Hedda
Gabler''; ``The Miracle''; ``Out of Africa,'' and ``Cal,'' produced
by David Puttnam, recognized as possibly the best film ever made
about the sectarian warfare in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his friends agree with critics that McCann's greatest
achievement was his acting in ``The Dead.'' McCann, who never
married, although he was engaged several times, played a husband,
Gabriel Conroy, who learns that his wife, Gretta, played by
Angelica Huston, still yearns for a young suitor who died decades
earlier. Conroy admits to himself that he has never known such
strong love.
</P>
<P>
   The film ends with McCann, looking out a window of the Gresham
Hotel on O'Connell Street at a swirling Dublin snowstorm, reciting
Joyce's words softly in a voice-over: ``His soul swooned slowly, as
he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly
falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living
and the dead.''

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ Because a Frenchman played like Pepe Le Pew
on the 72nd hole, the British Open ended as a coming-out party for
a local laddie with a reputation as an underachiever.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Lawrie, 30, a Scotsman with oodles of talent but only two
European tour wins to show for his pro career, started Sunday 10
shots from the British Open lead. When he finished his 72nd hole at
surprisingly benign Carnoustie, he still was four strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, he was holding the Claret Jug overhead, the
first Scot to win a British Open in Scotland since Tommy D. Armour
did so in 1931 at this course. Lawrie, who commuted to the
tournament each day from his home in Aberdeen 60 miles to the
north, made up the biggest deficit in the 128-year history of the
British Open _ or any American PGA Tour event, for that matter.
Houston's Jackie Burke owned the previous record for best comeback
in a major, making up eight shots in the 1956 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie shot a magnificent 4-under-par 67 on Sunday, then played
four playoff holes in even-par for the victory. But this British
Open will forever be remembered for how Jean Van de Velde lost it.
</P>
<P>
   The leader by five shots starting the final 18, Van de Velde
struggled early, then steadied himself and had a three-stroke lead
when he stepped to the 72nd hole. He could afford double bogey and
still win.
</P>
<P>
   But Van de Velde hit the grandstand, the water and the sand and
was lucky he didn't hurt somebody before he made a six-footer to
salvage a triple-bogey 7 and a spot in the four-hole playoff with
Lawrie and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean had the tournament in his pocket,'' Lawrie said. ``He
went for the shot, and I'm not here to criticize him. He should
have won the tournament, and it's lucky for me he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde's 18th hole will go down as one of the most
embarrassing chokes in golf history. For 17 holes, the 33-year-old
never flinched. At least not fatally. He never fretted about
potentially being the most obscure golfer in the past 50 years to
win the British Open. He never even panicked when he fell behind
and was in danger of living up to predictions he would collapse
like a wet croissant when the pressure rose.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 72nd hole. Then, Van de Velde went down faster than an
expensive bottle of bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a wayward drive that shot to the right and
almost went into the cement creek called Barry Burn, which twists
along the 17th and 18th holes at Carnoustie. But Van de Velde
missed the shot so far right, he was in short grass on the 17th
fairway. He had 189 yards to carry the burn that cuts about 30
yards in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   The carefree Van de Velde made the questionable move of the
tournament when he pulled out a 2-iron to go for the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky I missed the creek there,'' Van de Velde said of
his tee shot. ``But when I got there, the ball was lying perfectly.
I couldn't have placed it any better. To carry the water wasn't
very demanding. So the option was to either hit a wedge down there
on the left, pitch it on and two-putt or three-putt and walk off
with it (the trophy), or do you hit the shot over there and try to
go forward with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my 2-iron and thought, `You're going to hit it down
there.' But I pushed it a little. I didn't hit a very good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an understatement. The ball cleared the burn with no
problem. But it went so far to the right that it hit a railing on
the grandstand and kicked backward, bouncing hard off Barry Burn
and about 30 yards back toward Van de Velde in some of the deepest
grass on the course.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the result, Van de Velde defended his effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need to go for the glory, but that wasn't even glory
or something absolutely mad I was trying to do,'' he said. ``It
just came out to be a nightmare. If I would have been in the middle
of the fairway and pulled out a wedge, you would have thought,
`What the hell is he doing?' I just mis-hit that one.''
</P>
<P>
   He still had four shots with which to work to win the
tournament. But he tried to hack the ball across the burn and
watched it land smack in the middle of the eight-foot-wide expanse.
There was barely enough water to cover the golf ball. But after
stripping off his shoes and socks, Van de Velde decided he couldn't
play from the burn. He retreated again and took a drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the ball lying on some mud or whatever,'' he said.
``I thought if it was pretty firm, I was definitely going to hit it
out of there. I took my shoes off, and I could see the ball
sinking, you know, telling me, `Hey, you silly man. Not for you.
Not today.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now he had to get up-and-down to avoid a playoff. When he dumped
his fifth shot in the bunker left of the green, just getting into
the playoff seemed iffy.
</P>
<P>
   But he blasted to within six feet and drilled the putt, which
might have been the only time you'll ever see a pro golfer pumping
his fist after a triple bogey. He entered the playoff at 6-over-par
290 after a final-round 77.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, Leonard had hit a shot in the same burn that
confounded Van de Velde and bogeyed the 18th to fall to 6-over for
the tournament. About 90 minutes before that, Lawrie had finished
off his terrific round with a par but didn't think he had done
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every kid dreams about winning the Open, especially
when it's played nearby to your home,'' Lawrie said. ``It's huge to
win the Open, especially when I live just up the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I must say I didn't think I'd get into the playoff. No
way. I thought the tournament was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie has outstanding skills but hasn't seemed to get the most
out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have said that to me,'' Lawrie said with
regard to why he hasn't won more. ``I practice hard. I practice my
chipping and short game a lot. If you're an underachiever, then
sometimes I don't get as much out of my game as I maybe should. But
I don't really know why that is. Yeah, a lot of people have told me
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That tag will be shed because of the way Lawrie performed in the
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Through two holes of the playoff, nobody had made a par. Leonard
and Lawrie were 2-over, and Van de Velde continued his plummet as
he went double bogey, bogey on the 15th and 16th.
</P>
<P>
   The weather had turned dreary by this point, just like the golf.
In the rain and cold, the threesome trudged on. The good news for
all the players Sunday was that the blustery winds of the first
three days had departed, leaving flags limp.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard narrowly averted a disaster when his drive on the 17th
stopped just a foot from rolling into Barry Burn. He would par the
hole, but Lawrie took control when he dropped a 10-foot birdie putt
in on top of Van de Velde's. It gave him a one-shot lead on both
players going into the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   When Lawrie socked a 4-iron from 221 yards to within three feet,
he had the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit an awesome 4-iron,'' he said. ``I had hit the same club
on the 17th as well from 225 yards. So I knew it would be the right
club. Obviously, I'm very delighted. I played beautifully all day
and holed a lot of putts, which you have to do around this
course.''
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't hurt to have a competitor gift-wrap a place in a
playoff with sloppy play on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   But true to his nature, Van de Velde laughed it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are worse things in life,'' he said. ``You know, I read
the newspaper this morning and some terrible things are happening
to other people. This is a golf tournament. It's a game. And I gave
it my best shot. Next time, I'll hit the wedge, OK?''

EDITORIAL: AN OPENING FOR CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, July 19:
</P>
<P>
   Politicians often like to say that they will not be slaves to
public opinion. ``I don't run polls to tell me what to think,''
Gov. George W. Bush declares. That would be reassuring, except that
Bush and others are harvesting campaign donations from special
interests that expect to exert an influence more powerful than
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush announced that his $37 million war chest was so
big he would spurn federal matching funds in the primaries and
ignore campaign spending limits in effect since the 1970s. If he
gets the nomination, Bush will almost certainly try to outdo
President Clinton in raising vast sums of unregulated ``soft
money'' for his party.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Sen. John McCain plans to give the Senate a chance to
remove the worst campaign abuses by bringing a soft-money ban up
for debate. For decades, corporations and unions have been banned
from donating to federal candidates, and since 1974 there have been
ceilings on donations by individuals and political-action
committees. McCain's bill would extend these rules to money raised
by the political parties, closing a loophole exploited by Clinton
and Bob Dole in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of senators have supported McCain's bill,
co-sponsored by Russell Feingold of Wisconsin, but 60 votes are
needed to break the filibuster that has always been mobilized by
Trent Lott, the majority leader. Accordingly, in a tactical shift,
McCain and Feingold have eliminated a separate provision that would
apply federal fund-raising limits to money raised by independent
groups for campaign ads within two months of an election.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times editorial page has always supported limits on
fund raising by independent groups, when the money is used for what
are clearly campaign ads on television. Without such a provision,
corrupt money will easily flow to bogus groups with ties to the
candidates themselves. But Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has
seized on the limits applied to independent groups as a violation
of free speech. Stripping them out of the bill is a politically
practical concession that could well bring wavering Republicans to
support the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Even this modified soft-money ban would mean no more White House
coffees or sleepovers for fat cats and no more $100,000 tickets to
dinners with the congressional leadership. There would also be no
opportunity for Bush's unidentified fund-raising team, the
``Pioneers,'' to raise six-figure sums for the party when the
campaign heats up.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reform would mean that health care issues could be
decided without the corrupting influence of vast sums from
insurance companies, that environmental enforcement could be
carried out without the influence of money from the oil, gas and
timber industries, and that laws curbing guns and tobacco could be
decided without unlimited sums from the gun and tobacco lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a temptation this week to listen to disingenuous
calls for delay. Some Republicans are already talking about pushing
the issue off to October. But if reform is not enacted quickly, it
might get swallowed up in the heat of a presidential campaign that
is already raising money at rates unlike any seen in the past. For
this issue, delay is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Among themselves, Democrats and Republicans in Congress whine
incessantly about having to raise more and more money. Now is the
time to show their paymasters that they have the courage to free
themselves, and free their constituents, from the chains of money
corruption.

COAST OFFICIALS SAY THERE IS LITTLE CHANCE OF SURVIVORS FROM CRASH
OF KENNEDY'S PLANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOE STINEBAKER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WOODS HOLE, Mass. _ As the sun fell on Cape Cod Sunday night, all
hopes for the survival of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife and his
sister-in-law faded with the light as U.S. Coast Guard officials
conceded there was virtually no hope of finding any survivors from
the crash of their plane.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for state and federal agencies conducting the search
for survivors insisted all day Sunday that they still considered
the search for Kennedy's downed single engine plane a ``rescue
mission.'' But late Sunday, a somber Coast Guard admiral announced
that the focus of what had been a frantic, two-day effort to find
survivors would now shift to finding and recovering the wreckage
and the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent some very painful moments with the families
tonight,'' said Coast Guard Rear Admiral Richard Larrabee. ``It was
a difficult phone call for me and I'm sure it was difficult for
them. This is not the result we were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's plane, a Piper Saratoga II HP, is believed to have
ditched into the Atlantic Ocean Friday night, just several miles
southwest from Gay Head, on the southwest corner of Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is believed to have been making his final approach to
the Martha's Vineyard airport when the plane disappeared from air
traffic controllers' radar screens.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister,
Lauren Bessette, were presumed dead Sunday night. Experts said most
people can expect to survive no longer than about 12 hours in the
68-degree water temperatures in the area, although they said
exceptions are not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But with 48 hours passing since anyone last heard from the three
_ and with debris from the flight washing ashore nearby _ even the
most optimistic began to concede yet another tragedy had befallen
the ill-fated Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers remained optimistic though that they would find the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, officials with the federal National
Transportation Safety Board said they had detected a single
``ping'' from an electronic location transmitter, or ELT, near the
area where the Kennedy plane was believed to have crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee described the ping as ``one brief transmission'' and
said it may have come from the Kennedy plane's emergency beacon.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Coast Guard asked the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration to dispatch its research ship, the Rude,
to investigate the transmission. The Rude, which is equipped with
sensitive listening and sonar viewing devices, arrived at the area
four-and-a-half miles southwest of Gay Head, but there were no
reported discoveries by late last night.
</P>
<P>
   Larrabee announced later that the ``ping'' had not, after all,
come from the downed aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The area is near the ``debris field'' from which several pieces
of debris believed to have come from Kennedy's plane have been
discovered. Ocean depths in the area range from around 40 to 100
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Debris from the crash will be collected and reassembled as much
as possible at a hangar at the Coast Guard Air Station on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gary Jones, the Coast Guard's chief public affairs officer
here, said the signal had clearly come from under water and was the
only known ELT transmission in the area since the crash. Jones said
ELTs are designed to begin transmitting after a sudden jarring or
after contact with salt water. While it is unusual to receive a
single transmission, so many hours after a crash, Jones said,
``I've seen them go off for weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NTSB's entry into the investigation was seen by
some as an admission that officials no longer expected to find
survivors. NTSB chairman James Hall, a presidential appointee, said
the agency will work ``as quickly as possible but with great
care.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as what happened with the Kennedy plane, he said: ``The
answer is simple, at this point we don't know. We may not know for
several days. There is even a possibility we will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the very beginning steps of what will be a
painstaking review.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said witnesses saw Kennedy loading his new plane
at Essex County Air Field in Fairfield, N.J., on Friday evening and
that he and his passengers took off at 8:38 p.m. local time.
Kennedy informed officials that he would be flying north and then
turning east towards Martha's Vineyard. Radar then showed Kennedy's
plane climbing to 5,600 feet heading east along the southern coast
of Connecticut until reaching western Rhode Island at 9:26 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pearce, the chief NTSB investigator, said that at 9:40
p.m., the plane was on radar at 2,500 feet, 17-18 miles west of
Martha's Vineyard still heading east. Within 29 seconds, Pearce
said, the plane had dropped to 1,800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no further radar data recorded from that point,''
Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce declined to say whether the sudden drop in altitude was
the result of the plane diving toward the sea, saying only that
such a drop ``is within the airplane's capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before search officials acknowledged there was little
chance of survival, people around the nations Sunday appeared to
accept the inevitable, many speaking about the son of the former
president in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, stopping to speak briefly after returning
from Camp David asked the nation to remember the Kennedy and
Bessette families in its prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 40 years now the Kennedy family has inspired
Americans to public service, strengthened our faith in the future
and moved our nation forward,'' Clinton said. ``In recent years in
particular, John Kennedy Jr. and Caroline have captured our
imagination and won our affection.... We hope the families of these
fine young people will feel the strength of God, the love of their
friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens.''

<P>
   BOURNE, Mass. _ After two fruitless days of searching for a
plane that disappeared off the coast of Martha's Vineyard with John
F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law on board, the Coast
Guard said Sunday night that it had all but given up hope of
finding survivors and now was focused on recovering their remains.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee said he had informed family members
that the odds of finding any survivors after 48 hours in the
68-degree water were remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult for me to share this information with
them,'' he said in a news conference at Otis Air National Guard
base here.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Larrabee said that what started as a search and
rescue mission early Saturday morning was now a ``search and
recovery'' mission. With that shift, command of the investigation
was handed over to the National Transportation Safety Board, the
agency that has jurisdiction over airplane accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, the location of Kennedy's single-engine Piper
Saratoga had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours there had been speculation that the plane had
been found after the Coast Guard announced late in the afternoon
that it had detected a single ping from an emergency beacon in
waters off Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   But that information turned out to be a bad lead. Larrabee said
Sunday night that the ping may have been emitted by a Coast Guard
marker.
</P>
<P>
   In Hyannis Port, the Kennedy family spent another long day
waiting and praying in their compound of white clapboard houses
overlooking Nantucket Sound. In the morning, three priests arrived
to say a private Mass for family members under the same white tent
where Rory Kennedy was to have been married Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the ceremony, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy could be seen
holding the communion chalice, offering wine to Ethel Kennedy, the
widow of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, their daughter Rory
Kennedy and other family members. In the afternoon, Sen. Kennedy
took several family members for a sail into the Atlantic on his old
blue wooden-hulled sloop, Maya.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I have a hard time deciding whether to refer to
them in the past tense or the present tense,'' John Perry Barlow, a
friend of John Kennedy's for more than 20 years, said late Sunday
afternoon. ``That's very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The family of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister,
Lauren Bessette, 34, also spent the day in seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, President Clinton returned to the White House
from Camp David and gave a short, somber address as his wife and
daughter looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 40 years now the Kennedy family has inspired
Americans to public service, strengthened our faith in the future
and moved our nation forward,'' Clinton said. ``Through it all they
have suffered much, and given more.''
</P>
<P>
   Offering his prayers and support, Clinton added: ``At this
difficult moment, we hope the families of these three fine young
people will feel the strength of God, the love of their friends,
and the prayers of their fellow citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The clues on Saturday had seemed to point toward a rapid
conclusion to the hunt, with luggage and a prescription belonging
to Kennedy's passengers washing ashore on Martha's Vineyard.
Sunday, a plane's insulation and headrest were added to the
catalog, but searchers working by land, air and water found no firm
evidence of the fate of Kennedy, 38; his wife of nearly three
years, or his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that underscored the size and complexity of the
evolving search and accident investigation, a ``unified command''
was established at Otis Air Force base on Cape Cod. The command
included representatives of the Coast Guard, the National
Transportation Safety Board, the Federal Aviation Administration,
the Navy, the Transportation Department, the National Oceanographic
and Atmospheric Administration and a variety of state agencies.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   More reinforcements were on the way. A second NOAA survey ship,
the 163-foot Whiting, was diverted from Delaware Bay and was
expected to arrive Monday. A Navy salvage vessel, the Grasp, was
expected to arrive on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard responds to 50,000 distress calls a year, and
rescue officials gamely insisted they were not giving special
treatment to the Kennedys. But in some respects, this search was
different, starting with the tremendous scrutiny from an
international contingent of reporters and photographers and from
the highest levels of government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Coast Guard officials here on Saturday night to
express his concern. Massachusetts Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci called
as well.
</P>
<P>
   The search gave a schizophrenic air to the grassy, rose-rich
island of Martha's Vineyard. Vacationers lapped black raspberry ice
cream and ambled in sandles, while camera crews barged past as they
scrambled for position, and divers prepared for the possible
recovery of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The island's mood was described in a simple message scrawled on
a chalk board overlooking the beaches where the first debris washed
up on Saturday. ``Moshup Beach and Aquinnah Beach our prayers are
with you John-John, Carolyn, Lauren,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Taylor Scherer, 40, who lives in the village of West
Tisbury, walked barefoot on the beaches of Martha's Vineyard
Sunday, but she did not take her usual swim. ``It seems like their
resting place _ not some place I should be,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, people here and across the nation were in search of
resolution Sunday. For most of them, none was to be had.
</P>
<P>
   The area of the search seemed to expand and contract and shift
with each new shred of information or rumor.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday afternoon, after luggage from the Kennedy plane
washed ashore near Philbin Beach at the southwest tip of Martha's
Vineyard, the search area was narrowed to 550-square miles.
</P>
<P>
   But when the search resumed at full force at 5:30 a.m. Sunday,
the Coast Guard sent helicopters, airplanes and a small flotilla of
cutters and inflatable boats across an expanded search zone of
1,200-square miles. Still, Coast Guard officials seemed confident
they would soon find the plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer looking for a needle in a haystack,'' Larrabee
of the Coast Guard said at a 9 a.m. briefing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But as the hours ticked past, the searchers met only with
maddening results.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers scoured the dunes and shoreline for more debris with
small all-terrain vehicles. They found nothing. The probed the
ocean floor with ultra-sensitive sonars aboard the Rude, the same
research vessel that had helped locate wreckage off Long Island
from TWA Flight 800. Again, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Private boats and beach-combing tourists grimly joined the
effort in what Larrabee described as a ``tremendous outpouring of
sympathy.'' As Melissa Epstein, a tourist from Brooklyn, wandered
the beach with a friend, their thoughts were very much on the
Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just looking at the cliffs and hoping they find them
safely,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 10 scuba divers was kept on alert in the town of
Menemsha, but the divers sat idle as there was no promising area of
the ocean for them to search.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long tedious job out there, and sometimes it's very
frustrating when they're not hitting anything,'' said one diver,
Sgt. William Freeman of the Massachusetts State Police.
</P>
<P>
   If and when the time comes, Freeman said, the diving team has
the ability, using inflatable bags, to lift from the depths a plane
the size of Kennedy's, a single-engine Piper Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Though the water temperature was a chilly 68 degrees _ making
survival a remote possibility, especially since the plane was not
equipped with a life raft _ Coast Guard officials pressed on
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they said, survival statistics show that the average person
cannot withstand more than 12 hours in such water. And yes, they
said, the statistics gave little reason for comfort after a second
day with no sign of life.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, said Larrabee early Sunday, ``We have all read
miraculous stories of people surviving under these types of
conditions, and that's what gives us hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the going was slow. The Rude began searching at 7 p.m. on
Saturday night. By mid afternoon Sunday, it had completed a
painstaking sweep of just five square miles.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning, after the local harbormaster ran computer
models of how wreckage might be affected by winds and tides, Capt.
Robert Bird, a spokesman for the state police, announced that his
agency was focusing its search in the waters around Nomans Island,
which is about three miles south of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   But by noon, the searchers had very little to show for their
efforts. Three miles south of Martha's Vineyard, they recovered a
headrest, like the one that washed ashore on Saturday. A fuel slick
was spotted far outside the primary search area, but it was quickly
discounted as having any connection to the Kennedy plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not find a lot,'' Larrabee glumly reported at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, word came of the day's first significant finding
_ bits of foam insulation that were scattered over a mile of beach.
Bird said the insulation was ``consistent'' with insulation that
would surround an airplane cockpit. In response to a reporter's
question, he acknowledged the obvious: That it likely would take an
impact of great force to produce such debris.
</P>
<P>
   But with the detection of the ping at about 3:45 P.M., the tone
shifted rapidly from official words of hope to outright
resignation. James Hall, chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, for one, began his first press briefing late Sunday
afternoon by saying, ``I deeply regret having to come before you on
such a difficult case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone was any talk of miracles. Hall introduced Robert Pearce,
the NTSB investigator appointed to lead the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, a former military pilot who has investigated hundreds of
crashes involving small planes during his seven years with the
NTSB, offered new details about Kennedy's flight.
</P>
<P>
   After taking off at 8:38 p.m. without incident from Essex County
Airport in Fairfield, N.J., Kennedy's plane was tracked on radar as
it climbed to 5,600 feet passing north of the Teterboro Airport in
New Jersey, and then heading east toward Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:26 p.m., the craft was west of Rhode Island, and still at
5,600 feet, though it soon began to descend. At 9:40 p.m., when it
was 17 or 18 miles from the Martha's Vineyard airport, the plane
was at 2,500 feet. Over the next 29 seconds, it dropped another 700
feet, a rate of descent that Pearce said was ``within the
airplane's capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, with the plane still 16 miles from the airport,
radars lost contact. Pearce explained that the plane was below an
altitude where it could be detected by radar.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said he expected the investigation to be completed within
nine months. In addition to examining radar data, NTSB
investigators were interviewing those familiar with Kennedy's
flying abilities, reviewing weather data and pulling all
maintenance records associated with the craft, though there were no
immediate indications of mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the very beginning stages of what will be a
painstaking, detailed investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But veteran pilots repeatedly speculated that Kennedy, a
relatively inexperienced pilot, may have crashed after losing his
visual orientation in the haze and darkness over Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning that such speculation can be hurtful for family
members, Hall asked people to refrain from hasty conclusions about
the cause of the plane's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is simple,'' Hall said. ``At this point we do not
know. We will not know for some time. There is even a possibility
we will never know.''

STEINHAUER EDGES KANE IN 5-HOLE PLAYOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. _ In the moonlight you could hardly see the
tears beginning to mingle with the sweat under Lorie Kane's eyes.
But you did not have to see them to know they were there. They came
almost as soon as Sherri Steinhauer rolled in an improbable 35-foot
birdie putt to finally put an end to a heart-wrenching five-hole
sudden-death playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Kane's friend Se Ri Pak had been shaking up some champagne near
the 18th green since before the hot sun had set, ready to celebrate
what she believed would be the first victory of Kane's career. It
was put away. As Steinhauer captured the Japan Airlines Big Apple
Classic at Wykagyl Country Club and raised her arms and danced a
few tired steps, Kane knew that she was a runner-up _ for the
eighth time in four years on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   The two had been paired for 77 holes, from the opening day. They
entered Sunday's final round as the unlikely leaders of the
tournament, with Steinhauer two strokes ahead of Kane. And after
all that time together, even Steinhauer could feel the pain that
Kane was going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this was hard for her,'' said Steinhauer, who recorded
her first victory of the season. ``It's hard playing against her
because she's been so close to winning. When she does win, she's
going to go on to win many, many more. She's a great competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane came into the interview room, her face buried in a towel,
and said: ``Well, what can I say. It's very tough and it's getting
tougher. But I'm going to have lots more chances. I played solid
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The two had swapped the lead back and forth Sunday. They pulled
even at the sixth hole and then Kane took the lead by making birdie
on the ninth hole. She stretched the advantage to two strokes with
a birdie on the par-3 13th hole.
</P>
<P>
   But both players would squander opportunities with misses on
short putts throughout the final few holes. Then on the 18th, still
leading by one stroke, Kane struck a 30-footer that kissed off of
the lip and slipped a foot past the hole. Steinhauer converted a
12-footer from above the hole for birdie and it took a tap-in by
Kane to force the playoff. Both finished regulation play at
11-under-par 273, Steinhauer shooting an even-par 71 while Kane
shot 2-under 69.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Inkster finished third, three shots back, after a 70 on
Sunday. Pak, who led after the first and second rounds but fell out
of contention with a 77 Saturday, eagled the 18th hole Sunday to
finish at 70 and 2-under 282 for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden-death playoff was held entirely on No. 18, which was
played repeatedly until someone won. The two each parred the first
four playoff holes. After the third and fourth times, marshals
inquired if they wanted to stop and continue on Monday, but the
players agreed to continue. The fifth playoff was going to be the
final hole, no matter what the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unanimous,'' Kane said. ``We said, `Let's go try it
again.' You could still see. The lights were on in the clubhouse,
so you had something to aim at.''
</P>
<P>
   After both players hit solid drives, Kane, who had blasted a
4-wood close to the green with her second shot on the previous
attempts, tried an iron and settled at the top of the hill about
130 yards from the green. She then tried to loft the ball toward
the pin, but it drifted into the sand trap on the right side of the
green. She recovered nicely, dropping a shot out of the sand just a
foot shy of the pin. But it left an opening for Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   In the growing darkness, Steinhauer had to consider not just the
35-feet that separated her from victory, but also the diminished
view of the hole she had as 8 p.m. passed by. ``It was extremely
dark,'' said Steinhauer, who earned $127,000 with the victory. ``I
thought about having my caddie tend it, but I didn't want the
distraction. I got over it and imagined it in my mind. It was
incredible that it went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauer had struggled with her putting on the back nine
Sunday, but still had confidence that this lengthy putt would drop
and finally put an end to the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My putting is a funny thing,'' she said. ``When I'm confident,
I'm a good putter. I'm constantly fighting to understand my
putting. I took a few practice strokes and I felt better over that
one. On that last one, I said, `This could be the one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kane had remained upbeat throughout the tense and tedious day on
the course, which lasted more than seven hours with a 55-minute
suspension for lightning in the middle. And she stiffened her lip
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've shed my tears and I'm ready to go,'' Kane said. ``Once I
get to chat with my mom and dad, then it's going to have to go
away. I will remember the feeling because I don't want to be here
again.''

RAFTER DEFEATS MARTIN TO CLINCH AUSTRALIAN VICTORY OVER U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert score in 2nd graf.)  (cb) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ His own captain declared Todd Martin an
invalid on Sunday before he limped out for his confrontation with
Patrick Rafter. But it took 3 hours 14 minutes before Martin
finally gave up the ghost in the brutal five-setter that clinched
this Davis Cup quarterfinal for Australia.
</P>
<P>
   With an ill-aimed backhand return of the spry serve Rafter sent
his way at triple match point, a miserable Martin conceded the
match, 4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, and the round on a 128-degree
hardcourt in front of 5,300 disappointed fans at the Longwood
Cricket Club.
</P>
<P>
   For Martin, who took intravenous fluids before the match, it was
a distressing end to a debilitating day. He had informed Tom
Gullikson, the United States captain, that he felt sick and
disoriented after his morning practice session and doubted that he
could give Rafter a fair fight. If Martin had been found unable to
play, Gullikson could have substituted Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   But over the objections of Gullikson and the United States team
doctor, Martin was deemed fit to compete by the event's neutral
physician, Richard Paul, an orthopedist and a longtime Longwood
member. Martin was then ordered to play by Stefan Fransson of
Sweden, the event's neutral referee.
</P>
<P>
   For the Australians, Rafter's victory, which gave them an
insurmountable 3-1 lead, was a just result to a competition tainted
by controversy _ about the location, the court surface and the
possible scheme to bring in Sampras as a singles ringer.
</P>
<P>
   While the gray-haired Martin slumped down in his changeover
chair under a shroud of cold towels, the pony-tailed Rafter raised
his fists in the steamy air, ripped off his shirt, and was raised
on the shoulders of his hooting and hollering teammates as they
celebrated his comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know why he's won the U.S. Open twice,'' Gullikson said
about Rafter. Speaking about Martin, who assumed the lead singles
role many felt should have belonged to Sampras, Gullikson was
properly grateful. ``I thought he played a heroic match,''
Gullikson said.
</P>
<P>
   After Rafter clinched the three-of-five-match competition,
Lleyton Hewitt, the 18-year-old rookie defeated Martin on Friday,
completed a 4-1 victory for Australia by defeating Alex O'Brien,
7-5, 6-4. O'Brien, Sampras' doubles partner Saturday in the United
States' only match victory, filled in for Jim Courier, who opted
not to play because of a slight leg strain.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, who won his five-setter against Martin despite trailing
by 4-2 in the final set, said, ``My body might not want to last,
but my mind and everything else wants me to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-ranked Rafter improved his record in five &UR; - &LR; set
matches to 12-2, and has now won 11 five-setters in a row, five of
them after trailing by two sets to none.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; `` &LR; When I get into a five &UR; - &LR; set match, I know that record,''
Rafter said. ``I know I'm gonna be the one there last.''
</P>
<P>
   What Rafter did not know until 20 minutes before the match
whether his opponent would be Martin or Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   He did not comment on Gullikson's reasons for trying to use
Sampras, but he made it clear that he believed Martin's
apprehension about putting his body through another workout in the
sauna-like heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get a better sportsman in the world than
Todd,'' Rafter said. ``I have a lot of respect for Todd; I never
once saw Todd trying to pull something over on me. I saw him out on
the court and he didn't look great. He looked very pale in the
beginning. But as the match got along, he got more and more into
it, and I knew then that I'm in a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Martin had a 3-0 lead in the fifth set, he slowly
frittered it away. A doublefault at break point closed the gap to
4-3, a strong hold by Rafter tied the set at 4-4. In the last two
games, Rafter pushed himself to a competitive zone Martin was too
weary to reach. Rafter seized his pivotal break to 5-4 in the final
set with a searing crosscourt backhand volley after Martin
doublefaulted to break point. Rafter then zoomed out to a 40-0 lead
as he served for the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick outplayed me,'' said the eighth-ranked Martin, who was
told before the match by the U.S. doctor, David Altchek, that he
was unfit to play due to lingering effects of heat prostration from
his loss on Friday to Hewitt. Suspicion about Martin's fitness,
coupled with the availability of Sampras, made for a Byzantine
morning at Longwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's entitled to his opinion,'' Martin said of Dr. Paul. The
Australian captain, John Newcombe, who said that Martin seemed
reasonably fit, added: ``We are not into mind games. He played
three and a half hours of pretty good tennis in the heat, had Pat
two sets to love and two breaks in the fifth. I think that speaks
for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said that his pre-match intravenous treatment had helped
him but that he had not taken to the court voluntarily. ``I didn't
know that I was really fit to play the whole match until near the
end of the match,'' Martin said. ``I was actually very distracted;
I had a tough time controlling my emotions. I went out and played
two very good sets and three okay sets and lost.''

PENMANSHIP PURISTS WRITE ON IN AGE OF E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ga., Ohio, Ky., Pa., Calif., Canada)  (lb) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ In the hotel's grand ballroom, a retractable
wall separated the inhabitants of two worlds, one robustly modern,
the other quietly struggling just to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, executives from Eastman Kodak, fitted with beepers
and cell phones, gazed over laptop computers at a
software-generated slide show. Next door, clumps of women and men,
their hands and clothing stained with ink, gripped handmade wooden
pens and hovered over sheaves of paper filled with ornately looping
capital A's, B's and C's.
</P>
<P>
   Writing by hand may be a dying art, but it returned with a
flourish in Rochester last week, where the International
Association of Master Penmen, Engrossers and Teachers of
Handwriting held its 50th annual convention to uphold the integrity
of the written _ not printed _ word.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, color fax machines and laser printers may be
essential to modern American life, but this group of 60 penmanship
teachers, calligraphers, card writers and certificate makers says
there is still room, and enough time, for pen and ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's a theory that computers are going to
replace us, but it's not going to happen,'' said Rick Muffler, a
White House calligrapher who is the president of the penmen's
association and, at 40, one of its youngest members. ``They make
what we do even more valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   A life devoted to handwriting is not easy. Penmanship has become
an afterthought in classrooms dominated by computers and the
Internet. And when was the last time anyone riffled through the
Yellow Pages looking for a certified engrosser?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in handwriting crisis,'' said Janie Cravens, a
penmanship teacher from Washington, Ga., who flew to Rochester to
attend seminars with titles like ``Spencerian Penmanship'' and
``Illuminated Capitals'' at the convention in the Hyatt Regency.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that with e-mail and technology and word
processing we don't need handwriting,'' said Ms. Cravens, clad in a
fuchsia sweater made to resemble a watermelon slice embroidered
with little brown seeds. ``It's an absolute life skill. It improves
our ability to communicate, and that's what life's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ms. Cravens, who carries her own handwritten business
cards, dated herself slightly when she added, ``I think we're still
a long way from carrying our word processors around and typing
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The association was formed in 1948 when two Canadian handwriting
enthusiasts, Eileen and Fred Richardson, organized an informal
gathering of penmen at their home on Lake Nipissing in Ontario.
Their mission was to restore penmanship in schools and improve
faltering handwriting skills among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Even as technology seemed to leave them behind, the group grew
little by little, and now claims more than 200 members in North
America, Australia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But the future is looking a little bleak. The last true masters
of penmanship, elder citizens who long ago received diplomas in the
craft from any of several now-defunct handwriting colleges across
the United States, are rapidly dying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost four top penmen in the last year _ to death,'' said
Bill Lilly, 72, a retired International Harvester factory worker
who is now the association's sole master penman. In 1952, Lilly
graduated from the Zanerian College of Penmanship, in Columbus,
Ohio, with the highest honor, a gold seal pasted on his diploma,
which he, like all the graduates, was required to write by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, whose silvery hair, straight-shooting manner of speech
and Southern lilt remind one of Ross Perot, found his devotion to
handwriting as a teen-ager in Paducah, Ky., where the sight of
filigreed handmade diplomas stopped him cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd stand there and look at certificates for a half-hour at a
time,'' he said, ``wondering how anybody could make script so
accurate and beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he holds workshops, for $300 a day, on penmanship and
decorative envelopes. ``My envelopes have become collector's items
across the country,'' he said after teaching a packed seminar here
on Flourished Script, his specialty. ``It's a fine art, not to be
rushed or taken lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what will happen to the association once he is gone, Lilly
shrugged. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``It will probably go
downhill, if not disappear altogether.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many educators are saying the same thing about the art of
penmanship in American schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many school districts today, you will not see penmanship as
a class on a teacher's schedule,'' said Fred Brown, 53, a retired
handwriting teacher and elementary school principal from Boyertown,
Pa. Students still learn penmanship, he said, ``but it isn't the
kind your readers will remember from their schooldays, where you
wrote O's over and over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, now director of professional development for the National
Association of Elementary School Principals in Virginia, squarely
places the blame for the demise of handwriting, and its cousins,
grammar and syntax, on computers and e-mail. ``I'm quite frankly
appalled when I get e-mail where the first letter of the sentence
isn't capitalized and sentences are filled with spelling
mistakes,'' he said. ``All matter of rules and courtesy seem to
have vanished.''
</P>
<P>
   John DeCollibus, who writes inspirational cards, lamented:
``Today, even my own kids, it's half writing, half printing. They
hold a pen wrong. They hold it like a chisel.''
</P>
<P>
   To draw in more young people and feed its need for more master
penmen and penwomen, the association plans to give an annual award
to the country's top penmanship teacher, Ms. Cravens said. A
writer's license for skilled fourth-grade pupils of penmanship,
which like a driver's license can be granted and revoked, is also
planned.
</P>
<P>
   For now, many of the handwriters say they plan on persevering
with their craft, earning a living by drawing up devotional posters
and color certificates (for $1,700 a page) and tackling the old
standby, wedding invitations, one niche market that has held its
own against computer-generated facsimiles.
</P>
<P>
   But even that domain seems doomed to quaint posterity against
the likes of Penmanship Inc., a California company that makes
products to teach handwriting to children _ on a computer. Few
people here, however, were ready to talk about the death of
handwriting.

we're holding on in a tough world.''

SCANT FACTS FAIL TO DETER TV BLITZ

<P>
   Television, the medium that was thrust into the modern era of
wall-to-wall breaking news coverage by the 1963 assassination of
President John F. Kennedy, used all the tools it has mastered since
then to chronicle the scant facts and copious emotions about the
disappearance of the single-engine plane John F. Kennedy Jr. was
flying to Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour after NBC's aviation correspondent, Bob Hager,
first reported that the airplane was missing at 8:06 a.m. on
Saturday, the three major broadcast networks, along with CNN, Fox
News Channel and MSNBC, scrapped their schedules. For the next 12
hours, aerial cameras panned large expanses of waters dotted with
Coast Guard search-and-rescue craft.
</P>
<P>
   Lending power to the images of empty ocean were alternating
images of Kennedy's life and heritage. As Kennedy said in a 1998
interview with NBC, which was broadcast on Sunday, ``The family
photo album in my head is shared with a lot of people.'' Throughout
the weekend, images from the cameras that had worshipped and
hounded him since his birth were offered to viewers, like visual
eulogies. The ubiquitous picture was the 1963 image that persists
above all others: a little boy, knees bare under a short coat,
saluting as his father's coffin goes by.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the various news outlets said no one there
hesitated about moving to wall-to-wall coverage, or about regarding
the disappearance of the plane carrying Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy, and her sister Lauren G. Bessette, as a major
news event.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sesno, the Washington bureau chief of CNN, said in an
interview that the country's emotional connection to John F.
Kennedy Jr. was the essence of the news value. ``That little boy
grew up to be a responsible, contributing man,'' Sesno said. ``His
journey and fate touch the heart and soul of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The coverage drew its energy from the celebrity of Kennedy:
among those asking questions at a Pentagon press briefing about the
search for the missing aircraft was a reporter for People magazine,
which had featured Kennedy on its cover 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard Reeves, a biographer of President Kennedy, said to
Dan Rather on CBS, ``The Kennedys had a lot to do with creating,
with exploiting the new age of celebrity.'' Retrospectives on
Kennedy's life dwelt on his modesty and self-effacing humor,
defining him as much by his low-key approach to life as by his
megawatt name.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to go to continuous coverage and to make the
aircraft's disappearance the focus of Sunday morning shows, like
the ABC program ``This Week,'' meant scrapping planned guests, such
as Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who is running for the
Republican presidential nomination. When there was programming the
networks wanted to keep, like ABC's broadcast of the British Open,
it was transferred to sister cable outlets, ESPN, for example (both
ABC and ESPN are owned by The Walt Disney Co.). By contrast, during
the proceedings on the impeachment of President Clinton, cable
channels carried the main news while their sister broadcast outlets
kept their regular programming.
</P>
<P>
   Although committed to wall-to-wall coverage, the news divisions
had few new facts. They passed on, with appropriate qualifiers,
unconfirmed reports that proved false, like the report that a
flight instructor had been on board the aircraft. Viewers saw the
realities emerge bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   Without firm answers, the news programs sought out aviation
experts, people with close ties to the Kennedys, and people like
Kyle Bailey, who saw Kennedy and his party board the aircraft in
New Jersey on Friday evening. Prominent among the commentators were
people like the historian Douglas Brinkley, who wrote for George,
the magazine Kennedy started three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts to fill in the blank canvas were marked by a desire
to distinguish the few facts from the rumors. Dan Rather of CBS
repeated his trademark cautions over and over. ``We don't want to
be all rumor all the time,'' he said early on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But, in news conference after news conference, the Pentagon, the
Coast Guard and the Massachusetts State Police added a few facts,
like a grim inventory of recovered debris, including headrests,
carpeting, a bottle of medication bearing Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy's name.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday afternoon, dominant themes had emerged: the risks of
flying on a hazy night; the difference between using visual flight
rules and using instruments; how easily pilots can get disoriented
flying over water at night. Pictures of the Piper aircraft Kennedy
was flying were shown repeatedly, as were live shots outside the
Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., where the extended family
had gathered to celebrate the wedding of Rory Kennedy, the youngest
daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, however, when Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee of the Coast
Guard somberly announced Sunday night that the searchers no longer
expected to find survivors, only the cable news channels provided
live coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement freed journalists to refer to Kennedy in the
past tense, which they had tried to avoid until then. But even on
Saturday in New York, the local NBC affiliate, WNBC, showed photos
of John and Carolyn Kennedy bordered in black, saying in symbols
what no one would say in words.

RALLY COMES UP SHORT _ AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ One game cannot and will not kill the Los Angeles
Dodgers' season, but the accumulation of shouldas and couldas has
already pushed it to the brink and threatens to knock it over.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers came back from three runs down once and tied
Pittsburgh on Eric Young's two-out double in the ninth. But as has
been the case throughout, the Dodgers rarely seem to do enough to
win close games that look hopeless at one point.
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers missed out on just such a chance in the top of
the 10th, Pittsburgh's Kevin Young scored on Adrian Brown's
sacrifice fly in the bottom of the inning to give the Pirates a 6-5
win Sunday at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (41-49) had a chance to pull out of last place for
the first time since June 26, but they remain cellarmates with
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   They've played well for more than a week, winning six of eight.
But they've dug themselves such a hole by playing miserably that
with each passing loss, a comeback is that much less probable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win more of those games, that's all,'' said a
frustrated Dodgers manager Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The game had many of the elements that could serve as a catalyst
to a momentum boost, but it was just a typical letdown. The Dodgers
rallied twice, tying the game 4-4 in the sixth with three runs, two
of which came on Todd Hollandsworth's second-career pinch-hit
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Young also had the two-out hit in the ninth off Pirates'
closer Mike Williams. And Young, who left the game after the inning
with a sore right hamstring, hustled a single into a double, only
to be stranded there for the second time in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth even made a sliding catch with the bases loaded to
end the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely would have things a lot better winning the game,
with guys coming off the bench and getting clutch hits and things
like that,'' said Eric Young, who added he didn't think the injury
was serious. ``We should have had the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Alan Mills (2-3) lost it after allowing a leadoff
double to Kevin Young, who moved to third on Ed Sprague's groundout
and scored on Adrian Brown's fly to center.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers put themselves in that position, again, because
guys paid to deliver the big hit didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   Young, Mark Grudzielanek and Gary Sheffield opened the game with
singles to give the Dodgers a 1-0 lead. But with Grudzielanek on
third and none out, Eric Karros and Raul Mondesi both struck out.
Sandwiched between them, Devon White walked, but Todd Hundley flied
out to right to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' next hit came in the fifth inning. They also went 4
for 16 with runners in scoring position. None of the hits came from
the No. 3 through No. 7 hitters, who combined to go hitless in
eight at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up hitting the ball hard to the right fielder and
didn't get any air under it,'' Hundley said. ``If it's 10 feet to
the right, or 10 feet to the left, we score three runs. We've hit
what we call the `atom bomb.' You hit balls hard but right at
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Dodgers survived until the 10th, when another scoring
opportunity was wasted. With Karros at second with the go-ahead
run, Mondesi grounded into a fielder's choice and Angel Pena struck
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to do the job all the time,'' said Mondesi,
who doubled to start the three-run seventh inning. ``We've been
playing great baseball. You have to forget about it. Just win
tomorrow. We have to forget about this game. It's over.''

CAT THIEF STEALS SWAPS STAKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ When the four-horse Swaps Stakes turned into
a riveting two-horse race at the top of the homestretch Sunday,
anybody with a Racing Form knew how Hollywood Park's big event for
3-year-olds had to end.
</P>
<P>
   Inching up on the outside was 1-2 favorite General Challenge,
the Santa Anita Derby champion whose history suggested that if he
was close, he'd win.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to fight back on the inside was the well-traveled Cat
Thief, a colt whose pattern said that if it was close, he'd find a
way to finish second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for sure . . .,'' said Bob Baffert, trainer of
General Challenge, who figured he was about to add to his
nation-leading seven Grade I stakes victories this year.
</P>
<P>
   And then Cat Thief did the unexpected. He showed some heart.
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas-trained Cat Thief, ridden hard by Pat Day, fought
back after losing the lead to General Challenge and David Flores in
midstretch, and won by a head.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief covered 1[ miles in 1:47 4/5 and paid $7.60. Long shot
Walk That Walk was a distant third and rank Desert Hero was last.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cat Thief's first victory in eight starts this year,
including seconds in the Fountain of Youth and Blue Grass stakes
and thirds in the Florida and Kentucky derbies. The $300,000
winner's share of the $500,000 purse put the son of Storm Cat over
$1 million in earnings for Overbrook Farm's William T. Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gutsier performance than the two times I rode him
earlier this year,'' said Day, who was aboard Cat Thief in Florida
before turning the mount over to Mike Smith and Jerry Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd felt like there was a little more than he'd been giving
me. But today I think we could have gone around (the track) two
more times and he wouldn't have let the other horse by.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe getting his picture taken today will boost his
confidence,'' Day added, hoping the victory marked the debut of a
whole new Cat Thief. ``It should shape up to be a good late
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swaps kicks off the so-called ``second season'' for
3-year-old thoroughbreds. Owners John and Betty Mabee hoped it
would set up General Challenge for the $1 million Pacific Classic
against older horses Aug. 29 at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to think about,'' Baffert said a day after the
Mabees' Excellent Meeting was upset by Smooth Player in the
Hollywood Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said both offspring of General Meeting will go to Del
Mar _ but, typically, he wouldn't speculate on their next starts.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's rival, Lukas, was in Lexington, Ky., for a horse
auction Sunday, leaving assistant Greg Falk to saddle Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans got their money's worth with that one,''
Lukas said by phone after the Swaps. ``What a horse race.''
</P>
<P>
   Joked Baffert: ``It's one of those races where the fans got
their money's worth, but I didn't get mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swaps shared the second-to-last program of the 66-day meet
with two other graded stakes:
</P>
<P>
   __ Dixie Union ($3.40) and Alex Solis came back at Exchange Rate
and Corey Nakatani to win the Hollywood Juvenile Championship and
give breeder and co-owner Herman Sarkowsky dreams of the 2000
Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be in the Kentucky Derby for sure, right?''
Sarkowsky, founder of the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers and the
NFL's Seattle Seahawks, said with a laugh. ``Right now we know he
can run 6 furlongs.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Class jumper Plicck ($39.60) and David Flores kicked past
Lazy Lode and Majorien and held off River Bay by a neck in the
Sunset Handicap on turf. Then Plicck and River Bay were vanned off
with non-life-threatening leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a bad step probably 50 yards from the wire,'' Flores
said. ``He was easy on the lead by then and I just tried to hold
him together. When he passed the wire, I pulled him up right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Jockey Alex Solis' three winners Sunday gave him 56
going into closing day and clinched the Panamanian's fourth title
in six Hollywood Park spring-summer seasons. Trainer Ron McAnally,
with 25 winners, will lead the meet for the fourth time in nine
years. . . . Today's Hollywood Park racing will be the last in
metropolitan Los Angeles until the Oak Tree meet at Santa Anita
begins Sept. 29. . . . It also marks the swan song of Hollywood
Park clerk of scales Charlie McCaul, a familiar figure at the local
racetracks since he graduated from high school in New York 25 years
ago. McCaul will go into private business. . . . Entries will be
taken today for Thursday's opener at Del Mar.

CLINTON AND BARAK PRAISE EACH OTHER FOR PEACE EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Prime Minister Ehud Barak of
Israel exchanged toasts Sunday night at a White House dinner,
praising each other for their efforts toward peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Prime Minister,'' Clinton said, ``you have made it very
clear that Israel will keep its commitments. I want to make it
equally clear that America will do its part. And that should
include the approval by our Congress of the commitments we made at
Wye to help the parties promote the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   The president cautioned that ``much of the hard work of turning
words to deeds remains to be done,'' but added, ``I am grateful the
people of Israel have called upon you for your greatest command.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister lauded Clinton, saying, ``History will record
that few have worked more tirelessly or more effectively than the
president of the United States to prevent the breakdown of the
peace process, to give hope and help to all the peoples of our
region to take up this historic opportunity. You are really a great
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak added: ``We have a profound trust in your resolve and your
leadership, so powerfully demonstrated again this year in Kosovo.''
And he told Clinton of the coming peace process, ``I can assure you
on behalf of the people of Israel that we will overcome the
obstacles and endure the pain, knowing that America stands by us.''
