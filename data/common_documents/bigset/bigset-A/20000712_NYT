FORMER DOCTOR CHARGED IN DEATH OF 3 PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, S.D., Colo., Ill.)  By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Everywhere Michael J. Swango went, it seemed,
death soon followed. In medical school, as a young intern, as a
doctor, many of the patients he saw died. But he always managed to
find new posts _ even after he was convicted of trying to poison
several co-workers by putting ant-killer in their doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the case with the doughnuts, the authorities never
charged him with any violent crimes. But federal investigators here
said Tuesday that they had enough evidence to charge Swango with
the 1993 murders of three patients who were under his care at a
Veterans Affairs hospital in Northport and with a pattern of fraud
dating back to 1984 when, court papers charge, he killed a patient
in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The officials charged Swango _ who was to have been released
this Saturday from a federal prison in Colorado where he has served
a 3 and a half year sentence for fraudulently obtaining the
Northport post _ after exhuming the three New York patients and
finding poisons in their bodies. In some cases, the court papers
charge, Swango falsely claimed that he had obtained ``do not
resuscitate'' orders from relatives of his victims in order to make
their murders easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of using his medical license to become a healer,
Swango embarked upon a career as a killer,'' said Loretta E. Lynch,
the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. ``Through a
web of lies and deception, Swango inveigled his way into the
confidence of hospital administrators across the country and the
world. Once in their trust and in their employ, he utilized his
skills to search for victims and take their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Swango, 45, could face the death penalty. His
lawyer, Randi Chavis, did not respond to repeated messages. In the
past, Swango has maintained his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   The three murder charges stem from incidents in 1993, when
Swango was hired as a medical resident by the Stony Brook Health
Sciences Center after lying to the admissions office, saying that
his previous conviction for poisoning stemmed from a ``barroom
brawl.'' As a Stony Brook intern, he was assigned to the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center in Northport.
</P>
<P>
   He had worked there for three months when Stony Brook officials
learned about his criminal past _ which had been featured in
newspapers and on national television _ and fired him. Stony Brook
officials said at the time that they had determined that no harm
had come to the 147 patients he treated there.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials disputed that Tuesday. They charged Swango
with killing three patients with lethal injections while at the
Northport hospital: Thomas Sammarco, 73; George Siano, 60, and Aldo
Serini, all of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Stony Brook, Patrick Calabria, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also charges Swango with assaulting a fourth
patient there, Barron Harris, by injecting him with paralyzing
medication. Harris, who was 60, then fell into a coma and later
died.
</P>
<P>
   There may have been many more victims, investigators said. Lynch
said that prosecutors believe that Swango may have been involved in
a number of other murders across the globe, from Ohio to Zimbabwe.
But she declined to speculate on how many there might be.
</P>
<P>
   In the indictment, though, prosecutors paint a portrait of a
serial killer who began in his very first job out of medical
school. After that, they charge, he lied and misrepresented himself
to obtain other medical jobs where he could kill again.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Blind Eye: The Terrifying Story of a Doctor Who Got Away
With Murder'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1999), James B. Stewart, contends
that the Swango case highlights the reluctance of the medical
profession to screen or sanction its own. ``The case shows that the
medical establishment will blindly trust the word of a fellow
doctor over the word of other witnesses, and that the medical
profession cannot adequately police itself,'' Stewart said Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stewart writes in the book that questions were raised about
Swango when he was a medical student at Southern Illinois
University: classmates called him Double-O Swango, joking that he
had a license to kill, because of the large number of his cases
that ended in deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, as a medical resident at Ohio State University
Hospital, Swango was accused of causing a patient to have a seizure
after injecting something into her intravenous tube. The patient,
Rena Cooper, survived and told hospital officials about the attack,
but they did not believe her. The hospital found no evidence
against Swango, though a subsequent report on its investigation by
the dean of the university's law school found that the hospital had
not been thorough.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's indictment _ which was unsealed in federal District
Court here _ mentions the attack on Cooper and says that Swango
``murdered, attempted to murder and assaulted patients'' while at
Ohio State University Hospital. It also says that he murdered
Cynthia McGee, 19, in 1984 by giving her a potassium injection that
caused her heart to stop.
</P>
<P>
   David P. Ferguson, the associate vice president for university
relations, said that Ohio State had done its best to arrive at the
truth. ``We could all benefit from the clarity of hindsight,'' he
said, ``but we feel what we did was appropriate and diligent at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Swango was not allowed to continue his residency there for a
second year. When he left, he returned to his native Illinois and
found work as an emergency medical technician with the Adams County
Ambulance Service. While there he was convicted of lacing his
co-workers' doughnuts and coffee with an arsenic-based ant-killer.
Five people became ill, but no one was killed.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to five years in prison, but served only two.
</P>
<P>
   His sentence raised eyebrows in Ohio, where officials took
another look at his residency and found ``circumstantial evidence''
but no proof that he had committed crimes. When he got out of
prison, officials charged, Swango used false names and false
documents to try to get a number of medical positions. He was
rejected from the Ohio Valley Medical Center; hired by a Veterans
Hospital in South Dakota, but fired when his past became known, and
then hired by Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   After Swango was dismissed by Stony Brook in 1993, he went to
practice medicine in Zimbabwe _ where the authorities have issued a
warrant for his arrest on charges that he poisoned seven patients,
five of them fatally.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in 1997, while stopping over in Chicago en route
to a new job as a doctor in Dharan, Saudi Arabia. He pleaded guilty
to making a false statement to Stony Brook officials, and went to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, the Department of Veterans Affairs and prosecutors,
meanwhile, began building their case against him.

INFLUENCE-PEDDLING TRIAL BEGINS FOR A PATAKI FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Asserting that a ``pipeline'' of political corruption
stretched from Gov. George Pataki's campaign headquarters to the
highest levels of the state criminal justice system, a federal
prosecutor charged Tuesday that a volunteer fund-raiser had
illegally promised favorable parole rulings for three felons in
exchange for donations to Pataki's 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the fund-raiser, Yung Soo Yoo, called the
government's accusations ``a fairy tale'' and argued there was no
connection between the campaign donations and the parole of the
sole prisoner who was released.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer insisted that Yoo, a New Jersey businessman who was
often asked by the Republican Party to raise funds among
Korean-Americans, was simply ``trying to do a good deed'' by
advocating the prisoners' release, and that he was caught in the
unfortunate crosswinds of political interest.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Yoo stems from a two-and-a-half-year federal
investigation into accusations that Pataki officials used the
promise of early parole to help fill the governor's campaign
coffers. While the federal prosecutors overseeing the investigation
have repeatedly said there is no evidence that Pataki participated
in or had knowledge of the various crimes alleged, the case has
proved embarrassing for his administration, which has sought to
eliminate parole entirely and has made it tougher for violent
felons to win release on parole.
</P>
<P>
   The opening statements in the campaign corruption trial, which
began Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, presented starkly
different versions of the dealings among Yoo, officials close to
Pataki and the families of the three felons, John Kim, Bo Young
Chung and James Jhang. The three were convicted of several crimes,
including armed robberies and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors contend that Yoo acted illegally by
promising the families that he would use his political clout to get
their sons paroled if they donated more than $36,000 to Pataki's
election campaign. But Yoo's lawyer, Nicholas DeFeis, contended
there was no influence-peddling plot, in part because Kim, the only
one to eventually be released, was qualified under state guidelines
for parole.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In her opening statement Tuesday, Margaret Giordano, who is
prosecuting the case for the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn,
laid out a detailed map of how the families' desire for their sons'
parole traveled through Yoo to officials in Pataki's campaign
office, the State Office of Community Affairs and the State
Division of Parole.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano said this ``pipeline'' was possible because Yoo was
friendly with Patrick Donahue, Pataki's campaign finance director,
and Grace Koh, who worked as a liaison to Asian constituents in the
Community Affairs office.
</P>
<P>
   Giordano said that before the 1994 election, Yoo and Donahue
secretly met with the families and promised to work to secure
parole for the three prisoners in exchange for the donations.
``Give me three more months and I'll make good,'' Giordano quoted
Donahue as saying to the families.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Koh nor Donahue has been charged in connection with the
case. Donahue's lawyer, Thomas Puccio, did not return phone calls
Tuesday seeking comment. Andrew Lawler, Koh's lawyer, was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   After Pataki took office, Giordano said, Koh ``sent signal after
signal'' to officials of the parole board, who received her message
clearly: ``The governor's office is calling and John Kim better be
released.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Giordano said, Koh assembled parole documents for
Kim and sent them to Brion D. Travis, the chairman of the parole
board. Giordano added that Travis then held a secret meeting with
one of his deputies, Ronald Hotaling, in which, according to the
government, Travis said he was ``getting a lot of heat from the
governor's office'' about Kim's release.
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling, who pleaded guilty in the case last year, relayed the
message to a pair of parole commissioners, the government said, who
eventually decided to release Kim in April 1996. One of the
commissioners, Sean McSherry, was found guilty in August 1999 of
lying to a federal grand jury about the case. The other
commissioner, Leo S. Levy, was charged last month with misleading
investigators in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement, DeFeis said that Kim was released not
because of any illegal intercession by Yoo, but because he was an
``ideal candidate'' for parole. DeFeis said Kim's parole file
contained a recommendation for parole from the officer who arrested
him on armed robbery charges in Queens years ago and a similar
letter from one of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeis also contended it was the prisoners' families, not Yoo,
who were attempting to secure parole for the men through bribes.
``They are the bribers and the intended corrupters,'' DeFeis said.
``They were the ones who went to Yoo with bad intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoo, he said, was interested only in doing a good deed. And in
return, DeFeis said, ``he received nothing for this _ not public
office, not a dime, nothing but aggravation.''

TAYLOR GOT ELECTED TO HALL, SO IRVIN'S A SHOO-IN (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that Michael Irvin has officially called it a career, the
biggest question is where does he go from here.
</P>
<P>
   If this was any other football player, the answer would be
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Football immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's football accomplishments as the best wide receiver in
Dallas Cowboys history dictate that five years from now he should
join Steve Young and Dan Marino as members of the Pro Football Hall
of Fame Class of 2004.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers, 750 catches for 11,904 yards and 65 touchdowns in
12 years, are indisputable.
</P>
<P>
   Both the catches and yards rank among the top 10 in NFL history.
He is third in 100-yard games, with 47. His 15.9-yards-per-catch
average is better than any of his peers did in the 1990s; Jerry
Rice was second at 15.3 yards per catch.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Irvin rose to the occasion in the clutch. He
kept the chains moving on third down, caught tough passes over the
middle and proved to be a game breaker in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in the fact that Irvin was not only a member of three Super
Bowl title teams but the actual driving force behind them, and it
seems ridiculous to doubt that Irvin's Hall of Fame resume would
pass the litmus test of greatness in any era.
</P>
<P>
   But Irvin didn't play in any era. He came along during the
high-tech age of sports when Monopoly-money salaries and
intensified media scrutiny have proved to be a combustible mix.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin _ who ate cereal with water as a child because his family
(he has 16 siblings) couldn't always afford milk _ thoroughly
enjoyed the spoils of his career with cars, suits, jewelry and fur
coats. He played hard on the field and partied hard off of it.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to that fateful night in 1996 when Irvin was
busted in a Irving hotel room with drugs and a couple of strippers.
He pleaded no contest to felony drug possession and was sentenced
to four years deferred probation.
</P>
<P>
   For that, Irvin has been labeled as the poster child for the
bad-boy image that has smudged the sports landscape in recent
years. Moreover, there are those who plan to use character
questions to block his entrance into the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Those people, however, should be flagged for piling on, as they
are undoubtedly using a recanted rape allegation and a
training-camp fight in a dorm room as fodder for their position.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who alleged rape went to jail after admitting she made
the whole thing up. The Cowboys, the NFL and Irvin's probation
officials ruled that the dorm tussle that left guard Everett McIver
with a cut on his neck was unfortunate and regrettable, but not
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are that Irvin is guilty of only one damning
transgression. And that slate has been wiped clean now that he has
completed probation and regained all rights and privileges as a
regular citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Should Irvin continue to be punished for a crime even after
paying his debt to society?
</P>
<P>
   Also, to use that incident against Irvin would mean that the
lessons learned from last year's Hall induction of former New York
Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor have been ignored. Not only did
Taylor flunk multiple drug tests during his NFL career, but he has
been arrested twice on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his bust is in the Hall of Fame because his on-field
exploits warranted his induction.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for Irvin, who never drew the NFL's ire by flunking a drug
test and whose status as one of the hardest workers in franchise
history serves as proof that his off-field dealings never
interfered with his commitment to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let the five-year wait begin. nn

IRVIN WASN'T THE BEST, SO IMAGE CAN HURT CHANCES OF ENSHRINEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Irvin is one of the Dallas Cowboys' all-time greatest
players. By definition, that should make him one of the NFL's
all-time greatest players.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing is ever that simple with Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who retired Tuesday because of a spinal condition, caught
almost everything thrown his way for 12 years. However, he isn't
likely to catch a break from the 38 writers and broadcasters who
elect players into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that is an indictment of the voters rather than Irvin.
Lawrence Taylor once called them ``old phonies'' unfit to judge
him. But that is exactly what they do.
</P>
<P>
   The selectors are the judge and the jury of the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Irvin pleaded no contest to second-degree felony
cocaine possession in exchange for four years of deferred probation
and a $10,000 fine. There also was a recanted rape allegation that
saw his accuser sent to jail for lying, and a training-camp fight
that left offensive lineman Everett McIver with a cut on his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike baseball, which has punished Pete Rose for his gambling
problems, football's Hall of Fame has no criteria for citizenship
in its bylaws.
</P>
<P>
   But former Minnesota Vikings defensive end Carl Eller, a former
drug addict who was accused of sexual assault last year, is
unlikely to ever be rewarded for his five All-Pro selections and
his six Pro Bowl appearances that spanned a 16-year career. Draw
your own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   And though Taylor was arguably the NFL's greatest linebacker,
his election in his first year of eligibility was not unanimous.
Taylor twice was charged with drug-related offenses after his
retirement from the New York Giants in 1993, including pleading no
contest to purchasing $50 worth of crack cocaine from an undercover
police officer in St. Pete Beach, Fla., in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite backlash from some selection committee members for his
off-field problems, Taylor was rewarded for what he did on the
field when he earned football immortality last year.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't only Irvin's drug bust that might prevent him from
getting a bust in Canton.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin will never be mentioned as the NFL's greatest receiver. He
was a great player, but being a great player is not nearly enough
to assure election into the Hall. Call it the politics of football.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Youngblood, one of the NFL's all-time great defensive ends,
has been waiting and waiting and waiting for his induction.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks were not recognized by the NFL as an official statistic
until 1982. Youngblood played from 1971-84, so the NFL credits him
with the 24 sacks he had in his last three seasons. But Youngblood
had 126.5 sacks before that. His 150.5 total sacks are surpassed in
NFL history by only Reggie White (192.5), Deacon Jones (173.5) and
Bruce Smith (171).
</P>
<P>
   Youngblood, who played with the Los Angeles Rams, survived the
final cut to six in his first year of eligibility, which is as
close to the Hall doors as he has come in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin is tied for 10th in NFL history in career receptions with
750 and ranks ninth in receiving yards at 11,904. He also has three
Super Bowl rings. Is it enough for the 80 percent approval
necessary?
</P>
<P>
   James Lofton played 16 seasons. He made All-Pro four times. He
played in eight Pro Bowls and three Super Bowls. Only Jerry Rice
has more receiving yards than Lofton's 14,004, and Lofton ranks
ninth in receptions.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't Lofton in the Hall of Fame? Lofton doesn't have a
Super Bowl ring, but Lynn Swann and John Stallworth each have four,
and they aren't enshrined.
</P>
<P>
   It might be easier to get through the eye of a needle than into
Canton.
</P>
<P>
   That means Irvin should expect induction into the Cowboys' Ring
of Honor. He can only hope for induction into the Hall of Fame. nn

ALL-STAR FORMAT NEEDS REVAMPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ (begin ital)Today's All-Star, No-Bull edition of
The Sporting Muse:(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   - If Major League Baseball begins to fret about the public's
attention span and interest in the All-Star game, it only has
itself to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The game's importance and relevance has been watered down
considerably the last few years for a variety of reasons --
expansion that has swelled rosters to 30-plus including injury
replacements, free agency that sends players flying across league
lines, and interleague play that has removed the special,
once-a-year atmosphere that was the game's focus.
</P>
<P>
   In the era before cable television and free agency, the All-Star
game was the only chance to see Stan Musial and Ted Williams on the
same field. Or even in a more contemporary time, a career A.L.
player like Reggie Jackson against a career National Leaguer like
Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this stat: Of the more than 60 players elected or added
to the all-star team, including those who opted out due to injury,
25 of them have played in both leagues during their career,
including both starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe it's time to change the format and take advantage of
baseball's diversity. A U.S. versus the World format would
definitely give the game some bite.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the starters, reserves and replacements who made the
2000 rosters, here's how the lineups for Tuesday's game might have
looked with that kind of format:
</P>
<P>
   World: P, Pedro Martinez (Dominican Republic); C, Ivan Rodriguez
(Puerto Rico); 1B, Andres Galarraga (Venezuela); 2B, Roberto Alomar
(P.R); 3B Tony Batista (D.R.); SS, Edgar Renteria (Colombia); LF
Vladimir Guerrero (D.R.); CF, Bernie Williams (P.R.); RF Sammy Sosa
(D.R.); DH, Magglio Ordonez (Venezuela); Closer, Mariano Rivera
(Panama).
</P>
<P>
   Aside from those 11 players, there were seven other players from
other countries on the field in Atlanta, including Cincinnati's
Danny Graves, who was born in Vietnam, and Florida's Ryan Dempster,
who is Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.: P, Randy Johnson; C, Mike Piazza; 1B, Mark McGwire; 2B,
Jeff Kent; 3B, Cal Ripken; SS, Alex Rodriguez; LF, Barry Bonds; CF,
Ken Griffey Jr.; RF, Jermaine Dye; DH, Darin Erstad; Closer, Trevor
Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's this: A West versus East game that would also break
league barriers and embrace continental drift. Again, using the
2000 rosters, how about these teams, sprinkling in players from the
Caribbean into the East team?
</P>
<P>
   East: P, Martinez; C, Piazza (Philly); 1B, Todd Helton
(Tennessee); 2B, Alomar or Ray Durham (North Carolina); 3B, Chipper
Jones (Florida) or Ripken (Maryland); SS, Derek Jeter (New York) or
Rodriguez (Florida); LF, Gary Sheffield (Florida); CF, Griffey
(born in Philly, raised in Cincinnati); RF, Carl Everett (Florida);
Closer, Derek Lowe (Michigan).
</P>
<P>
   The opponent could even be an all-California unit.
</P>
<P>
   West: P, Johnson (Walnut Creek, USC) or David Wells (Torrance);
C, Jason Kendall (Torrance) or Mike Lieberthal (Glendora); 1B,
McGwire (Pomona, USC) or Jason Giambi (West Covina, Long Beach
State); 2B, Kent (Bellflower); 3B, Troy Glaus (Tarzana, UCLA); SS,
Nomar Garciaparra (Whittier); LF, Barry Bonds (Riverside); CF, Jim
Edmonds (Fullerton); RF, Brian Giles (El Cajon); Closer, Hoffman
(Bellflower).
</P>
<P>
   That's not even all the all-stars who hail from the state --
there's also Ryan Klesko (Westminster), Jermaine Dye (Vacaville),
Mike Sweeney (Orange), Darryl Kile (Garden Grove) and Jeff Cirillo
(Pasadena).
</P>
<P>
   Some people would consider it politically incorrect and
exclusionary, but I'd be fascinated by an all-star format that
honored the Negro League and the barrier Jackie Robinson broke and
create a team of African-American stars.
</P>
<P>
   It would at least put a sense of spectacle back in the All-Star
game. And where does it say a little controversy is bad? ...
</P>
<P>
   - Tuesday's game was deadly dull. The absence of the McGwires
and Ripkens undoubtedly was a letdown, not that any of their
replacements were wanting. Part of the blame has to go to the crowd
in Atlanta, which isn't known for being raucous, unless they're
doing that dreaded Tomahawk Chop.
</P>
<P>
   And allow me to be the first to express relief that it never
reared its ugly chant.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from seeing Derek Jeter have a nice game and Chipper and
Galarraga do well in front of the home crowd, the game was a
non-event. Most poignant moment: The camera catching the Angels
Troy Glaus yawning during the eighth inning. ...
</P>
<P>
   - NBC's coverage was as mundane as the game. I miss Bob Uecker,
who may not have been much of an analyst but would could be counted
on to drop a few good one-liners or zingers.
</P>
<P>
   Airing tape of dugout conversations was nice, but this is the
kind of event that screams for a live microphone on a few players
who could lend commentary to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Like, how about a microphone on injured pitcher Greg Maddux, who
could talk about how he would pitch Jeter? Or a mic on Giambi
talking about what it's like to face Johnson or Tom Glavine?
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has personality, but humdrum affairs like Tuesdays say
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   - Best line of the night, from NBC's Bob Costas: ``If you're
scoring at home, stop.'' ...

MAVS SEEK MIX OF OLD AND NEW TO BUILD ON SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let the guesswork begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Mavericks just completed their five-day minicamp for
rookies, free agents and selected veterans, and one thing seems
certain: nearly half the roster will be overhauled when the 2000-01
season begins in November.
</P>
<P>
   So the question becomes, who will make the cut for the new-look
Mavs?
</P>
<P>
   Barring possible trades, six holdovers appear to be locks to
return, and the four rookie draft picks also seem assured roster
slots. That leaves two spots on the 12-man roster open, plus two or
three more spots for players likely to be carried on the injured
list.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs' two best players, All-Star guard Michael Finley and
ever-improving forward Dirk Nowitzki, are nearly untouchable. Any
hopes of fielding a contender are contingent on building around
those two, owner Mark Cuban has said.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Steve Nash, center Shawn Bradley, free-agent power
forward Gary Trent and small forward Cedric Ceballos also figure in
next season's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Contract issues make Nash and Bradley nearly untradeable _ Nash
has more than five years remaining on a deal paying him more than
$5 million per season, while Bradley enters the last year of his
contract paying him more than $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Trent, who had a breakout season two years ago before missing
nearly all of 1999-2000 with injuries, is expected to re-sign with
the team Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos, the Mavs' third-leading scorer, shuffled in and out of
the starting lineup last season. He will likely come off the bench
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The four rookies _ guard Courtney Alexander, and forwards Etan
Thomas, Donnell Harvey and Eduardo Najera _ also have roster spots
virtually clinched, but their roles this season should vary
greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Alexander expect to see big minutes, with Thomas
providing a needed physical presence up front and Alexander, a
backcourt scoring boost off the bench as Finley's apprentice.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey remains a raw talent and could see time on the injured
list. He missed much of minicamp with a strained groin muscle. ``He
could be the next Dennis Rodman, without the hair,'' Mavericks
assistant coach Donnie Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Najera has impressed coaches with his all-around play, but
finding minutes for him could be difficult. Najera is also making
the switch from college power forward to NBA small forward,
prolonging his adjustment period to the pro game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the rookies, the Mavs picked up two veterans on draft
day through trades. Point guard Eric Murdock, from the Los Angeles
Clippers, and forward John Wallace, from New York, strengthen the
bench. Mavs coach Don Nelson has told Murdock, who missed 42 games
last season and recently had an MRI done on his right knee, that he
will back up Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up and that makes 12. So where does that leave free
agents Hubert Davis and Greg Buckner, who both contributed greatly
last season, centers Bruno Sundov and Hot Rod Williams, and guards
Damon Jones and Robert Pack?
</P>
<P>
   Sundov, Williams, Jones and Pack appear to be on the way out. If
the Mavs can't trade Williams and Pack, the team will have to
absorb their contracts, more than $6 million combined this season.
Williams probably would retire, while the oft-injured Pack would
try to sign elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sundov set himself back by missing minicamp with a sprained left
ankle and Jones has been told to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Buckner, a restricted free agent, has received a three-year,
$2.5 million deal with Vancouver, leaving his return questionable.
The Mavs had offered Buckner a contract starting at about $500,000
per year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the money, Buckner is looking for more playing
time and the Mavs appear loaded in the backcourt. Cuban said he
would probably match the offer, but in doing so the Mavs would
expend valuable cap room next year and part of their salary-cap
exceptions this season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the league's 3-point shooting percentage leader last
season, is a safer bet to come back, though he's listening to
offers from several teams. The Mavs have offered a one-year deal
between $3.5 million-$4 million, while Davis would prefer the
security of a three or four-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs, who have a $2.25 million salary-cap exception, are
also in the hunt for a backup center. They have expressed interest
in free agents Scot Pollard (Sacramento), Jahidi White (Washington)
and Brad Miller (Charlotte). Gheorghe Muresan, the 7-foot-7 free
agent who spent the past two seasons in New Jersey and is playing
on the Mavs' summer-league team, is also a possibility. MINICAMP
SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs' summer-league team left Monday to play an 11-game
schedule, beginning Tuesday in Long Beach, Calif., and concluding
in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to realize that this is a full-time job, there's
no break from now until October,'' owner Mark Cuban said.
``Everybody wants to get better and that's what's important to
me.'' nn

LATEST POLL SHOWS BUSH SURGING AHEAD OF GORE IN MISSOURI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Up by only two points in February, Republican
George W. Bush has surged to an 11-point lead over Democrat Al Gore
in Missouri, one of the key swing states in the presidential race,
according to a new poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, commissioned by The Kansas City Star, showed Bush
leading Gore by 48 percent to 37 percent as the candidates approach
their party conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Third-party contenders barely registered. Reform Party candidate
Pat Buchanan attracted 2 percent support, as did Green Party
nominee Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate. Undecided voters
totaled 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's strong showing is considered significant because of
Missouri's standing as one of the nation's most reliable
presidential bellwether states. Missouri voters have picked every
presidential winner but one _ Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 _ in the
20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is expected to do well in the South and West, with the
exception of the West Coast. Gore is expected to do better in the
Northeast. Political observers say Gore will have to win most of a
belt of key states that includes Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan,
Illinois and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   In national polls that draw responses from all states, Bush is
ahead in virtually every recent poll, although the margin of his
lead varies. A Gallup Poll conducted for CNN and USA Today in late
June had Bush up over Gore 50 percent to 38 percent, with Nader
drawing 6 percent and Buchanan 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Another late-June survey for Fox News had Bush leading by the
smaller margin of 42 percent to 37 percent, with Nader at 7 percent
and Buchanan at 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In February, before the Missouri primary, the Texas governor led
the vice president in Missouri by 44 percent to 42 percent, a
statistical tie, when a survey by The Star asked about a potential
race between Gore, Bush and Buchanan. At the time, however, Sen.
John McCain of Arizona and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey
were still in the primary contest.
</P>
<P>
   The trend shown by the latest poll pleased Bush aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the poll reflects the strength of Governor Bush's
leadership message on reforming Social Security, rebuilding the
military and being a different kind of Republican,'' said Bush
spokesman Tucker Eskew. ``That has enormous appeal in Missouri and
across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gore dismissed the poll as relatively
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls at this point are just snapshots in time,'' said Gore
aide Jano Cabrera. ``It's July. People are focused on...hanging out
with their kids, planning vacations. At this point, the last thing
they're thinking about is the issues and the experience of the
candidates, which will come later.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Gore has been the subject of critical news
stories that have questioned the direction and focus of his
campaign. Also receiving coverage was Gore's involvement in
questionable fund-raising practices in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Since the earlier poll, Gore's unfavorable recognition rose 7
points as Bush's dropped 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results don't surprise me, because Gore has taken a lot of
negative publicity lately and so it's evidently had an effect,''
said St. Louis University political scientist Ken Warren.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 624 registered voters who said they vote regularly
was conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research Inc. of Washington
from Thursday to Monday. The poll had a margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Mason-Dixon found that Bush led in all areas of Missouri,
although his leads in the state's two largest cities _ Kansas City
and St. Louis _ were about the margin of error. Those cities are
considered traditional Democratic strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the four rural regions, he led by at least 8 points,
with his largest lead coming in the GOP-dominant southwest
Missouri, where survey respondents favored Bush by 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has stuck to a positive message, a consistent
message, and he hasn't had to change who he is or what he believes
in in order to respond to the latest poll or focus group,'' Eskew
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore spokesman Cabrera said the race would tighten once
voters began to examine Bush's plans for tax cuts and changes in
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In another positive sign for Bush, the poll showed the governor
leading among both Missouri men and women. In 1996, Republican
nominee Bob Dole had a particularly difficult time attracting women
to his fold, and the resulting gender gap undermined his chances of
defeating President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was up over Gore among women by 44 percent to 41 percent
and among men by a sizable 52 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, political scientist Barbara Sinclair of the
University of California at Los Angeles, said Bush's chief campaign
theme of ``compassionate conservative'' is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's managing to project a somewhat softer, more caring
image'' that sells well with women, Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   Men are backing Bush because males are most likely to agree with
a central GOP belief that people should get ahead on their own,
Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And everything from tax cuts to being strong on defense and
pro-gun tends to be more appealing to men,'' she added, referring
to some of Bush's core ideas.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush's lead continues, one question will be whether other GOP
candidates in Missouri can expect to enjoy a coattails bump at the
polls, courtesy of their popular presidential candidate. The state
is the site of highly competitive races for the U.S. Senate,
governor and a slew of other statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans shouldn't count on too much, said professor
Warren of St. Louis University. A bounce from a winning
presidential contender tends to be statistically insignificant, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most times, candidates running statewide or for Congress win
or lose on their own merits.''

JETER LEADS AMERICAN LEAGUE TO VICTORY IN ALL-STAR GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Derek Jeter tucked his jersey into his uniform pants
and listed the people who were at the All-Star Game to watch him
start for the American League on Tuesday night. Jeter mentioned his
parents, his sister and three of his friends from New York, shaking
his head as he talked about securing enough decent tickets. But
Jeter should not have stopped his list at six.
</P>
<P>
   Beside Jeter's family and friends, there were 51,317 other fans
who were at Turner Field to watch him. It happened that way because
the game that was missing marquee players like Mark McGwire, Ken
Griffey Jr., Alex Rodriguez and Pedro Martinez, and was being
called the All-Scar Game, developed into another perfect stage for
the amazing Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter stroked three hits, knocked in two runs and scored one run
to power the American League past the National League, 6-3, and
became the first New York Yankee to be voted most valuable player
in the All-Star Game since the award was instituted in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre chose his shortstop as the starter after
Rodriguez sustained a concussion last Friday, and Jeter poked a
two-run single off the New York Mets' Al Leiter in the fourth
inning to break a 1-1 tie in helping the A.L. win the game for the
fourth straight year. Leiter wound up the losing pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely means a lot,'' Jeter said before the game.
``At this position, especially in our league, you never know if you
might get another chance to start. I have to cherish it. You never
know if you'll get a chance again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter will undoubtedly get another chance. Yogi Berra, Mickey
Mantle, Roger Maris, Reggie Jackson, Thurman Munson, Dave Winfield,
Reggie Jackson, Don Mattingly, Rickey Henderson, Paul O'Neill and
Mariano Rivera have played in All-Star Games as Yankees over the
last 38 years, but none ever claimed the award that Jeter did on
Tuesday night. After all the attention on who was not playing,
Jeter made sure that fans noticed who was playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No player likes to see a player get hurt, especially in a game
like this,'' Jeter said of the missing players. ``But there are
still a lot of good players in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans lined up outside Turner Field early on a steamy day.
Some had their tickets, some were searching for tickets and most
were eager to watch the finest players in baseball. Well, they were
eager to see most of the best players in baseball. The list of
injured players was stunning for its size and stature.
</P>
<P>
   Players like McGwire, Griffey, Rodriguez, Martinez, Cal Ripken
Jr., Mike Piazza, Barry Bonds and Greg Maddux are not
once-in-a-lifetime All-Stars. They are future Hall of Famers and
the kind of players fans thirst to watch in this game each July.
But all eight, plus Manny Ramirez, were spectators this time.
</P>
<P>
   If Roberto Alomar's bruised right elbow had prevented him from
playing second base for the American League on Tuesday night, there
would have been at least one player for all nine positions on the
All-Injury team. Atlanta's Bobby Cox, the National League manager,
lamented that some fans would not get to see ``their heroes and
superstars.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were still plenty of stars on hand, and plenty of
excellent performances. Jeter doubled in the first inning, the only
blemish off Randy Johnson in Johnson's eight-pitch cruise through
his only inning. David Wells was crisper as he whiffed two in two
shutout innings, throwing 23 of his 27 pitches for strikes and then
hanging out with his 8-year-old son, Brandon, in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I enjoy the spotlight for the fact that I'm afraid to
fail,'' Wells said. ``I want to be the hero.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Jeter. The A.L. loaded the bases against Leiter in the
fourth on a walk, Travis Fryman's single and Barry Larkin's error.
With one out, Jeter, the Yankee, faced Leiter, the Met. The two
opposed each other last Friday when the Yankees beat the Mets, 2-1,
at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had spoken to Alomar earlier in the game about trying to
resist swinging at Leiter's cut fastball, a pitch that starts out
over the plate and dives in hard on right-handed batters. Leiter
threw the cutter on the first pitch. Jeter could not resist, and he
blooped it over Larkin for a two-run single that put the A.L. ahead
to stay, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit it well,'' said Jeter, who had struck out in his
other two All-Star at-bats before Tuesday night and decided to
swing early in the count. ``I just hit it in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, the N.L.'s third pitcher, had scant control as the
A.L. took a 1-0 lead in the third. After Jim Edmonds sprinted to
the center-field warning track and made a gorgeous basket catch
over the shoulder on Mike Bordick's 395-foot fly ball, Brown looked
lost. The $105 million pitcher with the mean streak had a wild
streak.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Alomar, and Jeter squirted a single over second base
for his second hit. Bernie Williams grounded to third for the
second out, but Brown walked Jason Giambi on a 3-2 pitch to fill
the bases. Brown then fell behind by 3-0 on Carl Everett. The crowd
booed. Brown rebounded to pump two high fastballs by Everett, but
he unleashed another high fastball for ball four to score the first
run.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the third, Chipper Jones quickly tied the score
when he belted James Baldwin's 2-0 fastball to left-center field
for a homer. Since Jones was playing on his home field, he rounded
the bases with a huge smile. When he touched the plate, he used
both hands to point to the fans behind the plate. He became the
13th All-Star to homer in his own ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' said Jones. ``I mean, it's every little
boy's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones made a bid to be the hero when he had one of the three
singles off Oakland's Jason Isringhausen to chisel the deficit to
3-2 in the fifth. But Isringhausen retired Sammy Sosa on a fly ball
to center and got Jeff Kent on an infield pop to preserve a one-run
lead and keep Jeter's two-run single as the most important hit of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get butterflies before the game,'' Jeter said. ``It's a
situation where you've got the best players in baseball here. You
want to have fun, but you also want to do well. But the No. 1
priority, I think, is just to come out here and give the fans a
good show.'' &QL;

LAKERS EYE MAGIC'S AMAECHI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO - The Lakers' search for frontcourt help has taken
them to a familiar source: the roster of the Orlando Magic. Four
years after plucking away Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers have set
their sights on Orlando free agent John Amaechi.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-10, 270-pound Amaechi could fill two glaring Laker needs _
a backup center for O'Neal and a starter at power forward. Amaechi,
29, averaged 10.5 points and 3.3 rebounds in 80 games at center
last season, his first with Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Amaechi met with Laker officials over the weekend but is said to
be leaning toward returning to the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Bill Sweek said 17 teams have expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, it's between the Lakers and Orlando,'' Amaechi
told the Orlando Sentinel.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who are over the salary cap, can only offer the
midlevel salary exception - a starting salary of $2.25 million, or
up to a six-year deal worth $17.7 million. The Magic is under the
cap and can offer Amaechi much more. Orlando also is eager to
retain him after losing its bid to land San Antonio's Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Amaechi plans to meet with Magic officials later this week
before making a decision. The Chicago Bulls, who have plenty of cap
room, also could offer Amaechi a more lucrative deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also are expected to announce soon that they will
exercise their option to bring back 36-year-old guard Ron Harper.

YOUNGER GAY MEN SHOW LESS CAUTION AS AIDS RATES RISE
</HEADLINE>
bc-LADN-AIDS.A (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Complacent because of potent drugs that prolong
the lives of people with AIDS, young gay men in Los Angeles have
been contracting the deadly virus at a rate faster than the
national average but still slower than in New York, according to a
report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, to be published Wednesday, suggest that public
health messages are not successful in reaching young people at risk
for the disease. Too young to have witnessed the ravages of the
first wave of AIDS and aware that anti-AIDS drug cocktails can keep
the illness in check, they are engaging in risky sex, said Wesley
Ford, a co-investigator in the study for the county Department of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get sick, they'll have something for it: There is that
laissez-faire attitude,'' Ford said. ``But that's part of the
risk-taking behavior that's associated with younger men.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1998, health officials surveyed 509 boys and
men 15 to 22 years old and screened them for human immunodeficiency
virus, the precursor to AIDS. Of the 42 men who were HIV positive,
80 percent did not know they were infected.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of Los Angeles County respondents who were
infected, 8.3 percent, exceeded a national rate of 7.2 percent. In
New York City, young gay men had an infection rate of 12.1 percent.
In the overall population, HIV infection rates run less than 0.05
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The jarring finding reverses steady declines of new HIV rates
reported locally and across the country since their peak in the
early 1990s. New HIV infection rates had dropped from an estimated
13,000 in 1990 to 2,000 in 1999, said Nicole Russo-Okamoto,
spokeswoman for AIDS Project L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had thought it was on the wane, and to see these numbers,
it's scary,'' she said. ``There's this younger group that's so far
removed from the AIDS epidemic that it's not in their thought
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Russo-Okamoto and Ford said that HIV prevention messages need to
be changed. Rather than campaigns aimed at changing sexual
behavior, Ford suggested public health agencies emphasize
establishing safe sex practices among young people having sex for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find what kinds of messages work for them,'' Ford
said.

SWISS BANK IS ACQUIRING PAINEWEBBER 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK McGEEHAN and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For several years, Donald B. Marron has waved off
questions about when he would relent and sell the PaineWebber
Group, the fourth-largest U.S. brokerage firm and the biggest one
that is not part of a financial services conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Marron, the firm's longtime chairman and chief executive,
appears to be waving a white towel in surrender. UBS A.G., a giant
Swiss bank that was formerly called Union Bank of Switzerland, has
offered to pay about $12 billion in cash and stock for PaineWebber,
and the companies were expecting to announce an agreement on
Wednesday, according to executives close to the deal. Almost $1
billion of the purchase price will go into a bonus pool to retain
crucial employees of PaineWebber, an executive said.
</P>
<P>
   That price would translate to slightly more than $73 a share, or
a premium of about 46 percent over PaineWebber's closing price
Tuesday of $49.9375. Shares of PaineWebber rose $3.8125 as
speculation about a possible merger circulated.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest beneficiaries of the acquisition would be the
General Electric Co. and Marron. G.E., which sold the defunct
Kidder Peabody brokerage firm to PaineWebber, owns about 31.5
million shares, or 22 percent, of PaineWebber's stock. Those shares
would be worth about $2.3 billion at the proposed price. Marron,
who has run PaineWebber for two decades, owns shares that would be
worth more than $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal called for UBS to pay about half of the
purchase price in cash and the other half in UBS stock, an
executive said. It would be the biggest deal involving a Wall
Street firm since Congress passed legislation late last year that
tore down walls built in the 1920s to separate banks, investment
banks and insurance companies. Some analysts expected that change
to usher in a wave of consolidation, but so far most of the
acquisitions have been relatively small ones that probably could
have been done under the old laws.
</P>
<P>
   In buying PaineWebber, UBS would be copying a model pioneered by
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. that combines the process of creating
securities for sale, known as investment banking, with the
distribution of those products to investors through a network of
brokers. The biggest financial services firm, Citigroup, and the
biggest securities firm, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., are
products of mergers of investment banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   UBS and PaineWebber are quite complementary, so executives close
to the firms expect minimal job losses as a result of the deal. UBS
manages about $1 trillion in assets, mostly for European
institutions. It also has a U.S. investment banking arm built
around the Warburg and Dillon Read firms that it bought in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber's investment banking operation has never been
competitive with the biggest Wall Street firms, but it has a
significant stock research and trading business. UBS specializes in
research and trading of European securities and currencies.
</P>
<P>
   UBS, which has made no secret of its ambition to be a major
player in financial services on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean,
in May listed its stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Marcel
Ospel, UBS' chairman, did not deny that a primary reason for the
listing was to create a currency that could be used to make
acquisitions in this country.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Ospel said in an interview that the stock listing
``will just add to the flexibility to act if we wanted to act.'' He
said UBS would use ``all routes'' to achieve its goal of building a
broad financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of PaineWebber and UBS were not available for comment
on Tuesday night. At PaineWebber's headquarters in Manhattan,
employees were huddled late into the evening. One executive leaving
the building after 8 p.m. said, ``We're all working late and
learning German.''
</P>
<P>
   UBS, a banking giant formed by the 1998 merger of Union Bank of
Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corp., has been the most aggressive
of the foreign banks. It has built a big sales and trading
operation centered at a huge headquarters in downtown Stamford,
Conn., complete with what it proclaims is the world's largest
trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber has long been seen as one of the most attractive
targets on Wall Street because it has a network of 8,500 brokers in
300 offices around the country who cater to affluent investors.
PaineWebber also has a significant money management business. It
has been the subject of takeover rumors for years, but Marron, who
is 65, has steadfastly avowed the firm's independence until this
year.
</P>
<P>
   UBS plans to operate PaineWebber as its brokerage arm, but a
person close to the deal said that Marron will stay on only briefly
before moving on to manage money. Two of Marron's lieutenants,
chief financial officer Regina A. Dolan and president Joseph Grano,
are expected to continue to hold top management jobs at
PaineWebber, this person said.

FIREFIGHTERS: BEWARE OF WATER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Fort Bragg, Calif., Volunteer Fire
Department recently special-ordered a very large pair of fire
boots.
</P>
<P>
   VFD secretary Vanette St. John opened the package, inspected the
boots and found a tag that read: ``Avoid getting wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the Fort Bragg VFD forgot to specify that they are
 &UR; not  &LR; one of those outfits that fights fires by beating them out
with Ping-Pong paddles.
</P>
<P>
   IN A SIMILAR vein, I was strolling around Pac Bell Park one
recent game and came upon a booth near the bleachers where salesmen
were trying to collar folks into applying for a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Their gimmick was that if you filled out the application, they
gave you a nifty baseball glove. Free!
</P>
<P>
   I was fairly sure these were not mink-lined, $250 Barry
Bonds-model gloves, but they looked fairly cool, so I signed
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Took glove out of bag, noticed that the leather had the supple
feel of a pack of cigarettes. Saw large stamped warning on glove
that glove is not be used for playing of baseball. Pushed on web.
Web laces snapped.
</P>
<P>
   So if you get one of these gloves and give it to your kid _ and
who else would you give it to, your mother-in-law? _ be sure to
tell the kid to make sure to carry a small bag to collect broken
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   I know credit card firms do sleazy things, like asking you to
send them money every month if you charge stuff on the card, but
this is low.
</P>
<P>
   MUNI BUSES have advertising placards inside, and sometimes the
placards carry ``Streetfare'' poems, created by folks like you and
me and printed by Muni for the cultural edification of us all.
</P>
<P>
   So Elizabeth Chur looked twice before she realized this one poem
was not Muni issue, but was slapped up there on the ad space by
some underground poet. It was titled ``Muni Haiku 13,'' and it
went:
</P>
<P>
   ``Apology is/unnecessary when no /schedule exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Chur notes that the last line is one syllable short of a haiku,
unless you use the British pronunciation ``shed-u-ul.''
</P>
<P>
   MISTAKES MADE here, fresh daily, although I prefer to think of
them as amusing bloopers &AMP; blunders that could be the basis of a
humorous TV show, if only I could get Ed McMahon and Dick Clark to
host it.
</P>
<P>
   First up, Ruger guns (Or should that be firearms? Or
constitutionally approved devices for control of a run-amok
government?) are  &UR; not  &LR; foreign-made, since they are made in
Connecticut. But you have to agree, they  &UR; sound  &LR; foreign. But then
so does Haagen-Dazs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of ice cream, the original Swensen's ice cream parlor
is indeed still in operation, at Union and Hyde, but that happens
to be on Russian Hill, not in Cow Hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gallagher passes along a trivia note about Cow Hollow:
Octavia Gough was a dairyman's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Starting now, I assume nothing. I once assumed that Cow Hollow's
name might have come about because that area was once a gathering
place for artists to bring large wooden carvings of cows and then,
using special tools and secret techniques, hollow them out.
</P>
<P>
   Got time for one more correction? David Bell tactfully notes,
``It's the Amish who raise barns in a day, not the Quakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that just like the Quakers, holier than thou, to think
they're above such folderol as helping a neighbor raise a barn?
</P>
<P>
   THEY CAN'T get enough culture up there in wine country.
</P>
<P>
   Meadowood Resort's annual Opera on the Lawn Thursday (ticket
sales open to the public) won't be just any old opera that you can
hear at any old opera house. Maestro Richard Williams and S.F.
Opera director Richard Harrell have co-created a special
for-this-gig-only performance.
</P>
<P>
   Superb dining and wining and opera-buffing. And if this doesn't
go over, next year Meadowood will probably say the heck with it and
put on a tribute to Grand Funk Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   JEFF KENT of the Giants and Jason Giambi of the A's were in the
starting lineups of last night's All-Star Game, thanks to the
dogged efforts of Bay Area voters.
</P>
<P>
   The local fans stuffed the ballot boxes via the Internet. And
there were folks like the man  &LR; husband and wife who sat in their
Lower Box 106 at Pac Bell Park, night after night, hand-punching
thousands of ballots for Kent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Chicago politics,'' a Giants exec told me, ``but for
a good cause.''
</P>
<P>
   And how about that All-Star Home Run contest Monday night? The
TV announcers did a magnificent job of turning a glorified batting
practice session into the shelling of Ft. Sumter.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to have those guys broadcast one hour of my life, to
make it seem exciting.
</P>
<P>
   AND SPEAKING of sports ... It's a shame that Bill Rojas got
bounced out of another big-time job.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor is he's the leading candidate to be the next coach of
the Golden State Warriors.

FOUNDATION BEGINS $50.5 MILLION EFFORT TO RESTORE
CALIFORNIA'S  MISSIONS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARL NOLTE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco foundation has begun a $50.5
million campaign to restore the 21 Spanish missions that are among
the oldest and least understood institutions in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The missions, which flourished in the years before the American
flag flew over California, are viewed either as relics of a
romantic vanished past or symbols of European imperialism that
destroyed the native culture.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is more complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I stand outside Mission San Jose, I tell people that it's
true that the way of life of my ancestors no longer exists because
of the presence of this colonial institution,'' said Andrew Galvan,
an Ohlone Indian who is helping raise money to preserve the
missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, when I go inside I see the place where my
great-great-grandfather was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   ``These missions were built by Indians and for Indians,'' Galvan
said. ``We are all connected to these missions, as a spiritual
home, as a symbol of the survival of a people, or as a symbol of
oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find myself in an odd juxtaposition,'' said Galvan, who is
an archaeologist interested in the 3,000-year history of his
people.
</P>
<P>
   The beginning of the end of the world of the Indian people came
in 1769, when the first Spanish mission was founded in San Diego.
When the last mission was founded, by the Mexican authorities at
Sonoma in 1823, the Franciscan padres had a string of 21 missions,
each a day's journey apart, connected by a road called El Camino
Real.
</P>
<P>
   They had converted thousands of the California Indians, but
thousands more died of disease, of overwork or of the shock of
cultural contact with the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   The missions were really the beginning of modern California, for
better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The missions introduced modern agriculture to California, built
irrigation ditches, introduced the growing of grapes and the first
orange trees. The style of the missions _ whitewashed adobe with
graceful bell towers and arches _ has been widely copied in public
buildings and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Entire small cities _ like Santa Barbara _ have embraced the
mission style. Even a national fast-food chain _ Taco Bell _ uses a
modified mission-style building.
</P>
<P>
   But the old missions have a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The missions need help,'' said Rick Ameil, president of the
California Missions Foundation, a private group that is raising
money for restoration and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list is long and the price tag is high.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has a list of repairs, seismic work, projects and
other items that totals $50.7 million, ranging from $5.1 million at
La Purisima Conception near Lompoc to $500,000 for Mission San
Carlos Borromeo in Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the missions need seismic work. Some, like the famous
and beautiful Mission San Juan Capistrano, are crumbling away under
the onslaught of time. San Juan needs $5 million in repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, Mission San Jose, founded 203 years ago in what
is now Fremont, has a portion of the original adobe that Ameil says
``is in such bad shape that the city of Fremont has ordered it
either closed or demolished.''
</P>
<P>
   The building is the oldest in Alameda County. The cost of
repairs and other work is $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mission San Francisco de Asis, usually called Mission Dolores,
has had a problem with beetles that have eaten the wooden statues
and part of the building's paneling. The foundation gave Mission
Dolores $25,000 last week as a 224th birthday present, but the
total cost for an overhaul is $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst, Ameil says, is Mission San Miguel, one of the
best preserved of all the missions and centerpiece of the small
town of San Miguel on Highway 101 just south of Paso Robles. ``San
Miguel is in very bad shape,'' said Ameil. ``One earthquake would
probably take that place down.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 21 missions are funded by a government agency,
Ameil says. All of them are short of money. ``There is no one
entity looking after the long-term restoration and preservation
needs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The missions have had a curious history, both hated and loved.
The first U.S. citizens to visit California thought the life of the
Spanish and Mexicans romantic and indolent. ``In the hands of an
enterprising people,'' wrote one of them, ``what a place this would
be.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Gold Rush transformed California after 1849, the native
Hispanics, who called themselves Californios, were pushed aside.
The Indians were simply exterminated by the Americans _ the Indian
population fell as low as 30,000 in 1860, according to some
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Annals of San Francisco'' the American historian Frank
Soule wrote of the old California, ``Even in the least frequented
corners of the earth is there a nation so stupid, of such
contracted ideas, as weak in both body and mind as the unhappy
Californians, ... better, a thousand times better that the missions
... should be ruthlessly swept away.''
</P>
<P>
   The missions did in fact crumble away, until the 1880s, when
Helen Hunt Jackson in her novel ``Ramona,'' and Charles Fletcher
Lummis, sought to romanticize the old missions. Jackson wrote of
the happy Indians toiling to the sound of the mission bells, and
Lummis called the missions remnants of ``the sleepy Spanish past,
... of the old days of romance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lummis, one of the grand promoters of California, founded a
magazine called ``Land of Sunshine'' and became so enamored of the
Spanish days that he began dressing as a Californio and calling
himself ``Don Carlos.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lummis attracted the attention of Phoebe Apperson Hearst,
who persuaded her son, publisher William Randolph Hearst, to take
up the cause of the missions.
</P>
<P>
   The old buildings, many of them in ruins, were acquired, rebuilt
and remodeled in a sort of new golden age of the missions.
</P>
<P>
   By 1913, Hearst and Rep. Joseph R. Knowland, owner of the
Oakland Tribune, bought Mission San Francisco Solano in Sonoma from
a private owner for $13,000. It is now a state park.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the missions became icons of an older
California, and were visited by schoolchildren and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, however, native activists presented a revisionist
history of the missions, and accused the Spaniards and mission
founder Junipero Serra of racism and genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is probably somewhere in between, but the past is
closely mingled with the present.
</P>
<P>
   California Missions Foundation president, Ameil, is a descendant
of Felipe Santiago Garcia, who came to Mission San Diego in 1774.
Garcia served in five missions and had 21 children. One of them,
Ameil says, was the first European child born in what was then Alta
California.
</P>
<P>
   Ameil recruited Galvan to serve on his board.
</P>
<P>
   Galvan says he wants to be sure ``the Indian story is not
forgotten in the mission story.''
</P>
<P>
   He was at Mission Dolores in San Francisco for its 224th
birthday celebration recently and led a prayer to the four
directions of the world in the churchyard. ``There are 5,000 Ohlone
burials in that yard,'' he said, ``And it was important that
someone like me should lead a prayer for them.''

 UC BERKELEY OFFERING $500 REBATE FOR EARLY GRADUATION  &HT;     By Tanya Schevitz 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY _ Attempting to accommodate the first wave in what is
expected to be a deluge of new students, the University of
California at Berkeley is offering its seniors a $500 rebate if
they attend summer school and graduate in August instead of
sticking around another semester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat here at my desk and I thought to myself, `Now what would
get my attention if I were a senior?' '' said Gary Penders,
director of summer sessions, ``It seems to be working.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 316 students have applied for the graduation payoff, and
there is still time for others to sign up for the program, which
runs through August 11.
</P>
<P>
   Their graduation will help make room for the 400 extra students
UC expects in the fall as children of Baby Boomers _ now moving
through junior high and high schools _ spill into universities and
cause enrollment to begin a steady climb.
</P>
<P>
   The early graduation proposal is the first of its kind in the
10-campus UC system and could become a model program. UC is already
throwing around a proposal to offer students who graduate in four
years a rebate on their last regular-term fee _ about $2,000,
Penders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one way to expand. The university is trying to
accommodate more students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With California struggling to find a way to deal with a tidal
wave of students projected to crash into the state's colleges and
universities in the next 10 years, UC needs to more than triple its
summer enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   The system is expected to make room for 63,000 additional
students _ including 4,000 at UC Berkeley _ by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Fox, executive director of the California Postsecondary
Education Commission, hailed the campus' creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one answer to the tidal wave of students, so we
need a variety of responses,'' Fox said. ``Anything that shortens
the time to degree is good, and if it is the rebate that motivates
the students, I think it is a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The summer sessions at UC are currently self-supporting, funded
by the student fees, making classes more expensive than the regular
semester.
</P>
<P>
   One course can cost between $800 and $900, while a full load in
the regular semester is about $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gov. Gray Davis has included $34 million in next year's
state budget to lower summer school fees and help the UC and
California State University campuses run year-round. Still,
students need an incentive to give up their summer jobs and travel.
</P>
<P>
   The lure of money worked for UC Berkeley senior Teresa
Rodriguez, who will finish up a double major in English and
physical anthropology this summer. Until she heard about the
program, she did not even know students could graduate in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wasn't sure that I was going to go. I made an
almost instantaneous decision after I found out about it,'' she
said of the rebate. ``It is a lot of money that you don't expect
for something that is a benefit anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   She will use her ``reward'' to visit a few graduate schools she
is considering for a doctorate program and will spend the fall
studying for the admissions exam instead of sitting in classes.
</P>
<P>
   She said the $500 was not the only advantage to summer classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot more relaxed, and there is a lot more interaction
in class,'' she said. ``Instructors tend to explore different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer, about 9,400 UC Berkeley students, about 40 percent
of the undergraduates _ are in campus classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Another incentive for students to attend the summer sessions is
a change in the eligibility requirements for the Low Income Grant
Program. While last summer only students who received less than
$1,000 a year in family support for their education were eligible,
this year the threshold has been raised to $3,000, increasing the
pool of eligible students.
</P>
<P>
   The rebate program came out of the Expanded Enrollment Steering
Committee, a group of UC Berkeley administrators and faculty
members who have been studying ways of accommodating more students
on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought if we could convince them to do this, we could both
attract more students to the summer sessions and ultimately we
could admit more students in the fall.''

   ATLANTA _ Honus Wagner, Ernie Banks and Cal Ripken played in
three different eras. They were the best at their position in those
eras. Imagine if Wagner, Banks and Ripken played in the same era.
That mental exercise shouldn't be too difficult. Just look at the
present era and think Alex Rodriguez, Nomar Garciaparra and Derek
Jeter. They are a conglomerate of shortstops the baseball world has
never seen at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, Garciaparra and Jeter were all in Atlanta Tuesday
night on the same team, the American League All-Star team.
Rodriguez was elected to start but recently suffered a concussion
and couldn't play. Jeter started in his place and capitalized on
the opportunity, rapping a double and two singles, scoring the
A.L.'s first run for a 1-0 lead and driving in the next two against
Al Leiter for a 3-1 lead, all in the space of his limited night's
work of four innings at the start of the 6-3 victory. He was named
the game's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take it for granted,'' the Yankees' shortstop said
of his All-Star performance. ``You never know if you're going to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Mike Bordick talk, the All-Star game will be a perennial
part of Jeter's schedule. Bordick was here, too. Baltimore's
shortstop, he was named to eplace Rodriguez on the A.L. roster. The
collective shadow of Rodriguez, Garciaparra and Jeter looms so
large that Bordick wouldn't ordinarily even be noticed. He
understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be able to take ground balls out there with those guys
is a great thrill,'' Bordick said. ``As a player and a fan, I'd
want to see Alex on the field as well. It's unfortunate. I feel
good that I was next in line and got this opportunity, but I'm
upset that Alex got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordick laughed. ``People,'' he continued, ``have been asking me
were you upset you weren't on the All-Star team? With Alex and
Nomar and Derek, no, I wasn't upset at all. These are the guys who
have been the superstars at that position ever since they've been
in the league and they continue to be consistent that way and doing
their superstar thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Bordick has no ego problem and certainly no illusions
about his place vis-a-vis the terrifically talented threesome, it
seemed to his listeners like a good idea to ask Bordick to offer
his view and assessment of his contemporaries. However laudatory he
was about all three, he kept coming back to Jeter, who has never
been elected an All-Star starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex is certainly doing things, setting a precedent like Cal
did,'' said Bordick, who plays alongside Ripken, now a third
baseman. ``Cal was the best-hitting shortstop in the game, a
power-hitting shortstop. It seems like Alex is carrying it to
another level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek Jeter isn't going to have enough fingers for all the
rings he's going to be wearing. With him as the Yankee shortstop
and an incredible leader, not only does he do things consistently,
putting up good numbers offensively, but defensively he's the one
that keeps getting better out there. And Nomar Garciaparra, Ted
Williams said he could be the best hitter of all time. These three
guys are incredible. The thing about them is they do it every day
and every year, year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordick was asked what he sees when he watches them play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, all three guys are different,'' he said. ``Alex
is deceptive for as much ground as he covers for as big as he is.
Sometimes it doesn't look like he's even moving, but he's covering
so much ground he gets to these balls deep in the hole or up the
middle and has an incredibly strong arm. Nomar throws from
different angles and his body's all over the place, but he has that
incredible gracefulness. Derek is just as well rounded as all of
them. It seems like he can do it all out there, as far as the
range, the arm, jumping and throwing. All three of them are just
incredibly fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   If he could, Bordick added, he would meld them all together and
``make an incredible cyborg out of them.'' But he can't create that
supersupersuper shortstop. So which of the three does he think is
No. 1? He did not respond immediately. He thought for a few
seconds, then a few seconds more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I don't know.'' But in the end, it
was the rings that made his decision for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derek Jeter, to me, offensively is certainly consistent,''
Bordick said, then abandoned his effort to define his No. 1 by
dissecting the elements of each one's game. ``He's got the rings
and that certainly puts him apart from the others.''
</P>
<P>
   The rings are the three World Series rings Jeter has earned in
his four years with the Yankees. The Yankees, in his young career,
have gone to the World Series so often Jeter thinks that's a
routine part of their schedule. But, Bordick was reminded, Jeter
hasn't won those rings by himself, by his play at short or at bat.
He has had help from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly,'' Bordick responded, ``but he's part of the
backbone, in the middle of that field. He's showing his leadership
skills and really taking hold of that team. I think the players
rally behind him and Bernie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, when I watch Derek Jeter, I see him getting better
and better. I'm not saying the other guys aren't getting better and
better. It's just the rings that really put me on Derek Jeter's
side. Pretty impressive.''

 CUTTING BACK _ ON PURPOSE _ ON AIDS DRUGS THE LATEST TREND  &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ As protesters at the 13th International
AIDS Conference clamor to gain access for impoverished Africans to
expensive new anti-viral drugs, researchers here are studying a
range of new strategies to let patients already on the medicine
take less.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after American AIDS patients began taking
combinations of three powerful anti-viral drugs that quell the
relentless replication of HIV, patients weary of unpleasant or
debilitating side effects are desperately seeking ways to take a
break from the rigorous pill-taking that restored their health.
</P>
<P>
   Top AIDS researchers Tuesday presented early findings from
carefully designed trials of ``structured treatment
interruptions.'' Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National
Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said the results are
somewhat encouraging. But with so many unknowns, he warned patients
contemplating a break in therapy: Don't try this at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would urge you not to try this until the clinical trials are
complete,'' he said during a plenary session Tuesday. The two
biggest unknowns clouding treatment interruptions are whether the
strategy will keep working over time and whether the virus will
take advantage of breaks in therapy to mutate into drug-resistant
forms.
</P>
<P>
   Among the treatment interruptions being tested is a regimen in
which patients take anti-viral drugs for a week, then take nothing
for another week, in continuous on-and-off cycles. A second test
puts patients on the drugs for two months, followed by one month
off.
</P>
<P>
   The encouraging news is that ``the virus is going nowhere,''
said Fauci, although he stressed that the studies involve very
small groups of patients.
</P>
<P>
   After seven cycles in the one-week-on, one-week-off trial, after
seven such cycles  &LR; there was no evidence of significant increase in
the amount of virus in the body, Fauci said. In the two-months on,
one-month off trial, there was clear evidence that the tenacious
bug begins replicating, but restoration of the treatments knocks
the virus down to undetectable levels again. ``Thus far, we don't
seem to be getting resistance,'' Fauci said.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco Bay Area, activists are not waiting for the
National Institutes of Health to finish their work. Individuals,
 &LR; After consulting with their doctors, individuals are taking
themselves off anti-retroviral therapy in similarly structured
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are doing this not because they want to stop taking the
drugs, but because drug toxicities are reaching a point where they
can't continue to take the drugs,'' said Jeff Getty, president of
the board of Survive AIDS. The San Francisco advocacy group has
begun gathering anecdotal reports from patients throughout the
country who have taken themselves off the drugs for brief cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Getty said the activists are not seeking drug company support
for their experiment because they believe the firms have an
inherent interest in seeing it fail. If patients found it was safe
to switch to taking AIDS drugs only every other week, ``we would
cut the cost of these expensive drugs in half overnight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, the effort by American activists to cut AIDS
drug consumption is not at all at odds with the goals of activists
who want expanded access to the medications. The primary barrier to
drug access in developing nations is price.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Wilson of San Francisco has taken himself off his
anti-viral drugs, closely monitoring the level of virus in his
bloodstream. When his ``viral load'' starts to climb, indicating
the virus is replicating again, he goes back on the drugs. He feels
better under the new regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor tells me I'm gambling,'' said Wilson. ``I know that
it is a crapshoot. I'm convinced there is a right and wrong way to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson directs the anecdote-gathering effort known as the Berlin
Patient Project. It is named after an anonymous German AIDS patient
who took himself off drug therapy because of health problems, then
returned to it, then stopped again _ only to find that he had
cleared the virus from his system. He has been off drugs for four
years, and although he has the virus in his system, his own immune
system seems to be keeping it in check.
</P>
<P>
   University of California at San Francisco virologist Dr. Jay
Levy said the biggest problem with drug-interruption therapy seems
to be that once the drugs are stopped, the body's own immune system
does not kick in to take their place. ``The question,'' said Levy,
``is how do you get the immune system to come back?''
</P>
<P>
   Levy said treatment interruption is a logical therapy to study,
but it is fraught with danger. ``There is no way I would advocate
doing this until the clinical trials are over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Levy is especially wary of the one-week on, one-week off
regimen. It causes patients to have ``suboptimal'' doses of drug in
their system, conditions that are ripe for breeding drug-resistant
strains of the virus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of sessions throughout the day Tuesday, researchers
discussed different strategies for fine-tuning the three-drug
combination therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing viral resistance remains a serious problem, forcing
clinicians to switch drug regimens for their patients. A paper by
researcher Dr. Scott Holmberg of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention found that patients were most likely to have
long-term success with anti-viral drugs _ a year or more without
developing resistance _ on their first experience with the
triple-combination drug therapy. About half the patients in his
study reached that goal. The success rate fell to 30 percent for
patients on their second course of combination drugs, and it fell
 &LR; to only 15 percent after they were switched a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Most successful with the treatment were those who had never
taken any anti-retroviral drugs in the past, and who took the
combination with only one form of drug known as a protease
inhibitor. Those who took two protease inhibitors in their drug
combinations did not fare as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two other CDC studies found that drug resistance is cropping up
as a problem in developing countries where the drugs are being
tested in pilot programs. A study by Dr. Paul Weidle found
resistance to at least one anti-retroviral drug in 74 percent of
samples taken during a 20-month trial.

DRUG CZAR WANTS HOLLYWOOD'S HELP TO FIGHT SUBSTANCE ABUSE
</HEADLINE>
bc-LADN-STONED.A (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG and GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hollywood reacted with caution and opposition after
White House drug czar Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey told Congress on
Tuesday that he intends to extend his anti-drug media blitz to the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said Hollywood film makers, unlike TV networks, will
receive no government financial incentives in return for
incorporating anti-drug messages in their scripts.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy and overseer of a five-year, $1 billion media
program, did propose a potential boost for Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He said his office hoped to use taxpayer dollars for
``promotional activities and special events that capitalize on the
visibility'' of films that feature anti-drug messages.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey declined to elaborate on his promotional proposal,
saying it was still in the planning stages. But he stressed that
``not one cent'' would be used to directly finance Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said his office would use its resources to educate
producers, directors and studio chiefs ``about how images of
substance abuse in the movies impact audiences, especially young
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   His announcement drew sharp reactions in Hollywood, along with a
wait-and-see attitude on the part of some executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd for the government to try to do this kind of
stuff. How about giving rewards for every movie that doesn't have a
gunshot in it? We know what violence does to people,'' said
director-producer Jeff Greenwald, whose upcoming film ``Steal This
Movie!'' is a story about sex, drugs, and rock and roll, with the
late Abbie Hoffman serving as tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Directors Guild and its members are concerned about abuses
of drugs and alcohol in our society and welcome public discussion
about this issue,'' DGA President Jack Shea said. ``However, it is
a longstanding commitment of the DGA to protect the right of
individual filmmakers to allow their visions to be unclouded by any
government interference.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of studio executives said they would withhold comment
until the drug czar's plans become more specific and detailed.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey made his announcement as members of the House
Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources
grilled him for two hours about the effectiveness of the media
program and the legality of a controversial effort that offers TV
networks a financial incentive to air programs with anti-drug
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, launched in 1998, networks are required to
donate $1 worth of free air time for every $1 the government spends
to place its anti-drug advertising. That means the government
places ads for half cost. However, the networks can reduce that
requirement by receiving credits for airing programs with anti-drug
themes.
</P>
<P>
   The networks can then use time slots formerly reserved for
government public service spots and sell them to commercial
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, McCaffrey's program has approved $25 million worth
of credits to networks for 109 television episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan, including the American Civil Liberties
Union, say it amounts to government censorship. Dan Forbes, a
journalist for the online magazine Salon who broke the story in
January, reported that anti-drug officials and companies under
contract to the White House had suggested changes in TV scripts to
fit in with their effort.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey hotly denied the censorship charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one cent has been paid to anyone for content and there is
no secret government censorship plot,'' he said. ``It is
unquestionable that I'm trying to get an anti-drug message into
popular culture. But we don't want to be involved in the creative
process.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called Forbes' reports ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who also testified to the subcommittee, stood by his
reporting and called the goverment media campaign ``subtly
manipulating and chilling.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey did admit that his program had changed its ground
rules in January, mandating that TV programs be reviewed and
considered for credit only after they have aired. He also said
movies would be considered for promotional tie-ins only after they
are released.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, asked McCaffrey, ``Why change the
guidelines if there was nothing wrong with the old ones?''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., the subcommittee chairman, expressed
concern about trust. ``We cannot afford to have kids thinking that
every drug message portrayed on TV was planted by the government,''
Mica said.
</P>
<P>
   Current popular taste may be at war with McCaffrey's anti-drug
message. The No. 1 film in the country, ``Scary Movie,'' which made
more than $42 million in its opening weekend, makes light of drug
usage, particularly marijuana smoking.
</P>
<P>
   One of its primary characters, played by the movie's co-writer
Marlon Wayans, is seen throughout the film smoking pot. The
character's drug habit even manages to save his life when he coaxes
the movie's homicidal maniac to get stoned with him.
</P>
<P>
   Other summer movies have celebrated drugs as well. In ``Shanghai
Noon,'' Jackie Chan's character is comically shown getting stoned
smoking a peace pipe. In the upcoming teen comedy ``Loser,'' drugs
are featured in a subplot involving a group of college students who
give the so-called ``date rape'' chemical to girls.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Rhoden, a spokeswoman for the Writers Guild of America,
said the latest proposal is laced with uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unclear what credits would be applied to movies in
theatrical release or what kind of purchases could occur to give
credit to a company.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of influencing writers and their stories, that occurs
constantly from a plethora of organizations. We hear from everyone
from the Red Cross to environmental groups,'' she said. ``We're
concerned about the culture of drug use, but is there an
appropriate avenue for our government to get involved? That's the
real ethical question.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials reported on Feb. 3 to a Senate
subcommittee that most of the credits had been approved for
programs with inherent anti-drug themes, including ``Seventh
Heaven,'' a wholesome WB Network drama featuring a clergyman's
family, and Fox's ``America's Most Wanted,'' which solicits the
public's help in capturing fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   That revelation moved Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., to
declare the White House program a windfall for the networks and led
to the subcommittee's vote in February to end funding for the
credit scheme. Final funding for the White House anti-drug campaign
is still pending in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey on Tuesday declared his media program a success,
reporting that 95 percent of the target audience of youths age
12-17 was being exposed to an average of eight anti-drug messages
per week on TV and radio, in newspapers and magazines and over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Citing studies by the Partnership for a Drug Free America,
McCaffrey also said that teen drug use had declined since 1998, due
in part to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Mica and other panel members, citing recent reports from the
Centers for Disease Control, said that adolescent drug use was
actually on the rise, especially abuse of methamphetamines and
potent and ingestible Mexican heroin.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the conflicting data were based on different sets
of statistics. He also said his office is planning new ad campaigns
to target methamphetamines and heroin.

 SENATE DECIDES TO STAY OUT OF MUSIC DOWNLOADING CONTROVERSY  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate indicated Tuesday that it wants no part
of the hottest controversy in the music business, ensuring that the
youth-driven trend to download music from the Internet will
continue to reshape the industry, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Metallica rocker Lars Ulrich square off with
the Byrds folksinger Roger McGuinn over the evils and joys of
Internet music downloads, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, said, ``I think the courts can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the Senate will keep ``a close eye'' on the raging
copyright fight between the recording industry and Internet music
distributors, such as San Mateo-based Napster, but will take no
action now.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's ranking Democrat, Patrick Leahy of Vermont
agreed, adding that movie studios were once ``terrified'' of
videotapes, which later turned into a major revenue stream for
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, things get sorted out and new (technologies) offer
new opportunities for artists and more choices for consumers,''
Leahy said. ``Let's not strangle the baby in the cradle.''
</P>
<P>
   The copyright dispute has drawn intense lobbying in Washington
from the software industry, recording companies, Hollywood studios
and even book publishers as Internet distribution undermines
ownership of ``intellectual property'' across the spectrum of
copyrighted material.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders liken unauthorized free Internet distribution
of copyrighted work to theft, saying it robs artists of their
livelihoods, strangles artistic creation and, ultimately, will harm
consumers as the sources of creativity dry up.
</P>
<P>
   Internet distributors contend that established industries are
trying to stifle a hugely  &LR; popular technology that will bring
untold convenience and flexibility to consumers. They say they want
to preserve copyright protections but that recording studios have
been reluctant to work with Web sites the studios view as
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors say the recording industry has hit them with
huge lawsuits on the scale of those filed against tobacco
companies, and that the suits could put them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, some argued Tuesday that technologies such as
Napster and a more sophisticated program called ``Gnutella'' _ a
free software that allows users to download music from each other's
computers rather than a central server _ are inherently
uncontrollable. Hatch even quoted Intel Chairman Andy Grove's
prediction that ``the whole Internet could be rearchitected by
Napster-like technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, whose high-profile hearings on technology issues often
indicate where Washington is headed, did not disappoint Tuesday,
lining up the chief combatants of the music wars and packing
Capitol Hill's most cavernous hearing room.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica's Ulrich opened by accusing Napster of hijacking,
piracy and theft of artistic property.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Metallica's rise from rags to riches as ``the classic
American dream come true,'' Ulrich compared a musician's right to
own his music to a carpenter's right to own a table he crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich recounted how his band was working earlier this year on a
song for the movie ``Mission Impossible-2'' when members heard that
radio stations were already playing versions of the work in
progress. The band traced the ``leaks'' to Napster and filed a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My band authored the music which is Napster's lifeblood,''
Ulrich said. ``We should decide what happens to it, not Napster _ a
company with no rights in our recordings, which never invested a
penny in Metallica's music or had anything to do with its
creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Napster chief executive Hank Barry countered that the Web site's
20 million users have a right to ``share'' music under copyright
law. Barry argued that Internet distribution ``is helping, not
hurting'' the music industry by allowing people to sample music
before buying it, leading to more store sales. And he said Internet
distribution gives music lovers and artists unprecedented access to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   The Byrds co-ounder McGuinn agreed, charging that recording
studios actually undercut artists rather than protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recording more than 25 records and such 1960s megahits
as ``Mr. Tambourine Man'' and ``Turn, Turn, Turn,'' McGuinn said he
``never saw any royalties'' from most of his work other than meager
advances. ``The recording companies have ways of not paying,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, McGuinn said he began recording traditional folk songs
to preserve the genre and was led eventually to Internet
distributor MP3.com, which paid him ``an unheard of'' 50 percent
non-exclusive royalty and helped fuel a resurgence in folk music
that he said the big recording companies had abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   But such arguments had little sway with California Democrat
Dianne Feinstein, who took a much harder line than her colleagues
on copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my way of thinking, Napster has found a method which
entirely defeats copyright protection,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Barry sharply countered, ``Sales are up, Senator,'' but
Feinstein was undeterred. ``You could do the same thing with a
book,'' she said. ``You could do the same thing with a movie. You
are essentially defeating any intellectual property copyright with
your technology, all driven under the cloak of anonymity at the
other end of a server.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry replied that such charges have been levelled against every
technological advance, ``from the piano roll to radio to cassettes
to VCRs. These horrible prophecies have not come true. In every
case it's been a financial boon'' to copyright holders and content
producers.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, drew a sharp distinction between Napster and Gnutella,
which pay no royalties, and such companies as MP3.com and
Emusic.com of Redwood City, which do.
</P>
<P>
   But Gene Kan, a University of California at Berkeley graduate in
electrical engineering who helped develop Gnutella, said the
``toothpaste is already out of the tube'' and that Napster's 20
million users of today ``will be 100 million tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to ``lock up'' copyrighted material will be defeated
eventually, Kan predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Hoffman, founder and CEO of Emusic.com of Redwood City,
agreed that the convenience, flexibility and infinite availability
of music on the Internet will upend the music industry's reliance
on physical distribution.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffman said that while Emusic offers lower costs _ 99 cents
for a single track and $8.99 for an album _ it still pays artists
and cannot compete with free music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason my stock declined 70 percent is because Napster
will invalidate the concept of paying for music,'' Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hatch said Congress will take no action now, he warned
that Washington will ``be watching very closely'' to see that
``fair and reasonable licensing'' takes place between recording
studios and Internet distributors to make sure that artists are

 &HT;    Jays' Wells compiling hefty All-Star resume
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Facing Sammy Sosa with two out in the first inning and
Jason Kendall with two out in the second, David Wells resorted to
curveballs that floated to the plate seemingly in slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get ahead in the count,'' Wells said, ``you can throw
anything up there. If you show you've got command of your pitches,
they can't sit on a certain pitch. And I had a good curveball
working.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and Kendall each watched the pitch break over the plate for
a called third strike that quelled early National League scoring
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get these guys with their bats on their shoulders,''
Wells said, ``it's a nice feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a feeling Wells has had all season. His two scoreless
innings Tuesday for the American League epitomized his performance
to this point. He earned the start with a 15-2 record that includes
an eight-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   He was undaunted by the imposing lineup the National League
trotted out. In three All-Star appearances, Wells has not given up
a run in 4 1/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Though halfway there, Wells isn't talking about a 30-win season.
And despite a late-career surge _ the 37-year-old left-hander has
66 victories over the past 3 1/2 seasons _ Wells doesn't entertain
the notion of making the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``All (the Hall of Fame) is going to get is my hat and that
jersey (from his perfect game two years ago),'' he said. ...That's
good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The two innings of work were enough for Wells, but he did have
one regret _ he didn't get to bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice,'' he said. ``Get up there and swing
for the fences. Knowing me, that's probably what I would have done.
Just go out there, hit any pitch _ anything straight, I had a
chance. You have a wrinkle in it, no way.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) it's fun up there, getting a bat in your hands. As a
pitcher, you never know _ you can probably win a game that way.''
</P>
<P>
   AL and New York Yankees manager Joe Torre had a different
approach: ``Joe said: `Just take three (strikes),''' Wells
recalled. ``I said, `OK, right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wells was more excited about his Toronto Blue Jays' playoff
prospects. They are in a virtual tie with the Yankees for first in
the AL East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are right there; we're right there,'' he said. ``I
think the best pitching wins. With the young staff that we have,
they don't know what they have yet. I see it. It's a matter of
these guys putting it together, because they have tremendous arms.
Once they find command of their pitches, oh, boy, this could be a
good year for Toronto.

 &HT;    American League too much for National League
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For three isolated reasons, the American League won
the 71st All-Star game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The AL was better on the mound, more consistent at the plate and
better in the field.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Derek Jeter went 3-for-3 with two RBIs and one run as
the night's MVP, leading the AL to 6-3 victory, its fourth straight
and 10th of the last 13 Midsummer Classics. The NL was outhit 10-9
(three extra-base hits to one) and gave up a critical unearned run
in the fourth on a botched double-play ball to Barry Larkin. The AL
never trailed. The NL has been outscored in this game, 29-13, since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The game was attended by 51,323 fans, 1,261 more than Turner
Field's listed capacity. They saw Jeter become the first Yankees
player to ever win the All-Star MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in a game like this, you have to be in the right place
at the right time,'' Jeter said. ``I was very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching that ever since he came to the big
leagues,'' said NL manager Bobby Cox, whose All-Star record dropped
to 1-4. ``Somebody in the clubhouse asked me if he was getting
better. I think he was this good when he first came up. That's why
he's here. He's an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't blame this one on the Braves. Chipper Jones drove in
the National's first run with a third-inning homer. Andruw Jones
drove in the second with a fifth-inning single. Tom Glavine worked
a 1-2-3 fifth. Andres Galarraga, in one of the night's sweetest
moments, was welcomed to the plate with a standing ovation and
later singled.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be nearly enough. The NL was held hitless from the
fifth through the eighth, although Steve Finley drove in one run in
the ninth. But by then, the Americans had removed all drama with a
three-run ninth, with San Diego's Trevor Hoffman slapped around for
three consecutive singles.
</P>
<P>
   The National had closed to 3-2 in the fifth, and Atlanta fueled
it. Following Gary Sheffield's lead-off walk, Chipper Jones
produced his third hit of the night and Andruw Jones, in his first
All-Star at-bat, singled up the middle to score Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine was summoned to work the top of the fifth, and the
Braves left-hander became the first pitcher all nigt to retire the
side in order. Jones' homer was the only of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' he said. ``I mean, it's every little boy's
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Al Leiter's. With New York Mets left-hander on to work
the fourth for the Nationals, Larkin's glove helped make a mess of
what had been a 1-1 game. After a walk to Jermaine Dye and a single
by Travis Fryman, pinch-hitter Mike Sweeney of Kansas City rolled
one to shortstop that took a quick hop as Larkin dropped his glove,
skipping off the heel.
</P>
<P>
   The error loaded the bases for Jeter, who produced his third hit
in three at-bats, driving in two runs with a single up the middle
for a 3-1 lead. Jeter knew what pitch Leiter would throw, did not
particularly want to offer at it and was hardly impressed with the
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cutter. I mean, he does it every time I face him,'' Jeter
said. ``I try to lay off it. I didn't hit it well. I just hit it in
the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones had tied the game 1-1 in the third and made a
little history, too. He sent a 2-0 pitch from James Baldwin over
the center field wall, becoming the 13th player to every hit a home
run in his home park. He joins Hank Aaron on that list, who hit one
in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The night's foremost ovation belonged to Galarraga, who had the
packed house standing by the time he got to the plate in the second
for his first at-bat. Making his first All-Star start only nine
months after completing cancer treatments, Galarraga doffed his
helmet before drilled David Wells' first pitch on a line to left
field. Everett was able to glove it with just four steps.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga later singled in the fourth before coming out for
pinch-runner Todd Helton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be something better than today,'' Galarraga said,
``to be with this team, to play this game today.''

 &HT;    Galarraga braces for the best at the All-Star game
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - No more regrets over what this All-Star Game wasn't.
That kind of thinking can be so wasteful anyway, as almost any
cancer patient will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints over all the players who no-showed Tuesday night
were to be washed away in a torrent of appreciation for one player
you couldn't have kept away with a sore knee or a restraining
order.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Galarraga was braced for the best. ``The exhibition game
in Venezuela, when there were so many cheers, my eyes got wet and I
tipped my hat five or six times. My first time back in Atlanta, my
eyes got wet then, too. And it probably will happen again in this
game,'' the Braves' healed first baseman said in anticipation of
Tuesday's emotional welcome.
</P>
<P>
   It began from the moment he walked out during the pregame parade
of players and their children. As he crossed the outfield with one
daughter in his arms, holding another by the hand and one more
trailing, the crowd sought him out and threw the first huzzahs his
way.
</P>
<P>
   No All-Star received a louder, longer Turner Field ovation
during the introductions than he _ who could hope to? How good was
it? It might have been even more sustained than what greets John
Rocker on his dash out of the home bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   So much talk of failed body parts, of heads and knees and backs
that cost this evening. What this All-Star Game didn't lack was a
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The National League starting roster well represented the power
the perseverance. Last year at this time, Galarraga was wrapping up
another round of chemotherapy on the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in his
back. He had swollen to 40 pounds over his playing weight and lost
his hair while retaining his hope.
</P>
<P>
   Also throw into the syrupy mix of the All-Star elixir _ good for
what ails you _ the catcher's tale. Jason Kendall's year ago was
spent, ``on the couch, heavily medicated with my foot up.'' In
other words, the Pittsburgh catcher was pretty much your typical
home viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Last July 4, trying to beat out a bunt, misstepping at the bag,
Kendall suffered a ghastly, Ruffian-style dislocation of the right
ankle. The replays of him grasping his leg, with his foot dangling
as if unconnected to him, are still haunting. ``If the bone wasn't
sticking out of the skin, not as much would have been made of it,''
he now says, matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   For those players who missed the show, too bad. For Kendall,
``This time of year always felt like a holiday to me _ like
Halloween (granted, not an official holiday) or Easter. To be
playing in this game again is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   These little stories within the grander game have helped elevate
it once more. Hey, everybody loves a good resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   To another, wider audience, Galarraga spun his tale of faith, of
being cleansed by a divine dream that made him know all would be
well. Making it back to the All-Star Game was but one more element
in some heavenly plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great story that puts a smile on your face,'' said
Yankees and American League manager Joe Torre.
</P>
<P>
   And we're going to gripe about Mark McGwire's aches?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we complain about too many little things. Sometimes
we go 0-for-4 and we're not driving somebody in, we get so angry
about that. Now when I go 0-for-4, I'm not happy, but I don't feel
angry or like hitting someone. That situation made me feel much
better, more patient, more relaxed,'' Galarraga said.
</P>
<P>
   Applying that to the moment, an All-Star Game found its place
and gained some peace Tuesday.

STUDY QUESTIONS ECONOMICS OF MAKING R-RATED MOVIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Never mind their quality, an economic study
released Tuesday concludes that R-rated movies are just bad
business for Hollywood studios.
</P>
<P>
   In a study that questions the industry's basic business model,
economics professor Arthur De Vany's equations and economic
modeling show that the combination of a big budget, top stars and a
R rating may be the worst investment a Hollywood studio can make.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the study concludes that not only are R-rated films
less than half as likely as PG releases to gross $25 million
domestically, but that G, PG and PG-13 movies all generate better
revenues and profits than R-rated films while keeping costs down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, according to De Vany's study, more than half of the films
released in the last decade were rated R, less than 3 percent were
rated G and the remainder were split about evenly between PG and
PG-13 movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A studio executive seeking to trim the downside risk and
increase the upside possibilities could do so by shifting
production dollars out of R-rated movies into G, PG, and even PG-13
movies,'' wrote De Vany, an economics professor at the University
of California, Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know something about film revenues, like box-office
tracking guru Paul Dergarabedian, said the study has merit because
the numbers for R-rated movies don't add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do look over the past five years, let's say, at the top
30 (grossing) films, there's just a handful of R-rated films,''
said Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co.
``Certainly, there is some validity to that study.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the study was released after ``Scary Movie,'' which
is rated R, earned $42.5 million in its opening weekend, the
biggest opening ever for a R-rated film. It cost only $19 million
to make, ensuring that it will be one of the exceptions that proves
De Vany's rule.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, De Vany cited actor Jim Carrey's career as
proof that R-rated movies have a harder time making a profit. While
Carrey has enjoyed considerable box-office success with his PG-13
rated comedies such as ``The Truman Show'' and ``Ace Ventura,'' his
new R-rated offering, ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' is having a
disappointing summer.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Fox, which released the film, said the studio
``would have no comment'' on De Vany's study.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based entertainment industry analyst Art Rockwell said
that while it's clear that an R rating reduces a potential
audience, ``there's an awful lot of successful R-rated films.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dergarabedian noted that some of Hollywood's classic titles
_ like ``The Godfather,'' and the ``Exorcist'' _ and recent hits
like the Oscar- winning ``American Beauty'' were all rated R.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the AMC Promenade 16 Theaters in the suburban San
Fernando Valley, 15-year-old Kevin Sharar said teens prefer such
movies because they typically push the limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``R-rated movies are more interesting but sometimes it's hard
for younger kids to get in,'' said Sharar, who had just seen ``The
Perfect Storm,'' which earned a PG-13 rating for foul language and
scenes of peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to watch 'Scary Movie' the second it came out. When I
found out it was rated R, I went with my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   De Vany undertook the study to test a theory advanced by
syndicated film reviewer Michael Medved, who criticizes R-rated
films not only because they have foul language, sexual content and
graphic violence, but because Hollywood is losing money by making
so many of them.
</P>
<P>
   Using a complex economic model honed by earlier studies De Vany
authored on more traditional industries, he concluded that R-rated
movies are just a bad business decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the studios are running around trying to apply
formulas that are based on wrong kinds of statistical thinking to a
business that's very different from that,'' De Vany said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Gregg couldn't agree more. The 76-year-old grandmother said
there are too few G- and PG-rated films that she can enjoy with her
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to take my grandchildren to see movies but there's not
anything that they can see,'' said Gregg who had just seen PG-rated
``Disney's The Kid'' starring Bruce Willis. ``I don't really like
(most) movies, I'd rather see something without the bad language.''
</P>
<P>
   De Vany, who wrote the 47-page study as a research fellow with
Texas A&AMP;M's Private Enterprise Research Center, is a member of the
Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences at UC Irvine. He
produced the report with his research partner, associate professor
W. David Walls of the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood isn't the only industry that De Vany studies. He's
also written economic studies about the steel, energy and shipping
industries.

RUSSIAN PROTON ROCKET FINALLY LOFTS SPACE STATION MODULE INTO

   The Russian-made crew module for the U.S.-led international

leaving behind a two-year legacy of delay and doubt about the
country's allegiance to the project.

is intended to serve as the living quarters for future residents of
the slowly developing space station soared from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 11:56 p.m. CDT Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The module represents the first major Russian contribution to
the $100 billion, 16-nation space station assembly effort. A poor
economy that provided only a trickle of government funding for the
module delayed the liftoff by 27 months, raising doubts about
Russia's willingness to participate in the massive project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a huge amount of work go into this program,'' said
NASA's Mark Geyer, the station program's planning manager.
</P>
<P>
   As the orbital outpost's third major component, the crew module
would follow the launching of the first modules that were joined in
Earth orbit by a U.S. and Russian space shuttle crew in December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Once linked to the previously launched modules, the Russian crew
habitat will furnish the growing orbital outpost with living
quarters and life support systems for three astronauts and
cosmonauts. Commanded by American Bill Shepherd, the first resident
crew is tentatively scheduled to lift off for a stay of three to
four months in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Also known as Zvezda, for ``star,'' and its Russian technical
designation, service module, the multifaceted habitat would also
add critical new control and propulsion capabilities. When
augmented by a U.S. crew habitat in a half-dozen years, Zvezda
would continue to function as the cornerstone of the international
station's large Russian segment.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, the unpiloted crew module will circle
the Earth until late July 25, when propulsion and navigation
systems on the two previously launched modules carry out a
challenging automated rendezvous and docking about 240 miles above
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The interim period will allow ground control teams in Russia to
adjust the altitude of the new module, test its control, navigation
and power systems to improve the odds of a successful linkup, said
Valery Ryumin, space station program manager for RSC Energia, the
Russian aerospace company that will supervise the linkup.
</P>
<P>
   The station's first segments have enough fuel for at least two
automated docking attempts.
</P>
<P>
   If neither is successful, Russian cosmonauts Genadi Padalka and
Nikolai Budarin will be standing by in Russia, prepared to launch
to the crew module aboard a Soyuz rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Once aboard the new crew habitat, they would orchestrate a
manual docking of the three modules.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be quite sure that if it is necessary, they will be
able to perform the task with a quite high probability of
success,'' said Yuri Malenchenko, a veteran cosmonaut and colleague
of Padalka's and Budarin's. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The joining of the three modules should trigger an
unprecedented flurry of space station construction activity.
Fifteen construction, supply and crew transport missions are
planned in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The flights will boost the station's electrical power
production, add and equip the bus-sized American science laboratory
as well as provide an airlock to ease the many spacewalks that will
be required to complete the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Full assembly will require at least another 40 U.S. and Russian
rocket launches with major components over the next five to six
year.
</P>
<P>
   The station's global participants envision that when fully
assembled, the new outpost will provide enclosed laboratories for a
range of physics, biology and medical experiments. They also plan
to use its high-altitude vantage point for environmental studies of
the Earth and tests of hardware for future human space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was invited to join the United States, Europe, Japan and
Canada as a station partner in 1993. Transforming the former Cold
War rivalry into a cooperative partnership has proven difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The original plans to launch the crew module in April 1998
slipped as the Russian government was unable to furnish the funding
in the midst of economic and political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the financial difficulties began to ease last year, the
35-year-old Russian Proton rocket experienced a pair of launching
failures in spite of its 98 percent record for success.
</P>
<P>
   The Proton losses were traced to poor workmanship of rocket
engine components in the economic and political turmoil that
accompanied the break up of the Soviet Union and the transfer of
its space program to the Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the launch of Zvezda, uncertainly looms over Russia's
ability to carry out its other pledges to the station.
</P>
<P>
   The most crucial are a steady supply of Progress cargo capsules
with fuel and supplies for the station as well as the three-man
Soyuz capsules that will be parked at the station to serve as
lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership hopes to offset the pressure. NASA's shuttle
will likely take on more of the cargo hauling duties. The Europeans
and Japanese intend to develop a Progress-style cargo spacecraft of
their own.

 &HT;    Some injured stars no-shows, but most attend
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn

<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few hours before Tuesday's All-Star Game, Barry
Bonds filmed pregame a ctivities at Turner Field, including batting
practice, with a camcorder. If it was not clear before then, it was
then: the San Francisco Giants outfielder would be one of many
All-Star spectators instead of participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing great,'' Bonds said. ``I wish it could be different,
but it's not. So, I'm here to enjoy a great event. It's great to
play in these games. But if you can't, it's good to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   A thumb injury forced Bonds to miss the Midsummer Classic. Bonds
sounded frustrated when continually asked about his availability,
saying the team ``told me I'm out. To be honest, I'm tired of
talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hard not to talk about the stars who watched. Chicago
Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa was one of only four NL starters
selected by the fans who was able to start. In addition to Bonds,
injuries shelved Mike Piazza, Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries happen; they are a part of the game,'' Sosa said.
``But it's good to see so many guys who could not play come to the
game anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey participated _ and lost to Sosa _ in the home run derby
Monday, but he was not on hand for Tuesday's game. McGwire was a
no-show, too.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez suffered a concussion
and injury to his left knee in a collision Friday with Los Angeles
Dodgers shortstop Alex Cora. Rodriguez did not like the idea of
being a spectator, but he did find something positive about the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic the concussion will make me a smarter person,''
he joked.
</P>
<P>
   An MRI indicated there was no serious damage sustained in the
collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed not to be able to play here, but I consider
it a blessing in disguise to have this happen now,'' Rodriguez
said. ``I would rather miss the All-Star Game and have a few days
to recover than face missing another four or five games of the
regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I came to support the American League. That's the
least I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Greg Maddux was in uniform, although getting hit in
the right shoulder by a batting practice line drive Saturday
prevented him from participating. The big absentee was Baltimore
Orioles third baseman Cal Ripken Jr., who has a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal is Cal,'' Giants second baseman Jeff Kent said. ``You
can't really replace him. I know there are a lot of the big names
who couldn't play because of injuries. Everyone wants to see the
big stars, I understand that. But there are a lot of great players
in this game, so the other way to look at it is that there were
chances for some lesser-known players to get some of the
limelight.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Derek Jeter, the New York Yankees shortstop who would be
named the game's MVP: ``If you can't play, you can't play. But it's
great that the guys who can't play came to be here anyway. There's
nothing like the All-Star Game, so I would come, too, if I couldn't
play.''

DRUG CZAR WANTS HOLLYWOOD'S HELP TO FIGHT SUBSTANCE ABUSE
</HEADLINE>
bc-LADN-DRUGS.A (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG and GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hollywood reacted with caution and opposition after
White House drug czar Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey told Congress on
Tuesday that he intends to extend his anti-drug media blitz to the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said Hollywood film makers, unlike TV networks, will
receive no government financial incentives in return for
incorporating anti-drug messages in their scripts.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National
Drug Control Policy and overseer of a five-year, $1 billion media
program, did propose a potential boost for Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He said his office hoped to use taxpayer dollars for
``promotional activities and special events that capitalize on the
visibility'' of films that feature anti-drug messages.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey declined to elaborate on his promotional proposal,
saying it was still in the planning stages. But he stressed that
``not one cent'' would be used to directly finance Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said his office would use its resources to educate
producers, directors and studio chiefs ``about how images of
substance abuse in the movies impact audiences, especially young
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   His announcement drew sharp reactions in Hollywood, along with a
wait-and-see attitude on the part of some executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd for the government to try to do this kind of
stuff. How about giving rewards for every movie that doesn't have a
gunshot in it? We know what violence does to people,'' said
director-producer Jeff Greenwald, whose upcoming film ``Steal This
Movie!'' is a story about sex, drugs, and rock and roll, with the
late Abbie Hoffman serving as tour guide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Directors Guild and its members are concerned about abuses
of drugs and alcohol in our society and welcome public discussion
about this issue,'' DGA President Jack Shea said. ``However, it is
a longstanding commitment of the DGA to protect the right of
individual filmmakers to allow their visions to be unclouded by any
government interference.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of studio executives said they would withhold comment
until the drug czar's plans become more specific and detailed.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey made his announcement as members of the House
Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources
grilled him for two hours about the effectiveness of the media
program and the legality of a controversial effort that offers TV
networks a financial incentive to air programs with anti-drug
themes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, launched in 1998, networks are required to
donate $1 worth of free air time for every $1 the government spends
to place its anti-drug advertising. That means the government
places ads for half cost. However, the networks can reduce that
requirement by receiving credits for airing programs with anti-drug
themes.
</P>
<P>
   The networks can then use time slots formerly reserved for
government public service spots and sell them to commercial
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, McCaffrey's program has approved $25 million worth
of credits to networks for 109 television episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the plan, including the American Civil Liberties
Union, say it amounts to government censorship. Dan Forbes, a
journalist for the online magazine Salon who broke the story in
January, reported that anti-drug officials and companies under
contract to the White House had suggested changes in TV scripts to
fit in with their effort.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey hotly denied the censorship charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one cent has been paid to anyone for content and there is
no secret government censorship plot,'' he said. ``It is
unquestionable that I'm trying to get an anti-drug message into
popular culture. But we don't want to be involved in the creative
process.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called Forbes' reports ``ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who also testified to the subcommittee, stood by his
reporting and called the goverment media campaign ``subtly
manipulating and chilling.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey did admit that his program had changed its ground
rules in January, mandating that TV programs be reviewed and
considered for credit only after they have aired. He also said
movies would be considered for promotional tie-ins only after they
are released.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patsy Mink, D-Hawaii, asked McCaffrey, ``Why change the
guidelines if there was nothing wrong with the old ones?''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., the subcommittee chairman, expressed
concern about trust. ``We cannot afford to have kids thinking that
every drug message portrayed on TV was planted by the government,''
Mica said.
</P>
<P>
   Current popular taste may be at war with McCaffrey's anti-drug
message. The No. 1 film in the country, ``Scary Movie,'' which made
more than $42 million in its opening weekend, makes light of drug
usage, particularly marijuana smoking.
</P>
<P>
   One of its primary characters, played by the movie's co-writer
Marlon Wayans, is seen throughout the film smoking pot. The
character's drug habit even manages to save his life when he coaxes
the movie's homicidal maniac to get stoned with him.
</P>
<P>
   Other summer movies have celebrated drugs as well. In ``Shanghai
Noon,'' Jackie Chan's character is comically shown getting stoned
smoking a peace pipe. In the upcoming teen comedy ``Loser,'' drugs
are featured in a subplot involving a group of college students who
give the so-called ``date rape'' chemical to girls.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Rhoden, a spokeswoman for the Writers Guild of America,
said the latest proposal is laced with uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unclear what credits would be applied to movies in
theatrical release or what kind of purchases could occur to give
credit to a company.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of influencing writers and their stories, that occurs
constantly from a plethora of organizations. We hear from everyone
from the Red Cross to environmental groups,'' she said. ``We're
concerned about the culture of drug use, but is there an
appropriate avenue for our government to get involved? That's the
real ethical question.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials reported on Feb. 3 to a Senate
subcommittee that most of the credits had been approved for
programs with inherent anti-drug themes, including ``Seventh
Heaven,'' a wholesome WB Network drama featuring a clergyman's
family, and Fox's ``America's Most Wanted,'' which solicits the
public's help in capturing fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   That revelation moved Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., to
declare the White House program a windfall for the networks and led
to the subcommittee's vote in February to end funding for the
credit scheme. Final funding for the White House anti-drug campaign
is still pending in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey on Tuesday declared his media program a success,
reporting that 95 percent of the target audience of youths age
12-17 was being exposed to an average of eight anti-drug messages
per week on TV and radio, in newspapers and magazines and over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Citing studies by the Partnership for a Drug Free America,
McCaffrey also said that teen drug use had declined since 1998, due
in part to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Mica and other panel members, citing recent reports from the
Centers for Disease Control, said that adolescent drug use was
actually on the rise, especially abuse of methamphetamines and
potent and ingestible Mexican heroin.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the conflicting data were based on different sets
of statistics. He also said his office is planning new ad campaigns
to target methamphetamines and heroin.

SUMMER LEAGUE STUNNED BY McRAE'S DEATH 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Players, coaches and scouts watched and played five Summer Pro
League basketball games Tuesday, but many minds were on Conrad
McRae, the 29-year-old former Syracuse star who collapsed on the
court at UC Irvine and died the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shook me up personally,'' said Eddie Elisa, who played with
McRae on New York city summer leagues. ``It was on my mind all day
yesterday and this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Elisa, a forward on the Seattle SuperSonics summer league team,
he also played against McRae overseas. In the Sonics 91-90 loss to
the Lakers Tuesday, he had eight points in 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of McRae's death is inconclusive, said Rod Thomas, a
supervising deputy with the Orange County Coroner's office. The
coroner's office will be conducting toxicology tests, which will
hold the results for at least a couple months.
</P>
<P>
   McRae had a history of health problems. While signed to a 10-day
contract with the Denver Nuggets, he collapsed during warmups
before a game against Golden State on April 12, 199.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to playing on the Magic summer league team, McRae had
signed a medical waiver and didn't indicate any previous health
problems, an NBA source said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions on McRae's health were referred to his agent, Mitch
Frankell. Phone calls to Frankell were not returned. The Magic
released a statement expressing condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shocked at the news of the tragedy,'' said John Gabriel,
Magic general manager. ``Our thoughts and prayers are with his
family.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae, known for his athletic ability and being in good shape,
was practicing with the Orlando Magic for the Summer Pro League at
UC Irvine on Monday when he collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic wrapped up the two-hour practice with a running drill
called 17s. It's a drill where players run from sideline to
sideline 17 times. Normally the drill is timed to hit under a
minute. In this case the drill wasn't timed players said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an experience I witnessed first hand,' said Matt
Harpring, a forward on the Magic who was at the practice. ``When
you think about it, you think it's surreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he fell the trainer went out and did CPR right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Harpring added, ``It was kind of weird. It was kind of out of
the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to McRae's death, the Magic pulled out of the Summer Pro
League. The team and players left Southern California Tuesday
morning. The SPL scheduled was reworked so there are still five
games a day.
</P>
<P>
   The practice at UC Irvine was the first for the Magic. McRae had
met the team in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Harpring said the trainer ran out right away and found no pulse.
There was a summer camp going on nearby and those trainers helped
out as well.
</P>
<P>
   The paramedics arrived on the scene shortly after, Harpring
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him laying there at the end,'' said Mike Miller, the
Magic first round draft pick and No. 5 overall selection. It was
Miller's first practice with the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Both Miller and Harpring said that McRae didn't appear to have
any problems leading up to the running drill.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has had a number of tragedies over the past year.
Minnesota Timberwolve guard Malik Sealy and Charlotte Hornet Bobby
Phills both died in traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   McRae played last season for Trieste in Italy. He averaged 10.9
points and 11 rebound a game. He played in 30 games and averaged
35.4 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very nice kid,'' said Dick McGuire, director of
scouting for the New York Knicks. The Knicks had McRae in for a
mini-camp. ``I don't know what you can think except to for feel
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae, 6-10, from Brooklyn, N.Y. played at Syracuse from
1989-1993, averaging nearly 13 points a game his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great guy,'' said Bill Curley, who played at Boston
College and faced McRae. ``He was a good kid. He always had a smile
on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen still out
</P>
<P>
   Laker first round draft pick Mark Madsen missed his third
straight game on Tuesday with a right wrist injury. Madsen first
hurt the wrist in a pre-draft workout when he was hit on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   He went through four workouts with the Lakers before the wrist
began to seriously bother him. The Lakers have been holding him out
and Madsen said he is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really anxious to get out there and play,'' Madsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey to D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Former UCLA guard Toby Bailey is off to join the Washington
Wizards summer league team at the end of this week. The Wizard are
playing summer league games in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He is preparing for his stint with the Wizards on the Nutriola
team at the Summer Pro League. He had 16 points on 6 of 11 shooting
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said he had taken a couple weeks off to recover from
tendonitis in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get my timing back before I go to
Washington,'' said Bailey, who played last season with the Phoenix
Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas in the house
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Mavericks made a summer league splash Tuesday
displaying four rookies in a blowout win over the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Equally impressive were forward Etan Thomas, the 12th overall
pick; Courtney Alexander, the 13th overall pick; Donnell Harvey,
the 22nd overall pick; and Eduardo Najera, the 38th overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   The game could have been a battle of rookies but none of the
Clippers four draft picks are playing in the Summer Pro League.

CART RACE IN MAY GIVES TMS A 2001 SWEEP OF U.S. CIRCUITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ CART's high-tech race cars will team up with
Texas Motor Speedway's high-banked racetrack beginning in 2001,
when the 1.5-mile quadoval in Fort Worth will play host to every
major American racing series.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of the open-wheel Championship Auto Racing Teams
FedEx Series to TMS' schedule on Sunday, May 6, 2001, was announced
Tuesday by Eddie Gossage, the track's executive vice president and
general manager, and Bobby Rahal, CART's interim president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the culmination of a dream that we've been wanting to
put together for some time. It's a great day,'' Gossage said during
a news conference at The Movie Studios at Las Colinas. ``Next
season, it'll be the single greatest racing season in the history
of motorsports that any speedway has ever been able to put
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural CART Texas 600k, the first race of a three-year
sanctioning agreement, has been booked as part of a three-day
weekend that currently is all open-wheel. The schedule will include
a race for the Dayton Indy Lights Championship, CART's top
developmental series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to be a great event,'' said Rahal, a
three-time series champion, current team owner and member of CART's
board of directors. ``These are the world's fastest cars, so what
that's going to be like on this place is going to be something to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of CART, TMS has firmed up five major
motorsports event weekends at the paved track, an increase of one
over 2000. Beginning in late March/early April, TMS will play host
to the NASCAR Winston Cup, Busch Grand National and Craftsman Truck
series; the open-wheel Indy Racing Northern Light Series, the
American Le Mans Series and BFGoodrich Tires Trans-Am Series. The
latter two series will compete on a 2.5-mile layout that combines
the oval and an infield road-course under construction.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new Texas Motor Speedway Dirt Track will play
host to the Pennzoil World of Outlaws Series for Sprint Cars, the
Hav-A-Tampa Late Models and the Wrenchhead.com National Dirt Track
Series for motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``No other speedway in the world can boast of a schedule that we
can at Texas Motor Speedway now,'' said Gossage, seated on a dais
along with Rahal and 1996 CART champion Jimmy Vasser.
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, of Target/Chip Ganassi Racing, said he was eager to make
his first visit and turn his first wheel through TMS' 24-degree
banked turns. TMS will become the highest-banked track in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we're ready to come here and put on a good show,''
said Vasser, anticipating a reduction in the 900-plus horsepower
currently cranked out by CART's turbocharged V-8s. ``CART's working
on that package right now, probably a horsepower reduction and some
aerodynamic drag issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``To come to Fort Worth and show our product, I think it's going
to be great, not only for CART and our racing teams, but for the
fans in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The CART race here will be televised by ABC. CART's addition is
a testimony to the series' desire to break into a Fort Worth-Dallas
market that historically has posted strong TV numbers even though
TMS has played host to Tony George's rival Indy Racing League since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our objectives at CART is to align ourselves with the
best markets and the best racetrack promoters in the business,''
said Rahal, who was selected by CART's directors to replace Andrew
Craig after the latter's forced resignation on June 16. ``For all
kinds of reasons, it made sense for us to come down and work with
Eddie to put this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said the talks that resulted in this agreement
accelerated on June 22, just prior to a CART board of directors
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote them a simple one-page, three-paragraph letter saying
we want to have a CART FedEx Championship Series race, and we think
we'll fill the place,'' Gossage said. ``He (Rahal) went before the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL has competed at TMS twice a year since 1998, and has
drawn the largest crowds outside of the Indianapolis 500 at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been rumors of this the last couple of years,'' said
Rahal, the 1986 Indy 500 champion. ``And it was just a matter of
understanding the promoter, how strong they are here; understanding
the market, how strong it is; understanding we're now working with
our cars to make them race-able anywhere the opportunity exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The event at TMS will give CART two in Texas. CART has competed
on a temporary street circuit through downtown Houston since 1998.
The Texaco/Havoline Grand Prix of Houston is scheduled for Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said the 2001 schedule, which is expected to grow from 20
to 22 races, was nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 90 percent there,'' Rahal said. ``I would suspect that
in a week to 10 days we'll have it done.''

CART INTENDS TO SLOW CARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The open-wheel cars of the Championship Auto
Racing Teams FedEx Series are the fastest in the world, boasts
interim CART president and CEO Bobby Rahal.
</P>
<P>
   And when CART runs its first race at Texas Motor Speedway next
May 6, it probably will record the fastest laps in the five-year
history of the 1.5-mile superspeedway with the 24-degree banked
turns. But even Rahal admits ``the fastest cars in the world'' need
to be slowed down before next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of all the type of circuits that we run on you are
going to see some type of power reduction,'' said Rahal, a
three-time series champion and team-owner who took the position
when Andrew Craig resigned under pressure last month. ``I think it
is important for us to have the fastest cars in the world and we
can still have the fastest races with 150 less horsepower. We don't
need over 900 horsepower at around 1,500 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal and Eddie Gossage, executive vice president and general
manager of TMS, announced Tuesday that the series will run the
inaugural Texas 600k on May 6, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under current CART rules, the open-wheel cars powered by
turbocharged eight-cylinder engines produce more than 900
horsepower. That would allow drivers to reach speeds of 230 mph at
TMS, even with the drag-inducing Handford Device mounted on the
rear wing.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest track the series currently races on is the two-mile
California Speedway, which is banked at 14 degrees. CART regular
Mauricio Gugelmin of PacWest Racing Group recorded a lap at 240.942
mph in Fontana, Calif., in 1997. It remains the fastest official
lap in auto-racing history. Gugelmin also ran a practice lap at
242.333 mph before qualifying, the fastest unofficial lap in
auto-racing history.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said CART officials are discussing methods to take away as
much as 150 horsepower from the V-8 engines for next season, and
modifying the rear wings. But to do so, Rahal has to convince four
competitive engine manufacturers _ Ford-Cosworth, American Honda,
Mercedes-Benz and Toyota _ that such a move is the right course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly it has not been tough at all and they have been
very good about it,'' Rahal said. ``They are extremely competitive,
but they understand the most important thing we have to create is
the right product. We think the technical aspect is important for
our brand, and understanding what they want to achieve and what we
want to achieve, they have been very positive about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal added he was not sure what speeds the cars would produce
at TMS. Even with a horsepower reduction, speeds still could reach
220 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Those speeds are fine with Jimmy Vasser, the 1996 series
champion. Vasser said the 24-degree banking at TMS could produce
some interesting racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``TMS promotes good side-by-side, wheel-to-wheel racing,'' said
Vasser, who drives for Target/Chip Ganassi Racing and is teammate
to reigning CART and Indianapolis 500 champion Juan Montoya.
``Certainly our cars are very, very fast, but any kind of racing
that close at those speeds is thrilling, not only for the fans but
for us in the seat.''
</P>
<P>
   CART limits the amount of testing by individual teams, but Rahal
said CART cars could test at TMS this fall. nn

ARMSTRONG AT IT AGAIN, INSPIRING US TO FLY HIGHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When he braved wind, rain and cold and ate up the side
of the 5,117-foot Montee d'Hautacam on Monday to claim a
four-plus-minute lead in the Tour de France that no one expects he
will yield, Lance Armstrong inspired a fellow competitor to draw a
perfect analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong came through like a plane at the end,'' said
Frenchman Richard Virenque about Armstrong's climb in the 10th
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Tour de France champion built last year's victory
on those same steep climbs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, maybe Armstrong knows something about himself that
other riders do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be afraid is a priceless education. Once you have been
scared, you know more about your frailty than most people, and I
think that changes a man,'' Armstrong wrote in his book, ``It's Not
About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life,'' written and published
this past year with sportswriter Sally Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   If other members of the Tour de France peloton see Armstrong as
a jet engine surging through the Pyrenees, maybe they also see how
his hope has turned into fulfilled prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, a surgeon closed the holes in his skull after an
operation that would kill the cancerous lesions on his brain.
Armstrong joked about the titanium screws left behind to hold the
bone together:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it'll make me climb better.''
</P>
<P>
   Titanium made this champion cyclist's bikes lighter and
stronger, so Armstrong figured this was a way to relate to what was
happening to him.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of terror, why not make a joke?
</P>
<P>
   Especially if it would indeed be the mountain climbs where
Armstrong would separate himself from all others in the most
grueling sporting event on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   This flash of levity is described in Armstrong's book, although
it is a book with little levity and much detail about Armstrong's
battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth going back to that dark place where Armstrong was.
</P>
<P>
   His story points him and anyone who reads it in a most powerful
direction _ the direction of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most of my life, I had operated under a simple schematic
of winning and losing, but cancer was teaching me a tolerance of
ambiguities,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked between the revelations and the psychology of fighting
cancer are the harrowing details. There is the painful swelling,
the five months in which Armstrong shrugged off symptoms. There is
the spitting up of blood and the fetal position into which
chemotherapy forced him to curl.
</P>
<P>
   Rampant, ruinous cells from Armstrong's testicular cancer swept
through the cyclist's oxygen-rich bloodstream, invading his
abdomen, lungs and brain.
</P>
<P>
   At 25, one of the world's most talented, brash athletes who
thrived on the pain of his work, Armstrong faced his mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time I was more fully diagnosed, I asked my doctors
harder questions. What are my chances? I wanted to know the
numbers. My percentage was shrinking daily. Dr. Reeves told me 50
percent, `but really I was thinking 20,' he would tell me later,''
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   His lessons were stunning and quick; his determination and fight
revelatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew now why people fear cancer: because it is a slow and
inevitable death, it is the very definition of cynicism and loss of
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, we have seen how athletic feats can inspire awe, can
turn us into entranced, transformed onlookers. The waves of
admiration and awe for Tiger Woods were understandable last month.
</P>
<P>
   That's because millions of people hack their way through a golf
course every year, coming to grips with that sport's difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' four-day, wire-to-wire mastery of the U.S. Open at Pebble
Beach seems beyond comprehension for anyone who has shanked a
5-iron off the trunk of a Douglas fir.
</P>
<P>
   Far fewer people take their place atop an 18-pound bicycle for a
2,200-mile tour of France.
</P>
<P>
   It takes years for a cyclist to mature, to build up the
endurance and strategic knowledge it takes to win. You not only
face the treachery of the 180-cyclist peloton, but also the cold
and rain, the blistering sun, the mountains and the gravel, the
fatigue and the wall of pain that shuts down upon you.
</P>
<P>
   The medical people spoke their piece last year, letting us know
in no uncertain terms what a cancer survivor like Armstrong had
accomplished by winning the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armstrong continues to let us soar with him in an almost
unimaginable way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't love the bike before I got sick. It was simple for
me: it was my job and I was successful at it. It was a means to an
end. But it was not something I did for pleasure or poetry. It was
my profession ... '' he said in his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I not only loved the bike, I needed it. Maybe I needed
to tell myself I was still a rider, not just a cancer patient, no
matter how weak I'd become. If nothing else, it was my way of
countering the disease and regaining the control it had stripped
from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Armstrong gets a rest before the Tour de France resumes
tomorrow in Carpentras. Most of us would go to the south of France
to eat, drink wine, enjoy the good life. Armstrong will be there to
``prove cancer survivors can win this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooting for him is easy, since he helps you remember what it
means to be alive, to surge, to soar, to fly like a plane.

Jeter's star shines brightest
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter has three World
Series rings and a Rookie of the Year award to show for his brief
major-league career, which spans less than five full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He has been on the cover of GQ, dated Mariah Carey and become
arguably the best player on the most storied team in baseball. And
if Jeter has a to-do list, he can scratch another item off it after
leading the American League to a 6-3 victory over the National
League on Tuesday night in the 71st annual All-Star Game at Turner
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who was 3-for-3 with a double and two singles, did
something Tuesday that no Yankee ever has done. Not Roger Maris.
Not Don Mattingly. Not even Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter became the first player in Yankees history to be named
Most Valuable Player in an All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to believe,'' said AL manager Joe Torre, who
manages the Yankees. ``We've had some great, great players through
the years, and it's hard to believe no one ever won it.''
</P>
<P>
   The MVP honor and everything Jeter has accomplished in his short
time in pinstripes has some lumping him with Yankees legends. Jeter
bristles at that suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to play a lot of years to be considered a Yankee
great,'' he said. ``Hopefully I can play for a few more years and
continue that debate. But this is just my fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very fortunate to have been at the right place at the
right time in a great organization. Down the road _ that's when you
sit back and reflect on your career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really sit around and think about that kind of stuff
right now. In due time, I'll realize how special it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter had struck out twice in his only two All-Star at-bats
prior to Tuesday's breakout, which included hits against Randy
Johnson, Kevin Brown and Al Leiter _ three of the nastiest pitchers
in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically had the same game plan against everyone,'' Jeter
said. ``I'm a free swinger. I think it's known around the league _
maybe both leagues. I wanted to at least put the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're facing three guys like that, you want to swing
early in the count. If you fall behind, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper Jones would have been the
likely MVP choice if the NL had won the game. The reigning NL MVP
was 3-for-3 with a home run before a hometown crowd of 51,323.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played in an NL park and in typical NL style, but
the AL All-Stars managed to win for the fourth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto Blue Jays 15-game winner David Wells started for the AL,
pitching two scoreless innings. AL starters have a string of eight
consecutive scoreless innings, dating to 1996 when Cleveland's
Charles Nagy allowed a pair of runs in the game, which was in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Wells allowed two hits and struck out Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa
and Pirates catcher Jason Kendall on slow-breaking curveballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get ahead in the count, you can throw anything up
there,'' Wells said. ``If you show you've got command of your
pitches, they can't sit on a certain pitch. I had a good curveball
working tonight; it's a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, White Sox righthander James Baldwin, who
pitched one inning and allowed a run on two hits, who was credited
with the victory.
</P>
<P>
   NL starter Johnson, who pitched for the Diamondbacks on Sunday,
worked just one inning before leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reds reliever Danny Graves also pitched a scoreless inning
before the AL broke through against Brown in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers righthander walked three batters, including Red Sox
outfielder Carl Everett with the bases loaded to force home the
first run of the game. The wild spell was rare for Brown, who is
averaging just 1.9 walks per nine innings this season with Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The NL tied the score in the bottom of the inning on Jones'
two-out solo homer off Baldwin. Jones became the 10th player to hit
a home run in an All-Star Game played in his home park, the first
since Cleveland's Sandy Alomar did it in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' Jones said. ``I mean it's every little boy's
dream. It's not often that a player gets to play on his home field
in an All-Star Game, much less start.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go out there and hit a home run was just awesome. I can't
explain it. It was something I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Mets lefty Leiter, who took the loss, allowed the first three
batters he faced to reach base in the fourth, and an error by Reds
shortstop Barry Larkin prolonged the inning, which was highlighted
by Jeter's two-run single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit it well; I just hit it in the right place,''
Jeter said. ``He's a tough pitcher. When he throws the ball, it
seems like it's going to go down the middle, and it runs off your
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The NL picked up another run in the fifth on an RBI single by
Braves center fielder Andruw Jones. The hit scored Dodgers
outfielder Gary Sheffield, who had led off the inning with a walk
against Athletics closer Jason Isringhausen.
</P>
<P>
   The AL scored three insurance runs off Padres closer Trevor
Hoffman in the ninth inning. Arizona's Steve Finley added an RBI
single in the ninth to complete the scoring.

 &HT;    MORMON AUTHOR MAKES 'LEAP' THROUGH ARTWORK(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    (resending to correct coding)
 &HT;    By BARBARA YOST(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - True to her Mormon upbringing, author Terry
TempestWilliams felt ``set apart'' while writing about the cancer
deaths of her mother and grandmothers in her book ``Refuge.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Mormon church, to be set apart means a kind of state of
grace when the faithful feel especially called to spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   As she wrote Refuge, Williams was able to keep herloved ones
alive. But when she finally published the book in 1991, their souls
returned to heaven, and Williams was left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a devastating loss,'' she said. ``They were gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Though tragic, that loss led her to a new spiritual journey,
which became the basis for her current work ``Leap ``(Pantheon
Books, $25). Leap is an intimate tapestry that weaves two disparate
themes: Williams' Mormon faith and her discovery of a 15th-century
painting that would obsess her for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the backdrop, and which is the main story?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are equal,'' Williams said .
</P>
<P>
   Known for her ecological activism and environmental
</P>
<P>
   writings, Williams, 44, is a fifth-generation Mormon who grew up
near Salt LakeCity. At 19, she married writer Brooke Williams in a
temple wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Today she clings to the faith of her childhood butsays ``I am
not orthodox.'' In Leap, she turns a questioning eye on her church
while embracing its catechism.
</P>
<P>
   But it is her relationship with Flemish painter Hieronymus
Bosch's masterwork The Garden of Earthly Delights that provides the
ornate frame for contemplation and an unexpectedly rich portrait of
a woman in love {ndash} with art.
</P>
<P>
   The affair began in the wake of her grief over thedeaths not
only of her mother and grandmothers but also the previous deaths of
fourother women in her family, all ``downwinders'' - suspected
victims of an environment
</P>
<P>
   poisoned by nuclear testing conducted in Nevada in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Williams and her husband decided to heal their grief
with a trip to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The day after arriving in Madrid, Williams went to the
</P>
<P>
   Prado, the city's premier museum and home to masterpieces by
Picasso, Dali,Goya, El Greco and Velazquez. As she entered a small
gallery, she found herself standing in front of a three-panel
painting that looked like a landscape, like the view from a window
onto a wondrous and complex scene of angels and devils and impish
mortals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped in my tracks,'' Williams said. ``I had seen that
painting before.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams remembered that reproductions of the left and right
panels, depicting heaven and hell, had hung over her bed at her
grandmother's house. The larger center panel was an unfamiliar
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body was flooded with memories,'' she said. 'I sent me
literally into a search.''
</P>
<P>
   As that search began, she and Brooke extended their four-day
stay in Madrid to three weeks. Williams returned again and again to
view the painting that had captivated her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't leave,'' she said. ``It was like falling in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tryst took her back to Madrid nearly every year.
</P>
<P>
   She kept journals like a schoolgirl writing a romantic diary.
Four years into the affair, she decided to write a work of
non-fiction and to weave religion into her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was on a spiritual path,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she believes that is what happens when ``dogma shatters and
spirituality rises.''
</P>
<P>
   She began to contemplate: ``What do I believe?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, her father, Salt Lake City pipeline fitter John
Tempest, chided her for her obsession with Bosch. She'd had a vivid
imagination since childhood. Was there really such a painting, he
teased?
</P>
<P>
   When she insisted there was, he declared he would go
</P>
<P>
   along on her next visit. So father and daughter made the trip,
walking into theBosch gallery together, prepared to share Williams'
vision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they found a blank wall bearing only a
</P>
<P>
   postcard reproduction of the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   A guard explained in Spanish and broken English that
</P>
<P>
   the aging triptych was undergoing restoration. He tried to
convey to JohnTempest the nature of the work, especially a section
depicting adultery. Grasping forwords, he finally shouted,
``Lewinsky!''
</P>
<P>
   Tempest returned home, but Williams stayed in Spainanother
month, tracking down the sisters restoring the painting. Convinced
ofher passion, Teresa and Davila Rocio allowed Williams to watch
them work and
</P>
<P>
   even one day handed her a cotton ball soaked in solvent,
inviting her to cleanone small portion.
</P>
<P>
   As she drew the cotton over a nude man with ablueberry for a
head, she felt a connection with his creator:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the woman the blueberry man is courting; myeyes, mouth
want his lip-luscious face just ripe to place on the center ofmy
tongue. I want, I want to suck every ounce of juice, sweet
blueberry juice, from his blueberry head. ...''

<P>
   Although the Mormon-owned newspaper, the Deseret News,
</P>
<P>
   has chosen not to review Leap, Williams does not feel the wrath
of thechurch for her frank writings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been excommunicated,'' she said with asmile. ``I'm
not trying to change
</P>
<P>
   the church. I have no ax to grind. My upbringing isMormon, and
that is the lens I see the world through. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a book about faith, what happens when ourinstitutions
no longer feed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, after completing Leap, Williams
</P>
<P>
   returned to Madrid for one last rendezvous. By now, the Garden
was brilliant in itsrefurbishment and had been moved out of the
Bosch gallery, displayed on aplatform, roped off from visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, too, had moved from Salt Lake City to thegentle hamlet
of Castle Valley, 27 miles east of Moab, population 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, we were both restored,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Castle Valley, Williams continues to work for theenvironment.
She serves on the
</P>
<P>
   board of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, whosemission is
to preserve 7 million acres of red rock country. In her own
town,she works with the Castle Rock Collaboration for the
protection of 5,000 acresof pristine land vulnerable to
development.
</P>
<P>
   In the center panel of her beloved painting is a tinyoman
surrounded by birds, one hand cupped to her ear.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is that woman, she said, ``listening to thebirds,
listening to the land.''

   CHINA-PRIVATE-SECTOR (Jiaxing, China) _ China has been marching
on the road of economic reform for more than two decades now, but
its private sector remains a tiny slice of an economy still
dominated by government-owned organizations. Entrepreneurs are
systematically shunned by China's banks, discriminated against by
regulators and barred from entering many industries. Barriers to

   EMPLOYEE-THEFT (Undated) _ In virtually every sector of the
economy, and in businesses of all sizes and shapes, from shoestring
non-profits to giant corporations, employee theft is rising
sharply. Spurred by the gold-rush mentality of the late 1990s,
emboldened by technology and quick to prey on the loose financial
controls at start-ups and small companies, workers at every rung of
the corporate ladder are stealing more money than ever before,
fraud examiners say.

businesses that have long made their money selling directly to

   PARIS-BISTOS (Paris) _ The word bistro is used as promiscuously
in Paris as the word deli is used in New York. Bistros in the true
sense _ the name comes from a Russian word meaning quick _ were
riding high when I first ate my merry way around the French capital
in the 1960s. Happily, Paris is a conservative city, slow-changing
and resistant to ``progress,'' and quite a few of the genuine
articles survive. Lovers of the sturdy, copious, grandmotherly
cooking that marks a true bistro pass favorite addresses from hand
to hand, like Russians in the Communist era exchanging samizdat

SPARKS' STREAK ENDED BY PORTLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It was probably going to end sometime, but
the Sparks weren't counting on their 12-game win streak ending at
the Forum to the expansion Portland Fire Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In a wild ending, the Sparks couldn't come up with the big shot
as Mwadi Mabika's desperation 3-pointer with two seconds to play
missed the rim as Portland sent a franchise-low crowd of 4,460 home
disappointed with 80-77 loss at the Forum .
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed by 10 with less than six minutes to play, but
they pulled within 78-77 when Mabika putting back a miss by Lisa
Leslie with 42 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Witherspoon, who had a spectacular game to score a
game-high 29 points, missed a layup and Leslie grabbed the rebound
and called timeout with 19.5 seconds to play. Following the Sparks
last timeout, Leslie passed the ball inside to DeLisha Milton, who
missed a layup.
</P>
<P>
   With 6.5 seconds on the clock, Vanessa Nygard, who had 13 points
for the Fire, made two free throws to make it a three-point game.
Mabika got the ball at the top of the key, but her shot was too
long to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, who hadn't lost at home in nine games, are the last
team in the WNBA to lose on their home court. Now they have two
days to prepare to host the three-time defending champion Houston
Comets, who are on a 9-0 tear to lead the league at 18-2. The
Comets host Sacramento today before coming to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean the end of the season, we gave a valiant
effort, we knew the team was coming in and they're one of the most
dangerous teams,'' Sparks coach Michael Cooper said. ``They had
nothing to lose, they got into their rhythm and we just couldn't
stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks are 16-3, with two of their losses coming at the
hands of Western Conference expansion teams. They lost their second
at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Sparks won at Portland, 70-57. Then the Fire had
their starting center, Sylvia Crawley, in the game. But Crawley,
the second leading scorer, sat out Tuesday with an ankle injury
suffered in Portland's last win against Washington. They were also
missing their No. 3 scorer Alisa Burras, who was out with a
sprained right knee. But it didn't hurt the Fire's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon just picked up her game a notch and made up the
difference. She scored 17 of her 29 points in the first half. She
was 10 of 17 from the field, including 4 of 5 from the 3-point
line, where Portland shot 60 percent (9 of 15).
</P>
<P>
   The Fire (6-12) shot 54 percent from the field, despite a 54
showing from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to come out and be aggressive and just play our
game,'' Witherspoon said. ``We felt a sense of calm down the
stretch as a team. We stuck together and did not come apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Mabika led four Sparks in double-figures with 22 points. But it
wasn't enough. Leslie picked up three fouls in the first half and
drew her fifth with 11 minutes to play in the second half. She saw
only 24 minutes of action, which didn't help the Sparks' cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks made their first four shots to go ahead 9-6, but the
Fire wasn't far with the hot hands of Witherspoon, who scored 17 of
her teams 41 first-half points. Nine of her points came from the
3-point line, where she was perfect with three and the team was 7
of 11 from long distance. Tara Williams and Michelle Marciniak
scored from beyond the arc in the final minute as the Fire took a
41-36 margin into the break.

YANKS' JETER STAR OF STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the course of the past week, the All-Star Game had
degenerated into the Some-Star game, with injuries cutting down
some of the brightest flowers in baseball's garden.
</P>
<P>
   It fitting, then, that the man most responsible for the American
League's 6-3 victory Tuesday night at Turner Field was part of the
AL's second line of attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' Alex Rodriguez was voted in as the starting
shortstop by the fans. But when Rodriguez was decommissioned by a
concussion and knee injury suffered Friday night, Derek Jeter
stepped to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   While he was there, the Yankees shortstop drilled hits in his
first three at-bats, scoring one run and driving in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the shortstop situation in the American League,'' Jeter
said after being named the game's MVP, ``you never know if you will
go to the All-Star Game, much less start in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, Jeter and Nomar Garciaparra all have their backers
for the title of best shortstop in the league. The fans liked
Rodriguez this year. Fate liked Jeter, who got his first-ever start
in an All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps starting is what it's all about for Jeter. He'd struck
out twice in two previous All-Star Games, both times serving as a
backup. But given the opportunity by fate to start, Jeter came up
big on a hot (86 degrees), muggy night that just seemed to get
hotter and muggier as the night went along, weather that is
something of a tradition in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter doubled in the first off former Mariner Randy Johnson. He
singled off Kevin Brown and subsequently scored on Brown's
bases-loaded walk to Boston's Carl Everett in the third. But it was
in his fourth-inning at-bat that Jeter defined the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pitted against the Mets' Al Leiter with the bases loaded, Jeter
didn't dodge the spotlight. He fought off a tough cut fastball,
lofting it into center field for a single and two runs. It was no
bullet, but it was just what was needed for the AL to break a 1-1
tie. The hit put the AL ahead for good and led directly to Jeter
being the first Yankee ever _ and this is hard to believe _ to be
named MVP of the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking into consideration all the great players that have been
in the Yankee organization, who wouldn't be surprised?'' Jeter
said. ``But in a game like this, you have to be in the right place
at the right time. I was very fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically had the same game plan against everyone,'' Jeter
said. ``I'm a free swinger. I think that's known around the league,
maybe both leagues. I'd struck out in my only two All-Star at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I wanted to at least put the ball in play. But when you're
facing three guys like that, you want to swing early in the count.
If you fall behind, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was never in trouble. Leiter and his National League
teammates were.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it seemed Jeter would be all the offense the AL
would need or get, before coming up with three runs in the ninth to
put the sloppy game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   For a group of All-Stars, the level of play could have been
much, much better, Jeter notwithstanding. Both sides made two
errors, and it was an unearned run, thanks to an error by Reds
shortstop Barry Larkin in the fourth, that was the difference in
the game until the AL scored its final three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rodriguez was limited to the pre-game introduction
ceremony by his sore right leg, thus liberating Jeter, both of the
other Mariners on active status got a chance to play. Indeed, 29 of
the 30 players on the AL roster played, with only Cleveland
left-hander Chuck Finley held out in case the NL came back.
</P>
<P>
   That never happened, in small part because Seattle's Aaron Sele
pitched a quiet fourth. A starter by trade, Sele had only made it
to one other All-Star Game, in 1998, and that night he didn't
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Sele gave up a one-out single to Andres
Galarraga, but the hometown hero didn't get beyond first base, as
Jim Edmonds fouled out and Jason Kendall grounded out to short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun, but it was a lot different, too,'' Sele
said. ``As a starter, you don't know how to prepare to pitch one
inning. Would I warm up too much? Not enough? Would I be too tired
from pitching (seven innings) Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked out fine, but I breathed a big sigh of relief when
it was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele was so caught up in getting his job done, he forgot to take
the obligatory souvenir baseball with which he'd retired Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Sele and pal Derek Lowe, the one-time Mariner now
pitching for Boston, got one that had been used from the game-ball
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it stays around the house long enough,'' Sele said,
breaking into a coast-to-coast grin, ``it will definitely become
the ball I used.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle designated hitter Edgar Martinez was in the on-deck
circle when the seventh ended. It seemed that his opportunity to
get an at-bat might vanish there, but Yankees manager Joe Torre
manipulated his lineup so Martinez could pinch-hit in the eighth
against Bob Wickman.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez picked out the second pitch he saw and lashed it,
driving a bullet to center, but he couldn't get the ball past the
Braves' Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was throwing good,'' Martinez said. ``I was looking for
anything I could drive, and I got a good pitch to hit. I hit the
ball real good, but (Jones) ran it down.
</P>
<P>
   The only damage the NL was able to do the rest of the way came
in the fifth inning, when A's closer Jason Isringhausen, pitching
too early in the game by the looks of it, walked Gary Sheffield to
open the inning, then gave up back-to-back, one-out singles to
Atlanta's Chipper Jones and Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
   That put the potential tying run at second, but Isringhausen
induced a fly ball by Sammy Sosa and a foul pop fly by Edgardo
Alfonzo, keeping the AL up 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones gave the NL its first run, ripping a solo homer
off eventual winning pitcher James Baldwin of the White Sox with
two out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' Jones said when asked how it felt to homer
in front of the home crowd. ``I mean, it's every little boy's
dream. It's not often that a player gets to play on his home field
in an All-Star Game, much less start.
</P>
<P>
   ``So to go out there and hit a home run, you know, it was just
awesome. I can't explain it. It was something I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' exploits notwithstanding, NL hitters didn't fare well
against AL hurlers.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, Detroit's Todd Jones and the A's Tim Hudson pitched almost
flawless ball in the sixth, seventh and eighth, setting the stage
for the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With Padres closer Trevor Hoffman pitching, the AL broke the
game open. Ray Durham and Garciaparra opened the ninth with
singles, and the Twins' Matt Lawton snookered a hit-and-run single
through the right side for a run.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox's Magglio Ordonez got a second run home by
delivering a textbook sacrifice fly to center, and the Angels'
Darin Erstad capped the three-run inning with an infield dribbler
that brought Lawton home.
</P>
<P>
   With the lead 6-2, the Yankees' Mariano Rivera no longer had a
save situation. But he was able to put the NL away despite
Garciaparra's throwing error _ the fourth defensive miscue of the
game _ which set up Steve Finley's run-scoring hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come here, you want to have fun, but you want to win,
too,'' Martinez said. ``I got an at-bat, Aaron pitched a good
inning and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Such are the joys of summer for the boys of summer.

   ATLANTA _ Shortly before midnight on the eve of 2000, Timothy
Fitzgerald Stevenson Cobb Jr. was savoring the moment. Debonair as
always in a white dinner jacket, he was in Miami Beach, surrounded
by the friends and relatives he was putting up for the weekend,
waiting for the fireworks to start.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb had much to celebrate. He had pulled off something of a
coup.
</P>
<P>
   Over two sleep-deprived years, he and his partner, Jeff Levy,
had built an Internet research company in Atlanta that ultimately
captured half of a fast-growing market. Then came a merger with
their only rival, and the payoff: a public stock offering. By the
end of trading on May 7, 1999, each man's net worth had swelled by
about $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the booming Internet economy, their windfall was by no means
the most spectacular. But it conferred an uncommon distinction on
Cobb: he became one of the country's few black Internet
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   It also happened to be Cobb's 35th birthday that night at the
National Hotel in South Beach, and when the clock struck 12, there
were hugs all around. Cobb remembers in particular a warm embrace
with Levy. It reminded him of how strong their bond had been. They
had shared a single-minded drive to succeed, often reading each
other's thoughts and finishing each other's sentences. To Cobb,
Jeff Levy, 37 _ one of the few white people in the room on New
Year's Eve _ understood his satisfaction in a way that probably no
one else could.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cobb also recalled a creeping uneasiness that weekend. One
reason was his shifting fortunes. Shortly after the merger, Levy
and Cobb went off to start separate Internet ventures. Levy's was
doing fine. Not so Cobb's.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason was the racial mantle Cobb bore: the black
success story in a white world. He calls it both a source of pride
and an enduring burden. For all he and Levy lived through together,
in this he was alone.
</P>
<P>
   The racial backdrop to Cobb's accomplishments went largely
unmentioned by the people he did business with, but he seemed never
to forget it. When things were good, being black made them better;
when things were not so good, it made them worse.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he dwelled on it, he insisted. To wonder how race might
have made his success harder or its aftermath rockier would be
counterproductive. Besides, he said, it would be unseemly for him
to complain. He had a new Porsche, a new Range Rover and trust
funds for his sons, ages 4 and 10 months. He was well invested in
other Internet companies. He was preparing to move into a luxurious
new house.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, in his business world, overt discrimination
had been alleviated by legal protections, changing notions of
acceptable behavior and an improvement in racial attitudes. And the
new high-tech economy provided a better semblance of equal
opportunity. It was one reason he had risked becoming a Web
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he knew how race could tip the scales. How skin
color could trump money and status when it came to forging business
ties. How self-imposed pressures to succeed, particularly as a
black man, could take a toll on every part of life. Certainly, he
acknowledged, race was in his thoughts as he churned over his game
plan that weekend. As he often reminded his wife, Madelyn
Adams-Cobb, he was nearly alone as a black Web entrepreneur in
Atlanta. If he failed, he believed, others would not get the
chance. He was a role model.
</P>
<P>
   When Cobb was growing up in Durham, N.C., he recalled, his
parents told him that he would have to work twice as hard as white
people to achieve as much.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was why he took care to be the best-prepared and
best-dressed for every business meeting. And why he is so driven to
excel. He felt that to be black and successful in business, you had
to be more than good; you had to be a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   That was how some friends at the Miami party saw him. But Cobb
knew that in this moment of glory he had to admit to a more recent
defeat: he was spending half a million dollars a month on an idea
he had lost faith in. He remembers thinking that he would have to
work harder than ever on a new venture. And he put out of his mind
the question of whether his marriage would survive the strain.
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDS AND RIVALS
</P>
<P>
   Close partners and good friends, Tim Cobb and Jeff Levy were
also friendly rivals. On the golf course Levy was the superior
player, but Cobb challenged him all the same, a trait that
impressed Levy when they were getting to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   As they went their separate ways, the former partners kept tabs
on each other's business exploits. Each invested in the other's
company, each sat on the other's board. Each also noticed who had
the bigger office and how much cash the other was burning.
</P>
<P>
   They were, it seemed, equally well-equipped to steer a new
enterprise in an industry that claims to be the ultimate
meritocracy. In largely white Silicon Valley, the mantra goes, the
business is evolving so quickly that the only color that matters is
green. In Atlanta, one of the new technology hubs in racially mixed
areas, the refrain is much the same.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, though, by the start of this year Levy had
clearly pulled ahead of Cobb. He had raised an additional $11
million to finance his venture, eHatchery, which helps companies
start up in exchange for a sizable ownership stake. The company's
offices were filling up with dot-com fledglings. And good press was
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   But Levy, a schmoozer who counts compulsive efficiency as one of
his greatest virtues, had pressures of his own. He was determined,
for instance, to measure up to his great-great-grandfather, Julius
Rosenwald, an early chairman of Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. who had given
millions of dollars to build schools for blacks in the South. Levy
had dabbled in civic causes and thought about philanthropy, but he
was counting on eHatchery to provide the means.
</P>
<P>
   As a Jew, Levy said, he often felt like an outsider himself. But
he also knew that his blond hair, blue eyes and white skin shielded
him from the kind of scrutiny Cobb faced. Though sensitive to race,
Levy prides himself on looking beyond it. He and Cobb rarely talked
about it. ``I never saw Tim as black,'' Levy said. What mattered,
he said, was that they thought alike.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-RACE-ENTREPRENEUR-ABRIDGED-ART-2NDTAKE-$ADV14-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; ATLANTA: thought alike. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others did not always look beyond Cobb's race. When Cobb was
told that a white executive at Levy's company had described him as
a ``black James Bond,'' he knew it was meant as a nod to his
fondness for gadgets and risk. But ``why a `black' James Bond?'' he
had wanted to know, supplying his own answer: ``Black is the
identifier that goes before you, always. It raises the odds that
you will get a real reminder that you are an outsider every time
they meet you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cobb remembered telling his mother he would not have had the
same success if he were not black. If he were white, he told her,
maybe he would have believed more in his chances of making partner
at his old law firms. Maybe as a junior executive at Turner
Broadcasting he would have had mentors and so would not have left.
In some ways, he said, the doors that seemed less open directed him
down the entrepreneurial path to where he was happiest.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cobb scoffs at the idea that race was not a factor in the
technology industry, if only because of who has more access to
capital. Like most Internet entrepreneurs, he and Levy had raised
their first million from friends and family _ and most of it had
come from Levy's friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to have people who can write checks for
$1,000,'' Cobb said. ``It's another thing if they can write checks
for $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But he would not blame race for the disparity between his and
Levy's recent fortunes. That would be too easy. After parting, they
had started different businesses; the market moved in unpredictable
ways. And he harbored no resentment toward his former partner. Levy
remained one of the few people he could talk to about what really
mattered: business.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS BUT MUCH IN COMMON
</P>
<P>
   The eldest of three children, Jeff Levy grew up in
Lawrenceville, N.J., in a modest home that reflected the family's
conscious effort not to show off its wealth. Levy's father, Paul,
was a judge; as a lawyer, he had represented the National Urban
League. His mother, Linda _ an heiress to the Rosenwald fortune _
was a humor columnist and cookbook author.
</P>
<P>
   The family's wealth meant that things came easily to Levy, but
it was also what made him so determined to prove that he didn't
need it.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Cobb was born in Burlington, N.C., where his father, Harold,
was a Baptist minister and his mother, Armadia, a teacher. Once,
Tim's father came home drenched. He had been marching for civil
rights and hoses had been turned on him. Cobb's mother still lowers
her voice when she says ``white,'' an indication, he said, of her
perception of how the world was divided, which side had power.
</P>
<P>
   Tim's academic skills earned him admission to Andover. His
father had suspicions, though: ``They said, `We need a black kid,'
and Tim had good grades and spoke nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim went on to the University of North Carolina. He decided to
attend law school at the University of Pennsylvania, even though an
uncle warned that corporate law firms would not hire blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The first time the Levys and the Cobbs met as couples was in
1994 at an Atlanta cafe. Valerie Hartman Levy had wanted them to
get together since Cobb, a lawyer, joined Turner, where she held a
senior legal position.
</P>
<P>
   Struck by his sense of humor, she remembered telling Cobb in his
job interview that he reminded her of her husband. Later, Cobb told
his wife that Hartman Levy, strong-willed and forthright, reminded
him of her.
</P>
<P>
   The couples soon discovered they had a lot more in common. Two
years earlier, both men left coveted jobs at fancy New York law
firms to follow the women, whose careers had taken them to Atlanta.
And both men soon chafed at their new jobs, Levy's with another law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   By the time dinner was over, the women had become friends and
the men had begun plotting their entrepreneurial escape. Their
rapport was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb had an idea: to create an audience measurement system for
Web sites that Internet companies would use, much the way the
television networks rely on Nielsen ratings. He thought of a name,
too: RelevantKnowledge.
</P>
<P>
   By then Levy had joined Turner's legal department and Cobb had
moved on to its business development unit. They began meeting for
coffee at 6:30 every morning, calculating and debating their
chances of success.
</P>
<P>
   As Levy saw it, Cobb had more to lose, having less of a
financial safety net. But at the same time Cobb felt that at 32 he
had hit a glass ceiling. Of the several hundred vice presidents at
Turner, only seven were black.
</P>
<P>
   Levy remembers taking courage from Cobb's resolve. In the fall
of 1996 they quit their jobs. RelevantKnowledge was born.
</P>
<P>
   ONLY ONE CHIEF
</P>
<P>
   At first, the two were 50-50 partners in everything: finances,
decision making, titles. But when they began raising money, venture
capitalists told them that a company led by co-CEOs would not fly.
Investors would be comfortable only if there was one chief, someone
to hold accountable for making a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The decision about who would be chief executive was made in one
of the nearly wordless exchanges they often had in those early
days. Both knew that Cobb was more qualified. He had more business
experience than Levy, whose specialty was libel law. And the
company was his idea.
</P>
<P>
   But both also believed it would be easier to raise money with a
white CEO than a black one. They did not think people would refuse
to invest simply because Cobb was black. They just thought a black
CEO would make the company look more unusual, Levy said. And as
much as Cobb cared about being a role model, risking the company
over racial pride could be self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   Levy remembers as painful their conversation about the CEO
question. They were taking a huge risk with their careers. They
would be investing their money and that of friends and family. In
the end, Levy recalls, they sort of said it without saying it. Cobb
picked up the phone afterward and left Levy a message: ``If you
want to be CEO, that's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-RACE-ENTREPRENEUR-ABRIDGED-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; ATLANTA: with me.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE PAYOFF, THEN THE PARTING
</P>
<P>
   If their bow to pragmatism was troubling, it did pay off. A
friend of Levy's from Harvard put them in touch with J.H. Whitney &AMP;
Co., the venture capital firm that eventually put up several
million dollars after dozens of others had turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb and Levy knew they were really co-CEOs, Levy said. ``It
wasn't like I would ever say, `I'm CEO, so that's what we're
doing.''' Friends remember that he always took care to refer to
Cobb as his partner and co-founder, and Cobb, who took the title of
president, attended every meeting with potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   Levy is reluctant to link any difficulty in their raising money
to Cobb's race. But he remembers noticing how people sometimes
looked to him in a meeting as if he, not Cobb, would have the
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like, `Hey, he's the better business person.' It
was, `Hey, he's the white guy,''' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of 1998, much of the Internet industry was
relying on RelevantKnowledge to measure Web-site popularity. And
because he carried the top title, Levy was becoming more closely
identified with the company's success. He was the one quoted in the
media; he was the one who networked with other Internet moguls.
</P>
<P>
   If Cobb regretted taking the No. 2 job, the closest he would
come to saying so was to comment: ``I don't make the rules. I have
to play by them, and I have to win by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, once the partners decided to merge with their major
rival, Media Metrix, Cobb did not stay long. He knew that only one
of them would be able to participate in taking the company public.
Levy wanted that job, and as the public face of RelevantKnowledge,
he seemed like the logical choice for it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Cobb invited Levy to help him start a Web site aimed at
teen-agers, an untapped demographic niche, according to the
information they had gathered at RelevantKnowledge. This time Cobb
would be chief executive, and this time they would take the company
public themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Levy declined. The idea did not grab him. And he couldn't
imagine not being chief executive. He, too, wanted to take his own
company public, and he tried to persuade Cobb to be his No. 2 at
eHatchery. Cobb declined.
</P>
<P>
   ONE SUCCEEDS, ONE STRUGGLES
</P>
<P>
   HipO.com, Cobb's new company, let teen-agers buy clothing and
accessories through the Web site and attracted some major
retailers, sponsors and investors. But by late fall, Cobb was
stumbling. Deals with potential partners had fallen through. By
late January, visitors to the site were seeing an animation bidding
them farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Adams-Cobb, now a vice president for employee development at The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution, believed that her husband might have
had an easier time with HipO had he not ceded the top job at
Relevant-Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Little slights gnawed at her. Sitting in the audience at the
Atlanta Convention Center in October as Cobb and Levy were
introduced on a panel of local technology executives, she chafed as
Cobb was introduced last, even though he was not sitting at the end
of the dais. The moderator introduced Levy as the ``former chief
executive of RelevantKnowledge'' and described eHatchery. When he
got to Cobb, he said simply, ``This is Tim Cobb, who helped found
RelevantKnowledge.'' Helped found?
</P>
<P>
   Did the demise of HipO have anything to do with race? He did not
think so, he said. Even in the midst of the current Internet
frenzy, the majority of start-ups fail. But he could not know for
sure. How had he performed at dinner when the Time Warner
executives talked about wine and people they knew in common? Anyone
might go through such a self-evaluation after an important business
meeting, but for Cobb each question came with an unspoken
qualifier: how did he perform, what impression did he make, as a
black man?
</P>
<P>
   Levy had no such concerns, of course. He was busy leveraging his
reputation from RelevantKnowledge to attract investors and draw
attention to eHatchery. An article in U.S. News &AMP; World Report and
a stint on CNN followed the first article about the company last
August in The Journal-Constitution. ``Jeff Levy is an Internet
success story,'' it began.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, HipO received scant press attention in its early
days. In January, The Atlanta Business Chronicle ran an account of
the demise of Cobb's HipO.com under the headline ``Not Hip Enough?
Web Site Dumps Pursuit of Teens.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Levy's public profile is higher than Cobb's, in part
owing to his position and exposure at RelevantKnowledge, he also
made an effort to raise it. He joined the board of Atlanta's
science museum, helped the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee
and was invited to Washington for a dinner with President Clinton.
Occasionally he answered his cell phone and found a senator on the
line. And his ``Thursday Nights at the Hatch'' cocktail parties
attracted Atlanta movers and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   He was also spending more time with his sons as his wife became
more involved in causes like the Million Mom March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff is a poster boy for the new economy in Atlanta,'' said a
prominent lawyer in a toast in March.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, meanwhile, was traveling more and working longer hours. He
was determined to make sure his investors did not lose their money
and was working furiously to transform HipO's assets into a new
Internet business. His wife remembers his coming home exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   He was also too overextended to think about community
involvement, he said. Besides, he had never shared Levy's
enthusiasm for it.
</P>
<P>
   In Cobb's view, the struggle for blacks now was mainly economic.
He could do more good, he said, by ensuring his own success, by
supporting other black professionals and by offering himself as a
model.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Cobb insisted, there would be more like himself.
</P>
<P>
   TOLLS AND PROSPECTS
</P>
<P>
   In April, Cobb and Levy dined together at an Atlanta restaurant.
They discussed business.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was preparing to raise more money. He wanted to set up
another eHatchery office, perhaps in Washington. Soon, he hoped, an
eHatchery investment would be ready to take public or be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects had also brightened for Cobb. He had transformed what
was left of HipO into a new company, Edaflow, which was using the
Internet to connect clothing manufacturers and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Cobb and his wife returned from Miami, they
separated. He moved into the new house in March while his wife
remained with the boys a few blocks away. But he spent more time
with his sons now.
</P>
<P>
   Adams-Cobb said some combination of the missed family dinners
and the constant feeling that her husband had blinders on had worn
her down. Cobb acknowledged that his approach to work had burdened
the relationship: ``When I'm in a foxhole, I divorce all emotion
from what I'm doing and just do it,'' he said. ``Madelyn doesn't
like me when I'm like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Their marital troubles were similar to those of many
entrepreneurs battling the odds. But some of Cobb's friends
suggested that because the sense of going into daily battle was
heightened for black men in business, so were frictions at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toll,'' Cobb said, ``is probably higher than I realized.''

 &HT;    Yankees star helps keep AL on a roll
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For three isolated reasons, the American League won the 71st
All-Star Game Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The AL was better on the mound, more consistent at the plate and
better in the field.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Derek Jeter went 3-for-3 with two RBIs and scored a
run as the night's MVP, leading the AL to a 6-3 victory, its fourth
straight and 10th of the past 13 Midsummer Classics.
</P>
<P>
   The National League was outhit 10-9 (three extra-base hits to
one) and gave up a critical unearned run in the fourth on a botched
double-play ball by shortstop Barry Larkin. The AL never trailed.
The NL has been outscored in this game 29-13 since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The game was attended by 51,323, 1,261 more than Turner Field's
listed capacity. They saw Jeter become the first Yankees player to
win the All-Star MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in a game like this, you have to be in the right place
at the right time,'' Jeter said. ``I was very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching that ever since he came to the big
leagues,'' said NL manager Bobby Cox, whose All-Star record dropped
to 1-4. ``Somebody in the clubhouse asked me if he was getting
better. I think he was this good when he first came up. That's why
he's here. He's an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't blame this one on the Braves. Chipper Jones drove in
the National's first run with a third-inning homer. Andruw Jones
drove in the second with a fifth-inning single. Tom Glavine worked
a 1-2-3 fifth. Andres Galarraga, in one of the night's sweetest
moments, was welcomed to the plate with a standing ovation and
later singled.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be nearly enough. The NL was held hitless from the
fifth through the eighth, although Steve Finley drove in one run in
the ninth. But by then, the Americans had removed all drama with a
three-run ninth, with San Diego's Trevor Hoffman slapped around for
three consecutive singles.
</P>
<P>
   The National had closed to 3-2 in the fifth, and Atlanta fueled
it. Following Gary Sheffield's lead-off walk, Chipper Jones
produced his third hit of the night and Andruw Jones, in his first
All-Star at-bat, singled up the middle to score Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine was summoned to work the top of the fifth, and the
Braves left-hander became the first pitcher all night to retire the
side in order. Jones' homer was the only of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' he said. ``I mean, it's every little boy's
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Al Leiter's. With New York Mets left-hander on to work
the fourth for the Nationals, Larkin's glove helped make a mess of
what had been a 1-1 game. After a walk to Jermaine Dye and a single
by Travis Fryman, pinch-hitter Mike Sweeney of Kansas City rolled
one to shortstop that took a quick hop as Larkin dropped his glove,
skipping off the heel.
</P>
<P>
   The error loaded the bases for Jeter, who produced his third hit
in three at-bats, driving in two runs with a single up the middle
for a 3-1 lead. Jeter knew what pitch Leiter would throw, did not
particularly want to offer at it and was hardly impressed with the
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``A cutter. I mean, he does it every time I face him,'' Jeter
said. ``I try to lay off it. I didn't hit it well. I just hit it in
the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones had tied the game 1-1 in the third and made a
little history, too. He sent a 2-0 pitch from James Baldwin over
the center field wall, becoming the 13th player to every hit a home
run in his home park. He joins Hank Aaron on that list, who hit one
in Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The night's foremost ovation belonged to Galarraga, who had the
packed house standing by the time he got to the plate in the second
for his first at-bat. Making his first All-Star start only nine
months after completing cancer treatments, Galarraga doffed his
helmet before drilled David Wells' first pitch on a line to left
field. Everett was able to glove it with just four steps.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga later singled in the fourth before coming out for
pinch-runner Todd Helton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be something better than today,'' Galarraga said,
``to be with this team, to play this game today.''

 &HT;    Big Cat, Kendall bring a dose of perspective
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No more regrets over what this All-Star Game wasn't.
That kind of thinking can be so wasteful anyway, as almost any
cancer patient will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints over all the players who no-showed Tuesday night
were to be washed away in steady waves of appreciation for one
player you couldn't have kept away with a sore knee or a
restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   When Andres Galarraga spoke, nothing but eagerness and
excitement tumbled out. ``I was like a little kid going to the
field today,'' said the Braves' healed first-baseman. And with
cause, for regardless of outcome or performance, he was the obvious
centerpiece of a game between baseball's best available stars.
</P>
<P>
   It began from the moment he walked out during the pregame parade
of players and their children. As he crossed the outfield with one
daughter in his arms, holding another by the hand and one more
trailing, the crowd sought him out and threw the first huzzahs his
way.
</P>
<P>
   No All-Star received a louder, longer Turner Field ovation
during the introductions than he _ who could hope to? How good was
it? Up in his box, Braves general manager John Schuerholz was seen
being practically physically lifted out of his chair by the
reception.
</P>
<P>
   So much tr elixir _ good for what ails you _ the catcher's tale.
Jason Kendall's year ago was spent, ``on the couch, heavily
medicated with my foot up.'' In other words, the Pittsburgh catcher
was pretty much your typical home viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Last July 4, trying to beat out a bunt, misstepping at the bag,
Kendall suffered a ghastly, Ruffian-style dislocation of the right
ankle. The replays of him grasping his leg, with his foot dangling
as if unconnected to him, are still haunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big difference, though. I dislocated an ankle, (Galarraga) was
fighting for his life,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories within the grander game have helped elevate it once
more. Hey, who doesn't love a good resurrection?
</P>
<P>
   To another, wider audience, Galarraga spun his tale of faith, of
being cleansed by a devine dream that made him know all would be
well. Making it back to the All-Star Game was but one more element
in some heavenly plan.
</P>
<P>
   And we're going to gripe about Mark McGwire's aches?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we complain about too many little things,''
Galarraga suggested this week.

 &HT;    Jeter makes history for Yankees
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not Ruth. Not Gehrig. Neither DiMaggio nor Mantle. Not even
Yogi. The only New York Yankee to win the most valuable player
award in an All-Star Game? Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to believe,'' the Yankee shortstop said. ``Look at
all the Yankee greats over the years. You figure at least one of
them would win one.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest great one did. Playing in his third consecutive
All-Star Game, hitless in the first two with strikeouts in his only
two at-bats, Jeter was perfection Tuesday. He went 3-for-3,
including a two-run single in the fourth inning off losing pitcher
Al Leiter that gave the American League the lead for good in its
6-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was given the MVP award, a singular event for baseball's
most tradition-rich team. ``With all the history books that have
been written by a lot of Yankees, it's hard to believe,'' said
winning manager Joe Torre of the Yankees. ``You couldn't want a
more proud individual to be the first one up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter started only because his close friend, Seattle's Alex
Rodriguez, suffered a concussion Friday, and Torre chose his own
shortstop over Boston's Nomar Garciaparra ``because Nomar started
last year and I think it's a big thrill for a youngster to start
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot,'' Jeter said. ``The shortstop position in the
American League, you never know if you're going to get a chance to
come to the All-Star Game, much less get to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Much less start. Much less become the first Yankee to be named
MVP. Especially after striking out twice the past two years.
Instead, Jeter, already considered the Prince of the City back in
New York, gave another princely performance in the town that's fast
becoming his second city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's a great stadium,'' Jeter said of Turner Field.
``You can see very well at the plate. We played some very important
big games here against the Braves, in the postseason, regular
season, now this game here. I don't know what to tell you. I guess
it's just good fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Or good hitting and preparation. Jeter was determined not to
fall behind in the count, as he quickly had in his two previous
All-Star at-bats. He came out swinging: first doubling off Randy
Johnson in the first inning; singling off Kevin Brown in the third
and scoring the night's first run; and finally lacing a Leiter cut
fastball in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically had the same game plan against everyone,'' Jeter
said. ``I'm a free swinger. I think it's known around the league,
both leagues. I wanted to at least put the ball in play.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, every time. Already, the 1996 AL Rookie of the Year, a
three-time world champion in just four years in the big leagues,
Jeter is now an All-Star MVP. And already a Yankee great?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he said. ``You've got to play for a lot of
years before you're considered a Yankee great. This is my fifth
year. Hopefully, I can play for a few more years, then start that
debate.''

 &HT;    Joe Belle inspired all he met
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ This is not a time for pettiness, but I can't
help feeling peeved that, until last fall, I appear to have been
the only person in town who didn't know Joe Belle.
</P>
<P>
   If he was Mr. UD, Mr. Personality and all that, don't you think
he could have taken the trouble to call me up?
</P>
<P>
   I wish to God, at any rate, that when I met the beloved UD
administrator it was for any other reason than what it was: A
feature story about his fight against a rare and deadly form of
brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, it is a rare privilege to have known a man like
Joe, who died Sunday at 50: A man whose love of life, love of
family, become even deeper when faced with losing them.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't going to be one of those ``good comes out of
tragedy'' epiphanies. It's true, as close friend Steve Yuhas
eulogized Tuesday, ``that the past 14 months have been a gift from
God to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Much good has come from Joe's illness and the inspiration he has
given so many. But much, much more good would have come out of
having Joe around for the next 40 years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm still in the anger phase. That's a luxury Joe didn't
allow himself as he endured three surgeries and a grueling medical
regimen, while continuing to work until several weeks ago. ``People
say, `Aren't you mad at God?''' Joe said. ``I don't have time to be
mad at God now. I need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Once I got to know Joe, he speedily made up for his previous
neglect. He wouldn't let me linger for very long in my safety zone
as a reporter. It was almost impossible to know him without knowing
him as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   So I joined hundreds of other mourners at Joe's funeral Tuesday
morning at St. Albert the Great Church in Kettering. Nearly every
face in the overflow crowd was tear-streaked. ``It was a real
tribute to Joe that we had to open both sides of the church
today,'' Pastor Jim Manning greeted the mourners.
</P>
<P>
   How could one man make such an impact on so many?
</P>
<P>
   It's something more than his irresistible wit, at once biting
and gentle. Something more, even, than the infectious exuberance of
this 5-foot-5 Italian leprechaun with a Paul Bunyan-sized zest for
living.
</P>
<P>
   Even when facing death, he put others first. In accepting UD's
Lackner award, which recognizes individuals who exemplify the
Marianist sense of hospitality, his first words were of wife, Barb,
``the pillar of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   When I visited him for the last time, on July 4, Joe was clearly
in pain, unable to eat. ``I'm ready,'' he said, ``but the Lord
won't take me.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking was clearly an effort, but he made the effort _ and his
thoughts were on his visitors. He wanted to make sure we sampled
the homemade pasta Aunt Martha made the night before.
</P>
<P>
   No one had expected him to awaken from the coma into which he
had fallen the Friday before. But he did, as if willing himself to
give his loved ones the gift of a goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   He even organized an impromptu champagne toast the Monday before
his death, inviting dozens of close friends to share the bottle of
Millennium champagne left over from New Year's It was, in short, an
Italian wake that the Irish could envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before the disease, Joe acted each day as if it were a
blessing to be alive,'' Yuhas said in his eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   Then he stopped himself, realizing he had belabored the obvious:
``But if you knew Joe, you know that.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right; he didn't need to tell us. We knew.
</P>
<P>
   For those who knew Joe Belle, it's a lesson not likely to be
forgotten.

   (Anne Applebaum writes a column for the London Sunday
Telegraph.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY ANNE APPLEBAUM &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the world of summit diplomacy, it has long been customary to
throw cold water on any really important meeting of world statesmen
well in advance of its occurrence: that way no one gets too excited
beforehand or too disappointed afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of this week's Camp David meeting between Yasser
Arafat and Ehud Barak, however, the advance noises have been
pessimistic to the point of caricature.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, commenting on the summit last week, actually
warned of the ``abject dreariness'' of the coming negotiations. The
Palestinian Authority's official position is that ``in spite of the
optimistic reports,'' there is still a ``long and difficult path to
put an end to a century-old conflict,'' and Arafat has recently
said that the peace talks are ``in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak himself didn't need to say anything: The mere fact that
his government fell apart on the eve of his departure for
Washington _ three of the coalition parties resigned, depriving him
of his parliamentary majority _ would have been enough to dampen
any unwarranted enthusiasm, had there actually been any in
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barak's difficulties are symptomatic of a deeper
problem, not only with this summit in particular, but with
Arab-Israeli summits in general. To start with, the expression
``Arab-Israeli'' is itself flawed, as anyone who has ever spent 10
minutes in the Middle East already knows. There has long been a
small group of Palestinians, and a small group of Israelis, who are
more than willing to do a deal. But if it were that easy, a deal
would have been done a long, long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there aren't ``Arabs'' as such: Even the multitrack
organization of Middle East peace negotiations is designed to
reflect the existence of Palestinians and Syrians and Lebanese and
others, each with their separate histories, their separate
relations with Israel, their separate agendas for the future. But
what the negotiations don't _ and can't _ reflect is that there
aren't really ``Palestinians'' either.
</P>
<P>
   That is, there are Palestinians who live in Gaza, Palestinians
who live on the West Bank, Palestinians who support the Palestinian
Authority, and Palestinians who support Hamas, among others. And
all these factions have their separate agendas, separate histories,
and separate traditions as well.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, needless to say, are there ``Israelis'' either.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't, in other words, one nation which has one set of
feelings regarding the Palestinians, or the territory Israel
acquired during the 1967 war _ territory which is referred to by
some as ``the West Bank,'' or ``the occupied territories'' and by
others as ``Judea and Sumaria,'' depending on their ideological
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I find it difficult to think of another country whose
citizens are so prone to provide not only different interpretations
of events but also different factual accounts of the events
themselves. Some of these deep divides are reflected in the
fractious Israeli political system, but they go beyond it too.
Would that this were only about ``Left'' and ``Right'' or hawks and
doves:
</P>
<P>
   To that, you have to add not only the traditional cultural
splits, between religious Jews and secular Jews, European Jews and
Middle Eastern Jews as well as the newer divisions between recent
Russian immigrants and old post-war settlers, not to mention rich
vs. poor.
</P>
<P>
   For a flavor of how much these various groups dislike each
other, read Uri Dan's attack on Barak in the Jerusalem Post and
Ha'aretz 's defense of him against ``the fanatics, the ranters and
ravers.'' Then ask yourself whether they could really be talking
about the same person.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the entities of ``Palestine'' and ``Israel'' are in
fact not unitary entities, but rather squabbling coalitions
composed of various groups who might at any point decide to chart
their own course (is it that hard to imagine a group of
Palestinians rejecting any agreement, and starting their own
jihad?), the question of just who is talking to whom at a Camp
David summit becomes a somewhat ambiguous one. In fact, neither of
the main protagonists can confidently claim to speak with the voice
of his respective nation.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there is Arafat: old, tired, under heavy
criticism for the manifold failures of the Palestinian Authority _
and, limited by the fact that he is, effectively, speaking for the
entire Muslim world. That makes him unlikely, for example, to give
up the Palestinian claim to sovereignty over Jerusalem: He would
lose the backing of too many people, not only in Palestine but in
the Arab states that have long supported the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't a man with a free hand, a man who can wheel and deal as
he wishes: There is his own future to think of, the interests of a
wide range of people, money, political support, power.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is Barak, who has an interesting
dilemma in front of him. As we know, he is no longer head of a
majority government, and on Monday, he narrowly escaped being
ousted altogether by a vote of ``no confidence.'' About 45 percent
of his countrymen, according to a poll this week, feel that he
doesn't represent them, and don't think he should go to the summit
at all.
</P>
<P>
   In good faith, can he sign an agreement handing over large
chunks of the West Bank (or whatever you want to call it) to what
inevitably seems destined to become a Palestinian state? And if he
does, will that spark riots, protests, new elections, a new
leadership, rollback _ and so on? Although he has announced his
intention to deal ``as a leader of the nation'' and then hold a
referendum afterward, he isn't exactly a free agent either.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at the same time, you would be hard-pressed to find two men
who really do, in their various ways, have a claim to speak for
their respective nations. Arafat, it hardly needs noting, has been
fighting these battles for a long, long time. He has been the
international face of Palestine abroad, for better or for worse,
certainly as long as I can remember.
</P>
<P>
   Although the same cannot be said of Barak, the man has served as
commander of the Israeli army's elite commando unit and as chief of
military intelligence and chief of staff of the Israeli army
itself. He has played a prominent role in peace negotiations since
1993. Quite a lot of people don't think much of him, but in
Israeli's direct prime ministerial elections, he was supported by
56 percent of the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   If not these two men, then who?
</P>
<P>
   In a most undemocratic way, the choice is theirs. Any
Arab-Israeli deal is virtually guaranteed to produce angry, even
violent opposition. Therefore, if a really meaningful breakthrough
is to be achieved, both men will therefore have to detach
themselves from the factional, domestic politics at home, ignore
the probable negative consequences for themselves and their
political parties, cast aside petty concerns about things like
``the next elections,'' close their eyes, cross their fingers,
sign, and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   And that's asking a lot of politicians, I know.

testing Nonoxynol-9 _ a common spermicidal gel _ to prevent HIV
infection not only failed to protect women from the virus, it
apparently helped promote new infections among Thai and African
prostitutes. The findings, released Wednesday at the 13th

 &HT;    GRAPEVINE: News, notes and gossip from the industry
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   World Championship Wrestling may not have put together the best
pay-per-view, but Sunday's ``Bash at the Beach'' could go down a
historic event.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks leading up to the show, Hulk Hogan had been missing in
action, despite being a headliner in a world title match with
champion Jeff Jarrett. Also missing at the same time was WCW
creative guru Vince Russo. Why were they both missing? Were they
trying to rework Hogan's contract or was Hogan looking to leave WCW
and start his own organization? Rumors are rampant on the Internet,
but chance are the events at ``Bash at the Beach'' were probably
staged.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Hogan had to say recently on ``The Love Sponge''
radio show in Tampa, Fla., where he is a frequent guest in his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Russo approached Hogan about losing to Jarrett by
disqualifcation after destroying Jarrett. Russo changed his mind
and then gave a different ending. That ending didn't sit well with
Eric Bischoff and he and Russo got into an arguement. Bischoff
stormed out of the meeting. Hogan told Russo that he would lose to
Jarrett if he could get out of his WCW contract. Russo argued with
Hogan and WCW top man Brad Siegel was called. Siegel said Hogan was
not going to be let out of his contract, but that he had a creative
control clause in his contract, so Russo should let Hogan win.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and Russo went to the ring, then Hogan went to the ring.
Russo told Jarrett to lay down in the ring and for Hogan to go
ahead and pin him if he wanted the belt so badly. Hogan said he
asked Jarrett why he was doing this. He told Jarrett he should get
up and they should fight to make Russo look bad. Jarrett said he
was just following orders and Hogan pinned him.
</P>
<P>
   Russo came out a second time to announce that Jarrett was still
the WCW championand displayed the old WCW belt (Hogan was given a
new replica belt) and would defend the title later in the evening
against Booker T. Hogan said he tired to get to the ring during
Russo's announcement, but we held back by security. He later tried
to talk to Russo again, but was escorted out of the building by
security.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russo promos had a real feel to them, something just
smells fishy about how it all went down. First, the amount from
``insider'' information on the Internet leading up to the ``Bash''
with Hogan claiming he's talking to FOX, claiming he didn't want to
lose to Jarrett and might no-show the event. WCW has used their own
group of insiders to send out information they want the fans to
have, while it is far from the truth. Second, it was played up
throughout the ``Bash'' that Hogan might not be there. Third, when
Russo came down to the ring before the match you knew from the look
on his face what was going to happen. When Vince McMahon really
double-crossed Bret Hart at the ``Survivor Series'' in 1998, he
didn't telegraph the move. Fourth, why did Jarrett have a back-up
belt, unless you knew you were going to need it? Fifth, Hogan's
comments on the radio show the next day was a hard sell after the
fact. Sixth, no one at WCW will say anything about it for ``legal''
reasons. And finally, whenever something is played as a ``shoot''
(real) it usually isn't.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason to believe it was real is because of the match
between Booker T and Jarrett. There were a lot of rest holds and
they talked their way through the match, so you could tell they
hadn't practiced.
</P>
<P>
   _ In other WCW show at the ECW Arena being the final one are not
true. Owners of the arena are trying to sell it, but have not found
a buyer over the past six months, so chances of it being sold soon
are not good. ECW has three more shows scheduled already. ECW has
also scheduled its first venture into Canada for Sept. 9 in
Ontario. ECW is also looking into putting on a show in England next
year. England is one of a few European countries that televises
ECW.

 &HT;    New Yorker looks at high-risk orphans
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Yorker ($3) offers a diverse _ and unusual _ array of
articles in its July 17 issue. Atlanta author Melissa Fay Greene
visits the New York clinic where Dr. Jane Aronson reviews videos of
high-risk orphans from Russia and Eastern Europe and advises
prospective parents who want to adopt the children. The parents'
reactions to the evaluations vary greatly, Greene writes. ``Some _
already in love with a photograph or a video _ want a rubber stamp
for their decision, and are outraged if they don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other articles of note include Timothy W. Ryback's discovery
that many of Adolf Hitler's relatives are living _ very quietly _
in New York City, and Burkhard Bilger's interesting Letter from
Kentucky about the local custom of eating squirrel brains. A virus
much like that of mad-cow disease is now threatening the culinary
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More Harry: Newsweek ($3.50) adds more fuel to the Harry
Potter frenzy this week with an excerpt from the new J.K. Rowling
novel, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.'' In addition,
reviewer Malcolm Jones examines the Potter phenomenon and offers
his opinion on the literary quality of the books. ``Rowling's
novels are probably the best books children have ever encountered
that haven't been thrust upon them by an adult,'' he writes.
``Rowling may not be as magisterial as (J.R.R.) Tolkien or as
quirky as (Roald) Dahl, but her books introduce fledgling readers
to a high standard of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than smoke: Things continue to change at Cigar Aficionado
($4.95). In an effort to broaden its appeal, the magazine has
expanded its coverage to include articles even nonsmokers can
appreciate. The August issue features a cover story on widow Bo
Derek (no, she's not dating Ted Turner); columns about the
Olympics, Jesse Ventura and classic cars; and a fascinating article
on Cuban-American exiles' attitudes toward Fidel Castro. Not
surprisingly, writer Jonathan Kandell found mostly hatred. One
exception was Alfredo Duran, a 63-year-old lawyer who took part in
the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 and spent two years in a Cuban
prison. Duran thinks it's time to start a dialogue with the
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More Bo: Ms. Derek, 43, proves she's still a ``10'' in the
August issue of Vanity Fair ($3.95) by posing for a revealing photo
spread for Herb Ritts. Also in this issue are a cover story on
Heath Ledger, Aussie co-star of ``The Patriot''; a report from Seba
votes from readers and food industry members. The Top 5, in order,
are Chops, Bluepointe, Nava, Canoe and Pricci. Also included in
this issue is Domicile, a mini-magazine about decorating and
interiors that takes readers into the home of Karin Jones, Atlanta
Brave Chipper Jones' former wife. Located in the Country Club of
the South, her 10,000-square-foot house boasts 20-foot
floor-to-ceiling palladian windows.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Critics have gotten this whole wrestling
thing wrong. As far as the WWF is concerned, violence, sex and
misogyny are certainly in-bounds. But don't accuse the
entertainment behemoth of not having standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there are limits,'' said Linda E. McMahon, president
and chief executive of the World Wrestling Federation and wife of
chairman-cartoon villain Vince McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until you hear what they are:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the World Wrestling Federation, we don't kill anyone. We're
not shooting people. Nor are we giving the impression that we're
killing anyone or knifing anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   This sophisticated woman, who presents herself with the
gentility befitting her Southern roots, said this to a roomful of
reporters without a dram of mirth or humor. She was serious. C'mon,
people, her tone implied, isn't that enough?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly a matter of personal preference and choice,''
she said at the Television Critics Association Press Tour.
``Clearly there are critics of our product. Clearly there are those
who do not like our product just as there are many who don't like
the ballet, opera or other entertainment options.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling, on par with ballet and opera, all said without so
much as a hint of a grin. That's wonderful theater.
</P>
<P>
   While you can take your shots at the WWF _ an adult product that
bills itself as an adult product yet continually markets to kids
(taking notes, tobacco industry?) _ there's no denying that it's
one of the most important shows on television.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did it save UPN (which had no soul to lose), but it
continually held the top ratings slots on cable on USA Network.
</P>
<P>
   But on the cable side, the WWF is jumping this fall to TNN, a
move that will cost the outfit ratings at the start but give it a
strong promotional vehicle, since the country station (which is
going toward more sports programming) is part of MTV Networks and
CBS-Viacom. ``Rock video'' will take on a whole new meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Also, expect specials to pop up on CBS, not to mention XFL
football games when the new WWF league premieres next winter on NBC
and UPN.
</P>
<P>
   This move is an entertainment rarity in television: a prime-time
show in its prime jumping networks. In most cases where shows have
shifted, it was at an end of a run, and the results were usually
poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations most certainly are to start equal to what the
WWF has done at USA,'' said Brian Hughes, TNN vice president of
programming. ``There is huge support for this sports entertainment
property in the way of marketing, not only in our air but off air
and across the Viacom family.''
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers are getting leery of wrestling (7-Up and
Coca-Cola are among those who begged off of UPN's ``WWF
Smackdown!''), and the genre has a history of going into decline in
popularity before inevitably bouncing off the mat.
</P>
<P>
   But clan McMahon _ conducting what Linda McMahon calls ``the
largest focus group that ever happens'' in packed arenas four times
a week _ have been able to tap into a vein that has put wrestling
on a historic upswing. As far as they are concerned, those kids
they are not marketing to will still be the fans of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mrs. McMahon would smile over that.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   NBC last week aired an unpromoted ``Freaks and Geeks'' marathon,
which came out on top in its time slot among the Big Three networks
in terms of demographics. Forget it: The great freshman drama is
still canceled.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox Family Channel will air all 18 episodes of the show _
including three episodes never before seen _ starting with
back-to-back episodes at 8 p.m. (Eastern) Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The drama's cancellation, especially in light of the weak slate
of new shows coming this fall to NBC and the other networks,
becomes more and more infuriating. In future years, look for this
show to be remembered as fondly as ``My So-Called Life,'' another
teen drama that died too young a death.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Producer Judd Apatow said the show was shopped around
to other broadcast networks before it was ultimately abandoned.
``It was a real complicated process,'' he said. ``We said, `Who
wants us?' and they said, `None of us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Apatow said he was concerned that shows like ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' and ``Survivor'' have created the attitude among
networks executives that only shows that could become the next
landscape-altering megahit should be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible trend for shows like `Freaks and Geeks,''' he
said. ``We're never going to change television. As I go in to pitch
(different) shows for next season, my pitch is, `Please let me make
the show that makes you feel less dirty about the other (stuff) you
are putting on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Good luck on that ever flying.

&HT;     NOT MUCH TO SCREAM ABOUT IN HORROR SPOOF PART III 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE WESTERBOORK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Wes Craven insists he made this third ``Scream'' out of
devotion to ``closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Devotion to money is more like it. The first ``Scream'' didn't
need a single sequel, much less two.
</P>
<P>
   By coughing up the same characters and situations yet again,
this franchise becomes what its original movie mocked: just another
hackneyed hack-'em-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' has the same old black-robed, white-masked murderer
arising to kill and kill again, this time in Los Angeles. He's
stalking the cast and crew of ``Stab 3,'' a film based on the first
Scream's story.
</P>
<P>
   Whiny victim junkie Neve Campbell has retreated to rural
seclusion, but somehow the script rationalizes a reason for her to
charge into the Los Angles, where the body count mounts
predictably.
</P>
<P>
   Courteney Cox Arquette, David Arquette and others also return,
as does the usual array of false-alarm jolts (we stopped counting
at six) and phone calls from the killer, who is using a gizmo to
alter his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few fresh elements, Parker Posey is a hoot as a
hysterical actress playing a TV reporter in ``Stab 3.'' Some
surprise cameos also pepper the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The action can be effectively gut-grabbing, and screenwriter
Ehren Kruger cranks out some good one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, this is a numbingly formulaic wind-down of a once-witty
concept: poking fun at horror-film cliches while slyly employing
them.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Craven and company become the cliche.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make you want to scream _ not ``Help!'' but
``Enough!''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen _ secret agent?
</P>
<P>
   No, but MGM is using its James Bond approach for Allen's catalog
of films on that label.
</P>
<P>
   This week brings the ``Woody Allen Collection,'' an eight-movie
gift set on VHS ($99.98) and DVD ($234.98). Titles also are sold
individually ($14.95 for tapes, $19.98 for discs).
</P>
<P>
   They focus on Allen's early career, from 1969 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He directed all eight entries: ``Bananas,'' ``Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About Sex,'' ``Sleeper,'' ``Love and Death,''
``Annie Hall,'' ``Interiors'' (a Bergmanesque drama in which he did
not appear), ``Manhattan'' and ``Stardust Memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Only ``Annie Hall'' has been on DVD previously.
</P>
<P>
   Not included from the same era are ``What's Up, Tiger Lily?'',
the Japanese spy film for which Allen added new dialogue; ``Take
the Money and Run''; and ``Play It Again, Sam,'' directed by Herb
Ross (and also sold by another label, Paramount).
</P>
<P>
   But largely these are the crop's cream, especially the one-two
punch of ``Annie Hall,'' the popular Oscar winner as 1977's best
picture, and ``Manhattan,'' its bookend.
</P>
<P>
   Allen disdains awards, as indicated by a line in ``Annie Hall''
and the fact that he stayed in New York to play clarinet at a club
the night the film won its awards.
</P>
<P>
   So don't expect him to agree with Oscar and anoint ``Annie'' as
his favorite work. Rather, his pet picture seems to be
``Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Want clues? Only ``Manhattan'' never has been telecast without
letterboxing, thus preserving Gordon Willis' exquisite
black-and-white cinematography.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, among the eight new DVDs, only ``Manhattan'' is
featured in just letterboxed form. The other films are offered
full-frame on one side of the disc and letterboxed on the other.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of that distinction, only ``Manhattan'' has a
picture disc with artwork on one side.
</P>
<P>
   Extras are minimal. Each disc has a booklet and theatrical
trailer, as well as language options for dubbing and subtitles.
These can be oddly varied: You can hear ``Annie Hall'' in French
and Manhattan in ``Spanish,'' but not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. This is the heart of Allen's best work, when his
ideas were fresh, his humor wasn't vulgar or mean-spirited and his
relationship-challenged New York neurotics were at their most
endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Most lovable among them is Oscar winner Diane Keaton's Annie,
yet even she is eclipsed by another character: New York itself in
``Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeously photographed and beautifully scored with music by
George Gershwin, ``Manhattan'' is the ultimate valentine to Allen's
beloved town. As he says in the intro, it was his town, and it
always would be.

&HT;     WAYS TO MANAGE UPHEAVAL IN MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Seven of the 10 managed-care companies that offer
Medicare HMO plans in Texas are abandoning the business next year _
and about 200,000 customers.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of those stranded and in search of new coverage
live in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The managed-care providers have said they are withdrawing from
the Houston market and others across the nation because low
reimbursement rates from the federal government combined with high
pharmaceutical and administrative costs have pushed their profit
margins below acceptable levels.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as private-sector, publicly traded companies, the
health maintenance organizations have the right to decide when and
where they want to do business and an obligation to their
shareholders to base those decisions on sound financial strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But the upheaval in the Medicare HMO market has left 6.5 million
retirees, the disabled and their families nationwide anxious about
their financial futures.
</P>
<P>
   By the time HMO coverage ends for many of them on Dec. 31, these
Medicare recipients will have several possible replacement
alternatives that may or may not duplicate the coverage they got
from their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   The first option is to do nothing prior to your HMO coverage
ending. You will automatically be enrolled in the original Medicare
plan, a fee-for-service plan that is managed by the federal
government through the Health Care Financing Administration.
</P>
<P>
   That plan is divided into two parts: Medicare A covers
hospitalization, and Medicare B covers doctors' bills. But neither
portion covers prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   This year, participants pay a $776 deductible for each hospital
stay of 60 days or less before the hospital coverage begins and a
$100 deductible each year before the medical coverage starts,
according to HCFA.
</P>
<P>
   People typically sign up for Medicare HMOs to get the
prescription drug coverage that they can't get through Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The best bet for getting prescription coverage is to switch to
another Medicare HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, in Houston, there will be only one HMO choice in
2001: PacifiCare Health Systems' Secure Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   This year, that plan does not charge a premium above the monthly
Medicare premium of $45.50 that's deducted from Social Security
checks.
</P>
<P>
   That money is paid directly to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   It requires participants to make co-payments of $6 for each
doctor visit, $5 for generic drugs and $20 for brand-name
prescriptions. The prescription coverage is limited to $1,200 each
year.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is no guarantee that the benefits, co-payments or
coverage levels will be the same next year.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs have the right to adjust their plans each year, and they
are not required to offer prescription coverage with Medicare HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   As the only state-approved managed-care company that has agreed
to renew its Medicare contract in Houston, PacifiCare can expect a
big boost to its enrollment and its expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect to see all 107,000 (former HMO participants in
Houston) sign up, but we want to give them that option,'' says Tony
Salters, a PacifiCare spokesman. ``At some point _ not now _ we may
have to say that the physicians cannot handle all the people who
want to enroll. ``PacifiCare will announce by Sept. 15 the details
of the coverage costs and benefits. However, it is highly unlikely
the company would drop prescription coverage from its Secure
Horizons' plan or dramatically increase its fees.
</P>
<P>
   Especially, since Amcare Health Plans of Texas is seeking state
approval to bring another Medicare HMO to the Houston market,
according to the Texas Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   People who want to swear off all HMOs because they fear all
plans eventually will leave the Medicare market do have other
options.
</P>
<P>
   They can buy Medicare supplemental insurance, which is also
called Medigap. There are 10 standard policies, labeled A (the most
basic and least expensive) through J (the most comprehensive and
expensive).
</P>
<P>
   The average costs range from annual premiums of $500 to nearly
$7,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the maximum prescription coverage is $3,000 each year, which
is a 50 percent match after the policy holder pays $3,000 for
medications and a $250 deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone being pushed out of an HMO will have the guaranteed
right to buy policies A, B, C and F from any health insurance
company that offers the coverage in the state. That means you can
get the coverage regardless of your medical history and without a
waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   There is a caveat for people under age 65 on Medicare, which
includes the disabled. They are only guaranteed the right to buy
policy A.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight insurers that will sell this group other Medigap
policies. For more information in Texas, go to www.tdi.state.tx.us
to get the rate guide or call an automated order line at
800-599-7467.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the four guaranteed policies offers
prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
   You would have to buy plans H, I or J to get that. And it is
rare for insurers to ``guarantee issue'' those policies. So, you
will have to be in good health and without a pre-existing condition
to qualify for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There is a loophole for HMO participants who have been eligible
for Medicare for less than 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   They have the right to enroll in any of the 10 Medigap policies
or HMO plans. Only people with end-stage renal disease would be
restricted to policies A,B,C and F.
</P>
<P>
   Another coverage option is to sign up for the new private
fee-for-service plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Life Insurance Co. offers the only one in Texas.
However, it does not offer prescription coverage and it is not
available to residents in the Houston metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another option is to call your former employer to see if any
health insurance benefits are available to retirees. However, most
companies have been dropping such plans. Also, some retiree health
plans have been connected to Medicare HMO programs that are pulling
out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   If those alternatives don't work for you, check to see if you
qualify for a Medicare assistance program.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Texas administers four federal programs that pay
part of your Medicare out-of-pocket expenses, such as premiums,
deductibles and co-insurance payments. The money you save from that
can be used to pay for prescriptions, but the plans do not cover
medications specifically.
</P>
<P>
   Each program has different income requirements. Check out
``Medicaid Programs'' at
www.dhs.state.tx.us/pro-grams/Elderly/index.html or call the state
Department of Human Services at 512-438-3280.
</P>
<P>
   The only federal program that does pay for prescriptions is
Medicaid, which also is administered by states.
</P>
<P>
   For elderly and disabled Texans to qualify for Medicaid, they
also have to be eligible for Supplemental Security Income, or SSI,
or the Medicaid Nursing Program, which limits individuals' monthly
income to $1,536 and couples' to $3,072.
</P>
<P>
   Later this summer, everyone affected by the HMO withdrawal will
get a letter from their managed care company by Oct. 2. It will
detail all of the options available to you based on where you live,
your medical condition and how long you've been eligible for
Medicare. The letter should include your name and the date it was
written.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely important that you hang on to the letter and its
postmarked envelope. You may need it to prove how you lost your
coverage and when you were notified.
</P>
<P>
   HMO participants who want coverage beyond original Medicare have
two 63-day windows to change their coverage, according to state
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The clock starts ticking when you receive the letter on your
options.
</P>
<P>
   The second window opens when your HMO coverage expires on Dec.
31.
</P>
<P>
   However, at that point you may be left with fewer options, since
other HMOs may have hit their enrollment capacity by that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's best to begin gathering information now, even though we
don't know what these HMOs will be offering next year,'' says Norma
Plascencia Almanza, coordinator of a Texas Medicare benefits
counseling program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You also need to talk to your doctors to see what they plan to
do, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, adult children should check with parents living in other
Texas towns or out of state about announced HMO changes and
research options.
</P>
<P>
   Get more information on the various choices by calling the
Health Care Financing Administration at 800-633-4227 or visiting
www.medicare.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Also contact the Texas Department of Insurance at 800-252-3439
to get more local information. And call the Texas Department on
Aging at 800-252-9240 to get a booklet detailing your choices, or
visit www.aarp.org.
</P>
<P>
   If you are outraged by the predicament you have been placed in
by the HMO pullout, contact your elected representatives. Now, is
the time to let your senators and representatives know how you
feel.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: My form for presidential politics
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I stopped by my doctor's office this week for
help with an insurance form, still trying to get reimbursed for a
medical bill I paid last December.
</P>
<P>
   That was back when I last had pneumonia. The doctor cured me,
but it looks like I'm going to die of frustration waiting for the
insurance company to pay me what it owes me.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember, not so many years ago, when my medical insurance
paid off like an ATM machine. Now, the least little jot or tittle
out of place, and you are flat out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you never hear back from them. When you call to ask,
they say there's no record that you ever filed.
</P>
<P>
   They tell you to resubmit. You resubmit and then they tell you
that their records show your request had been submitted earlier.
Grrr.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I chatted briefly with my doctor. He figures me for a
Democrat. I figure him for a Republican. We get along just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you going to be covering the convention,'' he asked, his
tone a bit mischievous, ``where our next president will be
nominated?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, `yes-sir-ree, no doubt about it,' I was going to be
covering the national political convention where our next president
would be nominated.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, I told him, I'll be covering both the GOP
convention in Philadelphia and the Democratic convention in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   So it is for a journalist _ everybody's friend.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said it ought to be fun. Well, yeah, it ought to, but
I'm not so sure it will.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago I was given this piece of political advice, from
a doctor, as I recall: Party with the liberals, vote with the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   I've done it both ways over the years and, with the accumulation
of years being what it is, have just about partied out with either
party.
</P>
<P>
   My personal presidential voting record goes back to 1964, LBJ
and Goldwater. Had the voting age been 18 early on instead of 21, I
could have voted in the JFK-Nixon race.
</P>
<P>
   I would have supported Kennedy, impressed as I was by the first
of the televised presidential debates, which probably I wouldn't
have even watched except that it was a journalism class assignment
at college.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I came back to the dorm and announced to my roommates
that Kennedy would be the next president. That was one of the few
times I was right about a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Counting up, I've voted for the winner three times and the loser
six. But two of the three being Nixon, I'm not sure how I should
count those.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, to my way of thinking, was a pretty good president on the
big issues, and a really bad president on the little things.
Reagan, I would say, was just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   My only other winner was Clinton in 1992, but four years later I
was so disgusted about the China money that I gave (Bob) Dole my
vote, knowing all the while I was throwing it away.
</P>
<P>
   Gore or Bush? Don't know, haven't decided.
</P>
<P>
   I've never met Gore, not being a Buddhist nun.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bush was in his first term as governor, I sat at the
same table with him at an editors' luncheon in Austin where he
spoke. It's like most everybody says: he's as nice a guy as you'll
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Do nice guys make good presidents? I don't know. Was Carter a
good president? Was Reagan?
</P>
<P>
   So, Gore or Bush? Just tell me how which one can straighten out
my medical insurance reimbursements. Grrr.

&HT;     RANTING AGAINST THE RAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Call it ``rage rage,'' and I have a bad case of
it. Whenever a new rage comes along, I get ticked off.
</P>
<P>
   First it was road rage, and I was angry because I had written
about it for years but hadn't invented that catchy term, calling it
``car wars'' instead. Arnold Nerenberg, a psychologist in Irvine,
Calif., came up with ``road rage'' in 1997, and a ``10-step
compassion program'' to overcome it.
</P>
<P>
   The name stuck, compassion for fellow drivers didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The next rage was ``air rage,'' those cases in which airline
passengers go bonkers and abuse or attack flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   This got me mad because it seemed the fault lay with airlines
and airports, which treat passengers like prisoners of war without
a Geneva Convention. Behavior is bound to deteriorate after long
waits followed by confinement with squalling kids to the left, fat
guys in shorts to the right and trays of fatty melted matter in
front.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants have launched a campaign against air rage, but
the Federal Aviation Administration says violent incidents in the
air have declined nationally.
</P>
<P>
   The next trend was ``cell phone rage,'' in which people grab
loud talkers' cell phones and break them. That teed me off because
it seemed too rational to be called rage.
</P>
<P>
   The latest rage is ``sports rage,'' and because some idiot
hockey dad allegedly beat another hockey dad to death we all have
to read the deep insights of sports rage experts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are sports rage experts, many of them sports
psychologists. I asked a longtime sports reporter what sports
psychologists do, and he said, ``Wait by the phone for a reporter
to call.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism experts, whose phones have gone silent with the
decline of terrorist rage, might consider changing fields. After
the hockey rage death, at least one sports psychologist's phone was
ringing off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Zaichowsky, a professor of sports psychology at Boston
University and former hockey player, told the Los Angeles Times
that sports rage is similar to road rage, ``anger, mixed with an
uncontrollable need to be physical.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, you get a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York Times, Zaichowsky was quoted as saying that
parental involvement had a deleterious effect on youth sports. He
said that when he was a kid, parents were minimally involved and
now ``parents drive the kids to practice and games, and as things
have gotten more organized, the stakes are higher.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to pick on this guy for answering the phone and
stating the obvious. After all, journalists were the ones who
called him, asked the obvious questions and printed the obvious
answers.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing newspapers and television need more than
violence, it's a trend. The question to ask, at least for anyone
afflicted with rage rage, is whether the nation faces a new threat
from sports rage.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Association of Sports Officials
says their reports of violence by parents at sports events have
increased markedly in the last few years. He said the association
now offers its members assault insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the father and coach of a Little Leaguer in Florida
broke the jaw of a 13-year-old umpire. Last year a Virginia mother
slapped a 14-year-old official during a soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the cases reported. The once-celebrated soccer mom is
now feared and scorned.
</P>
<P>
   We've always known about those Little League dads, and anyone
who knows hockey knows that hockey parents can be as intense as the
sport. Now the phrase ``hockey dad'' connotes a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the stigma facing a hockey dad who happens to be a
postal worker.
</P>
<P>
   The rage phenomenon is popular because it fits everyone's
preconceptions. If you're upset by a general loss of civility in
society, the various rages provide extreme examples.
</P>
<P>
   If you dislike the automobile, airline travel or controlling
parents, you can point to rage as the natural result.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe in punishment, lawsuits, pledges, religion,
old-fashioned values or hippie non-competitiveness, you have an
answer to society's problem with rage.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, it's not clear that rage is a national problem,
at least statistically. Violent crime in all categories has
declined, and it's not even clear how much havoc has been caused by
the mother of all rages, road rage.
</P>
<P>
   The American Automobile Association says that nationally the
number of accidents caused by road rage increased from a reported
1,129 in 1990 to 1,800 in 1996, just before the term was invented.
</P>
<P>
   That's only three road rage accidents per month per state. But
the phrase ``tip of the iceberg'' comes to mind, when you consider
all the near-misses caused by anger in any one day on San Francisco
streets alone.
</P>
<P>
   We've all felt rage of the road, air or sports variety, and some
of us have felt it within ourselves. That's the appeal of rage as a
trend. We don't need a rage expert to tell us it's there.
</P>
<P>
   We certainly don't need another kind of rage. I'm getting old
and teed off, and please don't tell me about age rage.

WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT PLAYING THE TOURIST
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   As we puzzled our way through a
menu that appeared to be heavy on duck liver when all we wanted was
pommes frites, someone warned we were beginning to act like
tourists. Someone else pointed out that our cover was long blown,
seeing as how our French is not so tres hot, and one of us was
wearing socks with sandals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is that not the worst? To be in a place where you have to
apologize and hold out a handful of change for the toll taker,
don't understand the answer even if you can manage the question,
can never seem to find the toilet, take copious photos of
strangers' clotheslines, and then have someone suspect you of not
being a native?
</P>
<P>
   Friends from Michigan who joined us in France said they were
trying not to act like Fudgies. A Fudgie is what the locals call
tourists who come to their part of the state on a maniacal mission
to buy boxes of Mackinac Island fudge.
</P>
<P>
   I thought that was pretty funny and wondered what we in Northern
California might call tourists who flock to our parts.
Merlot-heads? Crabbies?
</P>
<P>
   We all decided this thing about not wanting to be taken for a
tourist must come from being lumped in with that stereotyped
out-of-towner who blows into another country and grumbles loudly
about stores closing at night and not being able to find ice for
their cooler.
</P>
<P>
   However, we agreed, were it not for us spending our tourist
dollars in another country and their people spending their tourist
francs in ours, we might all have auto factories down the street
instead of charming old inns with red geraniums at the windows.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you're adaptable, what's wrong with being taken for a
tourist? Why pretend to know it all when you don't?
</P>
<P>
   Admit you're clueless. How many stamps does a postcard to the
United States take? Where does the soap go in the washing machine?
Does the kiss-kiss greeting go left cheek-right cheek or
right-left? (Left to right.)
</P>
<P>
   As the world shrinks and the global community grows, we tourists
are reminders that there are some borders that cannot be easily
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   Where would the fun be if we all ate dinner at 6 p.m. and knew
how to adjust the shower head? If everyone's market was a Safeway
and everyone's restaurant a Red Lobster, what would be the point of
ever leaving home?
</P>
<P>
   The unknowing tourist gets to make wonderful discoveries _ apple
and gorgonzola pizza, for example _ and see how the rest of the
world dances.
</P>
<P>
   After the third day of rain we headed south toward Spain, hoping
for sun. We drove into a French town near the Spanish border and
parked near a square. A band, dressed in black pants and gold
shirts, was starting to set up.
</P>
<P>
   People had gathered and when the music began we noticed a few in
the crowd start to shuffle their feet. With pointed toes they
softly pawed at the dirt, but held back, like shy children at a
ballroom dancing class.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually many were making the same movements and they started
coming together, clasping hands overhead and forming a circle. A
woman in a go-to-church suit, a younger one in jeans and high
heels, men in berets, an occasional teen-ager. Different people
would walk up and break in, matching the dancers' feet.
</P>
<P>
   The dancers didn't shout or kick up their heels. They simply
continued their small, delicate movements and smiled at one
another. Soon almost everyone in the square was dancing, leaving
only a few to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Later we spotted three of the dancers having a beer under a
yellow umbrella and asked them to tell us what had happened out in
the square. The dance is called the Sardana, explained one woman in
French, writing the word down for me. She called it a dance of
Catalan identity, a symbol of their culture. Another said it is
about solidarity and in Spain under Franco the dance became a sort
of people's protest.
</P>
<P>
   We apologized for our poor language skills and tried to tell
them we had never seen anything so lovely, that it was so darned
moving, it begged tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans?'' they asked. We said we're from California.
Tourists. They smiled.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Back when I was so smitten with this town that
I'd weep like a long-lost lover on touching down at San Francisco
International Airport, re-entry from a road trip or vacation was
always a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where I'd been _ to the Midwest to visit family or to
London to cover the effect of IRA terrorists on British tourism _
I'd mush my forehead against the plane window, peer down as we came
in over the San Francisco Bay and remember, ``Other places really
DO make me love you best.''
</P>
<P>
   The first whiff of cool, salt air as I stepped outside of the
San Francisco airport never failed to give me a thrill. The first
few days of maneuvering around town always lulled me into the same
smug state of satisfaction:
</P>
<P>
   Lucky, clever me. I lived and worked in the greatest city in the
whole New World.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, re-entry takes time and a concerted effort.
</P>
<P>
   From the Winchester Mystery House chaos of the airport to the
horn-blowing hell drivers of downtown, it is far easier to remember
what is wrong with San Francisco _ what we don't have, have too
much of or simply aren't _ than it is to remember why my heart ever
leapt upon returning.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have to work not to focus on the negatives.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt. The incompetence. The arrogance of the young rich. The
desolation of the street-bound poor. Billboards screaming from
every available wall. The noise, the disappearing views, the
grinding traffic, the overall feeling of dangerous IMBALANCE.
</P>
<P>
   But work I do because this is my home.
</P>
<P>
   If the positives _ the natural beauty, the human kindness, the
divine diversity _ no longer come to me unbeckoned, I'm willing to
search them out.
</P>
<P>
   Often this requires just keeping my eyes open, lifting my head
out of a book on the bus or actually looking into the face of a
poorly trained but hard-working young waiter or store cashier.
</P>
<P>
   The point is to be awake for the human connection, to see the
poignancy, vitality or profundity hidden just below the surface of
the ``ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the old man on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   On my first work morning back from vacation, he called to me as
I was about to board a bus for downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask him to wait, please!'' he hollered from a half-block away.
</P>
<P>
   Working two canes, he hurried along the sidewalk in a painful
side-to-side gait. The effort seemed Herculean.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing aboard the bus, breathless, the man said, ``Eh, I've
lost my speed.'' But his smile _ radiating with good cheer and
humor _ told the real story:
</P>
<P>
   By God, he'd made it, and it was a great day.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my re-entry searches for San Francisco's positives
entail more sophisticated work.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wesla Whitfield's opening night.
</P>
<P>
   A transplant from Smalltown, USA, as so many of us are,
Whitfield has made herself a major name in the international world
of cabaret singers. When she plays New York, it's in celebrated
(and sold out) rooms like the Algonquin Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she and her husband and accompanist, Mike Greensill, always
come home to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this past week, Whitfield, Greensill and their bassist,
Ken Miller, opened a three-week run at the York Hotel's Plush Room.
The first-night crowd was filled with connoisseurs of the cream of
American standards, the songs of giants like Harold Arlen, Irving
Berlin, Jerome Kern and Cole Porter.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Whitfield delivered the goods. In spades. And, after
the show, she and Greensill moved to the hotel bar to receive
kisses, kudos and hugs from a receiving line that snaked out into
the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I can live here for 32 years and have a sort of
career and know everybody in the audience by name,'' Whitfield said
the next day. ``That wouldn't be true in any other city in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is such a tiny city, but with all the amenities
of a great big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of us, Whitfield confessed, she and Greensill
sometimes ``play this real estate game,'' picturing what kind of
mansion they could get elsewhere for the price of their Bayview
District home.
</P>
<P>
   But it's just a game. It always will be.
</P>
<P>
   Said Greensill: ``We really can't imagine living any place else
but here.''
</P>
<P>
   To which I say, ditto.
</P>
<P>
   I may not be moved to tears every time my plane lands these
days, and it may take me a little longer to remember why, but, the
truth is _ lucky, clever me; I still believe I live in the greatest
city in the whole New World.

&HT;     CITIES SHOULD TAKE LEAD BY INVESTING IN GREENER ENERGY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JERRY BROWN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ In another era, we might have expected the
federal government to advance our national security interests by
establishing America as the superpower of energy independence and
sustainability.
</P>
<P>
   Given the absence of bold ideas in Washington, the burden of
innovation must be shouldered by cities and local governments.
That's why Oakland has decided to send a message to the rest of the
country that the moment has arrived for breaking America's
addiction to fossil fuels.
</P>
<P>
   Buying foreign oil is a major contributor to our persistent and
ever-increasing trade deficit ($110 billion dollars annually).
Moreover, conventional energy production is the largest industrial
source of pollution in the world, contributing to smog, acid rain,
global climate change and a host of other environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Record high temperatures were set again last year, in what has
become an annual confirmation of the effects of global warming.
</P>
<P>
   The time for complacency is over. The city of Oakland took the
lead and has become America's largest green power city. We will
reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and will purchase 100 percent
of our electricity from sources such as geothermal steam, wind
power and biomass.
</P>
<P>
   Our $4 million annual municipal electricity budget will now be a
force for something better _ a sustainable energy future. As a
major energy consumer, Oakland is expanding the market for
renewable energy, and we're doing it quickly: By 2004, 20 percent
of our electricity will come from new renewable energy facilities
brought on-line to serve the growing demand the city is creating
for green power. Annually, Oakland consumes approximately 9
megawatts of electricity, enough to power more than 27,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Our new green-power purchases will reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by more than 20,000 tons. If Oaklanders as individuals
would join their city government in purchasing sustainable energy,
our collective CO2 reduction would exceed 150,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   For at least 25 years, it has been obvious that the world must
shift away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   When I was governor of California, an energy crisis prompted
government at the state and federal levels to offer generous energy
and conservation incentives. The president at the time, Jimmy
Carter, described the energy challenge as the moral equivalent of
war. As a result, industry responded by producing an array of new
energy technologies.
</P>
<P>
   California led the world in wind energy by producing over 90
percent of the electricity generated from that source. Now _
finally _ after years of official indifference, there are stirrings
of concern, brought on by high gasoline prices and damaging foreign
oil dependency.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, people in the San Francisco Bay Area use more and
more energy, both for electricity and transportation. Yet, what
better place in the world than Silicon Valley for taking the lead
in developing new and sophisticated forms of energy and energy
efficiency?
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in government as well as the private sector should be
doing much more. Local government could install various types of
distributed energy technologies, such as photovoltaics and fuel
cells. Companies could establish modular micro-power plants that
would create both greater efficiency and the reliability needed for
an information economy that cannot afford a millisecond of power
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Cities, as well as businesses and residents, must ask two
fundamental questions:
</P>
<P>
   First, how can we be more efficient?
</P>
<P>
   Second, how can we decrease fossil fuels by increasing purchases
of renewables to meet our continuing energy requirements?
</P>
<P>
   In the new millennium each of us must take responsibility to do
our part to cut pollution and reduce global warming. Purchasing
green power is an important first step.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     DIVERSITY SHOULD INCLUDE ASIAN-AMERICANS, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WILLIAM WONG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Norman Mineta's nomination as Commerce secretary
in the last six months of the Clinton administration was widely
hailed by Asian-American political activists. And, from a symbolic
perspective, well it should be.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, the former California congressman,
now a senior executive with defense contractor Lockheed Martin,
would become the first Cabinet member of Asian ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans have long felt politically excluded because of
past legal discrimination and relatively small numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Only now, with sharp population growth and more experience,
Asian-Americans are participating in mainstream politics in larger
numbers. This change is acknowledged by Mineta's nomination,
although it has the appearance of a political crumb.
</P>
<P>
   Mineta has long been a political pioneer _ as San Jose mayor in
the early 1970s and as a member of the House of Representatives
from 1974 to 1995. His personal story tugs at the heart. Along with
120,000 others, he and his family were locked away in U.S.
relocation camps during World War II solely because of their
Japanese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Mineta could have broken the symbolic racial barrier
eight years ago. Newly elected President Clinton offered him the
job of secretary of Transportation. Mineta turned him down because
he was in line to become chairman of the House public works and
transportation committee _ a more powerful position, he felt, than
secretary of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   His dilemma at the beginning of the Clinton administration
illustrated the paucity of experienced Asian-American political
figures at the national level.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-American candidates for possible Cabinet jobs in early
1993 were Mineta and Robert T. Matsui, another U.S. representative
from California, a Japanese-American with less seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Asian-American political activists hungered for a
Cabinet appointment, especially after Clinton said he would name a
Cabinet that ``looked like America.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mineta turned him down, Clinton filled his senior team with
white men, white women, African-Americans and Hispanics, but no one
of Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   Racial symbolism has its limits. In our multicultural democracy,
where some groups are emerging from subjugated status, racial
politics are a fact of life. But soon, underrepresented groups like
Asian-Americans should pay a lot more attention to what politicians
who look like them actually stand for and do.
</P>
<P>
   That is beginning to happen. San Francisco is a perfect example.
It is only within the past two decades that Asian-Americans have
served on that city's governing Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are three supervisors of Asian descent, but rivalries
and disagreements among the three override the symbolism of ethnic
pride. In many ways, they have gone beyond racial politics and
mostly practice politics as usual, based on ideology, personal
feelings and ego.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a few more Asian-Americans politicians _ such as
Gary Locke, the governor of Washington, and David Wu, a U.S.
representative from Oregon _ have emerged. Their high profile helps
boost the perpetually sad-sack morale of Asian-American political
activists, but symbolic value has a short half-life.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, some Chinese-Americans are chagrined that Wu, a
Democrat, opposed normal trade status for China. Chinese-American
Republicans, in lively e-mail exchanges, jabbed at Wu's stance,
which was shared by a majority of House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans are such a diverse lot that a handful of
political leaders can't be expected to represent their wide
interests and still have credibility with the 96 percent of
Americans who are not of Asian descent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The heating in my house died on a morning so raw
and foggy you'd have thought it was December. The same day, I was
at San Francisco's Public Utilities Commission when an official
spoke of brownouts rolling down from the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if the energy grid was giving up the ghost. I was a
happy guy.
</P>
<P>
   I like rusticity and fear technology to the point that I'm not
even comfortable with household electrical current. Nickel-cadmium
batteries, cell phones and microwave ovens strike me as the devil's
work. Anything atomic gives me an anxiety attack.
</P>
<P>
   Near San Luis Obispo, many miles to the south, stands the
controversial Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric co. nuclear power plant called
Diablo Canyon. Look at this domed two-unit structure the wrong way,
utility critics say, and it might go nuclear, like a mad monster of
Greek myth.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E swears the plant is safe, despite documented problems. But
the bottom line for me is the fact that if Diablo Canyon blows up,
melts down or goes sideways, it could be the equivalent of a
homicidal next-door neighbor, fallout-wise. Chernobyl comes to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E whistle-blower Neil J. Aiken of Santa Maria is my current
hero. For years, Aiken, a licensed senior reactor operator and
onetime shift foreman, has battled with his former employer over
safety issues. He says the company's bosses put profits first.
</P>
<P>
   A prime example of this unholy tradeoff, Aiken claimed in a
recent interview, are the plant's circuit breakers, about 200
sofa-sized contraptions he said assist in delivering emergency
power and some operating power to safety-related equipment.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E replaced original General Electric units with
cheaper-to-maintain foreign equipment. According to Aiken, the new
units are more likely to malfunction in an earthquake or accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have multiple failures you wouldn't have experienced
with the other circuit breakers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So convinced is Aiken of the threat, he attended a shareholders'
meeting in 1998 attempting to provide a written account of his
concerns. Aiken's report, ``Going Critical,'' which he was blocked
from distributing, described a number of potentially grave
technical problems and contained some sweeping pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   It accused the utility of ``moral mismanagement'' and a reliance
on ``defective equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E has had a simple, unequivocal response all along. It says
Aiken is paranoid _ clinically psychotic. It went so far as to hire
a psychiatrist who declared the man mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Rueger, the utility's top nuclear officer, reaffirmed that
position Monday, issuing a statement in which said that Aiken had
fared poorly on PG&AMP;E's government-mandated ``fitness for duty''
program.
</P>
<P>
   Aiken was placed on leave. His career was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It floored me,'' Aiken said. ``It's amazing the kind of
pressure a corporation can put on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Where was the Nuclear Regulatory Commission? Off somewhere
inking its rubber-stamp pad. The NRC, not state agencies, regulates
nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   An NRC investigation, the agency reported May 19, concluded that
PG&AMP;E's decision to crucify Aiken was ``not motivated by retaliation
for his having raised concerns.'' This came after the NRC had
upheld more than a third of the over 50 alleged safety violations
reported by Aiken.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government has many voices and the Labor
Department also weighed in. Unlike the NRC, it isn't in bed with
the people it regulates.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the department ruled that Aiken had been
mistreated. The utility had smeared him with ``biased and
incomplete evidence,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   He was entitled to $116,000 in back pay, legal bills and
damages. PG&AMP;E appealed, then fired Aiken.
</P>
<P>
   But the whistle-blower wasn't whipped. All the while, his 1999
lawsuit in San Francisco for wrongful termination and civil-rights
violations was wending its way through the court.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting for months, PG&AMP;E backed down, agreeing to a
settlement for an undisclosed amount. It wrote a check intended to
shut Aiken's mouth _ a big check, I suspect, because it allowed him
to retire at 55.
</P>
<P>
   Aiken says he's history now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't emphasize what was done to me,'' he asked. ``At this
point, it's about current and future employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a moral dilemma. If you have an employee who dares to
hold them accountable, there's no protection. So people are
reluctant to speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all, fortunately.

FOR TRIATHLETE SALLY EDWARDS, LAST IS BEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no telling who will win the local stage of the Danskin
Women's Triathlon Series Sunday at Lake Pearl in Wrentham, mass..
There is no doubt, however, as to who will finish last.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Edwards, a 16-time Ironman finisher, Triathlon Hall of
Fame member and pre-race training instructor, has dibs on last
place. She has run in each Danskin event since its inception in
1990, yet for six consecutive years, has seen the backside of every
finisher at each.
</P>
<P>
   It's her job. She's what folks in triathlon call a sweeper, a
designated slowpoke. She purposely finishes behind the back, and
therefore, no other runner has to put up with the dread and
embarrassment of finishing last.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacramento, Calif., resident, a Danskin national
spokesperson and one of the sport's most celebrated figures (she
has published five books on triathlon) said she got the idea of
coming in last after coming up injured before a Danskin race in New
York six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The injury didn't prevent her from running, but it figured she
would likely finish last. So she asked Danskin representatives if
she could do so officially. After years of finishing first (or
close to it), bringing up the rear gave her an entirely different
perspective on triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea of what happens in back of the pack,'' said
Edwards. ``All of those people struggling, and no one wanting to
finish last.''
</P>
<P>
   She is slated to run at Wrentham, which will be the third
installment of the seven-city series. Other cities include San
Jose, Calif.; Orlando, Fla., and Austin, Texas. More than 50,000
have competed in the women-only event since its inception. Danskin
officials say it is the only multi-sport series for amateur female
athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The race is open to participants ages 14 and older and is
structured for both first-time and experienced competitors. The
course will be a .75K swim (approximately a half-mile), a 20K bike
race (about 11 miles) and a 5K run (3.1 miles). The event is
scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Even with pre-race instructions, you're bound to have many folks
struggling to keep up with the pack. Danskin officials have
attempted to make certain those who finish last get as much
satisfaction from having completed the course as those who battle
for first (races usually take about three hours to complete).
</P>
<P>
   That's where Edwards comes in. She said among the things she
discovered in coming in last was that those at the back of the pack
continue to work as hard to finish as anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a highly competitive person,'' said Edwards. ``I've been
racing for 30 years. I've crossed hundreds of finish lines first.
And this is, without a doubt, the most deeply gratifying experience
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It is quite a difference, she said, going from competing at the
top level of triathlon to purposely running, biking, and swimming
slow. That's similar to an NBA shooting whiz participating in a
3-point shooting contest with a few amateurs and deliberately
clanking attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big believer in heart-rate monitoring,'' said Edwards.
``My heart rate never goes over 100 beats per minute during the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not physically strenuous, but emotionally it is
extremely difficult, because you're telling yourself'' you are to
finish at a pace slower than that which you're capable.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said she now races competitively only in winter and
fall. As Danskin's national spokesperson, her competitive races
cannot interfere with Danskin races, which run throughout the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the triathlon record-holder said she's stored up memorable
moments as a designated sweeper that she never would have
experienced in competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago, at the Danskin Triathlon in San Jose, there was
a woman right in front of me as we approached the finish line,''
Edwards said, ``and she asked if we could go hand in hand as we
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a large crowd which cheered us. And, the woman told
me that she was 72 years old, that she was never much of an
athlete, and that she had lost 80 pounds training for the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `This is the happiest day of my life.' When you
realize that someone has had 72 years of happiness, for that one
moment to be the happiest of her life, that's pretty moving.''

FOR ONE NIGHT, GREAT SHORTSTOP DEBATE WAS CLEAR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Derek Jeter vs. Nomar Garciaparra? In the 2000
All-Star Game, Jeter was The Man.
</P>
<P>
   New York's shortstop went 3 for 3 with two RBIs and became the
first Yankee to win the All-Star MVP Award as the American League
defeated the Nationals, 6-3, Tuesday night. Garciaparra, meanwhile,
went 1 for 2 and committed two errors in five innings at short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot,'' Jeter said when asked about the MVP award.
``With the shortstop position in the AL, you never know if you're
going to get a chance to come to an All-Star Game, never mind start
one. It's tough to win an MVP award. You never know how many
at-bats you're going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Alex Rodriguez was voted to start the game but
suffered a concussion and could not play. This forced All-Star
(Yankee) manager Joe Torre to select an alternate starter, and he
went with his guy even though Garciaparra came into the break
hitting a robust .389.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter got hits off Randy Johnson, Kevin Brown, and Al Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically had the same game plan against everyone,'' said
Jeter. ``I'm a free swinger. I think it's known around the league,
maybe both leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Jeter's first All-Star start. A-Rod has started three
times and Garciaparra narrowly won the fan vote for the Fenway game
last summer. In two prior All-Star appearances, Jeter was 0 for 2,
both strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to at least put the ball in play,'' said Jeter. ``But
when you're facing three guys like that, you want to swing early in
the count. If you fall behind, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter doubled off Johnson in the first (``I was thinking about
bunting, but Randy Johnson's not the guy to bunt off''), singled
off Brown in the third, then delivered the key hit when he stroked
a bases-loaded single to center off Leiter in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw me a cutter,'' said Jeter. ``He does it every time I
face him. I try to lay off of it. I didn't hit it well, I just hit
it in the right place. He's a tough pitcher. (Roberto) Alomar and I
were talking about it after our at-bats. He throws the ball, it
seems like it's going to go down the middle and it runs off your
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter was flawless in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get butterflies before the game,'' he said. ``It's a
situation where you have the best players in baseball here. You
want to have fun, but you also want to do well. But the No. 1
priority I think is just to come out here and give the fans a good
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said, ``I just saw Derek's parents and I know they are
really proud. He's far beyond his years in terms of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick, Torre's third shortstop alternative for the game,
appeared as a pinch hitter in the third and flied to center field.
Garciaparra replaced Jeter in the fifth inning and made an error on
a routine grounder behind Derek Lowe in the sixth inning.
Garciaparra lined to left in his first at-bat, then hit a high-hop
single over the third baseman in the American League's three-run
ninth. It was Garciaparra's first All-Star hit in five official
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the ninth, Garciaparra overthrew first base
while tossing on the run for his second error, but then started a
6-4-3 double play that ended the game. He is the first shortstop
and seventh player overall to make two errors in an All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was pretty special for me, playing in front of the
fans at Fenway and all,'' said Garciaparra. ``I know Chipper Jones
must have felt great hitting a home run in front of his home fans
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Jeter replaced Garciaparra for the start of the fourth
inning. The ceremonial transfer made for a nice photo-op and Jeter
continued the tribute by mimicking Garciaparra's home plate ritual.
Then Jeter struck out. Tuesday night, Jeter used his own routine
and played his own game and it worked out considerably better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really get to talk to Derek,'' said Garciaparra. ``He
was too busy getting a bunch of hits. But tonight I imitated him. I
got a hit.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Already a latecomer to the Internet party, the buttoned-down
denizens of the insurance industry are still struggling to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have been too busy fixing outdated computer
systems to look ahead. Others were slow to anticipate that the
industry's 1950s-era paperwork system was ripe for an Internet
overhaul _ at least as much as brokerage or banking.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the late start, it seems clear the $3 trillion
industry is in store for some seismic changes. The question is
whether the slow-and-steady approach will help or hinder.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there are two basic scenarios for the day when more
individuals and businesses shop for insurance products online. In
one, brokers become extinct, as consumers deal directly with
brand-name insurance companies or comparison-shop in e-commerce
marketplaces. Simple products such as auto or home insurance
increasingly are being bought this way.
</P>
<P>
   Others say brokers are here to stay, and that insurance
customers of all kinds need the hand-holding and advice that agents
provide. Apparently clicking lacks a certain gravitas when
contemplating one's own demise and choosing life insurance, for
example. Companywide benefits are famously complicated, requiring
broker guidance, not to mention the new annuities hybrids starting
to roll out in the boundary-blurred financial services marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   With brokers a vital part of the distribution system, the
Internet will have its biggest impact in a business-to-business
context, by cutting waste and speeding up transactions. One
Massachusetts company betting on that outcome is StarNex Inc. of
Wrentham, mass., part of a new crop of facilitators that can
organize the flow of information, cut through legendary paperwork,
and help brokers and carriers work better together.
</P>
<P>
   There are no shortage of strategists, Internet experts and fresh
business-school graduates willing to oversee the insurance
industry's new economy makeover. The problem, analysts say, has
been the insurance industry itself. Carriers are just now replacing
old computer systems, well behind brokerages and banks, and they
are behind in the online world as well.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers, meanwhile, are looking at slashed commissions,
continuing a love-hate relationship with carriers, and worried they
may yet be left out.
</P>
<P>
   True, it's the insurance business. These are not exactly wild
and crazy guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional insurance companies had their hands in the
sand as the Internet distribution of products grew,''said Louis S.
Harvey, president of Dalbar Inc., the financial services rating and
research firm. ``Within financial services, they are the last
bastion.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance transactions on the Internet are on the rise, but the
traffic is still modest. A Forrester Research Inc. report this year
found that less than 1 percent of consumers buy insurance online,
though researching insurance is very popular. Forrester predicts
that online insurance sales could reach $14 billion by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Dalbar's Harvey believes that the insurance
companies must find a way to make more efficient use of the
nation's estimated 175,000 brokers, rather than cutting them out
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the brokers the cash register doesn't ring,'' he said.
``It takes a person to deliver an inherently negative message;
every insurance product is fear-based. That has never sold
effectively without someone there to make the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The process today, though, is anything but efficient. Agents
talk with customers and get a variety of quotes from carriers, by
phone and fax. For life insurance, customers need to get a medical
examination. Perhaps 30 days later, they may put their signature on
a policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do things instantaneously now,'' said Harvey. ``That's how
we do banking, that's how we buy stocks. Insurance is still back in
the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   The current process is costly to carriers as well, with
commissions often soaking up the entire value of the first year's
premium.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no shortage of frenzied activity to change the
situation. It's just that the online insurance scene is at the
moment is profoundly confusing, with no single approach _
``disintermediation'' or otherwise _ rising to dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Currently there is a hodge-podge of insurance supermarkets such
as InsWeb, Fidelity's Insurance.com, and Quicken, and virtual
insurers such as California-based eCoverage. At John Hancock, the
shopping and research side of the equation falls to the separate
Signatory Group; John Hancock Insurance Co. sells insurance to all
distributors, Signatory and everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   StarNex, by contrast, seeks to use the Internet to make the
existing relationship between brokers and carriers more efficient,
said chief executive John Unipan. Founded in 1998, StarNex created
BrokersPortal.com ``to enable brokers and companies to transact
business and find specific information quickly,'' Unipan said.
``We're going to be the intermediary and the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Unipan acknowledges ``There has been a lot of chaos, the
beginnings of different kinds of business models maneuvering in
this space. But agents and brokers are going to be present in
substantial portion of the business for next several years _
particularly for more complicated coverages like commercial or
company benefits. So we thought that was the place to start,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those trying to disintermediate got all the press, in all
industries, but the business-to-consumer model is not taking hold
as much as predicted,'' said StarNex chief marketing officer Jim
Kerley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now insurers are trying to focus on their core business,
realizing it goes through traditional organizations. The second
wave of change may not be as glamorous because it's not as
disruptive,'' Kerley said. ``But if we can make the broker more
efficient, we can by definition make the carrier more efficient. We
want to enable the broker and the carrier to maintain a
relationship, use the Internet for efficiencies, rather than have
the Internet eliminate those relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy certainly seems wise in this summer of Internet
discontent, with business models everywhere failing to live up to
hype. And in that respect, a glacial pace may end up being the
insurance industry's best asset. At least for now.

LISTENING TO PROZAC AND THE BACKLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. announced that it had received Food
and Drug Administration approval to market Prozac under a new name,
Sarafem. It's the same antidepressant drug, but now Lilly is
encouraging doctors to prescribe it for Pre-Menstrual Dysphoria
Disorder (PMDD) a relatively new condition deemed to be an extreme
form of pre-menstrual syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment that some doctors question whether PMDD
actually exists. Forget for a moment that an English academic has
claimed that the poet Sylvia Plath killed herself because of PMDD,
which is probably bosh. That's not the point; the point is that
Lilly has achieved a cherished ``brand extension,'' and will
succeed in selling more pills.
</P>
<P>
   Prozac occupies the intersection of two primal, American
compulsions: the need to sell, and the lure of the quick fix.
That's what makes it so fascinating. Capitalizing on clever
marketing, brutal infighting, and tens of thousands of genuine
success stories, Lilly has made Prozac the symbol of Americans'
innocent desire to feel better. Twenty-eight million Americans,
many of whom are wary of psychiatry and would think twice before
taking a pill stronger than Extra-Strength Tylenol, have been
willing to give Prozac a try.
</P>
<P>
   Now Prozac is under siege. After a euphoric high in the early
1990s, patients and researchers are stepping forward to take their
whacks at Prozac and its sister drugs Zoloft, Paxil, etc. Authors
Lauren Slater, Peter Breggin, and most recently Joseph Glenmullen
of the Harvard Medical School have all described the unpleasant
underside of the little green-and-cream-colored wonder pills:
Prozac loses effectiveness over time; the drug creates painful
withdrawal symptoms; it induces sexual dysfunction, and _ the most
dramatic charge of all _ it may exacerbate depressed patients'
suicidal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, which sells over $2 billion worth of Prozac every year,
doesn't take criticism lightly. One of the most hair-raising
stories in American jurisprudence, retold in Glenmullen's new book
``Prozac Backlash,'' was Lilly's outrageous behavior in the
so-called Wesbacker trial. Several years ago, a group of plaintiffs
sought to prove that Prozac prompted a (depressed and suicidal)
pressman named Joseph Wesbacker to kill eight people and himself in
a ``postal'' rampage with an AK-47 in Kentucky. Similar lawsuits
were pending, and Lilly could afford neither a negative verdict,
nor the stigma of a public settlement. So they secretly offered the
plaintiffs what one lawyer called a ``mind-boggling'' sum, in
return for arguing a weaker case. Lilly got its not-guilty verdict,
but when its machinations came to light, a Kentucky appellate judge
opined that ``the system has been tampered with,'' perhaps the
understatement of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be realistic. Glenmullen is selling something, too. He
hasn't researched the effects of Prozac, he's merely assembled some
of his own case studies and critiqued the work of others. (Breggin,
the author of ``Talking Back to Prozac'' has accused Glenmullen of
ripping him off.) Not only is Glenmullen successfully pushing this
book, he's simultaneously hawking a collection of his own patients'
sexual fantasies, called ``Sexual Mysteries,'' on his Web site. One
of the case studies concerns ``a patient's powerful sexual feelings
for her therapist.'' Gives pause, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the current spate of bad publicity for Prozac
coincides with Lilly's multimillion-dollar reformulation and
re-launch of the product. The old Prozac/Sarafem patent is
expiring, so much of the damage inflicted on the brand will be
visited upon rival drug companies hawking a cheaper, generic
Prozac. Meanwhile Lilly will be busy promoting the as-yet-unnamed
``new, improved'' Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly rarely acknowledges the alleged shortcomings of Prozac,
except to say _ correctly, I think _ that critics have exaggerated
the drug's known side effects. Yet, as it happens, Lilly's patent
filing for Prozac II says the new drug will reduce such side
effects as nervousness, anxiety, insomnia, and ``suicidal
thoughts.'' Just a coincidence? Psychiatrists are very skeptical
about coincidences, and so am I.

IN THE US, A CHANCE FOR REFUGE FOR SUDANESE BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are known as the lost boys, several thousand young Sudanese
men who have spent their adolescences on the run, fleeing war,
famine, and slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to officials at the State Department and the US
Catholic Conference, the US government will soon admit most of the
young Sudanese men as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church, which runs the largest refugee resettlement
program in the country, will help many find a home in several
American cities.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the past decade, these young men, children of two
tribes of Sudanese cattle herders, have been orphaned and wounded,
forced into military service and involuntary labor, and shuttled
from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 to 4,000 young men are victims of one of the world's
most prolonged conflicts, a 17-year religious war that produced a
humanitarian crisis described as the worst in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   The men are expected to be one of the most challenging groups
encountered by resettlement officials because of their disrupted
childhoods. Most of them spent years without any semblance of the
social structure imposed by adults. They have had little education,
they have had no exposure to urban life, and they will be moving to
cities without large communities of Sudanese immigrants who might
ease their transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is going to be different because, unlike a Cuban
refugee or a Bosnian refugee, they're going to come here with zero
English, zero work skills, and most of them will find a doorknob a
fascinating technological gadget because they come from a very
primitive rural milieu,'' said Joseph Doolin, president of Catholic
Charities in Boston. ``But we believe that everyone has the
intrinsic right to a decent life, and as part of an international
organization _ the church _ we work to improve the opportunities
and the life that individuals have.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has been engulfed in civil war between the Muslim north
and the Christian and animist south for 17 years, during which more
than 2 million people have died, mostly from starvation, and
another 4.5 million have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
   The US government and human rights groups have accused the
Islamic party, which seized power in the Sudan in 1989, guilty of
supporting terrorism and committing genocide through massacres,
slavery, and ``calculated starvation,'' by eliminating sources of
food and then preventing access to aid.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian crisis in the Sudan is arguably the world's
most dire. Representative Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey
Republican, said last month that the situation in the Sudan ``may
well be the most widespread, systematic, and brutal crimes against
humanity being committed anywhere in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a State Department official who asked not to be
identified, the Sudanese men are mostly members of the Dinka and
Nuer peoples, ethnic groups who live along the Nile in southern
Sudan and have an economy based on cattle herding. The young men,
many of whom are orphans, fled Sudan to avoid forced conscription
or slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The men spent the late 1980s in Ethiopia, were expelled by that
country back to Sudan, and eventually fled to Kenya, where they
have been living in a refugee camp since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the boys, based on what they have gone
through, have no prospects for returning back to where they came
from,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has agreed to consider for resettlement most
of the Sudanese young men, based on a recommendation by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and is now beginning to
conduct interviews to make sure those recommended are eligible and
do not pose a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Once they arrive in the United States, perhaps beginning this
year, they will be cared for by one of 10 resettlement agencies, of
which the Catholic Church is the largest. Since 1975, the Catholic
Church has resettled about 800,000 refugees in the United States,
about one-third of all refugees during that period, according to
Marie Quinlan, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The largest groups of refugees have been from Vietnam and other
parts of southeast Asia, from Bosnia and other parts of eastern
Europe, and from Cuba and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Charities in Boston resettles about 300 refugees each
year, including a small handful of Sudanese refugees over the last
several years. The agency, using mostly federal funds, houses,
feeds and trains refugees, with a goal of providing them the
language, work and life skills so they can live on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been lost boys for their entire childhoods,
wandering around on foot, avoiding bombs and bullets and also
avoiding being drafted into one army or another, and once they got
situated they kind of established their own little family units,''
said Claire Carroll, director of refugee and immigration services
for Catholic Charities of Boston. ``Our goal will be to help them
become completely self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Sudanese are thought to be Catholic, but the church
resettles refugees regardless of religious affiliation and does not
use its refugee resettlement programs for proselytization,
according to church officials.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist on international issues who recently visited Sudan
lauded the effort to bring the refugees to the United States, but
said the world must do more to help end the civil war there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got millions of displaced people, it's easy to say
that taking a few thousand people out isn't very important, but
then you'd end up doing nothing,'' said Elliott Abrams, chairman of
the US Commission on International Religious Freedom. ``Ultimately,
this can't be the main answer, because you can't take all those
displaced people out of the country, but if you ask, `Where is the
leadership of tomorrow's Sudan?' maybe among those 3,000 to 4,000
boys who are now going to get an education you'll find it.''

WEB ADVENTURES; THE SELF-MADE MAN BEHIND `SURVIVOR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PRAGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many parts of Marc Andreessen's past are almost cliche by now,
but when he was doing it, it was brand new. He was one of those
superyoung Internet savants who helped created something
(Netscape), got bought out (by AOL), made millions, and then fell
off the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   But as evidenced by his prominence in two tech magazines now on
newsstands, including as Wired's cover boy for August, Andreessen,
29, is back, and with business plan that is wholly untypical of the
times: He's in it for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   As Wired writer David Sheff explains it, Andreessen and his
comrades at Loudcloud were casting about for the next great
computer breakthrough and thought they'd found it, only to be
beaten to market while they assembled the nuts and bolts to support
it.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that it could easily happen again, they decided to create
a generic framework first, and then just plug in their idea when
they got it. And that's when they got it: They would be the ones to
help others get to market quickly; they would tend to the Web, and
their customers could stick to their knitting.
</P>
<P>
   That in itself is no big deal; plenty of people provide Web
hosting. What Loudcloud offers, Sheff explains, is greater
automation, embodied in Opsware, software that enables Loudcloud
``to put up a new Web site with a keystroke or two.'' To an
ordinary end user, that seems very nice but not exactly rocket
science, but analysts say it could all be very big.
</P>
<P>
   What's unmistakeably revolutionary in this economy's
built-to-flip atmosphere is Loudcloud's approach to building a
company, covered not only in Wired but in a Red Herring ``case
study,'' essentially a short essay by Andreessen. He says he wants
to build something lasting, to be able ``to look back and realize
that I was at the creation of something great.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of his method is to place import on every hire, driven by
his Law of Crappy People, which holds that the worst employee hired
at any level becomes the standard for that level. Loudcloud's ninth
employee was a recruiter, and the emphasis on personnel continues:
Employees are reviewed _ and get to review their supervisors _
every 90 days, because ``these days, who can even remember what
happened six or nine months ago?'' cofounder and CEO Ben Horowitz
says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another, quite different man-of-the-moment is Mark Burnett, the
arrogant cuss behind ``Survivor,'' CBS's
sort-of-but-not-really-reality show burning up the summer airwaves.
He is profiled in the July/August National Geographic Adventure,
which initially seems an odd place to read about a TV producer, but
it quickly begins to make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s, writes Gretchen Reynolds, he has been
leading the charge for what is being touted as ``the faster-growing
team sport in America,'' adventure racing, in which competitors who
are plopped down in some outrageous environment compete to return
to civilization first.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett brings to mind Pete Rose, admirable for his hard work
and accomplishment but not particularly likeable. He came to the
States nearly penniless 18 years ago, not well educated, skilled
only in what he learned as a British commando, and knowing only one

   But within six hours, he says, he had been hired as a nanny, and
within four years, Reynolds writes, had ``married a pretty blonde,
had a son, then another, and bought a big house not far from where
he used to babysit.'' Then he attended a course given by the
motivational Merlin Tony Robbins, he says, and the world became his
playground.
</P>
<P>
   His success has spawned, or released, a grating imperiousness.
Asked, for example, about his charges on ``Survivor,'' he is
contemptuous: ``Too bad the folks on the show couldn't really make
it on their own. We're going to have to give them rice and things
to keep them going. They'd die otherwise. From where I sit, there's
only one person I know of who could survive on the island on his
own. Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Surviving alone, of course, is the only way he could do it: If
he were on the show, he'd be quickly voted off so the others didn't
have to put up with him.

<P>
   Brill's Content for August brings the very best sort of tale
that the media criticism magazine can hope to offer, the story
behind the now-famous photo of Elian Gonzalez's being taken from
the home he'd been staying in in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Amy Bach, Steven Brill, and Julie Scelfo, the account
profiles the photographer, Alan Diaz, and explores the very murky
ethical currents that led to Diaz's being inside the house at the
moment of the government's raid. It is sympathetic but questioning,
and fittingly for a picture painted in shades of gray, draws no
firm conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Some elements of the story are not contended. Diaz is a
hard-working Cuban-American who came to photojournalism as a
vocation more than as a calling. Also not in contention is that his
doggedness is a primary reason he got the access he did; it's the
other reasons that present the difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for journalists to develop relationships with
subjects during a long-term story, especially when, as Diaz was
doing, they camp outside the subjects' house for weeks on end. But
even from afar, it's not always clear when that relationship has
compromised a journalist's objectivity, and that is Brill's
Content's chief question:
</P>
<P>
   By getting close enough to the family to win their trust, did
Diaz cease being an impartial observer? There's no doubt that,
given the chance, any photographer or reporter would have accepted
an invitation to be inside when the action went down, and anyone
would have been proud to capture the image.
</P>
<P>
   Judgments about how Diaz came to be there will continue, and
ultimately will determine whether the photo deserves a place in the
pantheon of great photojournalism, or is merely propaganda.

BILLY GONSALVES WAS NOT JUST A HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE IN SOCCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soccer has emerged as the most popular participant sport in the
United States. Its national teams consistently qualify for World
Cup finals and the country has a credible, if unambitious,
professional league.
</P>
<P>
   All this seems to be a recent, burgeoning phenomenon, devoid of
roots. But in fact, those roots were on the way to being
established and soccer was thriving before the Great Depression,
when the American Soccer League was the highest-paying league in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The ASL imported most of its players from Europe, offering
financial and/or political sanctuary, but soon began producing
homegrown talent, enough by 1930 that the US national team reached
the semifinals of the first World Cup in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   And the best of those young Americans was an inside right
halfback from Fall River, Mass. named Adelino ``Billy'' Gonsalves,
considered the greatest native-born player in US soccer history.
Gonsalves was nicknamed ``The Babe Ruth of Soccer,'' though had he
chosen differently he might have become ``The Pele of Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Gonsalves displayed a unique combination of
composure, strength, and staying power. His skills were recognized
internationally and he attracted offers from the best teams in both
baseball and soccer, which were then the only viable professional
sports on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Gonsalves is probably the only person ever to be offered
contracts by Brazilian (Botafogo), Italian (Roma, Lazio), and
Scottish (Celtic, Rangers) clubs, as well as the New York Yankees,
who wanted to sign him as a pitcher, and the St. Louis Cardinals,
who projected Gonsalves as a first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Gonsalves chose the World Cup over the World Series, a decision
that relegated him to the fringes of the sporting scene
domestically but allowed him to be a part of international history.
</P>
<P>
   On July 13, 1930, Gonsalves was a 21-year-old in the starting
lineup as the US defeated Belgium, 3-0, in the first World Cup game
ever, at the Parc Central Stadium in Montevideo. Four days later, a
20-year-old from Fall River named Bert Patenaude converted the
World Cup's first hat trick as the US blanked Paraguay, 3-0. In the
semifinal game in the new 100,000-capacity Estadio Centenario,
Argentina virtually disabled three US players. Center back Raphael
Tracy departed with a broken leg in the first half, and since no
substitutes were allowed, Gonsalves took Tracy's position as the
team continued with 10 players in a 6-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The US was awarded third place on goal differential over
Yugoslavia, and the future seemed bright for American soccer. But
the Depression devastated the ASL, and Gonsalves and his peers fell
into a sort of limbo, fending for themselves in semiprofessional
situations and gathering for what would be a final appearance on
the international stage at the 1934 World Cup in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the demise of the ASL and the US national program,
Gonsalves would transcend his time. In end-of-the-century ratings
by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics
of Wiesbaden, Germany, Gonsalves was No. 6 among players in North
America, the only US player in the all-time top 10.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gonsalves was born Aug. 10, 1908, in Portsmouth, R.I., the son
of immigrants from the Madeira Islands. He grew up in the
Portuguese section of Fall River and learned soccer from the
British, who were considered the masters of the sport. The lively
Fall River club soccer scene honed the skills of dozens of
top-flight players, starting a tradition that continued until
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In this cauldron of competition, teeming with seasoned pros from
Europe, Gonsalves passed his first tests as a teenager. He moved to
East Cambridge at age 18 and won the Boston and District League
with Lusitania Recreation, then became the youngest player to sign
with the Boston Wonder Workers, making his First Division debut in
a 3-0 win over the New York Giants Sept. 10, 1927.
</P>
<P>
   The Wonder Workers won the ASL championship, taking a 4-2
victory over the New Bedford Whalers at Battery Park June 16, 1928.
Gonsalves would win two more ASL titles with the Fall River
Marksmen and eight US Open Cup championships (a record he shares
with longtime teammate Alec McNab).
</P>
<P>
   But Gonsalves's most famous accomplishments were with the US
national team.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1930 World Cup, the US team toured Brazil, taking a
4-3 win over Santos, and the players later boasted that they had
defeated Pele's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1934 World Cup, Gonsalves was established as the US' most
dominant player. When the US traveled to Rome for the finals,
though, Gonsalves threatened to leave the team unless Aldo ``Buff''
Donelli was in the starting lineup. Coach Elmer Schroeder obliged
and Donelli, who later played and coached in the National Football
League, scored all the US goals in a 4-2 win over Mexico and a 7-1
loss to Italy in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   As Gonsalves performed on the World Cup stage, interest from
foreign clubs poured in.
</P>
<P>
   Recalled US defender Peter Pietras in ``US Soccer vs. the
World'' by Tony Cirino: ``For Gonsalves there were representatives
from many teams in our hotel all the time. He refused all the
offers. He would say there's no place like home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonsalves later regretted declining the offers, which were worth
as much as $10,000 plus expenses, a house, and bonuses for wins and
ties. He was well-compensated in the ASL, and he later remained in
demand, playing until 1953 as leader of teams as diverse in their
ethnicity as Brooklyn Hispano, Hakoah All-Stars, Kearny Scots,
Newark Germans, and St. Louis Shamrocks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gonsalves carried on a low-profile existence in Kearny,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Gonsalves married Mary McNab, the former wife of his teammate,
Alex McNab, who had been a Scottish national team player. The
couple did not have children, but Gonsalves did play on a team with
one of his stepchildren. Gonsalves died in Kearny July 17, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `He was ahead of his time,'' recalled his niece, Judith
Mitchell, who lives in Fall River. ``He was playing soccer when it
was not that popular in this country. He was looked up to, revered,
by a lot of people but if you met him you would never have known
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him as very charismatic, with movie star looks. He
always wore a straw hat and polo shirt. He was powerful-looking,
warm, outgoing, with a sense of humility. He didn't make that much
money playing soccer, but for him that wasn't an issue. He was
doing what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, many of Gonsalves's greatest feats occurred in
baseball stadia. On May 30, 1931, he scored a hat trick for the New
York Yankees' soccer team in a 4-3 victory over Scottish Cup
champions Celtic at Fenway Park. Legendary Celtic manager Willie
Maley called this ``the greatest performance I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   He was powerfully built (estimates of his size range from 5 feet
11 inches to 6 feet 1 inch and from 185 to 210 pounds) with a
strong shot (among his nicknames was ``Ol' Piano Legs'') and,
apparently, a strong throwing arm.
</P>
<P>
   Among Gonsalves's teammates was goalkeeper Johnny Reder, who
also played first base for the Red Sox. Gonsalves recalled a tour
to Mexico in which his team not only won in soccer but also
defeated the Mexicans in a baseball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to place Gonsalves's accomplishments in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of his peers say he was the best,'' said Colin Jose,
historian for the National Soccer Hall of Fame in Oneonta, N.Y.
``But there are no films of him playing, so it is hard to say. You
can't really go by stats, like in baseball, but I would say he was
one of the great American sportsmen. But like a lot of soccer
people, he gets lost in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were a young player today, he would probably be playing
in Europe. They say he was offered contracts in Europe, but he
didn't go. You have to play at the top level to develop your
skills, and when Gonsalves was playing I don't think anybody else
was paying what they were paying in the ASL.''
</P>
<P>
   The program for the May 14, 1944, US Open Cup final at the Polo
Grounds, which would be Gonsalves's eighth and final title, noted:
``Gonsalves is without any shadow of a doubt the greatest player in
the game today, with the most terrific shot in history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always regarded Bill Gonsalves as the closest thing we
saw to the ideal, complete player,'' the St. Louis Dispatch's Dent
McSkimming said in the '70s. ``As a reporter, I always asked the
foreign players the inevitable question, and in total they agreed
that Gonsalves would win a place and be a star in any team in the
world.''

LOW-YIELD PORTFOLIO LACKS A FIXED-INCOME SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We hope to retire in two years and expect $40,000 to be a
comfortable retirement income. What do you think of the feasibility
of retirement with no part-time work?
</P>
<P>
   D.A., Concord, N.H. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Certainly there will be plenty of assets on hand to supply
your target income, but delivering it from your portfolio will
require some adjustments. My tally of the actual yield _ estimating
that your cash investments will average 5 percent _ comes to a
little more than $12,000, with your money market and savings
accounts, the DPL holding, and Janus Balanced being the only
investments providing a significant income stream. Most of the rest
yield less than 1 percent. Average yield for the entire portfolio
is less than 1.9 percent. While the portfolio is nicely designed
for long-term growth, I suggest that in the next two years you
gradually build a real fixed-income side to the portfolio. You now
have $297,000 in 10 funds that are focused primarily on large-cap
domestic stocks.
</P>
<P>
   By the time you retire, I'd like to see about $100,000 in a
fixed-income portfolio. If you were to divert all of your current
yields in the next two years to such investments, you would need to
move only about $74,500 from the stock funds to the fixed-income
side to reach that goal. I would take all of that sum from the
various domestic stock funds, timing your sale of shares in the
funds you now hold so as to minimize the tax effect _ probably best
achieved by selling $25,000 worth of stock fund shares in each of
tax years 2000, 2001, and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   There are many solid fixed-income funds. My suggestion would be
a three-legged portfolio, such as putting half of the fixed-income
money in Vanguard GNMA, and a quarter each in Vanguard Short-Term
Bond fund and Vanguard High-Yield Corporate bond fund. Almost every
major fund family has similar offerings. You should expect a yield
of about 6.5 percent from this segment of the portfolio, raising
your overall income stream to nearly $18,000 in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Other than making that move, I think you have a nicely designed
portfolio which should supply the income you will need in
retirement and provide plenty of growth of principal, to keep pace
with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have no investments, but plan to ``max out'' contributions
to my company's 401(k) plan when I begin participating in the near
future. After the real estate sale, I plan to apply $100,000 toward
the purchase of a house and invest $500,000. I would then retire
when my investments would be able to yield $50,000 in today's
buying power. How do you suggest I proceed, and when can I retire?
I'm willing to accept moderate risk. I plan to speak to a financial
planner eventually, but I would like your suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   P.L., Bridgeton, Maine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, you could probably retire fairly comfortably in 10
years, but I like the numbers much better if you considering
waiting 12 years, when you will be 50 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the math: If you contribute to your 401(k) at a $10,500
annual rate, and if all of your investments average 10 percent
annual returns, you would have $1,532,563 after 10 years. To
maintain a lifestyle that now costs $50,000 a year, you would need
$70,592 if inflation averages 3.5 percent for that decade. If you
calculate that a fixed-income portfolio will yield you 6.5 percent,
you would thus need a bit less than $1.1 million to provide your
income stream, leaving you with only about $430,000 in growth
vehicles that could protect you against the inflation of the later
years of your retirement.
</P>
<P>
   That may seem like a lot of extra money, but bear in mind that
inflation can really gnaw away at your resources, and retiring at
age 48 is very early retirement; the earlier you retire, the more
protection against inflation you will need. After the first decade
of your retirement, you would need $99,489 a year to maintain your
lifestyle. A decade further along, the figure would be $140,339. So
I would like to see a bigger buffer fund.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow the same projection for 12 years, you would have a
$1,893,677 accumulation and you would need $75,553 to maintain your
current lifestyle. A fixed-income portfolio of $1,175,000 would do
the trick, which would leave you with $718,677 to put in
growth-oriented investments to protect you against future
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea to approach a financial planner on this,
especially if you can find a planner whose long suit is tax
expertise. Obviously with such large projected accumulations, taxes
will be a problem, and you will want to take advantage of the many
routes available to defer taxation. Depending on whether your
employer will provide matching funds, you might find that your
overall tax situation would be improved by diverting $2,000 a year
from the 401(k) contributions to a Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   If I were to suggest a portfolio that's likely to deliver this
growth, I'd look at a portfolio dominated by Vanguard index funds.
You might consider putting half of your money into Vanguard Index
500 fund, then dividing the remainder evenly among Vanguard Mid-Cap
Index, Vanguard Small-Cap Index, Vanguard Health Care, and Vanguard
International Growth funds.
</P>
<P>
   Would such a portfolio represent ``some degree of moderate
risk''? In truth, no. It would probably be better characterized as
having a normal degree of risk for a long-term investor. If you
wanted to ratchet the risk level downward, you might consider 35
percent in Vanguard Index 500, 30 percent in Vanguard Balanced
Index, 10 percent each in Vanguard Mid-Cap, Small-Cap and
International Growth funds, and 5 percent in Vanguard Health Care
funds. But if you did that, you should also expect that portfolio
growth would be a bit slower than what is projected above.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What would happen If I had a capital gain of about $500,000
from selling long-term stock holdings now? How and when would be
the best time to send estimated tax payments to the IRS? How long
can I delay without being penalized?
</P>
<P>
   S.D., Andover, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a problem that you might want to take to a tax
professional. The editors of ``J. K. Lasser's Your Income Tax, 2000
edition,'' are not easily daunted by tax complexities, but they
warn that penalties on underpayment of the estimated tax payments
may be eliminated or reduced only by using a method called the
annualized income installment method. They then add, ``The
computation is complicated and its use may be discouraged by the
complexity, despite the potential benefits.'' I don't know about
you, but when J. K. Lasser is daunted by tax complexities, I am
daunted as well.
</P>
<P>
   If you use the normal method of calculating estimated tax
payments, the rules call for equal payments of your tax liability
on April 17, June 15, Sept. 15, and Jan. 15 (although you can wait
until Jan. 31 if you file your completed return and pay the tax due
by that date).
</P>

but of course if the market should take an adverse turn during the

sold now.

   ATLANTA _ They did it. It took more than 60 years, but Major
League Baseball finally succeeded in sapping all significance out
of the All-Star Game. The hardball elements that made the midsummer
game special have been officially eliminated from the festival.
</P>
<P>
   How do we tell today's kids that baseball's All-Star Game used
to be a really big deal? In not-so-long-ago days, baby boomer ball
fans actually anticipated the clash and cared which team won. In
Boston, we took pride in being American League People. There was
great mystery about the National League, and the July joust
provided a rare view of that other league. The National League's
eight-game winning streak (1963-70) really hurt, and it was great
to see Reggie Jackson lead the AL back to victory in Detroit in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   There were quintessential American League guys like Al Kaline,
Carl Yastrzemski, Brooks Robinson, and Luis Tiant. And there were
National League guys like Stan Musial, Ernie Banks, Joe Morgan, and
Sandy Koufax. It was a big deal when Frank Robinson came to the
Orioles from the Reds because he was a National League-type player.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's all neutralized or diluted. Two distinct factions have
merged into one body, governed by a powerful, all-inclusive Players
Association. Baseball is like football, basketball, and hockey.
There's no identity to either league. No mystery, either. Free
agency, cable TV, and interleague play have combined to strip the
thrill of a once-a-summer meeting of American and National League
All-Stars. Players change teams every hour, the Mets play games
against the Yankees, and you can watch every player every day on TV
if you've got a big dish and nothing but time.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, a Hall of Famer who played all but one of his big league
seasons in the National League, said, ``I think of myself as a
National League player. There was always an identity, and I think
that's what made the All-Star Game special. A lot of things have
changed. Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr. are now National League
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be an identity, I really believe that. I believe
that fans should say, `This is a National League player' and `This
is an American League player.' And that way I think the All-Star
Game would stay where it deserves to be. We've definitely lost some
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, a veteran of 51 years in baseball, said, ``I think a
lot of things are different today. Years ago, you knew every player
and you knew 'em for seven straight years. Today, they bounce
around so much, you don't know one player from another. Players
change around so much today, it's hard to remember what league
you're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Winfield was honorary captain of the American League team.
That's Dave Winfield, who played in four All-Star Games for the
National League. Like so many other modern players, Winfield played
long stints in both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Winfield said, ``They change so much today, you can't really say
that he's an American Leaguer or a National Leaguer. I'm a good
example. I had six teams, two leagues, two countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans could hardly be wowed by the sight of Atlanta
Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga, the NL starting first
baseman. Boston fans saw Galarraga homer at Fenway last Friday
night. They also saw Chipper Jones, Andruw Jones, and Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really a proponent of interleague play,'' said
American League (Yankees) manager, Joe Torre. ``I think it takes a
little bit away from the All-Star Game. I guess we're going to have
to change with the times and understand. But I think it takes a
little bit away.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig, who would deny that today is Wednesday
if he thought the admission might hurt his sport, countered with,
``This is still the National League vs. the American League. I
don't think we should even consider changing the format. It's
wonderful and we're not going to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Bud. But how are kids supposed to identify with the alleged
rivalry? Griffey played for eight AL All-Star teams. This year,
Junior plays in the Senior Circuit. But he still plays games in
American League ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson _ the man who hit the monstrous homer off the
transformer in Detroit for the American League 29 years ago _
agrees with Selig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an American Leaguer and that's important to me,'' said
Reggie. ``But our All-Star Game is still the best one. I know this
argument goes to the idea of interleague play. Well, I wish there
was interleague play when I played. I wish I could have played
against Morgan, Rose, Bench, and Perez. I never played in Atlanta.
I never played against Willie Mays or Clemente. I never got to face
Bob Gibson and I would have loved it and I don't see anything wrong
with it. As a fan, I want to see good players.''
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of good players on display at Turner Field.
But there was no league identity. Next year they should just wait
till game time and choose up sides. Or do what hockey does and have
American-born players against the rest of the world. American
League vs. National League means nothing anymore.

PEGASYSTEMS WRESTLES WITH ACCOUNTING DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do some battles spin out of control and take on costly lives
of their own?
</P>
<P>
   The dispute in question involves Pegasystems Inc., the
Cambridge, Mass. software company, and a large chunk of the public
accounting world. It began years ago over a mistake involving
comparatively small change and has since exacted a huge toll on
everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   No one has suffered more than Alan Trefler, the brainy and
generally affable founder of Pegasystems who owns more than 70
percent of the company's stock. We've documented the rise of his
personal stock fortune, approaching $700 million at one point, and
numbing paper losses of about $500 million suffered in a period of
months. How's that for motivation?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who happened to stop by the Pegasystems annual meeting in
Cambridge two weeks ago would have witnessed a shareholder
ratification of the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche as its new
independent auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, Arthur Andersen had informed Pegasystems
that it would decline to stand for reelection as the company's
outside accountant. In other words, Arthur Andersen was dumping its
client.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever friction exists between Pegasystems and Arthur Andersen
(there is no reference to any specific dispute in public documents
on the subject), it surely must pale in comparison to the company's
long-running animus toward yet another big accounting firm, Ernst &AMP;
Young.
</P>
<P>
   Though the event that first sparked their dispute occurred
nearly three years ago, Pegasystems has recently filed a new
lawsuit against Ernst &AMP; Young alleging malpractice, business
defamation, and breach of fiduciary duty, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of both Pegasystems and Ernst &AMP; Young declined
to talk about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute involves ``revenue recognition,'' a bugaboo in the
software world a few years ago and certain bait for US Securities
and Exchange Commission officials on a campaign against dubious
accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding when a software company can count revenue in its
financial statements isn't as easy as it sounds. Many companies
have had to restate their results after they had been published,
usually because software can involve licensing deals and other
complicated business arrangements that must be recorded gradually
over time.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those companies took their hit and moved on, even
the ones that were saddled with shareholder class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
   Pegasystems didn't just fall into the revenue recognition trap
once. A year after the first problem, it again had to restate some
of its financial results over similar issues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Pegasystems continues to face two separate shareholder
class-action suits and has publicly acknowledged a formal SEC
investigation of its accounting for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   In routine company documents, Pegasystems has warned that it may
have to pay ``substantial damages or settlement costs'' to make the
civil suits go away. The company also concedes that past events and
the bad publicity that followed has hurt demand for its products
and services.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to the latest round of litigation, the
Pegasystems suit against Ernst &AMP; Young. Perhaps its just bad blood,
or part of a broader blame-game legal strategy, or even just
another example of the trendy pattern of companies suing their
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Pegasystems lays out in detail its version of who said and did
what when it came to the decision to record $5 million in revenue
from a licensing agreement with sometimes-competitor First Data
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   That's the really amazing part of the entire Pegasystems story:
Hundreds of millions of dollars in stock market value vaporized and
lawyers were set loose over how much of a $5 million deal could be
recognized at one time.
</P>
<P>
   It was a function of the high prices investors put on popular
tech stocks and how quickly they abandoned those momentum stocks at
the first hint of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Pegasystems and Ernst &AMP; Young argued in public about who was
responsible for the company's first gaffe from the very start,
which is unusual, and the accounting firm quit the account.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Pegasystems had recovered most of its lost stock
value, but was struggling again with accounting issues. The
eventual second restatement was no disaster, but Pegasystems had
burned through whatever confidence remained in the company's stock
and it hit rock bottom in fall 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Pegasystems' stock staged a comeback during the hot
technology stock market early this year, only to get hammered down
again in the spring. It's stayed down ever since _ closing Tuesday
at $5, off 12.5 cents _ and we can only wonder how much it hurts to
have all that baggage in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck, Deloitte &AMP; Touche.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 7 p.m. on the corner of Ocean Avenue and Santa Monica
Boulevard _ about as hot an address as there is in Santa Monica,
California. The evening is indigo, streaked with magenta rays from
a sunset over the Pacific, just across the street, beyond the
palms, beyond the beach. You're in this hip sushi bar, Roku, where
they charge, like, 15 bucks for two pieces of raw fish. You've
ordered your margarita on the rocks, with salt. ``What kind of
tequila would you like?'' asks the ponytailed waiter with the
gorgeous tan. You fumble, trying to come up with an answer that
won't make you sound like a complete hayseed, but the only thing
that comes to mind is: clear. Clear tequila. You idiot! You get
some help from the guy sitting next to you. But not much. ``What's
that stuff?'' Peter Farrelly asks the waiter. ``That expensive
stuff?''
</P>
<P>
   The waiter nods his head sagely and replies: ``Patron.''
</P>
<P>
   It's settled. The margarita will come with Patron tequila. Peter
Farrelly is drinking a beer, and his brother, Bobby, the other half
of the hot movie-making duo, is sitting across from you, sipping a
glass of cabernet. Next to him is Jack Black, the actor who, in
your mind at least, stole the show in ``High Fidelity,'' which,
happily, you had seen just the week before. Now, the Farrellys are
trying to talk him into working on one of their upcoming movies. In
walks a tall guy talking into a cell phone _ he must be 6 feet 5 _
and your margarita glass freezes in place, halfway to your lips.
Black, bless his heart, waves him over to your table.
</P>
<P>
   You want to say to Robbins: ``I loved you in 'Bob Roberts.'
'Bull Durham' is my alltime favorite baseball movie. 'The Shawshank
Redemption' was brilliant. 'Arlington Road' was mesmerizing.'' But
you bite your tongue and offer him a plate of half-eaten raw tuna
instead. Robbins hands his cell phone to Black. ``Sue wants to talk
to you,'' he says. That would be Susan Sarandon, his partner, the
mother of his children. You want to say, ``My friends and I loved
her in 'Thelma and Louise.' My daughter and I thought she was
amazing in 'Anywhere but Here.' My sister and I cried over
'Stepmom.''' But you bite your tongue and take a big gulp of your
margarita.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins shakes the Farrellys' hands. ``I'm a big fan,'' he says,
grinning. Boston comes up in the conversation. ``You're from the
Boston area?'' he asks the Farrellys. ``That's sane.'' He talks
about growing up in Greenwich Village, the son of a folk singer.
Although the Farrellys grew up near Providence, they have lived in
Duxbury for several years. Peter recently moved to Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Peter gets around to describing ``Ringer,'' the movie he and
Bobby are pitching to Jack Black, and the table explodes with
laughter. It's the story of a regular guy who poses as a mentally
retarded athlete in order to fix the Special Olympics. It's totally
un-PC _ and totally hilarious. The Farrellys didn't write it, but
they plan to produce it. ``You mean I gotta play a retard?'' asks
Black.
</P>
<P>
   Several plates of sushi later, the party breaks up. The Robbins
brothers head in one direction, the Farrelly brothers in another.
``I love the Farrellys, and you can quote me,'' Tim Robbins tells
me. A few steps later, Peter quips: ``He may have been lying.''
Another few steps and they bump into Brett Harrelson, Woody's
brother. Woody was the star of ``Kingpin,'' the Farrellys' second
movie; he played a bowler with a rubber hand. Later, after
Harrelson has climbed into his new BMW convertible and pulled away,
nearly hitting the Farrellys, accidentally-on-purpose, Peter adds:
``Life out here isn't really like this every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Peter and Bobby Farrelly were two goof-offs
who barely made it out of high school near Providence. Even their
parents didn't know what would become of them. They started writing
movies and had 15 scripts straight that never made it to the
screen. Then along came ``Dumb and Dumber'' in 1994, launching them
on a trajectory that has brought them fame and fortune _ all thanks
to movies that some critics say give bad taste a good name. In
1998, their blockbuster sleeper ``There's Something About Mary''
did $450 million worth of movie and video business and firmly
sealed their reputation as over-the-top _ some would say
under-the-bottom _ comic geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, ``politically correct'' is not in the brothers'
vocabulary. As masters of the outrageous, they typically center
their movies on loser types, from the dimwitted roommates in ``Dumb
and Dumber'' to the hapless guy who gets his penis stuck in his
zipper in ``There's Something About Mary.'' The genre, they say, is
a purposeful reaction to the softer comedies of the 1980s and their
know-it-all stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those movies were all about guys who knew more than their
teacher, they knew more than their boss, their girlfriend,'' Peter
says, citing Bill Murray, Chevy Chase and Eddie Murphy as examples.
``The smart aleck wore thin.'' Audiences, the Farrellys felt, were
ready for someone they could look down upon. ``When you look down
on someone,'' says Peter, ``you can sympathize with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of antiheroes, the Farrellys have high hopes for their
latest movie, ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' thanks largely to Jim Carrey
in the role of a schizophrenic state trooper. He has split
personalities, both of whom fall in love with Irene, played by
Renee Zellweger. ``It's a love triangle with the same guy,'' is the
way Peter Farrelly puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Test audiences raved about the movie. ``This is our
highest-scoring movie,'' Peter says. ``I think from the first two
minutes, you realize it's a different beast. We love it.'' They
also believe it's Carrey's best movie; it's his first R-rated
comedy. ``He really pushes the envelope on this one,'' Peter says.
</P>
<P>
   Shreds the envelope is more like it; some critics will likely
pitch a fit over a scene in which Carrey drops his drawers and
prepares to, uh, deface his obnoxious neighbors' yard. Then there's
the scene in which a chicken goes where no chicken has gone before.
By now, fans and critics alike know that no Farrelly movie is
complete without a signature scene of bathroom humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary,'' a romantic comedy that scored high with women, is a
tough act to follow. But the Farrellys are not worrried: ``Irene''
is likely to be more popular with men, they say, but it did just
dandy with women in the test run, too. And the Farrellys don't
really care, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never control how a movie does,'' says Peter. ``We
love this movie. If this movie did no business at all, I could live
with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of fun-loving, what-the-hell attitude that
permeates the Farrellys' work. On a balmy May afternoon at Big Time
Studios in Santa Monica, ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' is in the crucial
final day of editing, but the editing room could be a fraternity
house. Guys keep coming and going, cracking jokes. There's a fridge
full of Diet Coke and Sprite and lots of junk food.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby, 42, looks like the fraternity president: clean-cut, plaid
Bermuda shorts, white shirt, tan, blue-eyed like his father. Peter,
43, looks like the fratty renegade: goatee, longish hair, jeans,
and a T-shirt, brown-eyed like his mom. Their personalities are
different, too. Bobby is more laid-back, throwing in the wry
zinger. Peter is the talker. He's older by 18 months and is used to
taking the big-brother lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the business a long time, and there's no people
in the pictures more fun to work for than the Farrellys,'' says Sam
Seig, an assistant film editor who is stationed in front of a
monitor, fiddling with equipment. ``Every day, it's a joy. People
are always laughing, always joking.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Greenbury, the film editor on ``Irene,'' who was nominated
for an Oscar for editing ``American Beauty,'' wants to take a few
frames off a scene with Renee Zellweger. Bobby disagrees: ``If you
cut it, you lose her reaction,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbury, someone in the room notes, has edited all four of the
Farrelly ``films.'' Bobby goes fake-ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies,'' he cries. ``Movies. The Farrellys don't make films.
We make movies.''
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' he replies, ``is a great film. 'Irene' is a
movie. We're not trying to make any artistic statement. Our movies
are just for entertainment value.''
</P>
<P>
   A shiny red Jaguar with the license plate DOCKY is parked
outside the New Seabury home of Robert and Mariann Farrelly. The
car was a gift to the family patriarch from ``the boys'' and his
wife after he recovered from complications following colon surgery
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys said, `If Dad lives until September, we're going to
buy him a car.' They didn't want to spend the money until they saw
that I was going to make it,'' chuckles Docky Farrelly, 69. He's a
retired family physician _ everyone called him Doc until the first
grandchild rechristened him Docky _ who taught medicine at Brown
University. Mariann, 67, is a nurse practitioner who works two days
a week at a Fall River medical clinic. Five years ago, the couple
sold the Cumberland, R.I., home where they'd raised their children
and moved to their summer house in New Seabury on Cape Cod. While
the house is being renovated, they are borrowing a daughter's
vacation home nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the mid-1950s, five Farrelly babies came along
within seven years until, as Docky puts it, ``I had my wings
clipped.'' (``After each baby,'' he explains, ``Mariann would go on
the birth-control pill, and then to confession, and then get off
the pill.'') The three girls and two boys grew up close, and they
remain so: Each Farrelly movie includes a cast of sisters, nieces,
nephews, and, of course, Mariann and Docky.
</P>
<P>
   In leafy Cumberland, the Farrelly household was a magnet for
kids and animals of all sorts. There was a pond that Docky stocked
with ducks, geese and swans, and the backyard was big enough for
many a neighborhood football game. The kids loved animals; dogs and
cats came and went. More than anything, though, it was a house full
of pranks and laughter, much of it initiated by the parents. Ask
who makes them laugh the most, and the brothers name not Richard
Pryor or David Letterman but their parents. ``The older they get,
the funnier they get,'' says Peter. ``It could be senility, but
it's hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, when the boys were 5 and 6, their father loaded all the
kids into the car and went shopping for a Mother's Day gift. First
stop: the pet shop. ``There was this little Peruvian squirrel
monkey in a cage,'' Docky Farrelly recalls. ``He was a little ugly
green thing, but the kids fell in love with him. I said to the
owner, `Is this monkey going to be tame?' He said: `This monkey
will be the best friend you ever had.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Mariann walked into the living room on Mother's Day, there
was the monkey, and it was all hers. A few days later, Mariann, a
master bridge player, had her students over to play. ``I noticed
they all had this glazed look in their eyes,'' she says. ``So I
turned around and looked.'' There was her Mother's Day present,
masturbating in front of the ladies. After the monkey nearly bit
Docky's ear off _ ``so much for my best friend,'' he notes _ they
gave him away.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time the boys pulled a prank on their
unsuspecting mother during a bridge tournament. In those days,
ladies dressed up: suits, jewelry, stockings, pumps. Late in the
day, one player said, ``Oh, Mariann, you have something on your
back.'' Mrs. Farrelly reached back and peeled off a sign that said,
``I just pooped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came home at about 11:30 that night and ran up to the boys'
room with a fly swatter,'' she says, laughing at the memory. ``I
guess that this is where all the toilet humor comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   The unforgettable opening scene in ``There's Something About
Mary,'' in which the bumbling Ben Stiller gets his penis stuck in a
zipper just as he is preparing to take his dream date to the prom,
actually happened in the Farrellys' Cumberland home. Sort of. When
Kathy Farrelly turned 12, she hosted a party. She had a crush on
the coolest boy in the class. The boy went into the bathroom and
never came out. Finally, Mariann sent her husband in to check on
him. A few minutes later, he hollered: ``Mariann, get some ice
cubes!'' (In the movie, it's translated as: ``We've got a
bleeder!'') Between the doctor and the nurse, they got the boy
unstuck. For five years, they kept it a secret from their kids.
``We didn't want to embarrass the boy,'' says Mariann.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't all fun and games at the Farrelly household. To
hear the boys tell it, their parents were taskmasters: no TV during
the school week, mandatory study hours. ``The rule of the family,''
says Docky Farrelly, ``is that the minimum is a master's degree.''
The girls _ Beth, Kathy, and Cindy _ brought home all A's and B's.
Today, Beth, who has an MBA and lives in Duxbury, owns a market
research firm with her husband. Kathy, who lives in Norton, is a
producer for Channel 5's Chronicle. And Cindy is an entertainment
lawyer in Los Angeles _ her brothers are among her clients.
</P>
<P>
   But the boys were another story. ``The boys,'' says their
father, ``broke my heart in school.'' Time and again, they brought
home C's and D's. Their parents sent them to a Catholic school in
Providence. It didn't help. Then they resorted to a time-honored
parental method: bribery. When Bobby and Peter were 13 and 14, they
wanted dirt motorbikes. ``I tell you what,'' said their father.
``You make the honor roll this quarter, and I'll buy each of you a
trail bike.'' Lo and behold, they came home with all A's. The dirt
bikes were bought. They lasted two weeks, until Peter crashed into
a parked car containing an elderly man just coming home after a
two-week hospitalization for heart surgery. Docky put the bikes up
for sale that night. The boys' grades plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what the hell they were going to do in life,''
says their father. ``I was disciplined enough to go to college and
medical school and run a medical practice. A parent wants a child
to accomplish more than he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farrelly brothers were hardly a case of dumb and dumber.
They were, you might say, lazy and lazier. ``Classic
underachievers,'' as Bobby puts it. Both would daydream in class,
finding it tough to pay attention. But they weren't, as one might
expect, the class clowns. ``We'd be more like the kind who would
put our heads down on our desks and fall asleep,'' says Bobby. ``We
weren't disrespectful.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Peter: ``We respectfully got D's.''
</P>
<P>
   Frantic over their grades, their parents sent them to private
school: Peter to the Kent School in Connecticut, which he calls
``the strictest coed school in New England.'' Needless to say, he
hated it. (His first of two novels, ``Outside Providence,'' which
was made into a movie last year, is based on his experiences at
Kent). Bobby, meanwhile, was sent to Andover. How on earth did he
get in? As if on cue, both parents reply in unison: ``Hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   The new venues did not help either boy's grades. On Parents Day,
the Farrellys visited Peter's teachers. Docky was almost in tears.
The French teacher said: ``He's doing really poorly. If you tell
him to just sit there and be quiet, I'll pass him.'' But his
English teacher told a different story. ``He's got quite a knack
for writing,'' she said. (``It's funny,'' notes Docky today. ``Here
the boys are, writing all sorts of scripts, and Bobby says he and
Peter didn't write 16 pages between them in high school.'')
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for college, Peter was turned down by just
about every school to which he applied. His father called a friend
of his, a priest at Providence College. ``Father, you have to help
me,'' he said. Peter was admitted to Providence, where, according
to his father, he graduated last in his class. Bobby, meanwhile,
got into Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., (see
``hockey,'' above). He majored in geology. ``I think he thought it
had something to do with getting stoned,'' Peter quips.
</P>
<P>
   After college, Bobby sold life insurance in Providence; he hated
every minute. He and a friend from home decided to do something a
little more creative, so they invented and patented the world's
first round beach towel, The Sun Spot. ``So you didn't have to keep
turning your towel as the sun moved,'' he explains. ``We worked our
tails off but never succeeded.'' Peter adds: ``As it turned out,
people don't mind moving their towels.''
</P>
<P>
   But a mother never gives up on her child. Mariann Farrelly would
slip out of Mass at St. John Vianney in Cumberland a few minutes
early on Sunday mornings, raise the hatchback of her Honda Civic,
and sell Bobby's round towels to all her friends. ``They were big,
bright, colorful beach towels. They were beautiful,'' she says. ``I
still have a bunch of them somewhere in the cellar.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter, meanwhile, was in a similarly unhappy business, selling
space on a shipping company out of Boston. One day, he went to see
his father. ``Pop, I want to become a writer. I want to go to UMass
in the creative writing program and get my master's.'' His father
replied, ``Pete, you'll never get in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got in,'' is the son's answer. ``I gave them the first 50
pages of my book.'' That would be ``Outside Providence,'' still in
gestation at the time.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Massachu setts at Amherst, Peter Farrelly
was not happy. All the other students in the writing program were
given teaching assistant positions, with pay and perks. ``I had
been an accounting major, so they wouldn't give me one,'' he says,
a tinge of resentment in his voice nearly two decades later. So,
based again on the first 50 pages of ``Outside Providence,'' he was
accepted into Columbia University's creative writing program, where
he earned a master's degree in fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, their parents couldn't be prouder. ``I fill up every time
I talk about them,'' says their mother. ``They always say, `the
Farrelly brothers.' It's so gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Docky with considerably less sentimentality: ``If they were
driving a garbage truck, they would have accomplished more than I'd
hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, after finishing at Columbia, Peter moved to
Los Angeles, where he and a high school friend, Bennett Yellin,
began writing screenplays. They'd send them to Bobby, who was still
pushing his beach towels back in Rhode Island. ``Bobby was always
editing our stuff, and we felt guilty that he was doing so much
work, so we brought him in,'' says Peter. Eventually, Yellin struck
out on his own, and the brothers began their partnership. Their TV
heroes were Garry Shandling and Jerry Seinfeld. They sold a script
to the latter, but were never hired as writers. ``It's a good
thing,'' says Peter, ``because we wouldn't have written 'Dumb and
Dumber.'''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 10 years, some 15 Farrelly scripts sold, including
a rougher version of ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' (written in 1990), but
the pictures never got made. Their breakthrough movie, ``Dumb and
Dumber,'' gave them the opening to push their outrageous humor to
the limits.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophically, the brothers' humor derives from the rawer
'70s, when favorites such as ``National Lampoon's Animal House,''
``Blazing Saddles'' and ``Airplane!'' were made. Their mentors are
the Zucker brothers, who made ``Airplane!,'' ``Police Squad'' and
the ``Naked Gun'' series. In fact, the Farrellys and Zuckers are
now collaborating on a script called ``The Boss's Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Farrellys' hallmark is to push the envelope of
taste, they are sensitive to criticism that they are being
insensitive. Peter likes to say their movies ``have heart.'' They
would never poke fun at a cripple, they say, despite a sequence in
``There's Something About Mary'' in which a guy on crutches
painstakingly drops his keys and can't retrieve them. (``You find
out later he isn't really crippled,'' says Peter. ``He's faking
it.'')
</P>
<P>
   They acknowledge that their humor is edgy but resent the
``gross-out'' label they're often tagged with. ``Gross gets `uhh'
from the viewers; funny gets a laugh,'' says Peter. ``It's got to
be funny.'' They point to the semen-as-hair-gel scene in ``Mary''
as one that could have been gross if handled differently, but it
turned out to be a show-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``The Boss's Daughter,'' current projects include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuck on You,'' about hockey-playing Siamese twins. Their
ideal leads: Jim Carrey and Woody Allen. Carrey and Allen as twins?
``Well,'' says Peter, ``they share a liver, and 90 percent of the
liver is in the Carrey character, so Woody is not aging well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Say It Isn't So'': Boy meets girl of his dreams; she turns out
to be his sister. But not really. A romantic comedy starring Sally
Field, Heather Graham (``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me''),
and Chris Klein (``American Pie''), it just wrapped up filming in
Vancouver. Others wrote and directed it; the brothers are producing
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osmosis Jones'': An animated movie written by Marc Hyman, who
graduated from Boston University and Emerson College. It takes
place inside the human body and stars Chris Rock as a white blood
cell in the title role. Bill Murray also stars. The Farrellys are
directing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basket Case'': Agoraphobic non-jock has to shoot a basket
during half-time of a packed basketball game in order to win a
million dollars; in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shallow Hal,'' starring Gwyneth Paltrow as both a fat and a
thin version of herself. Shooting begins in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot of work, this brotherly collaboration, a lot of
togetherness. Luckily, say those who know them, their talents and
personalities complement each other's. Peter tends toward the more
physical comedy, Bobby the more verbal. Peter is the music freak,
whose movie soundtracks have been praised. Bobby gets credit for
his editing skills. The writing they do together.
</P>
<P>
   On a set, the codirectors never double-team the actors. ``It's
intimidating and confusing,'' Peter says. ``Bobby often sits in
front of the monitor, and I deal more face to face with them.''
Occasionally, the two will have differences, but they always leave
them at the office. ``He pulled a gun on me once,'' Peter jokes,
``but it didn't have bullets.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bobby says that Peter has always been the big
brother. ``If some bully was picking on me, instead of me getting
my ass kicked, he did,'' he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has sung a siren song to two goofy guys from Rhode
Island, but the pull of family and land is the underlying force in
their lives. Though the brothers each married women from the West
Coast, they live most of the year back east. Bobby's wife, Nancy, a
former flight attendant, is from Seattle. They've been married for
10 years and have two children: Jesse, 9, and Anna, 7, who attend
Duxbury public schools. Peter and his wife of nearly three years,
Melinda, who grew up in Los Angeles, sold their Duxbury home last
year and bought a house in West Tisbury on Martha's Vineyard. Their
son, Bob, is 15 months old, and they're expecting a girl in August.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a down-home, family atmosphere to the entire
Farrelly operation. Although most of the Farrellys' staff is male,
their scripts are scrupulously vetted by their wives, sisters and
mother, whose senses of humor the brothers admire. And each film
includes cameo appearances by sisters, nieces, nephews, friends,
and, of course, Mariann and Docky.
</P>
<P>
   In ``There's Something About Mary,'' they played the couple who
run Docky's Corndog Stand in Miami, serving corndogs to Ben Stiller
and Cameron Diaz. In ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene,'' Mariann and her
friends are the shocked ladies flashed by Jim Carrey at a train
station. And Docky played a casino cashier in Kingpin.
</P>
<P>
   The closing credits for ``Irene'' include a series of shots of
friends and family, names included, who were cut or are barely seen
in the film ``because of time constraints.'' Peter says:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a nice way of saying they gave horrendous performances.
But this way, at least they get seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the childhood friends of the Farrellys who now work in the
business is Dan Murphy, whom the brothers have known since their
teen-age summers in New Seabury, where they all caddied and kept
the greens at the golf club. On August 8, 1974 _ the day President
Nixon resigned _ Peter and Murphy took off with some friends for an
overnight sailing trip to the Vineyard. When they arrived, Murphy
took a dive off a piling and broke his neck; he now uses a
wheelchair. Murphy has acted in four of the Farrellys' movies,
including as an FBI agent in ``Irene.'' He was also the prototype
for the disabled kid brother in ``Outside Providence.'' (A few
years ago, fellow Rhode Islander Michael Corrente picked a copy of
``Outside Providence'' off a remainders table at a bookstore and
was so taken with it that he approached Peter Farrelly, who
``sold'' the film rights to him for a buck. Corrente directed it;
the brothers produced it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds canned, but it's true: Everyone loves working
with them,'' says Murphy, who grew up in Jamaica Plain. ``They
don't have any of the Hollywood pretentiousness, the ego stuff, the
power trips, that happen on other sets.''
</P>
<P>
   School chum Michael Cerrone was helping run a family car
dealership in Attleboro before joining the Farrellys. He co-wrote
``Irene'' and plays a bad cop who has a close encounter with a
chicken. Mark Charpentier, who grew up with the boys, left his
family's flooring business to work with them. He is the co producer
of ``Irene.'' Kris Meyer of North Quincy, who graduated from Boston
College High School, is their right-hand man; he's an associate
producer of ``Irene.''
</P>
<P>
   The Farrellys have also featured Boston comedians Steve Sweeney,
Lenny Clark, Jackie Flynn and Kevin Flynn in their movies. And then
there is their tradition of auctioning off a small part for a good
cause, like the Cam Neely House for cancer patients at the New
England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   There is also considerable local flavor to the movies, which the
brothers insist be filmed in New England. ``It's something we feel
very strongly about,'' says Peter. ``Irene,'' for instance, was
shot in Burlington and Middlebury, Vt., and in Newport, R.I. In one
scene, a local cries, ``I'm in a wicked rush!''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Farrellys always hold a premiere in Rhode
Island. ``Dumb and Dumber'' premiered in Warwick. ``It was all we
could get at the time,'' says Bobby. By ``Kingpin,'' they had
worked their way up to Newport. ``Irene'' premiered in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   But the business does force them to spend some time in Santa
Monica, where Peter has an apartment. His family came and stayed
with him during the final months of ``Irene;'' Bobby's children had
to stay back east to finish school, so he phoned them every eve
ning to say goodnight, and he commuted home on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once my kids got in school, I really wanted to go back home,''
says Bobby. ``It's a one-industry town here. Everyone's life
revolves around the movies.'' Adds Peter: ``It's a better life back
home. It's way prettier. This place is a desert.'' He pauses. ``But
what it's really about is the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask them more about the lure of New England, and Peter takes out
a copy of his 1998 novel, ``The Comedy Writer.'' It's about a guy
in a dead-end job in Boston who moves to Los Angeles to try to make
it in the movies and eventually heads home. Flipping to the end,
Peter Farrelly reads aloud: ``The Red Sox eked their way into the
postseason in the fall of 1990, and I walked to all the home
playoff games from my studio apartment in the Back Bay. I enjoyed
it when the weather turned cold again. I didn't like hot winters. I
didn't like places where I had to stop and think about what month
it was. I was glad to be around my parents, and my brothers and
sisters and friends. I liked living in a place where summer meant
something. I'd missed the leaves and cranberry bogs. I'd missed
meeting pretty girls who weren't automatically models. I'd missed
Mike Barnicle. Hollywood moguls come and go, and someday I'd be
lying on my deathbed, facing the void, and I was a blessed man
because I knew the truth is there is a God, and that everything
means something.'' This time, there is no punch line.

 FAMILY MEALS MADE SIMPLE _ THE ITALIAN WAY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HINGHAM, Mass. _ You don't have to be Italian to take a dozen
beautiful ingredients _ two of which, invariably, are tomatoes and
olive oil _ and turn them into a fine, quick dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But it helps.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tosi qualifies, being Italian on his father's side and
preferring Italian food to all other cuisines. And these days,
especially when it's his turn at the stove, Tosi is happy only with
instant meals. He has too many other interests, which include
playing with his daughter, Arianna, who is almost 4; spending time
with his wife, Bonnie Anderson, a model; working on the expansive
flower and vegetable gardens behind their 1822 house; and clamming
on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen in the Tosi household is very large, the result of a
recent renovation in which the small pantries that used to abut the
19th-century kitchen were incorporated into the main area. It was
one part of a major overhaul that occurred while the family still
lived in Charlestown. They've been in this house almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Arianna can drive her tricycle on the washed-out
terra-cotta flooring while her mother or father prepares dinner at
a 3 1/2-by-9-foot black-granite-topped island _ large by any
standard. On any given evening, the cooking island is bound to be
heaped with spaghetti and other Italian ingredients from the
Pastene Companies, which Arianna's father and uncle own.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tosi and his brother Christopher run a family business that
began informally on a pushcart in Boston's North End in 1848. Until
a decade ago _ when Americans discovered the Mediterranean diet _
Pastene's customers mostly consisted of a strong ethnic following.
``People tell me their great-grandmothers used our tomatoes,'' Tosi
says. Now, with pasta and olive oil on supper tables far outside
the Italian community, the privately held Canton, Mass. company is
in a boom.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the canned tomatoes he wants, the tomatoes Tosi
prefers above all others come from the garden behind his house. He
points out dozens of plants. ``I have 36,'' he says, ``red, yellow,
cherries, Big Boys, plums.'' Those and other vegetables are growing
in a bed that used to be covered in vines. The grounds of the
house, which he bought two years ago, hadn't been maintained for
many years, he says. The work is cut out for him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, time constraints are only part of the reason for the
family's quick meal strategy. As it happens, many Italian dishes
are uncomplicated by nature, says Tosi. ``Italian food is peasant
food, based on simple ingredients with wonderful flavors.'' When
Tosi is traveling in Italy (his company has an office in Naples)
and he eats something he likes, it goes into the repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   One is a dish based on lemon and pasta that Tosi ate at a winery
outside Florence in Chianti country. It does not contain tomatoes,
but rather onions sauteed in olive oil with garlic, and a generous
amount of grated lemon rind and juice. Those few ingredients are
tossed with spaghetti or another pasta and then, at the table,
sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. ``Some people add cream,'' says
Tosi. ``But we don't. It's light, and delicious with grilled veal
or pork chops and a salad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosi also makes a highly seasoned sauce from canned and
sun-dried tomatoes seasoned with capers, crushed red peppers, and
flakes of tuna. When the sauce is finished, he drains pasta, often
spaghetti, and adds it to the sauce. ``I always put the pasta into
the sauce,'' he says. ``Otherwise the sauce will not stick.'' He
admits it looks nicer to tip the freshly cooked pasta onto a big
platter and spoon the sauce on top, ``but it'll never coat it
properly.''
</P>
<P>
   There is almost always pasta for dinner, some sort of salad, and
often something grilled. At home, Tosi uses a gas grill. In
Chatham, where Tosi's mother and stepfather live, everyone joins
the family's clammers _ Tosi among them _ for a cookout on the
beach on a little hibachi filled with charcoal.
</P>
<P>
   They dig for cherrystones and littlenecks. ``We stick the clams
right on the grill so they're cooking in their own juices,'' he
says. Once the clams open, he puts them on a plate and drizzles
them with a mixture of melted butter, olive oil, and garlic.
``People eat dozens.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosi doesn't apologize for the gas grill he uses at home, even
though some cooks consider gas inferior to charcoal. ``It's easy.
It's right outside the back door,'' he says. ``We grill four days a
week, all year, in the rain, shine, snow, and sleet.'' He calls his
Weber ``the standard every-house model.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else about the house or kitchen is standard. The
cupboard doors are made from distressed pine, so the place doesn't
have a brand-new feeling. The same black granite that covers the
center island is on all the counters, and a very large sink _ ample
enough to hold several restaurant-size pots at once _ is also made
of granite. Like many wide sinks, his custom-made sink didn't drain
very well. But it was already installed when Tosi discovered that.
So the workmen had to plane it in place. ``Now it drains from every
corner,'' says Tosi, which seems to suggest he drove the workmen
crazy. ``I was on site every day,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   On either side of the window above the sink are pine racks that
hold beautiful, colorful ceramic plates from Ravello, a village in
the hills above Amalfi. Tosi has them packed in the shipping
containers that hold his imported foods.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike inexpensive Italian pottery, which chips if something
touches it, these plates are durable. ``We run them through the
dishwasher on a regular basis,'' he says. There are two
dishwashers. On the side of the island that faces the sink, there
are also two Sub-Zero refrigerator drawers (these in addition to a
Sub-Zero refrigerator-freezer). When Anderson and Tosi cook for
parties, which they do a lot, the top drawer holds food they're
cooking. The bottom drawer holds juices and snacks for Arianna, who
can open it and help herself.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson does most of the weekly meals. ``He courted me with his
cooking,'' she says, ``then something happened.'' They've been
married almost five years. Arianna was born when they lived in
Charlestown, in another old house that Tosi had lived in for 20
years. He had driven along the historic district in Hingham from
the time he was a boy growing up in Cohasset. ``I always wanted to
live here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Debbie Rogers, comes from an English family who
settled in Boston in the 1600s. His late father, Jerome, was so far
removed from his immigrant heritage that he didn't understand
Italian. ``You didn't want to be known as Italian back then,'' his
son says.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tosi went to Italy after high school and during college
spent summers there. He spent some time working in vineyards in
Tuscany. Before he was married, he spent every September in Amalfi.
``It's just spectacular. The whole coast is amazing.'' He returns
two or three times a year, though not with Anderson since Arianna
was born. After years of traveling without children, and sometimes
being disturbed by them on flights, he didn't want to fly with a
crying baby.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his company, he still goes to Italy. He considers the
Italian diet _ particularly in Amalfi _ healthier than his. ``They
sit down as a family for a one-hour lunch. Then there's an hour
nap. They work late, eat dinner from 8 to 10, then they do the
promenade. It's very relaxing. They don't seem to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosi's own diet isn't all that bad, but his portions are large.
He wrestles with his weight. When he reached ``my worst weight
ever,'' the man who imports pasta as his livelihood decided to go
on a low-carbohydrate diet. ``No pasta. No bread. No rice.'' It
nearly killed him. ``I hated that diet.'' He went off it, and half
the weight came back. But pasta is in his life again, which is the
important thing.

<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ When diners in upscale eateries _ from
Radius, one of Boston's hottest restaurants, to the four-star
Victoria &AMP; Albert's at Walt Disney World in Orlando _ bite into a
delectable marinated Dutch yellow tomato, they almost surely have
no idea of the unlikely journey it took to reach their table.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the golden vegetable came from Holland. But it first
made a stop in New Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   To be more precise, after a trans-Atlantic flight, the tomato
arrived at a red brick warehouse sitting amid hollowed-out textile
mills and weed-enveloped raiload tracks _ surely one of the most
unexpected crossroads of the food world.
</P>
<P>
   But this seaport city, long ago known as the whaling capital of
the world and then as one of New England's greatest mill towns, is
home to Sid Wainer and Son, a food emporium that inspires
gastronomic gushing from chefs across America and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   New Bedford would seem a surprising place where a pastry chef
can score those delicate California Froggy Hollow peaches needed to
concoct an $11 dessert offered at Radius.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the world's best chefs rely on Wainer and Son, whose
cavernous warehouses rise above a strip mall, for edible miniature
roses from Israel, white anchovies from Tuscany, and smoked salmon
from the Shetland Islands.
</P>
<P>
   From a site that used to be a blanket-making factory, a vast
cornucopia of food is placed into refrigerated trucks bound not
only to places in New England, but the Hyatt in New Orleans,
Glenmore Country Club in Keswick, Va., and two of Chicago's ritzier
restaurants, Spiaggia and Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to think we're in New Bedford,'' said chef Joyce Costa,
offering a taste of Brie cheese and fig compote hors d'oeuvres from
the kitchen counter of the company's public gourmet store.
Underscoring the company's high standards, Costa, like all the
sales staff at Sid Wainer and Son, is a chef.
</P>
<P>
   But outside New Bedford and beyond the world of professional
chefs, this city in southeastern Massachusetts is today mostly
known for its whaling museum and large fishing fleet _ not for the
$10,000 crate of olives that Henry Wainer procured from a Spanish
bullfighter turned olive grower.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, more than 150 years ago, whale hunting and New
Bedford were synonymous. This was the place from which in 1841
Herman Melville set out for the sea on a voyage that inspired
``Moby Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic emphasis shifted to land in the late 1800s when
dozens of massive mills created New Bedford's industrial skyline
near the waterfront. After World War I, New Bedford's economy was
booming and the city hit its highest population of 130,000. But
when the stock market crashed in 1929 so did the textile industry.
Despite lean years, New Bedford has managed to stage a comeback _
the city boasts a new industrial park and a new commercial pier _
but it still has one of the highest unemployment rates in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   But through New Bedford's ebbs and flows, Sid Wainer and Son has
thrived.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded in 1914 by Henry Wainer's grandfather
who supplied produce from New England to restaurants and stores by
horse and buggy.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Wainer, the company's president who turned 50 in June,
grew up working at his father's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up at 3 a.m. and worked until 10 all of my life,'' said
Wainer, who graduated from Nichols College in Dudley in 1972 and
has successfully expanded the family business.
</P>
<P>
   Today the sprawling complex includes nine temperature-regulated
storage rooms along with the gourmet shop. The company also is
opening an experimental multimedia kitchen and amphitheater. About
370 employees work round the clock to keep food shipped in from 40
countries moving to its final destination.
</P>
<P>
   The company has attracted chefs from across the country who have
moved to the New Bedford area because they share Wainer's passion
for food. A team of chefs tastes thousands of items each year and
only the best get the Wainer seal of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Wainer's face beams as he shows off his products. He has a story
for each one. He knows exactly the farm it came from and, in most
cases, knows the farmer who cultivated it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he points to a crate of olives worth $40,000 and
says he gets them from a Spanish bullfighter in Cataluna who turned
his bull farm into an orchard. Or, he lets you smell the fresh
truffles that were sniffed out of the ground by a dog he met in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   If Wainer tastes something he likes, he gets it. He has stocked
red baby bananas ever since he, his wife, and four children
vacationed in Barbados and became enchanted with the sweet fruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an opportunity it is to be in the food business,'' Wainer
says with a smile. ``The world is a small dining place.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hunnel, chef of Victoria &AMP; Albert's at Disney World, said
he has ordered from the company for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their knowledge of the ingredient is exceptional,'' Hunnel
said. ``If I want a wild French asparagus, they know what I'm
talking about.''

D.C. PLANNING BUMPER PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The announcement sounded pretty unremarkable at
first. After years with a bland motto, ``Celebrate &AMP; Discover,''
members of the D.C. City Council agreed last month to change the
slogan on local license plates to something a little catchier.
Something more historic.
</P>
<P>
   What they ended up with was downright revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, new tags in the nation's capital will
soon be emblazoned with the phrase ``Taxation without
Representation,'' a marker of the city's unique political status.
The city's half-million residents, who are unable to elect voting
representatives to Congress despite paying more than $2 billion in
federal taxes a year, will at least be able to drive their
longstanding frustration past the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials insist the move is purely ``educational,'' a
lighthearted attempt to correct nationwide misconceptions about the
plight of those living in the District of Columbia. But according
to some, the license plate initiative, which was welcomed
enthusiastically by Mayor Anthony A. Williams and the entire City
Council, is also part of a slow reawakening of the movement for
democracy in D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's public relations,'' said City Council chairwoman Linda W.
Cropp, who introduced the idea at the suggestion of a local
resident. ``And public relations, and information, and education,
can often play a major role in change.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, change has been hard to come by in the nation's
capital, where activists have spent the last 200 years trying
everything, from lawsuits to constitutional amendments, to gain
fuller voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   They have had some successes, most notably the 1968 legal change
that granted D.C. residents the right to vote in presidential
elections. Six years later, the city was also permitted limited
control over some municipal functions.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1978 attempt at a constitutional amendment to allow
complete representation failed to get the necessary 38-state
approval, despite massive support in the District and approval by
both houses of Congress. In 1993, a bill to grant D.C. statehood
never made it that far. With just 153 supporters, it was voted down
in the US House.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, advocates have continued the struggle, often with
little public support or national notice. Most recently, in 1998, a
D.C. coalition filed a lawsuit arguing for full representation;
earlier this year, a federal appeasl court ruled against them, 2-1.
The advocates have since appealed to the Supreme Court, where the
case could be heard as early as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The drawn-out court proceedings and lulls in legislative
maneuvers, however, have often caused the local furor over voting
rights to die down. ``There is no such thing as a movement that can
sustain itself for 200 years,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, the
Democrat who is the District's delegate in the US House but is not
allowed to vote on bills that come to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be the reason the catchy license plate slogan shot
straight into local headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamed up by Sarah Shapiro, 49, who lives in the Northwest
section of Washington, the motto became an instant hit on local
radio talk shows and newspaper columns, capturing the imagination
of residents weary of decades of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who is out of work on disability leave, had felt the
full effects of living without a fully enabled representative a few
years earlier when she sought the kind of assistance most members
of Congress provide: help with gaining Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said she contacted Norton, her congresswoman, and
Norton's staff members ``did what they could do,'' which, in her
case, was not much. They could only tell Shapiro the status of her
case, which she already knew. But when Shapiro's mother, who lives
in Brooklyn, contacted her congressman, Democratic Representative
Anthony Weiner, about the same matter, she got a letter back signed
by the Social Security commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different, isn't it?'' Shapiro said. ``What a
different reaction a voting congressman gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Norton, she added: ``It's not only unjust and
revolting and degrading and humiliating that she doesn't vote. It's
also very different for those she represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro didn't just get mad. She sent an e-mail to a local radio
show on politics. The broadcaster, Mark Plotkin, in turn, took her
``Taxation without Representation'' idea public.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Norton says, if the city doesn't adopt the
Revolutionary-era slogan, ``people are going to put it on their own
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be necessary. In late June, after receiving wide
public support, the D.C. City Council passed a ``sense of the
council'' resolution, which, unlike regular council votes, does not
require approval in Congress. Instead, it gives the nod to the
mayor to sign an executive order putting the new slogan onto the
city's license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress have given no indication they will take the
awkward step of overruling that order once Williams signs it,
although Congress has the right to control virtually everything the
District of Columbia does. Representative Thomas M. Davis III, the
Virginia Republican who heads the House Government Reform
subcommittee on the District, has expressed support for the
slogan's content, although a spokesman said Davis was less certain
about the tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of opposition from Republicans, who have historically
opposed giving the overwhelmingly Democratic city any congressional
voice,is encouraging to many D.C. residents and is helping add fuel
to the D.C. rights movement overall. According to one recent poll,
55 percent of Americans are unaware of the voting rights status of
the nation's capital. Nearly three-quarters said they believed D.C.
residents deserved to vote the same as everyone else, according to
Joseph Sternlieb, president of D.C. Vote, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our task is outside of Washington,'' Sternlieb said. ``We have
to convince the patriots around the country to expand our
democracy, to include the citizens who live in D.C.''

POTTY PARITY HITS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if you didn't know, nothing symbolizes male privilege so
obviously as do men's and women's public toilets. All it takes to
be reminded of this is a mere two minutes of being blocked at the
door of the men's room at the New Hampshire Liquor Store.
</P>
<P>
   A store employee, who was taking a moment away from cheerfully
ringing up chardonnay and Jim Beam to play a bouncer, told us that
someone was sweeping the floor. This seemed like a minor
inconvenience, except that this was Sunday evening, precisely when
weekenders and vacationers were heading home on southbound I-95,
just below the Hampton tolls.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, a line of seven or eight guys snaked out the
door. Never had you seen so many women smirking and sarcastically
rolling their eyes in gleeful shock _ as they marched right past us
into the line-less women's bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you know how it feels,'' said one woman to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh wow!'' said another. ``A guy's line! That's a new one!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding me! A wait on the men's line? What a lovely
sight!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazing sight,'' said my wife, Michelle Holmes, who
was one of the women who was able to go in and come out of the
women's toilet to find the same guys still in line. My wife and
such others all giggled and laughed. Another minute or two, and
some woman would have shouted at us, ``How's your bladder, girls!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, women, I know that a backup of seven or eight guys is
nothing like the pileups of 20, 30 and 50 women at concerts,
sporting events, state fairs, flower shows, and rest stops. I am
quite aware that men rarely suffer such indignities.
</P>
<P>
   Why, just three nights before, I played the bouncer myself up in
one of the high huts of the Appalachian Mountain Club in the White
Mountains. Michelle, sick of the line for the women's toilet, asked
me to hold the fort while she went into the men's toilet. I have
done that for her several times over the years, at roadside
restaurants, coffee houses, and campgrounds. Never once in our 21
years together has she had to stand outside a women's toilet,
saying, ``I'm sorry, could you wait a moment, my husband is in here
because the men's line is too long.''
</P>
<P>
   In the larger picture, times are changing. Over the last decade,
ever since Denise Wells of Houston was arrested for leaving a
hopeless women's bathroom line at a George Strait concert to burst
into the men's room, several states have passed ``potty parity''
laws that require large halls and stadiums to have more bathrooms
for women than men. In the mid-1990s, Massachusetts quietly changed
its plumbing laws to reflect, roughly, a 2-to-1 women's to men's
ratio in new toilets.
</P>
<P>
   There was real science behind the ratios. University researchers
found that women, who do not have the option of closely grouped
urinals, take between two to four times longer than men to use the
bathroom. That does not include other facts that may not be
suitable for dinner discussion, such as that women are three times
more likely to wash their hands than men after using the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of potty parity, there has been some male backlash.
Men are complaining in Nashville at the new stadium for the
football Titans that their lines are now far longer than the
women's under Tennessee's 2-to-1 women's-to-men's toilet ratio. Of
course, no one has yet done a study of how much beer the guys
consumed during the first half, compared to the women.
</P>
<P>
   There was Bob Glaser, who sued the city of San Diego in 1995 for
$5.4 million after fed-up women stormed the men's bathrooms to
urinate at a Billy Joel-Elton, John football stadium concert.
Glaser said he was ``angered, upset, embarrassed, distraught, and
(felt) violated.'' A federal judge called his case frivolous and
the Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But bathroom lines remain far from frivolous matters for women,
particularly in older facilities that are often exempt from potty
parity laws. Two years ago, Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond
Times-Dispatch wrote, ``I could have vacuumed my apartment, changed
my cats' litter boxes and re-laced every sneaker in my closet
during the time I wasted waiting for a stall at Garth Brooks's
Richmond Coliseum show last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported how, at a George
Strait and the Dixie Chicks concert at Texas Stadium, a men's
bathrooms was nearly empty as 56 women stood in line next door to
use their bathroom. Emily Nipps wrote last year in the Tampa
Tribune that a real ladies night at a club would not be one of
unlimited drinks but one of ``free facials and massages to women
who stand in long bathroom lines.''
</P>
<P>
   So guys, if you are ever in a backup for the toilet and women
laugh at you, grin, bear it, and support your local potty parity
laws. Women have grimmaced and have borne unspeakable bladder
discomfort for so long we were lucky they merely laughed at us
instead of cussing us out. It was only a two-minute line. One could
only imagine the anger of men had it been 20 minutes.

BACK TO THE SPIRIT OF '76 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The previews featured Martian mischief, menacing mutants, and
creepy cyberthugs. The main feature focused on people. Its special
effects were sacrifice, determination, and courage.
</P>
<P>
   It stumbles and falls, but ``The Patriot'' has legs. Its
artistic and financial success demonstrates that while Hollywood is
no hotbed of patriotism, it is always desperate for good stories.
Rocky and Bullwinkle? Gone in 60 seconds. If a recent,
self-absorbed past bombs at the box office, moguls will happily
rediscover the rocket's red glare.
</P>
<P>
   The American Revolution has inspired only 10 movies, according
to the Internet Movie Base, compared to 401 for World War II, 197
for the Civil War, and 72 for Vietnam. ``The Patriot'' is already
historic for reversing this trend.
</P>
<P>
   More inspiration will arrive next year with David McCullough's
biography of John Adams. The nation's second president,
overshadowed by other patriots, is a chattily expressive, emotional
gold mine of character development. Jack Nicholson should fight to
portray him. Thomas Jefferson, alas, is elusive. Ken Howard was a
more persuasive TJ in ``1776'' than Nick Nolte was as ``Jefferson
in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   In the title role of ``The Patriot,'' Mel Gibson plays Benjamin
Martin, a peace-loving farmer who suddenly becomes as impetuous as
Jimy Williams hooking a Red Sox pitcher. Gibsonesque road-warrior
mayhem ensues, but a human story, not war or politics, animates the
narrative. A teen-age heartthrob, Heath Ledger, also helps sell
tickets. ``Gone With the Wind,'' after all, was not about Robert E.
Lee and Stonewall Jackson, but Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler.
</P>
<P>
   After any drama based on history, nits and their pickers
multiply. British punditry has its knickers in a twist because of
the movie's view of redcoat behavior. While the British army's
conduct has often been atrocious, the script did invent
over-the-top, cinematically unnecessary atrocities. As the Duke of
Wellington said before Waterloo, war is heck.
</P>
<P>
   A suitable consolation prize would be a supporting-actor Oscar
for Tom Wilkinson, whose portrayal of Lord Cornwallis rivals that
of Laurence Olivier's depiction of Gentleman Johnny Burgoyne in
``The Devil's Disciple'' in 1959. That movie, based on a Shaw play,
starred Kirk Douglas and Burt Lancaster, the Mel Gibsons of their
time.
</P>
<P>
   The character in dispute, based on a Liverpool lout nicknamed
``Bloody Tarleton,'' was played by Jason Isaacs, who can be the
Basil Rathbone of the 21st century. And a villain he was, ordering
the bayoneting of wounded colonial soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Brits are understandably distressed at any departure from
slobbering Anglophilia, which first infected Hollywood when Warner
Brothers, RKO, and MGM discovered that Shakespeare, Dickens, and
those guys had no agents and didn't require royalty payments.
</P>
<P>
   When film rediscovers the American Revolution, ``Oliver
Wiswell'' by Kenneth Roberts, is a miniseries waiting for the
cameras. Also adaptable is ``The Braintree Mission'' by Nicholas E.
Wyckoff, published in 1957, about a British attempt to bribe John
Adams with an earldom. Both novels have scenes on the
still-preserved field in Milton, Mass. of Thomas Hutchinson, the
royal governor.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may be ready for real characters with real
motivations. The leaders of the 1770s can lay claim to tales of
bravery as compelling as those of ``the greatest generation'' of
the 1940s. Jacques Barzun has observed that when American educators
consigned history to the scrap heap of ``social studies,'' they
encouraged ignorance. But the tide is turning.
</P>
<P>
   The history-is-bunk attitude of early baby boomers is losing its
grip in faculty lounges and at the box office. Does Oliver Stone
have an audience anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood needs scripts and can find many in the Declaration in
which Jefferson and others offered to themselves and to the world
``our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.''

   Please, spare us the psycho-social interpretation of one very
angry guy pummeling another very angry guy to death at a suburban
hockey rink.
</P>
<P>
   Parental rage didn't kill Michael Costin; Thomas Junta did. A

self-defense. The rest of us will have to decide whether the fight

manufactured social ill.

   We make a grand pretense in this country of wanting to

ugly consequences we round out the sharp edges and slap the name of
a silly syndrome on it. Road rage. Air rage. Parental rage.
Violence _ blame it on the lack of open roads, on-time airlines,
and sufficient slots on the varsity squad.
</P>
<P>
   It is so easy to be seduced by the ample anecdotal evidence. Who
hasn't been cut off in traffic by a profanity-spewing driver? Who
hasn't witnessed a flight attendant being browbeaten by a passenger
on a delayed flight? Who hasn't shuddered at obnoxious parental
behavior on the soccer sidelines?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, I know fathers just like those guys,'' we tell each
other when we hear that the fight between Costin and Junta at the
Burbank Ice Arena in Reading erupted over their sons' pickup hockey
game. But do we really know anyone who would punch someone's face
with such ferocity that the victim was unrecognizable to his
family? Do we really think that this kind of violence is triggered
by a father's fantasies of his son playing in the National Hockey
League?
</P>
<P>
   It's true that too many parents have never learned the
fundamentals of sportsmanship, that too many drivers forget that
they are steering a potentially fatal weapon, that too many
self-absorbed airline passengers let their anger jeopardize the
safety of their crew and fellow travelers. But the harm in
ascribing an individual's bad behavior to a passing social
phenomenon is that it diverts responsibility from where it lies _
with the perpetrator and the culture that created him.
</P>
<P>
   Both Costin, 40, and Junta, 42, learned long before either man
became a father and a spectator at their children's sports events
that violence is a tool for settling disputes. They each had
run-ins with police, both as juveniles and as adults. Costin was
only a teenager when his father was convicted of manslaughter for
the stabbing death of Costin's older brother.
</P>
<P>
   Less dramatically, most boys learn the cultural tolerance of
violence the first time they throw a punch in the schoolyard. It's
not that big a leap from socking the boy who teases you at recess
to shoving the ticket agent who tells you the flight is canceled to
belting the coach who benches your son during the championship
game. It is harder to address and reverse a society's ingrained
acceptance of violence than it is to make up catchy names for a
syndrome when that violence flares on the road, in the air, or on
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In an Atlantic Monthly article two years ago, Michael Fumento
examined the widely reported ``road rage'' phenomenon. Far from
finding an epidemic of ``road warriors,'' he documented that
highway accidents actually had been declining. It was not the
statistical reality, but the rhetoric of politicians, pundits, and
the psycho-babble industry that had convinced Americans that
pulling onto the Interstate was a high-risk activity.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the appeal of the trendy explanation for bad
behavior continues unabated. Last week airline attendants across
the country distributed leaflets urging the criminalization of
``air rage'' when it would seem far easier just to enforce existing
statutes prohibiting drunken and disorderly conduct and assault and
battery.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noting that Michael Costin was not the only
Massachusetts man to die a violent death last week. Jeffrey and
Thomas Sirois got into a fight last Saturday night after an
afternoon playing pool and drinking together at the bar at an
American Legion post in Fall River. According to witnesses, they
exchanged some heated words about their father before taking their
dispute outside. Thomas allegedly pulled a shotgun and wounded his
brother in the abdomen. He then turned the weapon on himself and
fired once, killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why Thomas Sirois, 25, shot his older brother,
Jeffrey, 28, that night and then committed suicide. I am, however,
willing to bet that sibling rivalry had as much to do with the
violence in Fall River as ``parental rage'' had to do with the
homicide in Reading.

THE UNWANTED GAZE 
The Destruction of Privacy in America 
By Jeffrey Rosen 
Random House, 274 pp., $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For much of the past century, two dystopian visions have loomed
over Western society.
</P>
<P>
   The more well known, George Orwell's ``1984,'' imagined a future
dominated by the tyranny of an external oppressor, an all-knowing
political police force that tracks not only our movements but our
most intimate thoughts. In the other dim forecast, Aldous Huxley's
``Brave New World,'' we become our own oppressors, in that we learn
to prefer mindlessness or the absence of conscience to the valleys
and peaks of human emotion, from bliss to depression.
</P>
<P>
   But as new technologies combine with new laws in this new
century, dusty dystopian prophecies must adapt to new realities. In
Jeffrey Rosen's limpid look at America in ``The Unwanted Gaze,'' we
realize how we have created, to some extent, what we tried to
prevent. By seeking to expand our freedoms, we have limited them.
And in trying to raise consciousness, we have helped to stultify
it. In many ways, Rosen observes, we have become the victim of our
own good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous legal-affairs commentator, who chronicled the
Monica Lewinsky affair for The New Republic and The New Yorker, has
now produced a trenchant essay that speaks not of a distant
dictatorship but of a present and ever-more threatening tyranny,
one few are aware of until they become its victims. It's all told
through the prism of the familiar sex scandal. And Monica Lewinsky,
as dubious an innocent bystander as she may be, is the victim; Ken
Starr, the prying independent counsel and the face of the new laws,
is the oppressor.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky saga, Rosen writes, is significant because it
represents the depths to which our legal system has sunk, and how
the courts and government have steadily eroded our traditional
privacy rights. The essence of today's tyranny, Rosen argues, comes
from the confluence of the electronic era with sea changes in the
law regarding those rights. The age of the Internet, in which
confidential documents often come in the legally dubious form of
e-mails, has redefined the meaning of private papers. It has also,
to some extent, created a new measure of our identities. For, if we
are what we think, then who we are _ or what people judge us to be
_ can be divined by the Web sites we view, chat rooms we visit, the
e-mails we write, or the things we buy online.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Rosen explains, is that this dramatic new medium _
which records intimate thoughts and decisions for anyone to access,
anywhere _ has arisen after decades' worth of sexual-harassment law
has effectively scaled back our Fourth Amendment protections. And
it comes at a time when the line between the office and home,
thanks in the large part to the Internet, has grown increasingly
blurry.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual-harassment law, Rosen writes, has devolved considerably
from its laudable intention of protecting employees against
quid-pro-quo threats, such as a boss linking an employee's job to
sexual favors. The innovations in the law have expanded victims'
rights. Monica Lewinsky might never have become a household name
had Clinton not signed a law in 1994 to reform federal rules of
evidence. The new rules specifically allowed juries in certain
cases to consider evidence that the accused had committed similar
crimes in the past. That reform empowered Paula Jones's lawyers to
fish for lurid details about Clinton's previous liaisons, and
eventually helped justify Starr's seizure of Lewinsky's computer,
her receipts from Washington bookstores, and the infamous dress.
</P>
<P>
   Another legal evolution, perhaps more nefarious for privacy
rights in that its principles are now engraved in corporate
policies and university handbooks, has established protections
against a ``hostile environment.'' This vaguer category of
harassment, which may come in the form of foul language or dirty
pictures, has had the effect of making companies and even
universities more closely monitor the speech of their employees and
students. Because it is the company or university that can be sued
for such a hostile environment, they have been forced to protect
themselves, becoming more vigilant, monitoring everything from
e-mail to viewed Web pages. And for Rosen, the heightened
surveillance throughout the country recalls Orwell's Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting against lewd and crude behavior is not itself a bad
thing, Rosen maintains. But he believes there are better remedies.
Many hostile-environment cases prosecuted under
gender-discrimination laws, he argues, would be better dealt with
under invasion-of-privacy law. That would serve the purpose of
redrawing the lines of culpability, from the company to the
offending individual. And, he argues, it would reduce the need for
companies and universities to monitor speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is a blunderbuss rather than a scalpel,'' Rosen
writes, ``and recent scandals in Washington and the workplace have
taught us that the effort to provide legal remedies for relatively
minor invasions of privacy may inadvertently lead to privacy
violations greater than those the law seeks to redress.''

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Two years ago, when Michele Jaffe earned her
doctorate in comparative literature of the Renaissance from Harvard
University, she faced two career options.
</P>
<P>
   She could teach Renaissance literature to college students,
helping them analyze the poetic structure of Petrarch's ``Scattered
Rhymes'' and the metaphoric underpinnings of Dante's ``Divine
Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or she could write historical romance novels.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe went the route of the bodice-ripper, and today she's as
ecstatic as her lovestruck heroine, Sophie Champion. Her second
book, ``The Water Nymph'' (Pocket Books) _ a sensual story of
seduction set in Renaissance England _ was published this month,
and Jaffe is ``over the moon'' with the enthusiastic response.
Letters have been pouring in from readers, with comments like
``Your book is a wonderful story I could not put down.'' Publishers
Weekly calls it a ``rollicking adventure'' and ``great read'' and
marks Jaffe as ``a writer to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, considering her readership, ``The Water
Nymph'' got a rave rating of four and a half stars out of five in
last month's Romantic Times, a fanzine for devotees of romance
books. And she is already engrossed in ``The Firefly,'' her next
installment in an anticipated seven-book series, all featuring the
Arboretti cousins, a half-English, half-Italian family of merchant
princes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Water Nymph'' takes place in England in 1588, on the eve
of the battle of the Spanish Armada. The protagonists are Sophie
Champion, an intoxicating, if phobic, beauty with a pressing
mystery to solve, and the smooth and charming Crispin Foscari, earl
of Sandal, one of Queen Elizabeth's secret and most trusted
operatives. They are enemies, yet passionate lovers. The book takes
more twists and turns than a labyrinth in the English countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its historical intricacies _ informed by Jaffe's 8
1/2 years as an undergraduate and graduate student at Harvard _ the
book is a romance novel through and through. That is, it satisfies
the definition laid out, in writing, by the 8,200-member Romance
Writers of America. To wit: The main plot ``concerns two people
falling in love and struggling to make the relationship work'' and
it has ``an emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending . . .
which ``makes the reader feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   And proudly so. Jaffe has little patience for the ``snob
element'' out there _ readers who snub her genre as ``tawdry'' or,
even worse, who suspect she writes these books as a kind of joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to me, `Of course, you are writing ironically,
aren't you?' '' says Jaffe. ``But I don't. I think of these as
adventure stories for women, with a love element. It's just that
cynicism is a much more acceptable posture, especially in the
pseudo-elite world of Cambridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe, originally from Los Angeles, knows this world intimately.
At Harvard, she studied the history and literature of the
Renaissance and Reformation in Italy, England, and France; her
senior thesis was on 16th-century courtesans in Venice _
``fascinating women,'' she says, ``who make their money in the
company of men.''
</P>
<P>
   Her addiction to romance novels started accidentally. Six years
ago, when Jaffe was 24, her mother died of breast cancer. She was
in graduate school at the time, and a roommate recommended a few of
her favorite romance novels to help Jaffe lift her spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They helped me through a very difficult time,'' says Jaffe.
For weeks, she devoured a book a day, discovering that the novels
were ``the best and easiest way for me to access my emotions. The
key thing for me was knowing the books would end happily. They were
a safe place to feel sad, because at the end, I could have this
redemptive moment. I was sobbing a great deal, although there was
this confusion of whether I was sobbing for the characters or
myself or my mother. You can sort of go through all stages of
grieving in the life of a romance novel _ anger and guilt and grief
and frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe is a quick-witted woman who defies any stereotype of the
modern romance writer in America. ``I don't think there are many
people like her out there,'' Susan Ginsburg, her literary agent,
puts it.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, she's an Ivy League alum who has an
intellectual romance with language. She passionately despairs of
what she sees as ``the end of punctuation'' in contemporary
English, for example, and is accumulating theories for an article
she plans to write about the Internet's effect on speech patterns.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she pens a mean historical romance. Her long
curly red hair _ no, make that her dangling ruby tresses _ and the
4-inch fuzzy pink stiletto mules she fancies are evocative of the
world of her characters. If she wrote her books in a turret, you
wouldn't be surprised. In fact, the color scheme of her home office
in her Cambridge apartment is a startling, sensuous pink _ walls,
telephone, velvet couch, and even computer printer.
</P>
<P>
   She maintains that she still doesn't completely understand why
she fell in love with the lush and lurid Renaissance period, having
grown up in a ``minimalist home, which my parents decorated all
Scandinavian and teak. Maybe there was something about the
voluptuousness of it. Or maybe it's because I have curly hair. I
don't know if it was something latent, or if in another life I was
a Renaissance courtesan.''
</P>
<P>
   But the summer after her sophomore year, she took a trip to
Venice, which clearly seems to have ``sealed my fate. That was it.
I knew I was home. I spent the rest of my academic career getting
back there; I visited Venice every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first book, a 1999 novel called ``The Stargazer,'' is a
murder mystery set in Renaissance Venice. She wrote it in 1996, the
year she and her husband, a consultant in the field of physical
oceanography, lived in Venice ``while I was supposed to be doing
research for my dissertation.''
</P>
<P>
   In both books, her characters tend to struggle with their sexual
impulses, and they generally lose the battle. Her books are ``not
pornographic, but they are sexy,'' says Ginsburg of Writers House,
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe adds that her mother-in-law called her after reading ``The
Stargazer,'' saying she had blushed and could ``never look you in
the face again.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs. ``I didn't think it was very steamy. But it turned
out I was a poor judge of that.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Like Winnie the Pooh, Yasser Arafat loves honey.
Some of his colleagues believe his daily intake of the stuff,
bought at some expense in Yemen and poured into his tea, is the
reason that he is still in action, travelling from country to
country, tirelessly pressing his cause.
</P>
<P>
   He also sleeps well _ five hours at night, three in the
afternoon _ and eats heartily. Though watery of eye, and troubled
by an oscillating lower lip brought on by Parkinson's disease, the
Palestinian leader is still in fairly good fettle, given his
advanced years, his exhausting and dangerous career and his heavy
workload.
</P>
<P>
   Which is just as well. Because the same cannot be said of the
Palestinian state that may, or may not, now be approaching birth _
depending on the outcome of the tripartite summit in Camp David,
Md., which began on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel and the Palestinians reach an agreement and Arafat,
69, declares his state _ perhaps on Sept. 13, perhaps later _ it
will be shackled from the start.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union collapsed, it produced a litter of new
``democracies'' most of which were commandeered by Soviet-era
leaders even before the cheering had died out in the West.
</P>
<P>
   These hard men _ Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Haidar Aliyev
of Azerbaijan, and others _ quietly restored their nations to their
true colors as corrupt dictatorships. Palestine is also in danger
of making a poor start.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not so much the human-rights abuses that have
characterized Arafat's rule (though it seems unlikely, he can
always ease up, arguing that tough measures were necessary in the
transition to independence).
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is mismanagement and corruption. This is a
product of Arafat's practice of concentrating power on himself,
shored up by a plethora of security services and supporters who
have been rewarded for their loyalty _ and particularly for keeping
Islamic militancy at bay _ with stakes in big business monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   You need only to drive around the Gaza Strip to see the results.
On a headland overlooking the long, straight beach _ where
penniless Gazan fishermen stand in the surf _ stands the palatial
home of one of the biggest fish in the security services.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, there are more small palaces, wreathed with
balconies, belonging to top officials. Fed with perks and
sweetheart deals, these men will do all they can to protect their
interests when Arafat eventually goes.
</P>
<P>
   As there is a good chance that no one among those tipped to
succeed him will command enough support to win a fair election,
there is a real risk that the security forces will decide the
outcome _ in favor of their chosen candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Questions such as these are preying on the minds of the
Palestinian intelligentsia almost as much as those that will be
under discussion in the United States this week when Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton gather
at the presidential retreat and attempt to recreate the history
made by Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat just over two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are momentous: how much of the West Bank will Israel
return (90 percent is the most commonly quoted figure) and how much
will it keep for the 180,000 Jewish settlers who have illegally
seized Arab land in the name of religion and Zionism?
</P>
<P>
   And what about Gaza, where Israel still holds 40 percent of the
land? How much water will Palestine control? Will it get any of
East Jerusalem _ and if not can there be a deal? Will refugees have
the right to return, and will they get compensation?
</P>
<P>
   And _ when all is said and done _ will the new, independent
Palestine ultimately be anything more than a hodgepodge of land,
without a real army, linked frailly together by bridges or tunnels,
whose population cannot live without the menial jobs on offer from
the mighty consumer society next door?
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are entering the talks in a pessimistic mood.
They will be seeking a symbolic recognition from Israel that their
new state is based on the terms of U.N. Resolution 242 (which
restores the borders prior to June 1967), even though they will get
less.
</P>
<P>
   They also want an acknowledgement from Israel _ again, in
effect, symbolic _ of the right of return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that these matters will obscure discussion about the
quality of the new Palestinian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people fought for so long just to be another
stereotype Arab country,'' said Raji Sourani, director of the
Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza. ``We want to be a good
example to the rest of the world and we deserve it.'' &QL;

Some of his colleagues believe his daily intake of the stuff,
bought at some expense in Yemen and poured into his tea, is the
reason that he is still in action, travelling from country to
country, tirelessly pressing his cause.
</P>
<P>
   He also sleeps well _ five hours at night, three in the
afternoon _ and eats heartily. Though watery of eye, and troubled
by an oscillating lower lip brought on by Parkinson's disease, the
Palestinian leader is still in fairly good fettle, given his
advanced years, his exhausting and dangerous career and his heavy
workload.
</P>
<P>
   Which is just as well. Because the same cannot be said of the
Palestinian state that may, or may not, now be approaching birth _
depending on the outcome of the tripartite summit in Camp David,
Md., which began on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel and the Palestinians reach an agreement and Arafat,
69, declares his state _ perhaps on Sept. 13, perhaps later _ it
will be shackled from the start.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union collapsed, it produced a litter of new
``democracies'' most of which were commandeered by Soviet-era
leaders even before the cheering had died out in the West.
</P>
<P>
   These hard men _ Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Haidar Aliyev
of Azerbaijan, and others _ quietly restored their nations to their
true colors as corrupt dictatorships. Palestine is also in danger
of making a poor start.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not so much the human-rights abuses that have
characterized Arafat's rule (though it seems unlikely, he can
always ease up, arguing that tough measures were necessary in the
transition to independence).
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is mismanagement and corruption. This is a
product of Arafat's practice of concentrating power on himself,
shored up by a plethora of security services and supporters who
have been rewarded for their loyalty _ and particularly for keeping
Islamic militancy at bay _ with stakes in big business monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   You need only to drive around the Gaza Strip to see the results.
On a headland overlooking the long, straight beach _ where
penniless Gazan fishermen stand in the surf _ stands the palatial
home of one of the biggest fish in the security services.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away, there are more small palaces, wreathed with
balconies, belonging to top officials. Fed with perks and
sweetheart deals, these men will do all they can to protect their
interests when Arafat eventually goes.
</P>
<P>
   As there is a good chance that no one among those tipped to
succeed him will command enough support to win a fair election,
there is a real risk that the security forces will decide the
outcome _ in favor of their chosen candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Questions such as these are preying on the minds of the
Palestinian intelligentsia almost as much as those that will be
under discussion in the United States this week when Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton gather
at the presidential retreat and attempt to recreate the history
made by Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat just over two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The issues are momentous: how much of the West Bank will Israel
return (90 percent is the most commonly quoted figure) and how much
will it keep for the 180,000 Jewish settlers who have illegally
seized Arab land in the name of religion and Zionism?
</P>
<P>
   And what about Gaza, where Israel still holds 40 percent of the
land? How much water will Palestine control? Will it get any of
East Jerusalem _ and if not can there be a deal? Will refugees have
the right to return, and will they get compensation?
</P>
<P>
   And _ when all is said and done _ will the new, independent
Palestine ultimately be anything more than a hodgepodge of land,
without a real army, linked frailly together by bridges or tunnels,
whose population cannot live without the menial jobs on offer from
the mighty consumer society next door?
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are entering the talks in a pessimistic mood.
They will be seeking a symbolic recognition from Israel that their
new state is based on the terms of U.N. Resolution 242 (which
restores the borders prior to June 1967), even though they will get
less.
</P>
<P>
   They also want an acknowledgement from Israel _ again, in
effect, symbolic _ of the right of return of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is that these matters will obscure discussion about the
quality of the new Palestinian society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people fought for so long just to be another
stereotype Arab country,'' said Raji Sourani, director of the
Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza. ``We want to be a good
example to the rest of the world and we deserve it.'' &QL;

&HT;     GIRLS' JUMP ROPE DREAM TAKES ON ADULT DIMENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KRIS WORRELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ When Tahira Reid was in the third grade at Public
School 97 in the Bronx, she entered a contest at school in which
students had to make a poster of something they wished they had.
Reid drew a picture of two poles with ropes (made from glued yarn)
and a girl jumping in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called it an automatic double-Dutch jump rope turner, which
was kind of a long name,'' Reid said of her childhood design. ``I
was frustrated. I used to like playing double Dutch but I could
only play when I got to school because that's when a lot of girls
were there to turn the ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 23, Reid has finally seen her girlhood dream materialize. As
a sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, three years ago
she and some classmates created the Double Dutch Jump Rope Machine,
a device that uses two motors about 12 feet apart to turn two ropes
in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype consists of motors and gears atop two carts from
the student machine shop, balanced with plywood and cinder blocks.
It does not always work perfectly. Sometimes one of the motors runs
slower than the other, tripping up Reid as she tries to
demonstrate.
</P>
<P>
   But when it works properly, the ropes clack against the floor in
that familiar rhythm and Reid jumps and spins and counts, 1, 2, 3,
4, and she looks as if she's back on some Bronx block, playing with
the other girls.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Reid sees the double-Dutch machine as something people
should use together, as well as solo.
</P>
<P>
   ``People could jump and not worry about having to turn or
getting tired,'' she said, noting that not everyone is as precise a
turner as the machine will be. And let's face it, everybody wants
to jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like another treadmill. No one has this,'' said RPI
Professor Burt L. Swersey, who taught the class in introduction to
engineering design, where Reid devised her machine. ``This is like
the Wright brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who with co-inventor Andrew Burdick was assigned a patent
for the machine, received a $10,000 grant from the National
Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance. Out of those funds
she developed two more prototypes and paid for patent lawyer fees.
Reid, who graduated from RPI in May with a bachelor's degree in
mechanical engineering, is now looking for more sources of funding
so she can continue working on the prototype and eventually start
her own business.
</P>
<P>
   When she was a kid, she learned to double Dutch from her aunt,
who is only six years older than Reid.
</P>
<P>
   Even after she won first prize for her poster depicting the
``automatic double-Dutch jump rope turner,'' it was some time
before she pursued the invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't mechanically inclined,'' said Reid, who graduated as
high school valedictorian. ``I wasn't a tinkering type of child
that took things apart.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Swersey told her class to come up with something
that ``challenged the limits of sports and recreational
activities'' that Reid recalled her third-grade idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas come to fruition if you're in an environment that's
conducive to creativity,'' said Reid, who is by turns serious,
modest and enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tahira is one of my heroes,'' said Swersey. ``She's so
serious, so determined, so personable. And she's very creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid believes that there is a strong market out there for a
machine like hers, which she envisions selling to corporate
sponsors who will then donate the machines to community groups such
as YWCAs and Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Other potential users
are professional jumping teams and even fitness enthusiasts who
want something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the next Microsoft we're talking about here. But it
is an interesting approach to a niche market,'' said Phil
Weilerstein, director of the National Collegiate Inventors and
Innovators Alliance. ``Maybe this will be the new Hula-Hoop and
there'll be one on every street corner.''

</P>
<P>
   According to Bud Pickett, executive director of the United
States Amateur Jump Rope Federation, there are lots of eager fans
out there who would jump at the chance to practice jumping.
Thousands of jumpers participate in competitions each year, he
said, and more than 600 competed in the national contest, held
earlier this month at Disney World. Competitions are aired several
times a year on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think it'll be successful,'' Swersey said. ``The
machine's actually going to be better than turning by hand. This is
a way of being precise and giving a whole new level to the sport.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Camp David, once named Shangri-La, was a retreat
for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt from the stifling heat
which blankets Washington in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents ever since have used it as a vacation home, a place
to entertain guests and a workplace where the daily pressures can
be held at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote of the place: ``I
couldn't for the life of me find out what Camp David was. Not even
our Embassy in Washington could tell us. We were finally informed
that Camp David was what we would call a `dacha.'''
</P>
<P>
   The cabins, named after trees, sit on the side of a small
mountain in 135 acres of woods, and meetings are supposed to be
less pressured but also at arms length from the press.
</P>
<P>
   This quaint theory ignores the existence of cell phones: at
previous meetings, both sides have briefed reporters extensively
while the talks were under way.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of Thurmont, the nearest town to Camp David,
were somewhat blase at the flurry of activity on their doorstep.
They seemed more concerned with the local fire department's annual
carnival, according to reporters who had travelled to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done this before,'' said Wayne Stackhouse, president of
the fire company. ``Reporters and (officials) were all hustling and
bustling around. The townspeople kind of took a back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   All 97 hotel rooms in Thurmont sold out within hours of the
announcement of this week's summit. Thurmont Elementary School will
house the press, with separate classrooms for the Israeli and
Palestinian press (who get on no better than one might imagine).
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and Israeli officials are staying at the Rambler
Motel; the Cozy Country Inn, where bedrooms are named after
presidents and news organizations, is the other main place in town.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan Cottage has a queen-size water bed and a
corner-mirrored Jacuzzi; the Kennedy Room has a bidet. The Clinton
Room has no special facilities, but does have chocolate cigars, a
gesture which the owners were apparently thinking of at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Freeze, who runs the Cozy Country Inn, remembered a
previous U.S.-Soviet summit when Russian officials descended on the
bar and staged a drinking contest with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians won that one, no comparison,'' he told the
Washington Post. &QL;

IN THE US, A CHANCE FOR REFUGE FOR SUDANESE BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are known as the lost boys, several thousand young Sudanese
men who have spent their adolescences on the run, fleeing war,
famine, and slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to officials at the State Department and the US
Catholic Conference, the US government will soon admit most of the
young Sudanese men as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church, which runs the largest refugee resettlement
program in the country, will help many find a home in several
American cities.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the past decade, these young men, children of two
tribes of Sudanese cattle herders, have been orphaned and wounded,
forced into military service and involuntary labor, and shuttled
from country to country.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 to 4,000 young men are victims of one of the world's
most prolonged conflicts, a 17-year religious war that produced a
humanitarian crisis described as the worst in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   The men are expected to be one of the most challenging groups
encountered by resettlement officials because of their disrupted
childhoods. Most of them spent years without any semblance of the
social structure imposed by adults. They have had little education,
they have had no exposure to urban life, and they will be moving to
cities without large communities of Sudanese immigrants who might
ease their transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group is going to be different because, unlike a Cuban
refugee or a Bosnian refugee, they're going to come here with zero
English, zero work skills, and most of them will find a doorknob a
fascinating technological gadget because they come from a very
primitive rural milieu,'' said Joseph Doolin, president of Catholic
Charities in Boston. ``But we believe that everyone has the
intrinsic right to a decent life, and as part of an international
organization _ the church _ we work to improve the opportunities
and the life that individuals have.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan has been engulfed in civil war between the Muslim north
and the Christian and animist south for 17 years, during which more
than 2 million people have died, mostly from starvation, and
another 4.5 million have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
   The US government and human rights groups have accused the
Islamic party, which seized power in the Sudan in 1989, guilty of
supporting terrorism and committing genocide through massacres,
slavery, and ``calculated starvation,'' by eliminating sources of
food and then preventing access to aid.
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian crisis in the Sudan is arguably the world's
most dire. Representative Christopher H. Smith, a New Jersey
Republican, said last month that the situation in the Sudan ``may
well be the most widespread, systematic, and brutal crimes against
humanity being committed anywhere in the world today.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a State Department official who asked not to be
identified, the Sudanese men are mostly members of the Dinka and
Nuer peoples, ethnic groups who live along the Nile in southern
Sudan and have an economy based on cattle herding. The young men,
many of whom are orphans, fled Sudan to avoid forced conscription
or slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The men spent the late 1980s in Ethiopia, were expelled by that
country back to Sudan, and eventually fled to Kenya, where they
have been living in a refugee camp since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the boys, based on what they have gone
through, have no prospects for returning back to where they came
from,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has agreed to consider for resettlement most
of the Sudanese young men, based on a recommendation by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and is now beginning to
conduct interviews to make sure those recommended are eligible and
do not pose a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Once they arrive in the United States, perhaps beginning this
year, they will be cared for by one of 10 resettlement agencies, of
which the Catholic Church is the largest. Since 1975, the Catholic
Church has resettled about 800,000 refugees in the United States,
about one-third of all refugees during that period, according to
Marie Quinlan, a spokeswoman for the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The largest groups of refugees have been from Vietnam and other
parts of southeast Asia, from Bosnia and other parts of eastern
Europe, and from Cuba and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Charities in Boston resettles about 300 refugees each
year, including a small handful of Sudanese refugees over the last
several years. The agency, using mostly federal funds, houses,
feeds and trains refugees, with a goal of providing them the
language, work and life skills so they can live on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been lost boys for their entire childhoods,
wandering around on foot, avoiding bombs and bullets and also
avoiding being drafted into one army or another, and once they got
situated they kind of established their own little family units,''
said Claire Carroll, director of refugee and immigration services
for Catholic Charities of Boston. ``Our goal will be to help them
become completely self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Sudanese are thought to be Catholic, but the church
resettles refugees regardless of religious affiliation and does not
use its refugee resettlement programs for proselytization,
according to church officials.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist on international issues who recently visited Sudan
lauded the effort to bring the refugees to the United States, but
said the world must do more to help end the civil war there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got millions of displaced people, it's easy to say
that taking a few thousand people out isn't very important, but
then you'd end up doing nothing,'' said Elliott Abrams, chairman of
the US Commission on International Religious Freedom. ``Ultimately,
this can't be the main answer, because you can't take all those
displaced people out of the country, but if you ask, `Where is the
leadership of tomorrow's Sudan?' maybe among those 3,000 to 4,000
boys who are now going to get an education you'll find it.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Camp David, once named Shangri-La, was a retreat
for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt from the stifling heat
which blankets Washington in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents ever since have used it as a vacation home, a place
to entertain guests and a workplace where the daily pressures can
be held at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote of the place: ``I
couldn't for the life of me find out what Camp David was. Not even
our Embassy in Washington could tell us. We were finally informed
that Camp David was what we would call a `dacha.'''
</P>
<P>
   The cabins, named after trees, sit on the side of a small
mountain in 135 acres of woods, and meetings are supposed to be
less pressured but also at arms length from the press.
</P>
<P>
   This quaint theory ignores the existence of cell phones: at
previous meetings, both sides have briefed reporters extensively
while the talks were under way.
</P>
<P>
   The inhabitants of Thurmont, the nearest town to Camp David,
were somewhat blase at the flurry of activity on their doorstep.
They seemed more concerned with the local fire department's annual
carnival, according to reporters who had travelled to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done this before,'' said Wayne Stackhouse, president of
the fire company. ``Reporters and (officials) were all hustling and
bustling around. The townspeople kind of took a back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   All 97 hotel rooms in Thurmont sold out within hours of the
announcement of this week's summit. Thurmont Elementary School will
house the press, with separate classrooms for the Israeli and
Palestinian press (who get on no better than one might imagine).
</P>
<P>
   Reporters and Israeli officials are staying at the Rambler
Motel; the Cozy Country Inn, where bedrooms are named after
presidents and news organizations, is the other main place in town.
</P>
<P>
   The Reagan Cottage has a queen-size water bed and a
corner-mirrored Jacuzzi; the Kennedy Room has a bidet. The Clinton
Room has no special facilities, but does have chocolate cigars, a
gesture which the owners were apparently thinking of at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Freeze, who runs the Cozy Country Inn, remembered a
previous U.S.-Soviet summit when Russian officials descended on the
bar and staged a drinking contest with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians won that one, no comparison,'' he told the
Washington Post. &QL;

   FRANCE-CHALLENGES _ France has just taken over the rotating
presidency of the European Union and is riding a winning streak at
home: Consumer confidence is high. The World Health Organization
just rated France the nation with the best healthcare. And the
French even won the European soccer championship this month, making
their team the first to ever hold the world and Europe
championships at the same time. But, as Bastille Day approaches,
the nation also faces new challenges _ some of them prickly ones
related to the EU leadership. A talk with Consul General Jean-Paul

   NAACP-GORE _ BALTIMORE - Saying ``talk is cheap,'' Vice
President Al Gore launched a stinging attack Wednesday at the NAACP
convention on George W. Bush, his presidential rival. Gore said
Bush's words of conciliation to the convention this week mean

Undoing Racism workshops among others, will draw community
organizers from throughout the United States for workshops and

it is hoped the school will play a role in futhering redevelopment
of the historic African-American district. (Manuel, Atlanta

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ LUFKIN, Texas _ I stopped by my doctor's
office this week for help with an insurance form, still trying to
get reimbursed for a medical bill I paid last December. That was
back when I last had pneumonia. The doctor cured me, but it looks
like I'm going to die of frustration waiting for the insurance
company to pay me what it owes me. (Murray, Lufkin Daily News)

   EDITORIAL-LEE _ Feds' case against Wen Ho Lee gets weaker and
weaker. Now it turns out the nations to which he is accused of
offering his services and ``harming the U.S.'' were allies like
Germany and Australia. The charges against him are full of holes,
yet he is isolated and shackled like America's Public Enemy No. 1.

   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ At the same time that Congress is arguing over

age as elderly, old or senior. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald).

   XMEN _ It started in 1963 as The Uncanny X-Men. The comic book
by Stan Lee introduced five pupils at Xavier's School for Gifted
Youngsters. They possessed a mutant ``X gene'' that gives them
special powers that humans fear and distrust. Professor Charles
Xavier teaches these five X-Men to control their emerging powers to
fight evil and help mutants and humans coexist. While the comic
book has been a top seller for decades and spawned a popular Fox
cartoon, not many people know just who the X-Men are. That may
change with Friday's big-screen movie X-Men, starring Patrick
Stewart, Ian McKellen and Halle Berry, and directed by Bryan Singer
(The Usual Suspects). So, you're not a cult comic book reader.

   BEIRUT _ Having a wonderful time _ wish you were here. Which is
more or less the message on the ream of postcards now selling
across Lebanon, courtesy of the Islamic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The theme, of course, is predictable: the retreat of the Israeli
army from southern Lebanon and the Hezbollah guerrilla movement's
belief that this constitutes a stunning military victory over the
Middle East's most powerful army. Their celebration is as unique as
it is coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   There are postcards of ``martyrs'' undertaking their last attack
against Israeli troops and of babies carrying Hezbollah flags
against Israeli bunkers; Hezbollah keychains and car bumper
stickers; and pennants for motorcycles, each carrying the guerrilla
army's Arabic logo with a Kalashnikov rifle forming the ``ll'' in
``Hezbollah.''
</P>
<P>
   In one colored card, the Hezbollah chairman, Sayed Hassan
Nasrallah, stands above the clouds alongside his son Hadi, killed
two years ago in an attack on an Israeli position inside southern
Lebanon. Ayatollah Khomeini looks down upon both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ranks of guerrilla fighters march to their deaths. A toddler
holding a Hezbollah flag clambers up the side of an Israeli gun
revetment. A guerrilla loads a Katyusha rocket on to its rack.
</P>
<P>

Nasrallah and Abbas Moussawi _ Nasrallah's predecessor who was
assassinated, along with his wife and son, in an attack by an
Israeli helicopter pilot.

   ``One thousand for each photo,'' the urchin selling the
postcards demanded outside the Hezbollah's mosque in the Ouzai
suburb of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors beat him down to 500 Lebanese pounds _ 20p - a card.
Someone, I suspect, is making a killing. Then again, Hezbollah
provides thousands of dollars a year to the families of their
``martyrs,'' to Lebanon's poor in medical services and construction
work, an entire social fabric which is to be the foundation of the
movement's domestic political future (the next parliamentary
elections start at the end of August).
</P>
<P>
   In one card, Moussawi looks down from heaven, a paradise of blue
rivers and red flowers quite different from the barren hillsides,
polluted streams and overbuilt lands where his men died in such
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And beside one pile of cards, I found the ultimate gift for
every war junkie: a two-hour video of attacks on Israeli military
compounds, filmed by Hezbollah's very own cameramen. &QL;

   BEIRUT _ Having a wonderful time _ wish you were here. Which is
more or less the message on the ream of postcards now selling
across Lebanon, courtesy of the Islamic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The theme, of course, is predictable: the retreat of the Israeli
army from southern Lebanon and the Hezbollah guerrilla movement's
belief that this constitutes a stunning military victory over the
Middle East's most powerful army. Their celebration is as unique as
it is coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   There are postcards of ``martyrs'' undertaking their last attack
against Israeli troops and of babies carrying Hezbollah flags

stickers; and pennants for motorcycles, each carrying the guerrilla

   MARJAYOUN, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ Was this what victory was for? Was
this why the Hezbollah lost their hundreds of ``martyrs'' in their
18-year conflict with Israel and its Lebanese militia allies? To
blow up a war memorial?
</P>
<P>
   True, it wasn't much of a garden of remembrance; a domed,
half-eggshell building decorated with a cross and a half-moon and
the names of almost 300 ``South Lebanon Army'' militiamen engraved
on brass plates that had been screwed into a set of concrete walls.
</P>
<P>
   It stood on the top of a hill within sight of Israel, the
foreign land whom the SLA men had been paid to defend. And over the
entrance were written the words: ``Eternity to Our Heroic
Martyrs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they were collaborators, Lebanese working for their
country's enemy. Some of them were brutal, cruel men who had been
present at _ perhaps even participated in _ dreadful deeds of
torture within the walls of Khiam prison, now a museum of human
darkness on the hill opposite.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the dead were blackmailed by the Israelis into
joining the militia, boy-soldiers whose brothers or fathers would
have been imprisoned if they had not served Israel's cause in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And I suspected, when I first saw the memorial garden six weeks
ago, that it would fall victim to liberation, that it would be _ I
quote my report that day in the Independent _ ``the first place to
be destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I discovered just how total a victim it had become:
blasted by explosives, pulverized into dust, even the trees cut
down by the power of the bombs planted around it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the destruction, every brass name had been torn from the
concrete, every reference to the town from which the dead had come;
even the roses from the garden had been stolen. Then explosives had
been primed at the center of each memorial wall and within the
cupola with its legend about eternity.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose I should not have been surprised. When I last came
here, I found a Shiite man cutting away at a brass plaque with a
knife, gouging from the wall the name of Ali Ibrahim Hashem, one of
the most senior SLA officers, a father of three children blown up
by a Hezbollah mine on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am taking this one because it is still fresh,'' the Shiite
had told me with a laugh. Killing the dead, I called it.
</P>
<P>
   So what was I to make of all this rubble and burned trees and
blasted walls? Yes, it was an occupier's memorial. They were
collaborators. Some of them _ not all, but some _ were wicked men.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Hezbollah could have called it a ``traitor's''
memorial but left it intact. Because the dead were Lebanese. Of
both Muslim and Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   A few local Christians were timidly videotaping the evidence
while I was there, capturing on film this surreal attempt to erase
history. What was it supposed to achieve, I wondered? And what
comes next?
</P>
<P>
   Are the SLA's enemies now going to dig up the dead? Already, the
Hezbollah are erecting their ``memorials,'' banners at the site of
each guerrilla ambush, listing the name of each anti-Israeli
suicide bomber and the date of his death.
</P>
<P>
   In days to come, it's possible their enemies will destroy those
banners too. And one comes back to the old Lebanese question: if
you do what the bad guys do, what is the difference between you and
them? &QL;

<P>
   AIT AL-SHAAB, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ The rocks were littered with
old Pepsi cans and empty water bottles and dead bushes but Haji
Mariam Badran scrambled towards the Israeli frontier wire with the
help of her stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my sister Sheikha on the phone and she promised to
be here at 11:30,'' the old woman wheezed. ``We have been here
since 10:30. And now the Israelis tell us to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariam Badran's story is as pitiful as it is tragic. In 1948,
she fled Palestine when the Jewish army attacked their village near
Acre. Her sister stayed with her mother. She lives in the squalor
of the Ein el-Helweh refugee camp in Lebanon; Sheikha still lives
in the family home, complete with an Israeli passport.
</P>
<P>
   And on the very day that Sheikha called from Israel to confirm
their meeting at the wire, the Israelis decided to call an end to
the family reunions over the frontier fence.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere beyond the green watchtower and the five Israeli
soldiers in their poncho hats, Sheikha was vainly waiting to see
Mariam. To no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Mariam's son Fadel and grandson Ahmed were with her. It was
little comfort. ``I will tell you how I came to be here and Sheikha
came to be there,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Jewish soldiers came in 1948, Sheikha and I were
sitting on our mother's lap at the front of our house. The Jews
fired into the air and I ran to the back of the house and across a
field where I came across my uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see my mother and sister though they ran into the
house. But my uncle thought they had fled and so he came here to
Lebanon with me. And that was how I lost my home and my sister
stayed there. I can never go back to live there.''
</P>
<P>
   For days, the Palestinians from the Lebanese camps had stood at
the wire in the midday heat, shouting at long-lost relatives on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Three young men got engaged to Israeli Arab girls _ Palestinian
girls _ from Haifa by shouting their promises through the barbed
wire. One of them thought the Israelis might permit a family visit
once the couple were married, that he might even obtain an Israeli
passport.
</P>
<P>
   A girl had called to her friends: ``I come from Sabra and
Chatila. Have you heard of that place? There was a massacre there.
You must resist. Don't let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis decided to end it all. They shouted at strangers
not to approach the frontier _ a useless instruction since the
strangers are in Lebanon and the Israelis must now remain behind
their frontier fence.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is now driving down both sides to verify a
total Israeli military withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road at Rmeich there are some very worried
Christian Lebanese villagers. The mother and father of Beshara Said
are standing outside the family home, only hours after 10
truckloads of heavily-armed Hezbollah men turned up to search their
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't let the police or the `mukhtar' (village leader)
into the house with them,'' Said's mother says. ``They didn't allow
the government forces of law and order to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Beshara Said was a member of Israel's
mercenary ``South Lebanon Army'' militia, that Hezbollah had
discovered he had fled to Israel and wanted to check out his home.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Said admitted ruefully that, yes, the Hezbollah men had
found guns and uniforms in the house.
</P>
<P>
   In their determination to avoid Christian-Muslim fighting, the
Hezbollah action might therefore be explained. But not allowing the
police to enter the Said household smacked of something else:
Hezbollah justice rather than state justice.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, Lebanon, Palestine. It's the old equation back at the
frontier fence _ with Syria still demanding the return of all the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights even without its former card in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mohamed Badran, Mariam's son, he was watching a swallow
dip and soar over the rocks and bushes. ``I just told my son Ahmed
to watch the bird,'' he said. ``And as we did, the bird flew over
the frontier wire into Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was a bird.'' &QL;

   AIT AL-SHAAB, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ The rocks were littered with
old Pepsi cans and empty water bottles and dead bushes but Haji
Mariam Badran scrambled towards the Israeli frontier wire with the
help of her stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my sister Sheikha on the phone and she promised to
be here at 11:30,'' the old woman wheezed. ``We have been here
since 10:30. And now the Israelis tell us to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariam Badran's story is as pitiful as it is tragic. In 1948,
she fled Palestine when the Jewish army attacked their village near
Acre. Her sister stayed with her mother. She lives in the squalor
of the Ein el-Helweh refugee camp in Lebanon; Sheikha still lives
in the family home, complete with an Israeli passport.
</P>
<P>
   And on the very day that Sheikha called from Israel to confirm
their meeting at the wire, the Israelis decided to call an end to
the family reunions over the frontier fence.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere beyond the green watchtower and the five Israeli
soldiers in their poncho hats, Sheikha was vainly waiting to see
Mariam. To no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Mariam's son Fadel and grandson Ahmed were with her. It was
little comfort. ``I will tell you how I came to be here and Sheikha
came to be there,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Jewish soldiers came in 1948, Sheikha and I were
sitting on our mother's lap at the front of our house. The Jews
fired into the air and I ran to the back of the house and across a
field where I came across my uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see my mother and sister though they ran into the
house. But my uncle thought they had fled and so he came here to
Lebanon with me. And that was how I lost my home and my sister
stayed there. I can never go back to live there.''
</P>
<P>
   For days, the Palestinians from the Lebanese camps had stood at
the wire in the midday heat, shouting at long-lost relatives on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Three young men got engaged to Israeli Arab girls _ Palestinian
girls _ from Haifa by shouting their promises through the barbed
wire. One of them thought the Israelis might permit a family visit
once the couple were married, that he might even obtain an Israeli
passport.
</P>
<P>
   A girl had called to her friends: ``I come from Sabra and
Chatila. Have you heard of that place? There was a massacre there.
You must resist. Don't let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis decided to end it all. They shouted at strangers
not to approach the frontier _ a useless instruction since the
strangers are in Lebanon and the Israelis must now remain behind
their frontier fence.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is now driving down both sides to verify a
total Israeli military withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Just down the road at Rmeich there are some very worried
Christian Lebanese villagers. The mother and father of Beshara Said
are standing outside the family home, only hours after 10
truckloads of heavily-armed Hezbollah men turned up to search their
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't let the police or the `mukhtar' (village leader)
into the house with them,'' Said's mother says. ``They didn't allow
the government forces of law and order to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Beshara Said was a member of Israel's
mercenary ``South Lebanon Army'' militia, that Hezbollah had
discovered he had fled to Israel and wanted to check out his home.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Said admitted ruefully that, yes, the Hezbollah men had
found guns and uniforms in the house.
</P>
<P>
   In their determination to avoid Christian-Muslim fighting, the
Hezbollah action might therefore be explained. But not allowing the
police to enter the Said household smacked of something else:
Hezbollah justice rather than state justice.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, Lebanon, Palestine. It's the old equation back at the
frontier fence _ with Syria still demanding the return of all the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights even without its former card in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mohamed Badran, Mariam's son, he was watching a swallow
dip and soar over the rocks and bushes. ``I just told my son Ahmed
to watch the bird,'' he said. ``And as we did, the bird flew over
the frontier wire into Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was a bird.'' &QL;

   SANGPO VILLAGE, China _ Ding Yufeng is a fifth-grade dropout.
That does not make him unusual in this booming village in central
China.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a regular user of e-mail and the World Wide Web.
That, too, is not unusual here in Sangpo Village.
</P>
<P>
   Once a ``poor, backwards, uneducated'' speck in Henan province,
in the words of one local official, Sangpo is now a wired outpost.
Its 4,800 residents boast private cars, cellular phones, about 100
personal computers and a bustling Internet cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But Sangpo Village didn't get rich growing wheat and corn, which
is how most of surrounding Mengzhou County makes a living. Having
very little land, village leaders realized long ago the road to
wealth lay in private enterprise, not agriculture. So it decided to
capitalize on a traditional handicraft of its Muslim population _
sheepskin processing.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years, the village has grown these backyard businesses
into a multi-million dollar niche market. It now processes 5
million sheepskins a year, almost half of China's total sheepskin
imports. Most come from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Sangpo, the green fields along the side of the road
suddenly give way to row after row of short wooden tents, each with
a sheepskin on top laid out to dry. The streets inside the village
are also lined with drying sheepskins. Sangpo proudly calls itself
China's ``Fur City.''
</P>
<P>
   The finished products are exported to Turkey and Italy as
leather for shoes and handbags, to Russia as blankets and to the
United States as sheepskin carseat covers. The arrival of the
Internet two years ago has not only been a boon to business, it has
allowed bored youngsters a window to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has shortened our distance with the rest of the
world,'' said Bai Huzhan, Sangpo's Communist vice-party secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sangpo is an anomaly in China or a sign of things to
come remains to be seen. Some rural areas have started using the
Internet to post pricing and market information for farmers, but
the digital divide between rich and poor is still enormous, and
growing wider.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million people have gone on-line in this country of
1.25 billion, according to the latest official estimates. But less
than 1 percent of the population even has Internet access, as users
are heavily concentrated in the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials in Mengzhou County _ where Sangpo Village
resides _ are happy for the tax revenue and jobs the village has
provided, but have yet to make any great efforts to wire the rest
of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Only 60 percent of households in Mengzhou County have
telephones. The largest town in the county has a couple of Internet
cafes, but few people can afford the fee of 3 yuan (US36 cents) an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Sangpo Internet cafe, which charges 4 yuan
(US48 cents) an hour, is packed in the evenings, and home telephone
penetration is closer to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology came quickly to Sangpo. In 1993, the only phone in
the village was at the government building. By 1994, it had 2,000
lines and today, it has more than 6,000. By 1998, Internet access
seemed like the natural next step. So village leaders convinced the
county to set up a computer training center.
</P>
<P>
   In Ding's home alone, there are five phone lines. Two of them
are dedicated to personal computers, which he says are in use at
least 12 hours a day _ if not 24 _ by the extended family of more
than 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two computers is not enough for the family,'' said his father,
Ding Cunzheng, who runs the family sheepskin processing business,
White Dragon Fur Factory.
</P>
<P>
   For years, White Dragon was a small enterprise making leather
jackets. But then the younger Ding, 23, discovered computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any hobbies. I just fooled around and wasted my
time,'' says Ding, sitting in the factory office where he seems
oblivious to the clinging smell of animal hides. ``But when I
started learning computers, I found I could work at it all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was using search engines to find sheepskin suppliers and
eventually sent e-mails to hundreds of them introducing his
father's factory. He got few replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our factory is too small,'' Ding said.
</P>
<P>
   But one business in Australia, where sheep outnumber humans, was
also small and looking for someone to buy its sheepskins. Before
long, another Internet match was made.
</P>
<P>
   White Dragon was able to cut out its middlemen and buy raw
materials directly from the Australian supplier. Its business
increased more than three-fold, and it now employs more than 40
workers, mostly from Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   If anything, this is perhaps the dirty secret of Sangpo's
success. Cleaning, combing, cutting sheepskins is filthy work. It's
no work for rich villagers, especially those with two private cars
and 13 cell phones, as the Ding family has.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official population of the village is under 5,000,
the actual number of residents is closer to 11,000. The difference
being the laborers who've come from other towns and provinces for
jobs. They live in factory dorms and get paid by the piece, showing
that even Chinese villages take advantage of cheap Chinese labor.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity of the village has made its residents rather
lazy, laments Bai, the vice-party secretary. Money came easily, and
loftier goals were viewed as unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When villagers had nothing to do they would play mah-jong,''
he said. ``Kids wouldn't study; they'd just go out and spend
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of the information superhighway made people
realize they needed to learn to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know if they don't study, they won't be able to grasp new
technology,'' Bai said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Like many young people in Sangpo, Zhang Juan(CQ), 19, says her
favorite Web activity is chatting with her Net buddies from all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Web, I can see the outside world,'' Zhang said. ``We
chat about everything. If someone has something on their mind, they
can talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first time in a chatroom was nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was embarrassed to say I was from a village,'' she
says, taking a moment from a chat session in the Sangpo Internet
cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But she quickly gained confidence and made friends. Only
recently, she encountered a person from Hangzhou, a big city near
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person said, 'Well I have nothing to say to you, you live
in an isolated little village,''' she said. ``So I said, 'We're
much more developed here than where you are.'''

scientists reported at the 13th international conference on AIDS

known as the A3XX, for use on long distance routes like those
between Asia and Europe or the United States. With a minimum
capacity of 555 passengers, it would carry at least 140 passengers
more than the largest Boeing 747. And its development cost would
exceed $10 billion. It is a huge gamble for Airbus, which is
recasting its corporate structure to prepare for the project. There
are a number of obstacles, and it is not clear whether Airbus can
get enough orders to make the project ultimately profitable. But
the potential rewards are huge. For one, the A3XX would challenge
the long, lucrative dominance of Boeing's 747. By John Tagliabue.

would exempt nearly all of them from estate taxes. The Democratic
plan that the President favors would keep the levy only for the
fewer than one in 1,000 people whose wealth exceeds $8 million. But
some of these entrepreneurs say they distrust proposals to lift the
estate tax threshold, fearing that any revision would be encumbered
with rules that deny the benefits to them. A look at how some

   SANGPO VILLAGE, China _ Ding Yufeng is a fifth-grade dropout.
That does not make him unusual in this booming village in central
China.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a regular user of e-mail and the World Wide Web.
That, too, is not unusual here in Sangpo Village.
</P>
<P>
   Once a ``poor, backwards, uneducated'' speck in Henan province,
in the words of one local official, Sangpo is now a wired outpost.
Its 4,800 residents boast private cars, cellular phones, about 100
personal computers and a bustling Internet cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But Sangpo Village didn't get rich growing wheat and corn, which
is how most of surrounding Mengzhou County makes a living. Having
very little land, village leaders realized long ago the road to
wealth lay in private enterprise, not agriculture. So it decided to
capitalize on a traditional handicraft of its Muslim population _
sheepskin processing.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years, the village has grown these backyard businesses
into a multi-million dollar niche market. It now processes 5
million sheepskins a year, almost half of China's total sheepskin
imports. Most come from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Just outside Sangpo, the green fields along the side of the road
suddenly give way to row after row of short wooden tents, each with
a sheepskin on top laid out to dry. The streets inside the village
are also lined with drying sheepskins. Sangpo proudly calls itself
China's ``Fur City.''
</P>
<P>
   The finished products are exported to Turkey and Italy as
leather for shoes and handbags, to Russia as blankets and to the
United States as sheepskin carseat covers. The arrival of the
Internet two years ago has not only been a boon to business, it has
allowed bored youngsters a window to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has shortened our distance with the rest of the
world,'' said Bai Huzhan, Sangpo's Communist vice-party secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sangpo is an anomaly in China or a sign of things to
come remains to be seen. Some rural areas have started using the
Internet to post pricing and market information for farmers, but
the digital divide between rich and poor is still enormous, and
growing wider.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10 million people have gone on-line in this country of
1.25 billion, according to the latest official estimates. But less
than 1 percent of the population even has Internet access, as users
are heavily concentrated in the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   For now, officials in Mengzhou County _ where Sangpo Village
resides _ are happy for the tax revenue and jobs the village has
provided, but have yet to make any great efforts to wire the rest
of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Only 60 percent of households in Mengzhou County have
telephones. The largest town in the county has a couple of Internet
cafes, but few people can afford the fee of 3 yuan (US36 cents) an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Sangpo Internet cafe, which charges 4 yuan
(US48 cents) an hour, is packed in the evenings, and home telephone
penetration is closer to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Technology came quickly to Sangpo. In 1993, the only phone in
the village was at the government building. By 1994, it had 2,000
lines and today, it has more than 6,000. By 1998, Internet access
seemed like the natural next step. So village leaders convinced the
county to set up a computer training center.
</P>
<P>
   In Ding's home alone, there are five phone lines. Two of them
are dedicated to personal computers, which he says are in use at
least 12 hours a day _ if not 24 _ by the extended family of more
than 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two computers is not enough for the family,'' said his father,
Ding Cunzheng, who runs the family sheepskin processing business,
White Dragon Fur Factory.
</P>
<P>
   For years, White Dragon was a small enterprise making leather
jackets. But then the younger Ding, 23, discovered computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any hobbies. I just fooled around and wasted my
time,'' says Ding, sitting in the factory office where he seems
oblivious to the clinging smell of animal hides. ``But when I
started learning computers, I found I could work at it all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was using search engines to find sheepskin suppliers and
eventually sent e-mails to hundreds of them introducing his
father's factory. He got few replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our factory is too small,'' Ding said.
</P>
<P>
   But one business in Australia, where sheep outnumber humans, was
also small and looking for someone to buy its sheepskins. Before
long, another Internet match was made.
</P>
<P>
   White Dragon was able to cut out its middlemen and buy raw
materials directly from the Australian supplier. Its business
increased more than three-fold, and it now employs more than 40
workers, mostly from Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   If anything, this is perhaps the dirty secret of Sangpo's
success. Cleaning, combing, cutting sheepskins is filthy work. It's
no work for rich villagers, especially those with two private cars
and 13 cell phones, as the Ding family has.
</P>
<P>
   Although the official population of the village is under 5,000,
the actual number of residents is closer to 11,000. The difference
being the laborers who've come from other towns and provinces for
jobs. They live in factory dorms and get paid by the piece, showing
that even Chinese villages take advantage of cheap Chinese labor.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity of the village has made its residents rather
lazy, laments Bai, the vice-party secretary. Money came easily, and
loftier goals were viewed as unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When villagers had nothing to do they would play mah-jong,''
he said. ``Kids wouldn't study; they'd just go out and spend
money.''
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of the information superhighway made people
realize they needed to learn to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know if they don't study, they won't be able to grasp new
technology,'' Bai said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Like many young people in Sangpo, Zhang Juan(CQ), 19, says her
favorite Web activity is chatting with her Net buddies from all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Web, I can see the outside world,'' Zhang said. ``We
chat about everything. If someone has something on their mind, they
can talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her first time in a chatroom was nerve-wracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was embarrassed to say I was from a village,'' she
says, taking a moment from a chat session in the Sangpo Internet
cafe.
</P>
<P>
   But she quickly gained confidence and made friends. Only
recently, she encountered a person from Hangzhou, a big city near
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person said, 'Well I have nothing to say to you, you live
in an isolated little village,''' she said. ``So I said, 'We're
much more developed here than where you are.'''

   ST.-PETERSBURG-DEVELOP (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Several
homeowners, cell phones at hand, tend their lawns and gardens.
Others are firing up a barbecue in the backyard, while on the
street children ride mountain bikes or skate by on Rollerblades.
Two little girls talk about going with their mothers to get a bite
to eat at McDonald's. It could be a typical snapshot of American
suburban life, but the pork shish kebab on the grill, cooked
faithfully every weekend instead of hamburgers, is just one sign
that this probably is not Pleasantville. It is Kolomyaga, a

   NY-SCAFFOLDING (New York) _ It is becoming the signature profile
for much of the city: not the grand deco kitsch of the Chrysler
building or the telltale green canvas of Starbucks creep, but the
unlovely clump of plywood and metal tubing known in the trade as
the sidewalk shed or bridge. The city issued 1,806 permits for
sheds in the first six months of 2000, up roughly 80 percent from
the same period just five years ago. Obstructing sightlines and
walking paths, squeezing already congested sidewalks, the sheds
have become pedestrians' analog to squeegee guys, a minor obstacle
replicated onto every street corner, at least when you're in a

experiences when its most famous citizen suddenly ups and leaves.
Did residents of Nyack, N.Y., feel they failed last year when Rosie
O'Donnell packed up her three children and moved to Greenwich,
Conn.? Do house prices in Bedford Hills go up or down when Mariah
Carey leaves town? And would Americans once again start confusing

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ While watching fireworks last week, it came to me.
Why stop the festivities on the Fourth of July, for an entire year,
when another holiday that's rich with party possibilities follows
right on its heels?
</P>
<P>
   You guessed it _ that would be Bastille Day, the French national
holiday that commemorates the revolution. In France, food, music
and fireworks are a very big part of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Because the French have great food and because most of us like a
party, a Bastille Day celebation makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Let's examine the basic elements of what might make up a South
Texas Bastille Day celebration, for example.
</P>
<P>
   First, a quick history lesson tells us that July 14, 1789, was
the day the people of Paris rose up en masse to storm the Bastille,
a state prison that symbolized the French monarchy. Two days later,
the French Revolution had succeeded, marking the beginning of the
First Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The battle cry on July 14, ``Tous a la Bastille!'' (Everyone to
the Bastille!) was echoed the next year when delegates from all
parts of the country flocked to Paris to celebrate the ``Fete de la
Federation'' and proclaim their allegiance to the new republic.
</P>
<P>
   To mark our own celebration of ``liberty, equality and
fraternity,'' we don't have to pretend to be French. But, we might
consider uncorking a bottle of Texas Barbecue Red, making up a
batch of Frito pie (we'll explain how this fits in a minute),
throwing some croissants on the grill and turning on some Tejano
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Second, since we are a multicultural kind of town, we should
note that a very diverse group of people celebrates Bastille Day,
which offers plenty of possibilities for customizing our own
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   To plan your party, you might take a few tips from Santa
Barbara, Calif., which has the western United States' largest
Bastille Day celebration, the French Festival.
</P>
<P>
   They've been celebrating French independence for the past 13
years, but not because the French population there instigated it,
says festival organizer Steve Hoegerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French are pretty independent folks _ not really joiners.
So, when it came to organizing the French Festival it took me,
Steve the gringo, to do it,'' says Hoegerman, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day festival draws about 20,000 people who dine on
French bread and cheese, fruit, escargot, crepes, quiche and other
French foods. There is music, from Cajun to cabaret, a poodle
parade, a mock Eiffel tower, dancing, arts and crafts and more.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to capture the mythic France, and for that you
need two things wafting through the air _ accordion music and
good-smelling foods. So you have all the elements that create the
France of your dreams,'' Hoegerman says.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio chef Damien Watel, who grew up in Lille, a city in
northern France, remembers the Bastille Day celebrations of his
childhood. These, he says, were almost always spent at his mother's
island vacation home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wild island, about five miles long, and there would
be a huge celebration. The whole island would gather at the port,''
says Watel, who will be celebrating Bastille Day in his own style
by hosting a Chef's Summit on July 17 at his restaurant, Bistro
Vatel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fireworks were a giant part of the 14th,'' says Watel, as is a
diversity of regional foods. One of Watel's food memories is the
hearty Carbonnades de Boeuf or a beef stew resembling the classic
Beef Burgundy. ``They would pour it over pommes frites (french
fries) and stir it around. Actually, it was kind of like a Frito
pie,'' admits Watel.
</P>
<P>
   So the food part of the Bastille on the Rio doesn't have to be
hard. Pick up some cheese and fresh breads. Tart, with raspberries,
blueberries and white chocolate mousse, honoring the colors of the
French flag.
</P>
<P>
   Then, throw together some spinach crepes, roast a chicken with
fresh herbs, or make a pot of chili and create Frito pies.
</P>
<P>
   Put Tchaikovsky's ``1812 Overture'' on the stereo and enjoy the
patriotic strains of the French national anthem, the Marseillaise,
which occurs about halfway through.
</P>
<P>
   Then, spread a red-and-white-checked tablecloth on the back lawn
or your patio or the living room floor, pour the wine and _ ``Tous
a la Bastille!''

 &HT;    Pressure-treated lumber isn't only option for decks
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - When we think of decks, we automatically think of
the most common type of deck seen in this area: pressure-treated
lumber.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're interested in building a deck, it makes sense to
at least be aware that there are alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-treated lumber is popular for decks, mostly because
it's relatively inexpensive. But the typical wooden deck has to be
refinished regularly, and the expense and hassles of maintenance
make a few homeowners opt for other materials.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Cook of T.E. Cook Deck Builders said the vast majority of
the decks he has built have been pressure-treated lumber, but he
expects that to change eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year I get more requests for plastic decks because
people are tired of maintaining their wooden decks,'' Cook said.
``But when I quote a price for a plastic deck that's three times
more than a wooden deck, they go with wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually the price of plastic decks is going to drop, and
that's going to be what people want.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few basics to consider when you're contemplating
building a deck:
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-treated lumber is wood, typically pine, that has had
chemical preservatives forced deep into the cellular structure of
the wood. According to the American Wood Preservers Institute, the
process enables the preserved wood to maintain a chemical barrier
against termites and decay for 40 years or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-treated wood, especially wood that is not properly
sealed, can absorb water, causing it to twist, warp or cup. As the
wood loses its moisture, it can split.
</P>
<P>
   Wood meant for residential uses such as decks usually is treated
with water-based preservatives such as Chromated Copper Arsenate
(CCA), Ammoniacal Copper Quat (ACQ) and Ammoniacal Copper Zinc
Arsenate (ACZA), the institute said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute said the preservatives are not harmful in normal
usage, but treated lumber should not be used in applications that
come into direct contact with food, such as cutting boards. Also
normal precautions, such as wearing eye protection and a dust mask,
should be taken when cutting treated lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Treated lumber grays naturally as it weathers, and it should be
sealed to prevent deterioration. Depending on several variables _
how much sun and rain, what type of sealant is used _ you should
expect to reseal the deck every two to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Check out www.awpi.org for more on pressure-treated lumber.
</P>
<P>
   A deck of plastic, typically polyvinyl chloride similar to the
material used in plastic plumbing pipes, doesn't deteriorate in the
same way that wood does when exposed to the weather, but no
building material lasts forever. Check the warranty and care
guidelines for any plastic deck product you are considering.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of plastic decks point out that their decks
require no scrubbing, bleaching, waterproofing, staining or
painting. They are generally white but can be ordered in other
colors.
</P>
<P>
   Sources disagree on the point, but plastic-deck manufacturers
claim their products are cooler to the touch on sunny days. They
are also splinter-free and not prone to splitting.
</P>
<P>
   Composite deck products combine recycled materials such as
sawdust and shredded plastic. Perhaps the best known composite
brand is Trex, which is made of waste woods and scrap plastic such
as recycled grocery bags.
</P>
<P>
   The combination creates decking boards that are stiff like wood
but damage-resistant like plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Trex decking boards are brown when installed but quickly turn
light gray and maintain that shade for life. They can become
stained or develop a spotted appearance after a few years. Normal
deck cleaners will return them to a uniform color.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer claims it will not rot, crack or deteriorate
because of moisture, insects or the ultraviolet rays of the sun. It
also never needs sealing, does not splinter and does not become
slick when wet.
</P>
<P>
   Trex usually is more expensive than pressure-treated lumber, but
lower than plastic. Visit www.trex.com for more details.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-treated lumber retains the natural look of wood grain,
which is important to some homeowners. Redwood also has an
attractive grain, plus a rich reddish-brown color that many find
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Redwood, cedar and other woods are suitable for building decks,
and they can be strikingly beautiful, but they tend to be
expensive. Cook said the ones he has built have been about three
times as expensive as pressure-treated lumber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redwood is a high-end product for decks,'' said California
Redwood Association spokeswoman Pamela Allsebrook. ``It is more
expensive, but it has lots of advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Allsebrook said redwood decks are less prone than
pressure-treated lumber to warping and cupping. It is naturally
resistant to insects so chemical additives aren't needed. She said
redwood should be sealed regularly to extend its life.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said people with redwood and cedar decks usually use clear
sealants so the beauty of the wood shows through. He said clear
sealants don't last as long as types with some pigment, so
redwood-deck owners tend to seal more often.
</P>
<P>
   He also said redwood and cedar are softer than pine, so they
tend to dent when objects are dropped on the deck floor.

HAVE LAPTOP, WILL TRAVEL _ WITH EXTREME CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airports require certain survival skills under any
circumstances, what with summer crowds, delayed flights, overpriced
and stale food, lost baggage, overhead bins crammed with holiday
loot and the dreaded 300-pound, perspiring tourist with a duffle
bag heading for the center seat next to you.
</P>
<P>
   Add your laptop computer to the mix, and things can become
complicated. So if you must carry a computer with you, here are
some tips for how to get through airports a little more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   HOLD ON TO IT: To start with the obvious, but most important,
rule: Never, ever, check your laptop computer as baggage. Have you
ever watched the crews loading and unloading baggage? They often
compete to see who can throw the bag the farthest. If your laptop
is not mangled, it will be stolen. Maybe not on this trip, but
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   INSURE IT: If you use your laptop primarily for business, it is
probably not covered under your standard homeowner's insurance
policy. Your agent can add a laptop to your policy to cover the
loss of hardware. Safeware (www.safeware.com) is an insurance
company specializing in the coverage of laptops. One popular policy
covers up to $3,000 of the replacement cost of a lost, stolen or
damaged computer for $75 per year. And best of all, said David
Haase of Safeware, ``there is no stupidity exclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you are dumb enough to put the laptop in your
checked baggage or drop it off the side of a cruise ship, it's
still covered.
</P>
<P>
   BE PREPARED: Before you take your laptop to the airport, try
destructive visualization. Somebody steals your laptop. Do you have
a current backup copy of your data? Have you encrypted sensitive
information?
</P>
<P>
   Laptop thefts are rampant in airports. Some of the thefts are
opportunistic, occurring when the traveler leaves the computer
unattended for one reason or another. It takes just a second or
two, and the laptop has a new owner. Why is it that people who
would never leave a purse or wallet unattended while they visit the
restroom still occasionally leave their $2,000 laptops up for
grabs?
</P>
<P>
   But some thefts are orchestrated. One of the more common scams
involves a pair of grifters who select the victim at the security
checkpoint where bags are placed on a conveyor belt to be X-rayed.
The bag man (or woman) goes through first and loiters at the end of
the conveyor.
</P>
<P>
   The second thief waits for the victim to send a laptop through
the X-ray machine, then causes a distraction while passing through
the metal detector. The owner of the laptop is delayed on the other
side of the checkpoint long enough for the first thief to snatch
the computer bag and disappear into the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the chance of theft by conveyor-belt thieves, you may
want to ask the security guard to hand-check your laptop, unless
you are late for a flight. (By the way, the X-ray machine will not
harm the data on your hard drive or floppies.) Of course, a
hand-check means that you will have to appease the guard by turning
on the computer to prove that it is not a bomb. If you use
slow-booting Windows, allow extra minutes to get to your gate.
</P>
<P>
   According to Safeware, more than 300,000 laptops were reported
stolen last year.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T FORGET: Some otherwise sharp travelers simply forget their
laptops on the plane. You can help a Good Samaritan return your
computer by taping a business card to the bottom of the laptop,
engraving your driver's license number (not your Social Security
number, which could be used to steal from your online accounts) on
the top of the case or having contact information pop up when the
computer is first turned on.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T BE OBVIOUS: Many people carry their laptops in a carrying
case labeled ``Dell,'' ``IBM'' or some other obvious computer name.
The bag might as well say ``Steal Me.'' My bag preference is a
padded backpack. It is slightly less conspicuous, and is also
easier on the shoulders.

<P>
   LOOK FOR WIRELESS: And now, some good news. There are few things
more pathetic than the sight of a grown man sitting on the floor of
the airport waiting room beneath a pay phone with a phone wire
stretched between the modem and the phone, the laptop teetering on
his knee, as he tries to send a file on deadline. Yes, I was that
man.
</P>
<P>
   Wayport Inc. (www.wayport.com) has just completed unwiring the
airport that serves Silicon Gulch in Austin, Texas, to allow
travelers to get high-speed Internet access via wireless networking
anywhere from the gate to the baggage claim area. Just relax in a
comfortable place anywhere in the airport, pop open the notebook,
log on to the Wayport portal, and say goodbye to squatting under
the pay phones for an Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Two terminals at Dallas-Fort Worth will go wireless next week.
Wayport says LaGuardia, Kennedy and Newark airports will be
wireless by the end of the year, along with Seattle-Tacoma and
others. Wayport has set up its wireless networks in some 600 hotels
and plans to more than double its base next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wayport system is based on the 11-megabit IEEE 802.11b
wireless Ethernet standard used by Apple, IBM, 3Com, Cisco and
others. It requires a wireless networking card, about $99 to $179
in most stores, and costs a flat fee of $3.50 each time the
traveler logs on to the network, although there is no time limit
for the connection. Wayport has waived the connection fees for the
first 50 times the traveler connects.

<P>
   BYO MOVIES: On longer flights, some airlines show movies that
you probably did not want to see when they were at the theaters.
Some offer passengers a portable DVD or Hi-8 video player with a
dinky screen and bad sound. But if your laptop has a DVD drive,
simply rent or buy your choice of DVD movies before the trip and
enjoy them on the big screen. Make sure that you have sufficient
battery life, though. Your seat neighbors will stare in awe as you
fire up ``The Matrix'' on your 15-inch TFT screen.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning ahead, NEC has just released in Japan the
first laptop with Dolby Headphone, a new sound technology that
recreates the 5.1-channel surround-sound effects of a home theater
system through a pair of ordinary stereo headphones. The Dolby
Headphone technology is expected to be available in the United
States by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   SKIP THE TRAYS: Some airlines are adding an inch or two of space
between rows in coach, which is welcome, but they have not done
anything to make it easier to use a laptop on the little trays that
fold down from the back of the seat in front of you. Grab an extra
pillow or blanket from the flight attendant and _ here's a novel
idea _ use the laptop on your lap. If the lout in front of you
suddenly lurches backward, your computer will not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   AND SKIP THE BINS: It is a good idea to store the computer under
the seat in front of you rather than in an overhead bin. I saw a
laptop fall to its death recently when a passenger decided to
rearrange the overhead compartment to make room for her oversize
bag, and _ oops! Her seatmate's computer bag fell 5 feet to the
floor. Luckily, it did not land on someone's head. Also, a bag at
your feet is harder to forget than a bag in the overhead bin, and
no one is trying to jam a suitcase against your bag down there.
</P>
<P>
   FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS: Does your portable electronic device really
interfere with sensitive avionics on the aircraft, jeopardizing
everyone's safety during takeoffs and landings? The evidence is
inconclusive. But if the pilot is happier with devices turned off,
you should be happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you'd like to ignore all these tips, you could ask
yourself a fundamental question before you start out on your trip:
</P>
<P>
   Do I really need to take a computer with me on vacation?

 &HT;    Can't tell an X-Man from an X-File? It's time to consult our
excellent X-Men guide
 &HT;    By David Thomas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - It started in 1963 as The Uncanny X-Men.
The comic book by Stan Lee introduced five pupils at Xavier's
School for Gifted Youngsters. They possessed a mutant ``X gene''
that gave them special powers that humans fear and distrust.
Professor Charles Xavier teaches these five X-Men to control their
emerging powers to fight evil and help mutants and humans coexist.
</P>
<P>
   While the comic book has been a top seller for decades and
spawned a popular Fox cartoon, not many people know just who the
X-Men are. That may change with Friday's big-screen movie
``X-Men,'' starring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Halle Berry,
and directed by Bryan Singer (''The Usual Suspects'').
</P>
<P>
   So, you're not a cult comic book reader. Here's a guide to the
characters and story of the superhero tale:
</P>
<P>
   Professor X/
</P>
<P>
   Charles Xavier
</P>
<P>
   (Patrick Stewart)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power:
</P>
<P>
   Telepath
</P>
<P>
   Bio: Founder of Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.
Wheelchair-bound, he developed an advanced computer called Cerebro
to detect mutants like himself. He recruited the X-Men to help
defend humankind from evil mutants like his arch-enemy Magneto.
</P>
<P>
   Magneto/
</P>
<P>
   Erik Lehnsherr
</P>
<P>
   (Ian McKellen)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power: Can manipulate any metal substance.
</P>
<P>
   Bio: The Master of Magnetism is Charles Xavier's philosophical
rival. He believes mutants are meant to rule humankind, not coexist
with them as Xavier does. A child when his family was killed in a
Nazi concentration camp during World War II, Magneto has a deeper
reason to see his kind escape persecution. He heads the Brotherhood
of Evil Mutants.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclops/
</P>
<P>
   Scott Summers
</P>
<P>
   (James Marsden)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power: A high-powered optic blast. Think Superman's heat
vision on overload.
</P>
<P>
   Bio: The stoic leader introduced in the first issue of The
Uncanny X-Men must wear a protective visor, made of ruby red
quartz, at all times to control his mutant power.
</P>
<P>
   Wolverine/Logan
</P>
<P>
   (Hugh Jackman)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power: A healing factor and superhuman senses.
</P>
<P>
   Bio: The most popular of all X-Men. Wolverine doesn't know much
about his own past, and his age is a huge question mark because his
mutant power keeps him young. He has no scars and is extremely hard
to kill. His skeleton is made of the strongest metal on earth,
adamantium, and features three claws on each hand that can be
retracted into the arm at will. He has a soft spot for fellow X-er
Jean Grey.
</P>
<P>
   Storm/
</P>
<P>
   Ororo Monroe
</P>
<P>
   (Halle Berry)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power: Weather control.
</P>
<P>
   Bio: When the original X-Men were being held captive by an evil
alien, Professor X had to search for a new group of heroes to save
them. This changed the face of the series (See Uncanny X-Men 94 if
you can afford the $500 issue) and placed Storm in a leadership
position to compete with Cyclops.
</P>
<P>
   X Fact-ers
</P>
<P>
   Even though they aren't all in the movie, there are hundreds of
other X-Men characters. Some favorites: Iceman, Colossus, Beast,
Banshee, Longshot, Forge, Angel, Havoc and Polaris.
</P>
<P>
   Though the comic emphasizes action and evil-fighting, the
characters also fall in love (often with each other), break up,
lose friends, have children and face all the other highs and lows
of life.
</P>
<P>
   -Creator Stan Lee began the series in the era of civil rights as
a social commentary on bigotry with the mutants as a hated
minority. Even today, the X-Men battle racism.
</P>
<P>
   -If the movie does well, there's lots of buzz about an expanded
cast for the sequel, which may feature Sentinels, robots designed
to hunt down and kill mutants.
</P>
<P>
   -How do the X-Men fight evil across the globe? They hop in the
Blackbird, a superfast jet that can hover over any target
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   -How valuable are early copies of the comic classic? The Uncanny
X-Men 1 usually sells for $6,000, with No. 2 going for $1,700.
</P>
<P>
   -Past, Present and Future comics in West Palm Beach, the largest
comic retailer in the county, reports that X-Men comics are flying
off the shelves. ``There are at least 10 different X-Men titles and
we usually sell 200 a month, which is more than any other title,''
said manager Chris Emmersi. ``But lately, new customers have just
been snatching up copies.''
</P>
<P>
   More of the X-Men:
</P>
<P>
   Rogue
</P>
<P>
   (Anna Paquin)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power: She can absorb other mutants' powers and memories
by touching their bare skin.
</P>
<P>
   Bio: The comic book version of Rogue is a busty and strong young
woman who can steal other mutants' powers with a touch. Making all
her sexual allure quite deadly, since she'd steal even a mortal's
memories and strength. Unfortunately the sexpot role has been
filled by adolescent Anna Paquin.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Grey
</P>
<P>
   (Famke Janssen)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power: Telekinesis and telepathy.
</P>
<P>
   Bio: Originally named Marvel Girl, Grey dropped the moniker in
the 1970s around the same time NOW began. Grey was later abducted
by a powerful cosmic entity that impersonated her for years without
anyone catching on. During that time she (or was it the alien?)
married her high school sweetheart Scott Summers. And you thought
the ``who shot JR'' storyline had a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Sabertooth(Tyler Mane)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power: Possesses superhuman strength and animal senses
much like Wolverine's.
</P>
<P>
   Bio: Little is known about this evil mutant killer except that
he might have worked as a government agent.
</P>
<P>
   Mystique
</P>
<P>
   (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power: A human chameleon who can take on the appearance
of anyone she comes in contact with.
</P>
<P>
   Bio: This sly mutant is known for her deception, and not just in
physical form. You never know what side she's allied with.
</P>
<P>
   Toad
</P>
<P>
   (Ray Park)
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Power: Extreme dexterity and leaping ability.
</P>
<P>
   Bio: Once a side-show attraction, the Toad seems to enjoy the
role of supervillain lackey. He lives only to serve his master
whether it be Magneto or Mystique. And, oh yeah, he has a 15-foot
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   X-Men on the Web:
</P>
<P>
   ``Unofficial X-Men'' at www.xmansion.com has an extensive
gallery of X-Men comic art, chats and forums.
</P>
<P>
   The official site for the movie is www.xmenthemovie.com
</P>
<P>
   www.mutantwatch.com features the fictional Senator Kelly's
paranoid political tirade against the mutants among us.

 &HT;    50TH YEAR IN RADIO FINDS VETERAN NEWSCASTER IN A PLACE HE LIKES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a tad after 7 a.m. _ the middle of the workday
_ and Carl Kasell is sipping coffee from a sky-blue coffee mug
commemorating the Tar Heels of the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century has passed since the newscaster for National
Public Radio's ``Morning Edition'' began his career as a high
school reporter for WGBR-AM in his home town of Goldsboro, N.C. But
Kasell is proud that a trace of the South lingers faintly in his
familiar voice.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 66, he relishes his roots.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the tobacco country of eastern North Carolina. His
dad ``was a guy who kind of bounced from job to job,'' and money
was sometimes scarce in a family with four children.
</P>
<P>
   A young Andy Griffith, just out of college himself, was his high
school drama teacher. After casting Kasell in the lead of ``Father
of the Bride'' during his senior year, Griffith urged him to
consider a theatrical career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, 'No, I'm going to be a radio star,' `` Kasell
recalls with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s had just begun, and television was in its infancy.
Kasell had grown up listening to Jack Benny and ``the Lone Ranger''
and ``Superman'' and ``the Hermit.'' News bored him, but he aspired
to an on-air career as a quiz show host or actor in serial drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio was still king,'' he said. ``I always wanted to be a
part of it. It just fascinated me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry that can be so creative. Whereas TV plays to
your eyes, we play to your mind. When radio is done right, it can
create images that are far superior to what television can show you
with pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasell sips his coffee and glances at a studio clock. Every hour
from 5 a.m. through 11 a.m. ET, he delivers a five-minute newscast
as ``Morning Edition'' airs _ live or taped _ across the nation's
time zones. Every newscast must be updated.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, Kasell has arisen an hour after
midnight on weekdays in his home in suburban Annandale, Va. By 2:15
a.m., he's usually chatting with ``Morning Edition'' host Bob
Edwards at the NPR Headquarters in downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations are ``seldom about work,'' he said. They share
a passion for college football _ Edwards for the University of
Louisville Cardinals and Kasell for the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, he had headed to the scenic campus at Chapel
Hill. Coincidentally, UNC graduate Griffith moved back there at
about the same time, leaving teaching and beginning his night club
act. Kasell majored in English and worked at the campus radio
station, sometimes with classmate Charles Kuralt.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of college, he was drafted into the Army.
Stationed in Italy, he met the woman whom he would marry shortly
after his discharge. They celebrated a 37th wedding anniversary
before her death several years ago. Their married son lives in
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Having always worked an early morning shift, Kasell adjusted his
schedule to accommodate family life. After leaving work about 11:30
a.m., he would sleep from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Then he awoke for
several hours to watch his son play baseball from Little League
through high school or for other family activities. Then he slept
again from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining NPR in the mid-1970s, he worked for commercial
radio stations in North Carolina and Virginia. He played pop and
country music and worked for an all-news station that switched to
rock 'n' roll. He sees public radio as his salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care for shock radio. I think it's an insult to our
industry,'' he said. ``Ranting and raving and talking about obscene
topics is not what I envisioned radio to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Literate, leisurely, non-commercial NPR, with its entertaining
whimsy and thoughtful news and analysis and assorted cultural fare,
comes closer to being the radio of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an organization,'' he said. ``I'm glad I found it,
or glad they found me. However that worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Edwards, Kasell has been on ``Morning Edition'' since
its birth 20 years ago. The popular program is broadcast by more
than 520 NPR stations. More recently, Kasell has fulfilled his
boyhood ambition of hosting a radio quiz show _ NPR's weekly
``Wait, Wait ... Don't Tell Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like old-time radio,'' he enthuses. ``I'm official judge
and scorekeeper'' for panelists that include humorist Roy Blount
Jr. and Washington Post columnist Roxanne Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Kasell has also traveled to NPR stations around the country,
giving his audience a chance to see as well has hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while, you'll meet somebody who says 'You know, you
look exactly like I thought you would look,' `` he said. But that's
not the usual reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I probably sound younger than I am because a woman in
San Francisco last year said 'You know, you are really more mature
than you sound,'' he said. ``I said, 'You mean older, don't you?'
``
</P>
<P>
   But in his 50th year of broadcasting, he has no plans to leave
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider this work,'' he explained as 8 a.m.
approached and legions of commuters tuned into ``Morning Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun.''

`QUICK-RESTORE' ERASES PROBLEM _ AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a Compaq with Windows 98. I tried to
download an antivirus program, and it caused my computer to crash.
I used the Compaq ``quick-restore'' CD, but in the process lost
Microsoft Word and Microsoft Works and a few other programs and
files.
</P>
<P>
   _ Overkill
</P>
<P>
   Dear Over: Ummmm, I think you might have overreacted a tad. The
only time you want to pull out one of those quick-restore CDs is
when you've hammered your system so badly that there's just no
turning back.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that a bungled download was enough to kill
your PC, although almost anything is possible. I certainly would
have asked the office geek to take a quick look at it before
dropping the big one, though.
</P>
<P>
   A restore CD usually reformats and rebuilds the computer to its
pristine, out-of-the-box state. That may or may not include any
bundled applications like Word or Works. Generally, if the
applications aren't included in the restore disc, there's some sort
of utility that allows the buyer to create a set of installation
floppies. I guess it's sort of late for that.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the original documentation and product registration
numbers, you might be able to wheedle a copy of the software out of
Compaq _ or maybe even Microsoft _ for a nominal fee. If not, I'd
suspect that some local software store will be more than happy to
take your check for a whole new set of programs.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I added a 3-megabyte hard drive to my computer
and made it a slave to Drive C. I am now having problems with space
on C. Is it possible to use a program called ``Uninstaller'' to
move DOS to the second hard drive, leaving only Windows on Drive C?
Is this the best solution to the problem?
</P>
<P>
   _ Too Much Stuff
</P>
<P>
   Dear Too: Nooooooooo. Does that answer your question?
</P>
<P>
   First, those uninstaller programs usually require that they be
installed before you install an application. They keep a record of
which files are loaded where so they can find them all later.
</P>
<P>
   Second, you could use some geek tweaks to boot from a secondary
drive, but why clog up the plumbing? And, all you Poindexters out
there, don't start writing me with duct-tape-and-spit solutions.
Sure, maybe you can get it to work, but this guy is a normal human.
</P>
<P>
   Third, DOS and Windows are used to being in the same place,
since they're all part of one happy operating system. Well, not
that happy, but you get the point. Trying to scatter them over two
drives is just going to give you a major headache.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you want to do: Uninstall any application on the
primary hard drive that you can, then reinstall it on the new one.
Leave the operating system alone.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: What is your insight on all these sweepstakes?
Are they actually giving away all that money? Do you by any chance
know which ones are legitimate?
</P>
<P>
   _ Barnum Was Right
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BARNUM: The only truly legitimate sweepstakes I can fully
endorse is the Bombay Institute's Cash-a-Palooza, in which entrants
are asked to put their names and addresses on 10-dollar bills and
send them to my Cayman Islands address. Some lucky winner could
receive as much as $20 if I draw his or her name out of a hat. Or
not. I'm not sure where I put my hat.
</P>
<P>
   (About 30 attorneys want to make sure that you know Dr. Emilio
Bombay's last answer was a joke. Get it? Please don't send him

MAKING THE LEAP TO DIGITAL PLANNING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN  The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years and years and years, Larry Becker ran his life with a
paper-based planner. Perhaps more correctly, a paper-based planner
ran Larry Becker's life. In fact, he used to teach courses in how
to effectively use the popular paper planners.
</P>
<P>
   You know the kind: Available in office-supply stores and by mail
order, their pages hold notations for meetings, to-do lists, phone
numbers, follow-ups and other personal and business items.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, who runs a Web marketing company in Lakeland, Fla., and
gives time-management seminars, never went anywhere without his
planner.
</P>
<P>
   Then about four years ago, the paper scales fell from his eyes,
and he saw the digital world of handheld personal information
managers. He never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to Becker's recent endeavor: A two-hour video
tape, ``Time Management in the Palm of Your Hand.'' The tape, as
the name implies, is centered around the Palm personal information
manager, but the system can be used with other digital planners.
(Since Handspring's Visor uses the Palm operating system _ and was
designed by the same people who brought out the original Palm _ it
works seemlessly with that planner.)
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, personal digital assistants (PDAs) are small devices _
about the size of a deck of cards so they fit easily in pocket or
purse _ that store and retrieve to-do lists, a daily calendar with
alarms, memos, addresses and telephone numbers. They can store
several years of activities, thousands of names and hundreds of
memos.
</P>
<P>
   Using a search feature, users can instantly locate anything
anywhere in the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of it,'' said Becker, 37. ``If you've ever
written something in a paper planner and then try to find it again,
you know it's not very efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Some planners are divided so that users carry one month with
them at a time. ``If you're out somewhere and need to refer to
something from a previous month, you're in trouble,'' said Becker.
Finding such information using a digital device is quick and
painless.
</P>
<P>
   Becker came up with the idea for a training film for Palm users
after he gave a seminar to employees whose company had purchased
Palm for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found they didn't even know the basics for using the Palm,''
said Becker. ``Some of them were using the keyboard (a screen
display of a keyboard that is used for entering text by tapping on
letters) instead of the Palm's handwriting recognition because they
didn't understand how to use it.'' Using a stylus, letters drawn on
the Palm's glass screen turn into typed text. With a little
practice, it's a fast way to enter text.
</P>
<P>
   The $49.95 tape is professionally done. Becker has used shots of
the Palm's screen extensively, so users can see what's going on as
information is being entered. That approach has also kept the
``talking head'' format to a minimum. A time sheet has been
included with the tape so viewers can quickly move to one of the
six sections covered for review.
</P>
<P>
   The first section gives users some of the basics of operating
the Palm. (''You'd be surprised the things people miss because they
don't read the manual,'' said Becker as a way of explaining why
seemingly basic information is included in the first few minutes.)
The second section deals in setting up the Palm for time
management. Becker recommends users create various to-do lists so
items can be classified in groups: today, tomorrow, soon, later,
morning, weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The third and fourth sections cover commitments to
time-management success and how to keep on target by using the
to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth section explains techniques for improving efficiency
with the Palm's calendar and appointment manager. The sixth section
takes users through a typical day in a busy life by demonstrating
how time management can be adjusted to handle unscheduled events
and keep track of ongoing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Becker recommends two programs to add to the Palm. While not
necessary to time-management techniques, they do add some
improvements to the Palm's date book and to-do list. Links for both
programs are available on Becker's Web site, www.palmplanning.com,
under the software section.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and least expensive, is BIG To Do. Palm's to-do list
has five levels of priority for items. BIG To Do allows items to be
ranked one through 10 in importance.
</P>
<P>
   Becker had a friend write the program, to make it easier to make
the transition from paper planner to the Palm. With only five
levels, there wasn't an easy way to fit in with the A-B-C-1-2-3
priority system used in paper planning, said Becker.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a big change, but it saves having a group of ones or
twos on a list. The program has a 30-day trial period. To continue
using it costs $4.95 to register.
</P>
<P>
   The second program is DATEBK3 ($20 from Pimlico Software). It's
very much like the Palm's date book program, but provides some
welcomed additions. One of those is a ``floating'' item: With
Palm's date book, an item that you didn't want to forget to do on a
Tuesday _ but didn't get done on that day _ would not automatically
move to Wednesday. The item had to be moved manually. DATEBK3 will
keep moving the item forward until it has been checked as done.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice feature: DATEBK3 displays high-priority items in
the to-do list on the daily appointments screen. That way, you're
reminded of items that need to be done as the day progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Handspring's Visor don't need DATEBK3 because it's the
one the company used for its date book program. And although there
is a DATEBK4 version, Becker notes that it takes up nearly a half a
megabyte of Palm memory _ a lot more than DATEBK3 _ while not
adding substantial time-management functions. ``If memory is a
factor, DATEBK3 is the best one to use,'' said Becker.
</P>
<P>
   Becker has a book coming out in October, ``Teach Yourself Palm
Today,'' which will be published by the Sams division of Macmillan
USA.

THIS JESUS READS NIETZSCHE, PLACES PERSONAL ADS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big surprise. There's a guy on the Internet who calls himself
Jesus and is advertising for a mate. He sports golden locks,
dresses in a flowing robe, and claims to have ``a lean swimmer's
body and a six pack.'' On his Web site, www.jesus.com, he's
offering ladies a chance to shower with him as a ``lasting tribute
to. . .cleanliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. So is this the work of a pornographer, a performance
artist, or a postmodern poseur?
</P>
<P>
   This much we know. When ``Jesus'' returns queries, he calls back
collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a joke,'' says the fellow calling collect from Falls
Church, Va. He describes himself as a 26-year-old college graduate
who changed his name to Jesus a few years ago. He claims to be
gainfully employed _ ``I generate intellectual property'' _ and
swears that the Web site is ``totally legitimate.'' He also attests
that he has no interest in money or organized religion, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   So what's up with the Web site? ``I love women immensely, and
I'm looking for a good one,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon the skepticism, Jesus, but there have been too many
online hoaxes for anyone to believe unconditionally. Who are you?
What is your motive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I experiment with various things,'' he says. Well, so did
Timothy Leary. Can you be a little more specific? ``I don't want to
get into past projects.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about all you're going to get from the self-described
spiritualist who favors long romantic walks and the philosophy of
Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. (Nothing like a little nihilism on the
beach!) His ``sermons'' are semi-coherent, anti-corporate screeds,
although the site also boasts pictures of ``Jesus'' endorsing
Starbucks, Guinness, and Barbie. (Go figure.)
</P>
<P>
   In this age of privacy violation, a guy who goes around dressed
as Jesus is paranoid about revealing personal details: ``I don't
want people showing up at my house in the middle of the night,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't the only cryptic fellow associated with the site. The
domain name is registered to Tor Manders, a 34-year-old
Washington-based programmer who says he registered the name several
years ago. Manders says he leases the site to Jesus. A few months
ago, the site featured chat and discussion boards for Christians;
the personal ad went up last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to do with the content,'' says Manders,
not once but twice. ``I'd actually prefer not to have anything to
do with it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Manders can confirm that the photos on the site are real and
that the fellow looking for a mate does have a full-time job,
doesn't smoke, and only drinks socially. (He can't comment on the
``six-pack,'' though.) As for the shower offer, he's not sure what
that's all about. ``The shower thing seems to indicate, um, that
it's humor.'' A pause. ``On the other hand, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC;  ``Mr. Wong,'' an animated Web series on www.icebox.com, is
generating a fair share of controversy online. The title character
is a slant-eyed, buck-toothed butler who works for a self-centered
society girl, stereotypical enough to draw the ire of
Asian-Americans and members of the Junior League alike. In fact,
the show has been excoriated on the community site,
www.asianavenue.com, and the Icebox message boards have been
bombarded by fans and critics of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the most offensive thing about ``Mr. Wong'' is
that it's just not funny. Unlike the hilariously irreverent ``South
Park,'' whose politically incorrect characters are rooted in
contemporary life, ``Mr. Wong'' seems to take place in a time warp,
featuring a bumbling majordomo obsessed with Bing Crosby. The first
two episodes, titled ``Urine Trouble'' (get it? ha ha), are about
the valet's exploits at Graceland. See Mr. Wong urinate on Elvis
Presley's grave. Hear him mix up his l's and r's. Watch him teeter
around on little feet. Are we supposed to be laughing? And what's
up with that accent? It makes Charlie Chan sound downright British.
</P>
<P>
   The show does have one genuinely uproarious moment; too bad it
comes in the opening disclaimer that warns audiences about
offensive content, including ``racially inflammatory material. . .
tired vaudevillian schtick, vomiting, and rude nicknames.'' It does
promise that there are ``almost no portrayals of cannibalism.''
Maybe that would have been funny.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC;  The most recent wrinkle in the recording industry's battle
against online music piracy is a lawsuit against www.mp3board, an
MP3 search engine. But after a visit to the site, it's hard to
imagine what all the fuss is about. The links on the site lead to
other MP3 sites that display an endless series of pop-up windows,
similar to those that show up on porn sites. The pop-up windows
make it nearly impossible to download music. ``That's probably a
bug,'' says Ira Rothken, MP3board.com's attorney. ``It's not the
intention of the design to make it an annoying experience.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC;  You heard it here first: Musicmaker.com may come up with a
whole new concept _ the instant bootleg. The company, which sells
custom compilation CDs, is sponsoring the summer tour of The Who
and Jimmy Page and The Black Crows, which play the Tweeter Center
next week. Recordings of the shows may end up on musicmaker.com,
says Larry Lieberman, the company's president of global marketing.
``We could take a concert by any artist and put it up on the site
the next day for sale anywhere in the world,'' he says. ``The
concept is, `Leave your microphones at home. We'll get the board
mix for you.' '' But that would be legal, and that wouldn't be any
fun at all.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC;  This week, a coalition including Blockbuster, MP3.com, and
Yahoo launched www.whowantstobeamoviestar.com, a scheme that would
allow regular Joes and Judys to bid for the chance to play roles in
a yet-to-be-scripted movie. Under the original plan, aspiring stars
would bid for the roles on Yahoo's auction site; the winning
bidders would be appear in a film by screenwriter Adam Rifkin. The
film will be distributed by Blockbuster, and MP3.com will select
the bands for the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   After folks began placing bids, the California Labor Commission
intervened. It turns out that it is illegal to require a fee from a
job applicant. Whoops. The group revised its plan; now actors must
have others (like proud Aunt Selma) bid for them, acting as
sponsors. The film hasn't been named yet. How about: ``Who Wants to
Be a Labor Lawyer?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC;  Speaking of reality programming, the Net is abuzz with
theories on who is going to be the winner of ``Survivor.'' One fan
site, www.survivorsucks.com, claims to have the inside dope on the
show. Who knows who their ``sources'' are, but one thing is clear:
These people have way too much time on their hands.

PALMTOP SUFFERS; MICROSOFT, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Microsoft Corp. found itself ensnared in the federal
antitrust lawsuit, industry mavens like me have been on the lookout
for signs that the software titan was going soft under the strain.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few: Microsoft's inability to quash the
growing popularity of the Linux operating system, and the
retirements and departures of many of the firm's key executives.
Now I think I've stumbled across yet another sign of corporate
decay _ a good Microsoft product that would probably have been
better, if the company had been able to pop the whip as it did back
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to one of the latest palmtop computers running
Microsoft's Pocket PC software. I've spent a month using the
Hewlett-Packard Jornada 540, and the glitches and imperfections
I've stumbled across prove that Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard
aren't singing from the same hymnbook.
</P>
<P>
   I figure the antitrust case is partly to blame. Among other
things, Microsoft was condemned because it wouldn't let desktop
computer makers change the look and feel of the Windows operating
system. In the view of the US Justice Department, Microsoft's
tactics deprived the public of countless innovations in computer
user interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But consider the alternatives. Apple Computer Inc.
makes both the hardware and software for the Macintosh computer;
Palm Inc. makes the hardware and software for the Palm Pilot.
Because of this total control, both companies produce products that
are elegant and easy to use. Microsoft doesn't make computer
hardware, so it tried to keep it simple for consumers by ordering
PC makers not to touch anything. Looks like they can't do that any
more.
</P>
<P>
   And so we end up with the user interface of the HP Jornada. It's
like trying to use two computers at once; both HP and Microsoft
have installed their own menus, each with a different layout. There
are two places where you can reset screen contrast, but only one
for adjusting screen brightness. There are two places for checking
available memory; one lets you adjust memory levels, while the
other does not.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, Microsoft would simply have told HP to sit
down, shut up, and do it their way. Unfair, perhaps. Nasty?
Definitely. But it would have made the Jornada a lot easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another irksome example. The Jornada has a built-in
digital voice recorder that I used to record a half-hour interview.
I dumped the file onto my desktop computer, only to discover that
it could only be played back on the Jornada. Nobody has written PC
software that'll play back this sound format. I could have reset
the device to use a PC-compatible format if I'd known. But once
upon a time, I wouldn't have had to know. Microsoft would have
insisted that HP make its sound files PC-compatible or else. Ah,
those were the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a bruised, demoralized Microsoft is also easing up on its
own employees. That might explain the Jornada's most inexcusable
flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good palmtop, the Jornada can store your personal
address book. During a road trip, I needed to look up a contact at
IBM Corp. I couldn't remember the name; I just knew he was at IBM.
And that meant the Jornada was useless, because the
Microsoft-designed contact program won't let you search by company
name.
</P>
<P>
   Every other palmtop I've ever seen has this feature, including
previous Pocket PCs. But out of carelessness or laziness, Microsoft
has left it out. It's an astonishing lapse, and I couldn't imagine
buying a Pocket PC until it's fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a pity, because there's much to like about the $500
Jornada. It's smaller and lighter than previous Pocket PC models,
weighing and costing about the same as a Palm Pilot with a color
screen. And it boasts features that Palm Pilot users can only dream
about. There's the built-voice recording, for instance, and the
ability to play MP3 music files. Microsoft Reader, the company's
new electronic book software, is excellent; small enough for a
jacket pocket but clear enough to let me read the latest Michael
Crichton bestseller during a plane ride to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with the Jornada that couldn't be fixed by
a ruthless, aggressive corporate bully that would ride roughshod
over its partners and employees to get the product right. There
used to be a company like that in Seattle.

BUSINESS EXCHANGE SITES RAISE QUESTIONS FOR REGULATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can make individual purchase by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As companies in practically every industry rush to
join business-to-business exchanges on the Internet, regulators are
growing concerned that they will face a rash of new antitrust
questions for which they are not prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Known as B2B Web sites, the exchanges create a place for
companies in the same industry, be it automobiles or grain, to buy
and sell goods, potentially saving millions of dollars in
back-office costs by setting up a national marketplace online. But
the sites, which can compile huge amounts of sensitive data and are
often jointly owned by corporate rivals, also create opportunities
for collusion and price-fixing that did not exist before, antitrust
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Both regulators and executives agree that the stakes are
enormous. B2B sites already account for about $150 billion in
annual sales, significantly more than the better-known consumer
sites like Amazon.com. And that number is expected to grow
exponentially as businesses move more and more into buying and
selling to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust has never had this kind of factual scenario to look
at before,'' said Susan DeSanti, the Federal Trade Commission's
director of policy planning.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the commission took the unusual step of holding a
two-day conference to which it invited executives, lawyers and
consumer advocates to advise it on how to regulate B2B
marketplaces. Already, the commission is examining Covisint, the
site planned by the nation's Big Three carmakers, and last month
the Department of Justice said it was investigating one led by six
large meatpacking companies. The Senate Commerce Committee also
plans to hold a hearing this month on the airline industry's joint
Web sites. And law firms are doing a brisk business in advising
business-to-business exchanges on how to organize themselves so as
to avoid regulatory scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are beginning to take notice now because in
recent months one group of major companies after another has
announced plans to form exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, legal experts say B2B exchanges are likely to present
the next major forum _ after the Microsoft trial and the proposed
Worldcom-Sprint and America Online-Time Warner mergers _ for the
debate over how century-old antitrust laws should be applied to the
new world of the Internet. As in the previous cases, lawyers say,
the questions are not new: What is collusion and how can it be
stopped? When are competitors allowed to cooperate with each other?
Which rivals can they exclude from an alliance?
</P>
<P>
   The new twists are the speed with which companies are able to
communicate with one another and the the frequency with which
longtime rivals, such as DaimlerChrysler and General Motors and
Ford, are setting up joint ventures. Legal experts say those
ventures _ the B2B exchanges _ will give suppliers the opportunity
to signal each other about price increases, for instance, or
manufacturers a chance to conspire to pay artificially low prices
for their supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the issue that came up with Microsoft,'' said Andrew
I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University School of Law. ``Is
antitrust up to dealing with technology?''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate executives, for their part, say the exchanges will
increase competition by giving companies access to the most
updated, accurate information about prices. That in turn will lower
businesses' costs, increasing profits for efficient companies and
eventually bringing lower prices to consumers, they add.
</P>
<P>
   For now, regulators say they are trying to learn as much as they
can about the B2B sites before issuing any far-reaching policies or
bringing suit against individual exchanges. ``We at the FTC are
very much in a learning phase,'' Sheila F. Anthony, a federal trade
commissioner, told executives and lawyers at last week's
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise of huge efficiencies is certainly tantalizing,''
Anthony added. ``On the other hand, I can't help but wonder if
there might be a serpent in the garden of efficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   And Orson Swindle, another federal trade commissioner, said:
``We must get this right. Otherwise, we could do terrible harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites take any number of forms, from auctions that resemble
eBay to online catalogs that allow buyers to sift through products.
Some, like Covisint, are set up by the companies doing the buying.
Others, such as MetalSite, which is owned mainly by steel
manufacturers, are run by sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, though, regulators' worries fall into two
general areas, DeSanti said. In shorthand, Gavil added, the issues
can be thought of as ``exclusion'' _ who is allowed to participate
in the exchanges, under what conditions _ and ``collusion'' _ what
the participants are able to do with the information they gather.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the regulators' concerns is how the rapid
exchange of information on the Web sites will affect the companies'
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every sector of the economy, industry groups now spend
weeks collecting aggregated data on prices and sales volumes. On
the B2B exchanges, by contrast, companies will be able to see
current information immediately. That could make it easier for them
to coordinate the pricing of goods without ever speaking to each
other about it, a practice legal scholars call ``conscious
paralellism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking detailed, current information, a company might decide to
cut prices in a few markets and hope it can steal some market share
before a rival catches on, said Jonathan B. Baker, a former trade
commission official who teaches at the law school at American
University. On a business-to-business Web site, however,
information travels more quickly and could eliminate the price
wars.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is more than than just hypothetical, antitrust experts
say. In 1992, the Justice Department sued the nation's large
airlines, accusing them of using their computer reservation systems
to send up trial balloons on price changes. Smaller airlines also
opposed the system, saying they lacked the money to buy computers
that had suddenly become necessary to compete.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the suit, the airlines agreed to stop publishing
information about future changes in fares.
</P>
<P>
   Though the legal proceedings surrounding it ended years ago, the
airline reservation system has become a frequent topic of
discussion among executives, corporate lawyers and government
officials today. The central questions it raised in the early '90s
about the ways a network can cause collusion and exclusion are the
same ones at the core of the new B2B debate, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fair analogy,'' said Mark L. Walsh, the chief executive
of VerticalNet, which owns 56 B2B marketplaces.
Business-to-business exchanges offer ``a similar potential for
abuse,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates also say that because so many of the
exchanges are owned by competitors, the Web sites will allow rivals
to make decisions jointly about production levels and inventories,
becoming de facto cartels in the mold of OPEC. ``These are serious,
structural issues,'' said Mark Cooper, the research director of the
Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   To address the concerns _ and avoid regulatory run-ins _ the
companies setting up the exchanges are including antitrust lawyers
at almost every stage of the planning, executives say. The lawyer
for MetalSite has attended all of the company's board meetings, and
MetalSite executives avoid giving specific data to its board
members, who work for the steel companies that own the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably show our board less information than most boards
see. They only see aggregated data,'' said David B. Bordo, the
company's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the exchanges is to convince their customers that
they are independent of the companies that founded them. Covisint,
for example, is now negotiating with the trade commission over the
terms of its formal separation from the car companies that created
it, said A. Alan Turfe, the General Motors executive who is the
exchange's interim co-chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The customers, meanwhile, are concerned that proprietary
information _ such as how much aluminum they are buying and at what
price _ will become available to rivals or clients.
</P>
<P>
   Francis P. Lopez, the chief executive of Aztec Manufacturing
Corp., an auto industry supplier in Romulus, Mich., said B2B Web
sites can cut costs and offer ``tremendous, tremendous
advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are a lot of gray areas people are concerned
about,'' Lopez added. ``We have to make sure we have the ability to
protect privacy'' of companies' sensitive data.

WEB'S ACADEMIC PROMISE REMAINS UNFULFILLED _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By JACQUES STEINBERG  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEAVERVILLE, Calif. _ When it learned last year that a private
company was offering college-level Advanced Placement courses on
the Web, the lone high school in this remote gold-rush town thought
it had finally discovered a perfect way to mine the genuine
academic potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To the school, Trinity High, with 500 students, the prospect of
hiring its own Advanced Placement teacher had always been an
unaffordable luxury, even though taking such courses has become a
near necessity for students to get into the most competitive
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   So the school, in the redwood-dense mountains halfway between
San Francisco and the Oregon border, logged on. In essence, it took
the Clinton administration up on its pledge that educational
salvation could be found in new technology, and that the Web could
help the nation's poorest schools approximate the offerings of the
wealthiest, particularly in a corner of the curriculum where the
discrepancies were most stark.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the results here and elsewhere have been ragged,
suggesting that a computer can be a crude substitute for a teacher,
particularly when the students are so young, the stakes for them
are so high and the technology is so new.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand high school students nationwide took
college-level courses online this year, through a private company
called Apex Learning, or one of three state university systems.
They included two teen-agers here, each of whom enrolled in an
advanced government and politics class in which the lessons were
transmitted through electronic text and animated short films, with
exams graded via email. The teacher was never seen.
</P>
<P>
   One Weaverville student dropped out midway through the spring
semester because, he said, he could not summon the stamina to
continue, absent a teacher standing in front of him; the other
student finished the same course, but two weeks late, frustrated by
countless technical glitches that often prevented him from logging
onto the Web for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Similar growing pains were felt by other districts, including
some of those that also contracted with Apex, of Bellevue, Wash., a
leader in providing Advanced Placement courses online. Of the 600
students in 28 states who enrolled in at least one of the company's
online Advanced Placement courses, two-thirds did not complete
enough of the course work to take the final exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still pretty new and we are all learning about it,''
said Sally Narodick, the chief executive of Apex, which was
incorporated two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much is riding on whether such efforts succeed.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have heralded
the educational possibilities of the Web, most of what has been
labeled instruction in cyberspace is supplemental at best _ SAT
training, college counseling and virtual field trips.
</P>
<P>
   But online Advanced Placement courses represent something else,
one of the nation's first real opportunities to marshal technology
to plug gaping holes in the core curriculums of financially pressed
rural and inner-city high schools that cannot afford luxuries like
college level courses. Apex charges schools $325 to $400 per
student. Hiring a teacher could cost more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Apex, one of the few for-profit ventures in the online Advanced
Placement business, has raised $40 million from investors,
including Warburg Pincus, a Wall Street firm; Vulcan Ventures, a
fund led by Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft; and Edison
Schools, the public-school management company led by the
entrepreneur Christopher C. Whittle. Michigan State University, the
University of Nebraska and Johns Hopkins University are also
offering college-level courses to high school students online.
</P>
<P>
   All are seeking to close one of the widest gaps between rich and
poor schools. First begun as an experiment in the 1950s involving
fewer than 2,000 students and a handful of college level courses,
the Advanced Placement program, run by the College Board, now
involves more than 700,000 high school students who took 1.1
million final course exams for college credit this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Though enrollment in at least one such course is regarded as an
unofficial prerequisite for admission to the nation's most
selective colleges _ and the University of California system gives
applicants who take such courses extra credit on their transcripts
_ only half of the nation's high school students have access to
Advanced Placement courses, which are regarded as a perk in
districts strapped for cash.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Education Richard Riley has proposed that every
high school in the country offer at least one Advanced Placement
course by 2002, and add at least one new course each year over the
next 10 years. The Clinton administration has asked Congress to
spend $10 million to help rural and inner-city schools purchase
Advanced Placement courses online.
</P>
<P>
   To Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board, such
online courses are a weak stand-in for what he says the country
needs: 180,000 teachers trained to offer college-level courses to 2
million more high school students.
</P>
<P>
   But Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of the University of
California at Santa Cruz, says such plans are pipe dreams,
considering that many of the districts lacking Advanced Placement
courses are in the grip of a severe teacher shortage in even basic
subjects. Often, Hernandez said, an online course, however flawed,
is the only opportunity a student has to take one. This past school
year, the University of California College Prep Initiative,
conceived by Hernandez and operated out of the system's Santa Cruz
campus, used state grants to pay for 800 California high school
students to take Advanced Placement courses online. They included
the two at Weaverville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is not to be an alternative to a high quality
teacher and classroom,'' Hernandez said. ``Our intent is to be an
alternative to nothing, and that's what they're getting right
now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Weaverville, a town of 3,370 residents, many of them loggers
and forest rangers, the experience of the two students who took
Apex's online government course underscored the program's promise
and its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   For Brian Jones, 19, a senior who wants to be a record producer,
and Jeremy Forbes, 18, who dreams of becoming a cartoonist, taking
college-level ``U.S. Government and Politics'' introduced them to
the concepts of pluralism, federalism, liberalism and conservatism.
Both said they now looked at presidential politics in a new light.
</P>
<P>
   But each was tripped up by shortcomings that, so far, are
embedded in such courses.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-March, in the seventh week of the 15-week course, Jones
was still doing work he should have completed in the second week.
Overwhelmed by the idea of writing a two-page essay twice a week,
and an exam every three weeks, Jones was already thinking of
summer. And with his professor, Steve Sandweiss, 448 miles away in
Tacoma, Wash., where he is a professor at a community college,
Jones dropped out, enrolling instead in his high school's civics
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like doing any work,'' he said. ``I'm just not
organized a lot of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was far more dogged, but he had ongoing problems signing
onto the Apex Web site _ sometimes because of problems on Apex's
end, and sometimes because of the limited capacity of the computers
in his school.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes finished the course two weeks late, and took the Advanced
Placement exam. He will know his grade soon but said that for all
the disruption he felt well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Apex officials said that they were already working to rectify
problems, smoothing software miscommunication, extending the course
calendar by three weeks and providing training for mentor teachers
in students' high schools. But Forbes' guidance counselor, Noreen
Bradbury, said that even in their present form, the online courses
were a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   She said she already had 11 students signed up to take advanced
courses next year in history, statistics, psychology, government
and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens the world to our kids,'' she said. ``They're not
distant and different from everyone else out there. They're as
good.''

&HT;     STUDY SHOWS GEL FAILS TO PROTECT AGAINST AIDS VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ A common spermicidal gel not only failed
to protect women from the AIDS virus, it apparently helped promote
new infections among Thai and African prostitutes, according to a
study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are a setback to efforts worldwide to come up with
a germ-killer that could be used by women to protect themselves
against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In many countries
hit hardest by AIDS, women have trouble insisting their male sex
partners use a condom.
</P>
<P>
   It could also serve as a warning to homosexual men who may have
thought lubricants containing the spermicidal gel Nonoxynol-9 might
help defend against HIV transmission during anal sex.
</P>
<P>
   Although not marketed as an AIDS prevention product, many
manufacturers have added Nonoxynal-9 to lubricants. Studies have
shown that Nonoxynol-9 kills HIV in a test tube and in animals, and
has proved to be safe in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The findings announced Wednesday at the 13th International AIDS
Conference in Durban come from Nonoxynol-9's use in the vagina.
Still, Grant Colfax, director of clinical studies in the HIV
research section of the San Francisco Health Department, said the
results are sobering for men, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinforces the need to use condoms no matter what,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an affliction in
which HIV weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Like other prevention researchers, those seeking to cut
transmission among gay men have been focusing on Nonoxynol-9 as the
most promising candidate as a germ killer. Other potential
microbicides are in the pipeline but none are as far along in
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to re-examine the research agenda at this point,''
Colfax said.
</P>
<P>
   Very little of the world's HIV research is focused on
microbicides, and it has been difficult to attract interest from
pharmaceutical companies in developing such products.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier study in which prostitutes in Cameroon inserted
Nonoxynol-9 impregnated film into their vaginas showed that there
were roughly as many infections among the group that used the
product, compared to the group that used a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Those results were disappointing enough. But when researchers
last month decoded the findings from a study conducted among
prostitutes in South Africa, the Ivory Coast and Thailand, they
found that 59 women who used the gel became infected with HIV,
compared to 41 who were in the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were even higher among women who came in for regular
follow-up exam. Sixteen percent of those using Nonoxynol-9 tested
positive, compared to 9 percent of those who got the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an understatement to say we were extremely
disappointed,'' said Lut Van Damme, a Belgian researcher who
presented the findings. ``The results are a serious setback.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Perriens, who heads the microbicide effort at the United
Nations' AIDS agency, issued a warning to anyone thinking of using
Nonoxynol-9 as protection against sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're wasting your money and you might possibly be wasting
your life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The data suggest that Nonoxynol-9 contributed to small sores in
the women's vaginas that may have provided an easier way for HIV to
enter their bodies. Women who used Nonoxynol-9 had more such sores,
and the number of sores was correlated to the risk of infection.
</P>
<P>
   The gel is marketed as a contraceptive in the United States
under the name Advantage S. Howard Levine, a spokesman for Columbia
Laboratories of Miami, maker of the product, said the findings only
apply to the group of women studied _ prostitutes who used the gel
many times a day, day after day. The gel has passed safety tests,
and Nonoxynol-9 has been on the market for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it is harmful is an overstatement,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, researchers who had been gearing up for further tests of
Nonoxynol-9 are expected to change their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to scrutinize this very carefully,'' said
Nancy Padian, director of international programs at the AIDS
Research Institute of the University of California at San
Francisco. She had been planning to embark on a study of
Nonoxynol-9 in Zimbabwe. ``I'm grateful to be able to make the
decision now, before the study got under way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the research pipeline are five other potential microbicides
that rely on various ways to combat HIV. Some interfere with the
ability of HIV to attach itself to the body's cells, others attack
germs generally, and some make the vagina more acidic, which is
toxic to HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also are looking at introducing anti-retroviral
agents, similar to those taken orally, as a way to prevent HIV from
gaining a foothold.

CHINA, FEARING MICROSOFT DEPENDENCE, LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Janet Reno is not the only one worried about
Bill Gates' software monopoly: China's leaders are, too.
</P>
<P>
   They are concerned that the country is growing overly dependent
on the Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system, which controls
microcomputers running everything from banks to President Jiang
Zemin's e-mail box. But the Chinese government, itself a master at
monopoly, is taking its case against Microsoft not to the
courtroom, but to the marketplace, albeit with a bit of
administrative fiat. It is backing the Linux operating system,
which was created by a Finnish university student in 1991 and is
distributed free to anyone who wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want one company to monopolize the software market,''
said Chen Chong, a deputy minister of information industries who
oversees the computer industry in China. With Linux, ``we can
control the security,'' he added, so ``we can control our own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Chinese have likened dependence on Microsoft
to leaving the keys to the country's increasingly computerized
economy in the hands of a potential enemy. Some warn that secret
holes in Microsoft's computer code might allow the United States
access to Chinese networks or even enable it, in time of war, to
shut those networks down.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns were heightened last year when a cryptographer for
a Canadian software firm working in the United States said he had
found a feature in Windows called an NSAKey _ as in National
Security Agency, the U.S. government agency that gathers electronic
signal intelligence worldwide. Though Microsoft said the key was
innocuous and no support has been found for any sinister
explanation, ``no one can guarantee that Windows does not have back
doors,'' said Liu Bo, a former Microsoft executive who is now chief
executive of Red Flag, a Chinese government-backed company set up
to create software based on Linux, and to encourage a software
industry in China.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, various arms of the government have been warning of
the security risk posed by the country's reliance on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without information security, there is no national security in
politics, economics and military affairs,'' declared an editorial
in People's Liberation Army Daily earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft calls such fears nonsense and says it continues to
enjoy a strong working relationship with the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shared product information with them,'' said Michael
Rawding, Microsoft's regional director in China, ``and I believe
that their comfort with our product information led them to allow
the launch'' of Windows 2000, Microsoft's new business-oriented
operating system, in China last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Windows source code, which Microsoft keeps secret,
Linux's code is open for all to see and is freely distributed with
the stipulation that anybody can improve it as long as any
modifications are shared with the rest of the world. The almost
communistic ``from each according to his ability, to each according
to his need'' approach appeals to China's Marxist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the government's stand, no one is suggesting that
Microsoft is finished in China. Though it will not provide specific
sales figures, the company says its software sales in China surged
80 percent last year and continue to grow. But the government's
move to diversify may reflect a broader dissatisfaction with
Microsoft and its founder, Gates, who just a few years ago was
hailed as a hero by China's young technology enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in Microsoft's image was the introduction of
its Chinese-language Windows 95 operating system, which was
programmed to display references to ``Communist bandits'' and to
exhort users to ``take back the mainland.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, infuriated to learn that Microsoft had used computer
programmers in Taiwan to write the software, demanded that the
company hire mainland programmers to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the company's critics is its former general manager
for China, Juliet Wu, who has become a national celebrity with her
withering, best-selling expose, ``Up Against the Wind: Microsoft,
IBM and Me.'' The picture she paints of Microsoft as an arrogant
Goliath feeds into the irritation many Chinese computer users feel
toward the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wu and other critics say Microsoft's pricing _ a software
program can cost as much as an average office worker's monthly
salary _ forces users to buy pirated copies of the company's
software. (The Business Software Alliance, a nonprofit trade group,
estimates that as much as 95 percent of all software in China is
pirated, though the industry hopes China's expected admission to
the World Trade Organization will change that.)
</P>
<P>
   Liu Dongli, an Internet entrepreneur in the southern province of
Fujian, was so enraged by having to pay $241 for the Windows 98
operating system that he sued the company for unfair pricing. The
suit was withdrawn when Liu realized that Microsoft charges no more
for its products in China than it does elsewhere. ``But that
doesn't mean we lost the case,'' he fumed, vowing to bring suit
again when he has more evidence. ``Monopoly is not a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The news media, meanwhile, have criticized Microsoft for suing a
company last year over the sale of pirated software. Microsoft,
which was asking for $200,000 in damages, lost the case because the
Chinese court ruled that it had sued the wrong company. The defeat
only darkened Microsoft's ominous silhouette in the eyes of many
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is a bully,'' said Hua Yuqing, a young Internet
entrepreneur, who complains that Microsoft's high prices and
proprietary computer code squelch creativity. He is building a
business creating software programs that run on Linux. ``I don't
want to feel that I'm subconsciously controlled,'' Hua said,
referring to the dependence on Microsoft that comes with using its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Hua and a half-dozen computer programmers are using Linux to
start a company that rents access to software, applications like
accounting and sales-tracking, through the Internet, rather than
selling copies of the software programs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's public relations in China has been a boon for Linux.
So far, several companies _ including Red Flag, which is backed by
President Jiang's son, Jiang Mianhang, and TurboLinux, based in San
Francisco _ have introduced Chinese-language versions of the Linux
operating system in China. Many other companies have started to
provide software and services for China's Linux users.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government tried for more than a decade to develop
an operating system of its own, but was unable to keep up with the
fast-changing industry. Linux gives the country the tools to build
that system now _ and, in the Chinese view, the fact that the Linux
code is not privately owned assures that any security it wants to
build into its computer systems will not have undetectable
vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   But even Linux enthusiasts profess some ambivalence about the
government's interest. Software developers writing programs for
Linux in China say some of their overseas colleagues worry that
China may not play by the rules for collaborating and sharing, and
may adapt Linux to create a proprietary system instead.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, China represents a market potential of such size,
and government influence over the market is still so strong, that
Beijing's support can turn almost any product into an industry
standard domestically. By the end of next year, the country may
well be the third-largest PC market in the world, and software
sales are expected to grow more than 30 percent a year for the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   As China's economy becomes increasingly integrated with that of
the region and the world, much of Asia is likely to follow its
lead.

   Liu, the chief executive of Red Flag, says a third of the
country's Internet servers _ the computers that power Web sites _
are already using Linux operating systems. He estimated that by the
end of next year Linux will run half of all servers in China and as
much as a third of the country's desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, those estimates may be exaggerated. Technology research
firm International Data Corp.'s Asia-Pacific division says its data
show less than 3 percent of all PC servers shipped to China last
year were loaded with Linux. But IDC expects the number to more
than double this year, and Linux's real market share is most
certainly higher because the operating system can be downloaded
free from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux, without doubt, has gained some headway among software
developers in China,'' Rawding said. ``However, I have yet to see
any mission-critical organization deploy Linux because the truth of
the matter is that in businesses, you want the support and service
to be available to you instantly when something does go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Great Wall Computer, one of China's biggest PC
makers, has already shipped 200,000 desktop computers loaded with
the Linux operating system, which looks much like Windows though it
cannot yet match all of Microsoft's features.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Li, marketing chief at Great Wall, says his company shifted
toward Linux at Beijing's urging. ``As a leading enterprise,'' he
said, ``we should respond to the call of the government.''

AT A CROSSROADS, PEOPLESOFT BETS ON THE FUTURE OF INTERNET-BASED 
SOFTWARE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Investors, clients and competitors are
wondering: Will PeopleSoft's newest product, a software rooted to
the Internet, lead to the demise or revival of the once highflying
company? The answer may become clearer on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in New York, PeopleSoft plans to show the
latest version of its ``enterprise software,'' a huge and complex
program that companies use to automate dozens of tasks, like
managing customer relations and human resources, sales support and
marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the newest version is that it will be Internet-based,
meaning company employees and customers can use the program with an
ordinary Web browser, instead of tapping into an internal corporate
software program.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, PeopleSoft's release is months behind the
Internet-centric releases of its competitors and the industry's
market share leaders, Oracle and SAP. Plus, PeopleSoft is coming
off a disappointing year of flat revenue and a falling stock price
_ after years of double-digit growth _ and a management overhaul
that moved the company's founder, David A. Duffield, out of the
chief executive position, leaving him as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft shares closed at $18.375 on Friday, a drop of over 30
percent since January. Adding to the company's challenges, a
shareholder lawsuit, filed on June 30 in Alameda County Court in
California, accuses company officials of insider trading. The
company declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But PeopleSoft said its two-and-a-half year development of the
new version will signal a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could shift the landscape,'' said Craig A. Conway, who in
May 1999 replaced Duffield as chief executive. He predicted the
overhauled software will provide a resurgence for PeopleSoft
against Oracle and SAP. ``We've got an ace up our sleeve,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   That trump card consists of additional features to the software
that the company gambled a significant portion of its budget
developing, he said. The features include 50 highly targeted
programs like Internet-based support for company technicians and
sales people, and Internet-based customer scorecards for clients.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in anticipation of the release, Lehman Brothers raised
its rating of PeopleSoft to ``outperform,'' up from ``neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   But more generally, industry analysts say it remains to be seen
whether PeopleSoft, based in Pleasanton, Calif., can revive its
fortunes and catch Oracle, also based in northern California, and
SAP, of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Exact market share figures are difficult to come by, because
each company has different definitions of what constitutes
enterprise software. SAP says it has 18,000 enterprise software
customers, Oracle claims 8,500 and PeopleSoft 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas P. Berquist, senior electronic commerce analyst with
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., said that of the 55 competitors in the field,
SAP leads with 10,000, Oracle follows with 6,000 and PeopleSoft has
3,000.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, analysts say much remains undecided in an
industry that has undergone fundamental change in the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Berquist said the industry peaked in 1997 with about $35 billion
in revenue. Since then, the industry has languished at between $25
and $30 billion in revenue, and he and other analysts say that one
main reason for the drop-off was the Y2K glitch.
</P>
<P>
   The theory goes that many companies last year simply stopped
buying enterprise software _ which can cost hundreds of thousands
to hundreds of millions of dollars _ when they realized they could
not have it in place and tested in time for any possible millennium
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor was that the makers of this software _ led by
Oracle, which pushed the idea early on _ promised a new generation
of programs run entirely over the Internet. They said the upgrade
would be profound because companies would be able to provide
essential software to employees without the company ever having to
configure their individual computers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, when employees wanted to file an expense form, check
product updates, look into their retirement portfolio or contact
suppliers, they would do so by logging into an Internet site on
which all the information was kept. Oracle said that it saved $1
billion on operating expenses last year by using its own
Internet-based software internally.
</P>
<P>
   This shift to Internet-based software from so-called
client-server based software _ in which some parts of the program
are kept on a central server and some on individual computers _
signals a radical shift in the industry, Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the architecture gets reshuffled, it's the single
greatest transition an industry can go through,'' he said. He said
the change is analogous to the shift in 1990 to the client-server
era from making enterprise software for mainframe computers, a
transition he said caused fits for the market leaders of the day,
Dun &AMP; Bradstreet and MSA.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say the present-day transformation is causing
consolidation among the smaller players in the industry and some
business failures. Baan, one of the top five enterprise software
competitors over the last several years, in May announced it had
sold its operations to Invensys, following seven straight quarters
of losses.
</P>
<P>
   However, Oracle announced its Internet-based product, 11i, last
year, deployed it piecemeal, but still racked up more than $400
million in sales the company's fiscal fourth quarter 2000. It began
shipping the software in complete form in May. Its head start gave
it ``a big marketing lead,'' said Nicole S. Gemmer, a research
associate with Chase H&AMP;Q.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, SAP introduced its product, mySAP.com, in the spring
of 1999 and began shipping in November. People familiar with the
company say the new product has 300 customers, including a deal
announced on June 14 to license mySAP.com to Nestle for use by
230,000 employees, a contract said to be worth $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft plans to start shipping its product, PeopleSoft 8, in
September. Jenni Lehman, an analyst of human resources software
with the Gartner Group, said PeopleSoft's late entrance can cut
both ways. ``There's no question they did get there late,'' she
said, but she added that they have the advantage of learning from
the efforts, and failings, of SAP and Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, PeopleSoft executives say they have one key edge: that
their product is the most completely Internet-based. Indeed,
Berquist, from Goldman Sachs, said some portions of the SAP and
Oracle programs still reside on the desktop computers of employees,
meaning PeopleSoft's offering could find a receptive audience among
companies looking for a truly Internet-only solution.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft's gamble was expensive. The company spend 27 percent
of its budget last year on research and development, Conway said.
But he said he was willing to bet that if PeopleSoft successfully
shifted its products to being Internet-based, it could return to
its glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Berquist said the answer will soon become clear _ perhaps not by
Tuesday, but before too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The street is looking for evidence that with the release of
pure Internet applications, growth will be stimulated'' in the
enterprise section, he said. ``It may take a quarter or two to
know. We'll all be watching closely.''

&HT;     STUDY SHOWS GEL FAILS TO PROTECT AGAINST AIDS VIRUS

<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ A common spermicidal gel not only failed
to protect women from the AIDS virus, it apparently helped promote
new infections among Thai and African prostitutes, according to a
study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are a setback to efforts worldwide to come up with
a germ-killer that could be used by women to protect themselves
against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In many countries
hit hardest by AIDS, women have trouble insisting their male sex
partners use a condom.
</P>
<P>
   It could also serve as a warning to homosexual men who may have
thought lubricants containing the spermicidal gel Nonoxynol-9 might
help defend against HIV transmission during anal sex.
</P>
<P>
   Although not marketed as an AIDS prevention product, many
manufacturers have added Nonoxynal-9 to lubricants. Studies have
shown that Nonoxynol-9 kills HIV in a test tube and in animals, and
has proved to be safe in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The findings announced Wednesday at the 13th International AIDS
Conference in Durban come from Nonoxynol-9's use in the vagina.
Still, Grant Colfax, director of clinical studies in the HIV
research section of the San Francisco Health Department, said the
results are sobering for men, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinforces the need to use condoms no matter what,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an affliction in
which HIV weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Like other prevention researchers, those seeking to cut
transmission among gay men have been focusing on Nonoxynol-9 as the
most promising candidate as a germ killer. Other potential
microbicides are in the pipeline but none are as far along in
testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to re-examine the research agenda at this point,''
Colfax said.
</P>
<P>
   Very little of the world's HIV research is focused on
microbicides, and it has been difficult to attract interest from
pharmaceutical companies in developing such products.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier study in which prostitutes in Cameroon inserted
Nonoxynol-9 impregnated film into their vaginas showed that there
were roughly as many infections among the group that used the
product, compared to the group that used a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Those results were disappointing enough. But when researchers
last month decoded the findings from a study conducted among
prostitutes in South Africa, the Ivory Coast and Thailand, they
found that 59 women who used the gel became infected with HIV,
compared to 41 who were in the placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   The figures were even higher among women who came in for regular
follow-up exam. Sixteen percent of those using Nonoxynol-9 tested
positive, compared to 9 percent of those who got the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an understatement to say we were extremely
disappointed,'' said Lut Van Damme, a Belgian researcher who
presented the findings. ``The results are a serious setback.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Perriens, who heads the microbicide effort at the United
Nations' AIDS agency, issued a warning to anyone thinking of using
Nonoxynol-9 as protection against sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're wasting your money and you might possibly be wasting
your life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The data suggest that Nonoxynol-9 contributed to small sores in
the women's vaginas that may have provided an easier way for HIV to
enter their bodies. Women who used Nonoxynol-9 had more such sores,
and the number of sores was correlated to the risk of infection.
</P>
<P>
   The gel is marketed as a contraceptive in the United States
under the name Advantage S. Howard Levine, a spokesman for Columbia
Laboratories of Miami, maker of the product, said the findings only
apply to the group of women studied _ prostitutes who used the gel
many times a day, day after day. The gel has passed safety tests,
and Nonoxynol-9 has been on the market for many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it is harmful is an overstatement,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, researchers who had been gearing up for further tests of
Nonoxynol-9 are expected to change their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to scrutinize this very carefully,'' said
Nancy Padian, director of international programs at the AIDS
Research Institute of the University of California at San
Francisco. She had been planning to embark on a study of
Nonoxynol-9 in Zimbabwe. ``I'm grateful to be able to make the
decision now, before the study got under way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the research pipeline are five other potential microbicides
that rely on various ways to combat HIV. Some interfere with the
ability of HIV to attach itself to the body's cells, others attack
germs generally, and some make the vagina more acidic, which is
toxic to HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also are looking at introducing anti-retroviral
agents, similar to those taken orally, as a way to prevent HIV from
gaining a foothold.

<P>
   It is going to change everything, they say. A new wave of
technology will put the world at people's fingertips. Pundits speak
breathlessly of checking stock quotes, sending e-mail messages,
even buying books at the touch of the button. And investors are
racing to buy into the companies making it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like the Internet in 1995? Indeed it does. But today all
the same hope and promotion are directed at a new generation of
services offered through cellular telephones, pagers and myriad
other radio-wave gizmos. All that is missing is a glossy magazine
to chronicle it all, called, say, Unwired.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the wireless Internet will spread even more
quickly than the wired one. That is because, from now on, nearly
every cell phone sold will have standard Web-browser software built
in. Adapting existing Web sites for use by these wireless browsers
is a relatively small additional expense. And thanks to the wired
Internet, tens of millions of people are already in the habit of
communicating electronically; the transition to wireless access
should seem but a natural next step to them.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the analogies to the wired Internet, it is likely to
be much harder to create services for wireless devices that are
easy, useful and profitable than it has been for the wired world.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, slow speeds, tiny screens and tortured methods of
entering text can make surfing the Net on a cell phone about as
satisfying an experience as reading a newspaper on a ticker tape
would be. And while the browser software does not add to the price
of a phone, most carriers charge users extra fees and per-minute
rates to send or receive data.
</P>
<P>
   As for devices like two-way pagers and Palm hand-held computers,
which have bigger screens and easier ways to enter text, the
hardware and monthly service fees are even more costly than the
cell phone services.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it is not clear how much business can be done
when it takes five minutes and 100 clicks to make an airplane
reservation wirelessly. And whatever limitations banner
advertisements may have on the Internet, they are Hollywood
productions compared with the possibilities on a cell phone screen
that shows four lines with a maximum of 22 text characters a line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies who are marketing this as the Web in your pocket
are overpromising by a long shot and well could sour the market,''
said Seamus McAteer, an analyst for Jupiter Communications. ``A lot
of the stuff on the Web just doesn't translate to a wireless device
today. A kid just isn't going to do research for his homework on a
cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless proponents argue that people love their mobility so
much that they will put up with expensive, hard-to-use data
services, just as they tolerate the static and cost of cell phones
themselves. They point to the mobs of teen-agers in Japan and
Finland using cell phones to send wireless love notes with their
thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, for one, is making a big bet that the most
popular application on wireless phones, as on its computer service,
will be buddy lists and instant messages.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, proponents argue that in the future technology will
allow bigger screens, faster data and some sort of easy way to
enter text _ possibly voice recognition. And they envision
complementary uses, PCs at home for detailed information searches
and exchanges and small wireless devices for terse updates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that people will do on mobile devices will be
completely different than on the Web,'' said Naveen Jain, chairman
of Infospace, a company that operates parts of the mobile data
service offered by carriers like AT&AMP;T and Verizon Wireless. ``You
want utilitarian, personalized and actionable information.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wireless Internet services have been available for several
years, first in the form of radio modems for laptops that were
mainly used by corporations that wanted to stay in touch with their
traveling sales force. More recently, two-way pagers, like the
Blackberry, made by Research in Motion, have become a status item
for executives who want to send e-mail on the run.
</P>
<P>
   The first mass-market wireless data service was over the Palm
VII, a version of 3Com's popular organizer introduced a year ago
with a wireless modem built in. So far, the Palm has attracted
somewhat more than 100,000 wireless customers. More important, it
has attracted a host of developers creating wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, for example, lets wireless Palm VII users search its
huge selection of books and other products, read user comments and
order with their one-click accounts. Web portals, including Yahoo
and Excite at Home's Excite, enable wireless users to tap into
services like e-mail and stock quotes. Other companies, like
Omnisky and Go America, have introduced online services and clip-on
modems that can provide wireless connections for existing hand-held
devices.
</P>
<P>
   But experts predict that wireless access on hand-held computers
will be overshadowed by the use of cell phones. Sprint PCS
introduced its Wireless Web service last November. It says a third
of its 7 million phones are now capable of browsing wireless Web
sites and more than a million have. Last month, AT&AMP;T introduced a
similar service and Monday Verizon, which was formed by the
combination of Bell Atlantic AirTouch and GTE and is the nation's
largest wireless carrier, plans to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with customer turnover and price wars, the carriers hope
data services can help restore their profit margins. But they are
taking sharply divergent approaches to designing and pricing their
data services.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Sprint and Verizon, see wireless data as a major
source of new revenue. They charge customers a monthly fee of $7 to
$10 to gain access to data services and then a per-minute fee for
each minute spent surfing or talking, with a set number included
with the monthly service plan.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has a very different model. For customers who buy a new
Web-enabled phone, the company will give unlimited free access to
some 40 information and commerce sites. AT&AMP;T customers who want to
use e-mail must pay $7 a month, and customers who want both e-mail
and the freedom to go to other wireless sites of their own choosing
must pay $15 a month. But there is no per-minute charge on either
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Much like an advertising-supported Web site, AT&AMP;T intends to
earn money from its free service through commissions from the sales
Web sites make to AT&AMP;T's Web-phone users. It also hopes that users
whose appetites are whetted by the free service can be persuaded to
upgrade to the pay services.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, though, how customers will react to AT&AMP;T's free
offer as they discover that the wireless Internet the company
promises does not include leading services like AOL and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the carriers want to be the control points,'' said
Mohan Vishwanath, vice president of Yahoo's mobile unit. ``But we
all know that if anything is going to grow at the rate of the
Internet, it has to be open.''
</P>
<P>
   The other carriers are not limiting access, but they are
nonetheless charging Web sites fees to be listed in prominent
positions in their cramped on-screen menus. Recently, America
Online supplanted Yahoo as the top item on Sprint's menu after
reportedly agreeing to a sizable payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the first several positions are of great value, and
we have charged for it,'' said John Garcia, Sprint marketing
director. He declined to discuss details of the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia did say, though, that Sprint is not yet sure how crucial
such payments will be to its business overall. ``The most important
thing now is how many minutes we rack up,'' he said. But over time,
the company may experiment with services in which advertisements
and commissions subsidize some or all of the air time, as AT&AMP;T is
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web site operators are bristling at the demands for
payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe in paying tremendous amounts to get listed,''
said Ali Hussein, the marketing director for Amazon.com's wireless
service. ``There is a definite benefit to the carriers to have
Amazon's brand and features on their service.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, nearly every major Web site is developing a wireless
version of its service and is paying whatever it takes to be on as
many menus as possible. Amazon, for example, has reached deals for
prominent display on Sprint and Verizon's service, but not on
AT&AMP;T's.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear just how much Internet sites might benefit
from these wireless deals. For now, the sites primarily want to
retain their customers who happen to use wireless services, even if
there is no immediate revenue to be gained.
</P>
<P>
   Travelocity.com, the online travel service, will soon allow
people to make reservations from a cell phone, though it expects
people will not want to do that very often. More valuable, perhaps,
as a convenience to its most profitable business travelers, is the
new system Travelocity has developed that will let travelers change
their return flights with just a few clicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to use a phone to say `Where should I go for
a cruise?''' said Terrell B. Jones, chief executive of Travelocity.
``But if you are in a meeting that is running long, wouldn't you
like to use your phone to pull up your reservation and click a
button marked `Later?'''
</P>
<P>
   So far there are no banner ads on wireless services, but the Web
sites are looking for ways to weave advertising in somewhere.
Yahoo, for example, offers a service that will send brief news,
weather or sports reports to users' phones, and those messages are
sponsored by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ZDnet, the technology information site, will also soon weave
some advertising into the text of its articles about computers and
technology that users read wirelessly. Later, ZDnet hopes to earn
fees from referring customers to computer stores.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the wireless strategy for most Web sites is to become
big fast and figure out how to make money later.
</P>
<P>
   See? It does sound like the Internet all over again, doesn't it?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Online retailers have been putting their marketing budgets on
crash diets this year _ replacing pricey, fatty television ads and
portal deals with leaner print ads and e-mail efforts that, like
all diet foods, may be less sumptuous but are far healthier in the
long run. More recently, dot-com retailers are testing a new item
on the low-fat marketing menu: catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Long a staple of the direct marketing industry, catalogs are the
newest fad among Web merchants who, in their pursuit of
profitability, have cast off any pretensions of Internet-only
retailing.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise, of course, that Web merchants
like RedEnvelope.com, eHats, Food.com, and eZiba.com, among others,
have either begun mass mailings or are developing such programs. It
is an accepted fact that online shoppers and catalog consumers are
a similar breed, preferring to browse through merchandise without
the help of a sales clerk, and accepting the risks inherent in
long-distance purchasing. And the back-office operations of catalog
and consumer-oriented e-commerce companies are nearly identical.
</P>
<P>
   But the catalog leanings of Internet retailers can also be
explained by looking at their executive rosters. The dot-coms spent
much of 1998 and 1999 raiding the management teams of L.L. Bean and
other giants of the direct mail realm, so it was probably
inevitable that many Web merchants would expand into catalog
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although these Internet executives are not abandoning other
marketing campaigns as they adopt catalogs, they express delighted
surprise about how well catalogs compare with other popular
marketing approaches, like e-mail advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can produce and mail a catalog that costs about the same,
if not less, than a targeted e-mail campaign,'' said Matt Jackson,
vice president for marketing at eHats, an online hat retailer that
is developing its first catalog.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies that conduct custom e-mail campaigns on behalf of
e-tailers may charge 25 cents or more per e-mail sent, Jackson
said. According to the Direct Marketing Association, most catalogs
cost 50 cents to $1 to print and mail to each household.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an e-mail, people either delete it or look at it quickly
and delete it,'' he said. ``But if we execute a catalog properly,
we know it'll not only get eyeballs, but it'll stay in someone's
house, so it has a shelf life and a much longer lasting impact than
a targeted e-mail campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   With catalogs, e-tailers also see a way to reach an objective
that no amount of digital alchemy can achieve _ selling goods to
the 50 percent of American households that remain without Internet
connections. ``We have to reach as many people as possible,''
Jackson said, ``and let them buy in whatever way they feel
comfortable, be it through the phone, the Web site a catalog,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   And even as they view catalogs as a cost-effective way to reach
offline customers, e-tailers are also looking at them as a means to
increase the Web site's traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Take eZiba.com, which sells handmade goods from far-flung
regions of the world. The company plans to begin testing a catalog
this fall with a mailing to 500,000 consumers, according to Bill
Miller, the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a former executive vice president at F.A.O. Schwarz,
said he would use the catalog primarily to attract customers to the
eZiba Web site. ``Every time we dropped a catalog at F.A.O., we saw
a significant increase in our Web traffic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catalogs can help create Web site traffic by showing customers a
limited, but enticing, selection of a company's overall merchandise
offerings, executives said. And because a Web order is less
expensive to process than a phone-based order, companies frequently
offer discounts or free shipping to draw customers to their sites.
</P>
<P>
   EZiba has more reason than many other e-tailers to use catalogs
as a device for generating Web traffic, rather than mainly a
vehicle for direct sales, Miller said. Because eZiba's business
involves selling goods with limited availability, the company
cannot stock enough items to support an extensive catalog mailed to
tens of millions of consumers. EZiba will ship a catalog with a
limited number of items that will be well-stocked, in case
consumers order those items in droves.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, Internet merchants are nicely positioned to
produce a catalog at low cost. Many e-tailers already have plenty
of product descriptions and high-resolution digital photographs of
merchandise on hand, as well as in-house creative directors with
experience in print publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Web retailers who have initiated catalog efforts say
incremental production costs are minimal. But executives said that
to market a catalog successfully, companies must overcome far more
difficult, and potentially expensive, hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Inventory management, as Miller noted, can be a huge issue.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Bazzone, president of RedEnvelope.com, an online gifts
retailer that began selling through catalogs in February, said
merchants that did not properly manage inventory during a catalog
mailing risked either alienating customers with sold-out items, or
burying their warehouses in unsold merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   For most catalogs, he said, 75 to 80 percent of the sales occur
within 40 days of the mailing. As a result, many catalog operations
engage in what is called ``slotting,'' or staggering their order
volumes with suppliers. So instead of ordering 1,000 items from a
vendor, they would arrange to receive 300 initially, have another
300 delivered two weeks after the catalog is shipped, and then have
the option of either receiving or canceling the remaining items,
depending on sales.
</P>
<P>
   The process is even more complicated for Web retailers, he said,
because the same items sell at different rates through the
different channels. ``It can get very hairy,'' Bazzone said.
</P>
<P>
   Developing an effective mailing list is no snap either,
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies must know their audience well enough to cite specific
customer demographics when they approach so-called list brokers,
who typically sell names and addresses of prospective customers for
$100 to $125 per thousand. And once the first mailing goes out,
merchants must have the personnel and technology in place to
analyze the response rates, so they can fine-tune subsequent
mailings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes Direct Marketing 101 from there,'' said Cindy
Marshall, director of marketing for eZiba.com.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for dot-coms, the course requirements for Direct
Marketing 101 also include a large section on customer service _ an
area of study that many e-tailers seemed to have slept through in
previous semesters. H. Robert Wientzen, president of the Direct
Marketing Association, an industry trade group, said Internet
merchants ``need to have real customer service when it comes to a
catalog, because customers expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he said, that requires substantial investment in
phone-based customer-service representatives. ``And it's probably
too late for some companies who are cash poor to make enough of an
investment in customer service to make it work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Internet companies that follow the catalog path can take
some solace in the experiences of Bazzone at RedEnvelope. He said
that only 30 percent of the orders generated by the company's
catalogs were taken over the phone. The rest, he said, came via the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Orton, senior vice president for business development at
Food.com, which delivers take-out food for 16,000 restaurants
around the country, said she hoped the company's coming catalog
effort would, like RedEnvelope.com, yield far more Web orders than
phone orders. Because the company already takes large numbers of
orders over the phone, Orton said she was not concerned about the
effect a catalog might have on customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the catalog as a way to migrate people from the phone
to the online experience,'' she said. For instance, Orton said that
in a recent survey 68 percent of the customers who had ordered over
the phone said they would prefer to use the Internet. ``So we see
this as a great opportunity for us.''

<P>
   Back in Reykjavik, Skuli Mogensen saw the wireless Internet
craze that was sweeping his native Iceland and had an inspiration:
Why not try to export the revolution by taking his company's
software for mobile wireless devices to the United States?
</P>
<P>
   So he has been preparing his company, OZ.com, to be a
trans-Atlantic wireless contender.``I had no doubt this thing will
explode in America,'' said Mogensen, 31, who incorporated OZ in San
Francisco. ``The U.S. market has relatively high usage of the
Internet, PCs, cable modems, Palm devices and cell phones, so why
shouldn't the wireless Internet be used to unite all of these
things?''
</P>
<P>
   It is far too early to handicap the chances for OZ, which
recently received a large equity investment from Ericsson, the
Swedish telecommunications company. OZ is but one of many hopefuls
in a free-for-all involving dozens of other start-ups and large
telecommunications companies to develop and promote access to the
Internet. And like the migrating Mogensen, the wireless Internet
craze is coming to the United States from overseas _ primarily
Europe and Asia, where for various reasons the trend took hold
first.
</P>
<P>
   The wireless Internet, which provides Web access on devices like
pagers, cell phones and Palm hand-held devices, is being promoted
as the most promising technological development since the Internet
itself started taking off in the early 1990s. In two or three
years, there are expected to be almost as many wireless Internet
users worldwide as people accessing the Web on wired PCs. But given
the current state of play in the industry _ and some distinct
technical shortcomings _ can the wireless Web live up to its
billing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may depend on the ability of companies to wade
through a morass of competing technical standards in their efforts
to make wireless Web access faster and more convenient. And at
least in the early going, American consumers will find that
wireless Web surfing is a slow, bare-bones experience bearing scant
resemblance to the hard-wired version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the euphoria phase right now, where the future seems
very bright,'' said Jane Zweig, executive vice president of
Herschel Shostek Associates, a wireless research firm. ``But pretty
soon we'll get to the pain phase, when the complications of the
wireless Internet will become apparent. Then it'll take a while to
get to the pleasure and perfection phases.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers in this country can already glimpse the wireless
Internet's potential through applications that enable them to get
stock quotes, check the weather or send short text messages over
their mobile phones or other devices. And judging from experiences
in Europe and Asia, Americans have only started to scratch the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, teen-agers download still cartoons on services
provided by NTT DoCoMo, the country's leading wireless company,
whose mobile Internet customers account for 30 percent of Japanese
Web users. In Italy, daily horoscopes are the rage. In Finland and
Sweden, one of the hottest applications is a mobile banking service
allowing people to conduct nearly every banking transaction except
withdrawing cash.
</P>
<P>
   Global growth estimates for the mobile Internet can be heady.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ARC Group, a London consulting firm, about 100
million of the world's 500 million mobile phones in use by year-end
will be capable of Internet access. Within three years, ARC says,
an estimated 300 million of 900 million wireless phones will be
Internet-ready. Other industry forecasts say that in five years, as
many as 500 million people worldwide _ one of every dozen _ will
have phones or other devices capable of wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Whether those projections are close to attainable will depend
largely on efforts now under way to increase the speed of wireless
Internet connections. For now, the fastest wireless speeds range
from 9,600 to 14,400 bits a second, much slower than the Internet
connections of up to 56,000 bits a second available to people using
dial-up modems on their home computers. (And, of course, other
kinds of wired connections, like cable modems or high-speed lines
are much faster still.)
</P>
<P>
   Today's wireless speed limits mean that most wireless users in
the United States can do little more than send or receive a few
lines of Internet text through cell phones _ maybe reading a brief
news alert about the latest interest-rate decision by the Federal
Reserve, or sending a short e-mail message over a Yahoo or Hotmail
account.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, nearly everyone in the wireless industry agrees that by
next year speeds approaching that of a typical home PC connection
will be available through wireless devices, allowing sophisticated
applications like the downloading of images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is a temporary problem,'' said John Garcia, senior vice
president for sales and distribution at Sprint PCS, one of the
nation's largest wireless operators, which is busily adding
Internet access to cities throughout its network.
</P>
<P>
   One reason wireless technology does not yet allow for more
sophisticated Internet applications is that companies in different
parts of the world have adopted different technological standards,
instead of rallying around a single standard that might ease
development of a common mass market for wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, for the most part, has adhered to a digital technology
known as GSM, which stands for global system for mobile
communications. In Asia, a mixture of standards is in use, with
CDMA, which stands for code division multiple access, dominant in
Japan and South Korea, while GSM is sporadically used elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in the United States where standards have been most
fragmented, helping explain why the wireless Internet has been
slower to catch on here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T uses a format called TDMA, or time-division multiple
access. Because TDMA does not support data transmission, AT&AMP;T has
been forced to overlay an older format to provide Internet access
through its cell phones, adding further complexity to its current
generation of handsets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other American carriers like Sprint and Verizon have
adopted CDMA. And still others, including VoiceStream Wireless and
Pacific Bell, a unit of SBC Communications use European-style GSM.
</P>
<P>
   Unless special measures are taken to enable a phone to use
several of these formats, a device designed to work with one
wireless technology cannot be used on a network that employs
another technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most creators of wireless Internet applications have compensated
for this technical Tower of Babel by agreeing to a format called
WAP _ for wireless access protocol _ which works with any of the
various cellular transmission formats. Any WAP-enabled cell phone,
used with any flavor of cellular network, can use the same WAP
application _ a wireless restaurant locator, for example, a
stock-quote system or some wireless Internet offering. (The iMode
technology used by NTT DoCoMo in Japan is not WAP compatible.)
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the disparate carrier standards are known as the
second-generation of wireless technology _ the first generation
having been the nondigital analog technology that the original
cellular industry rolled out in the 1980s. Over the next two to
five years, the global wireless industry expects to move to a
so-called second-and-a-half digital generation, followed by a third
generation. The differences can be arcane, but the coming
generations of formats are meant to allow for much higher data
speeds _ and to be compatible with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Whether WAP continues through these next generations, or is
replaced by a new format for programmers who write the application
software, the next generations of wireless technology should make
it easier to roam from one continent to another with a single
hand-held Internet access device. And the ability to send larger
amounts of data may make the wireless Internet an option for
businesses and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner than you think, we'll be able to do videoconferencing
with wireless access,'' said Anil Khatod, president of global
Internet solutions at Nortel Networks, the maker of network
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Nortel, companies like Ericsson, Motorola, Lucent and
Nokia are competing for tens of billions of dollars of contracts to
build new generations of wireless networks. Last year, the value of
wireless infrastructure contracts worldwide reached $28.7 billion,
a 22 percent increase from 1998, according to the Cahners In-Stat
Group, a research firm. Some of those companies, along with others
like Palm, Research in Motion and the Swatch Group, are developing
new types of devices for sending and getting wireless data and
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are coming up with things that will make your head spin,''
said Lawrence Rabiner, vice president for research at AT&AMP;T Labs.
One of AT&AMP;T's projects under development is a pair of
Internet-accessible ski goggles with a built-in wireless phone that
would allow skiers to hold conversations, transmit a video of their
downhill descent or pull down a course map projected onto a visor.
``It's James Bond, `Mission Impossible' stuff,'' Rabiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are big questions about how many new mobile
Internet services people really want, and how practical it will be
to provide or to use the most exotic applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the whole wireless Internet nirvana hype sells a lot
of papers,'' said Mark F. Bregman, who as head of pervasive
computing at IBM is working on third-generation and even
fourth-generation wireless technology. ``We need to realize that
the wireless Internet is not a panacea, that some things like doing
video on a cell phone would be impractical because video hogs so
much bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are concerns about the amount of available
radio-wave spectrum that can be used to transmit wireless data. And
some industry executives worry quietly about whether some consumers
might get turned off at this early, homely stage in the industry's
development.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such qualms, many new participants are entering the
wireless fray _ including Brad A. Silverberg, a former high-ranking
Microsoft executive who led the company's Windows business. In
March, Silverberg and former executives from McCaw Cellular formed
the Ignition Corp., an investment firm focused entirely on wireless
Internet ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge wager we're making, but my instinct tells me
the wireless Internet is the next tech tidal wave, like the PC and
the Internet itself,'' Silverberg said. ``Will we win the bet? If
you judge our chances by the number of people and amount of
resources committed to this thing, I'd say they are very good.''

 &HT;    What next for Netscape?
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ A tongue-in-cheek shrine commands a
second-story wall at Netscape Communications Corp.: collages of
cut-out photos, articles, cartoons and e-mail jokes ripping
Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the heart of the Netscape engineering department, where
software writers create the Navigator browser, the anti-tribute is
a motivational tool of sorts. The enemy's in sight, but he's
stripped of his imposing aura.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly subtle, the display symbolizes a future Netscape hopes is
imminent. All year, its engineers have quietly honed a new weapon
pointed right at Microsoft _ a Web browser created with visions of
humbling the software giant's dominant Internet Explorer program.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of computer software will be written for use
on the Web, making the Web browser battle between Netscape and
Microsoft the Internet world's equivalent of Windows vs. Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's upcoming offering, version 6.0, is designed to be a
sleeker, faster program that can run on a personal computer or a
smaller Internet-enabled device. A warm reception from consumers
and corporate partners alike could, in theory, turn the tide _ or
at least win an important skirmish _ in the long-running browser
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we think about the competitive landscape,'' said
Chris Nalls, product manager for Netscape 6.0. ``We're very much
heads-down, focusing on getting this product out because we think
it's compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   To stop the free fall, it needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, 80 percent of Web surfers used Netscape's
product, which was virtually alone in a hot market. But after
pricing problems and a reputation for unreliability, combined with
hot competition from Microsoft, Netscape is now flirting with rock
bottom. A bare 13.9 percent of global Web denizens used Netscape's
product as of June 18, according to research company WebSideStory.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, a whopping 86 percent slice of the populace surfs
with the Microsoft browser. Even Netscape's parent company, America
Online Inc., years ago chose Internet Explorer as its default
browser sothat the AOL software might come pre-installed on
computers running the omnipresent Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Microsoft, which declined to comment for this
story, is so far ahead that there's no longer much point in
challenging it.
</P>
<P>
   RISE AND FALL From its 1994 debut until about 1996, Netscape
dominated the Web-browser market and began charging $50 for
unchallenged software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft changed things when it launched the then-fresh Windows
95 operating system, which came with an early version of Internet
Explorer that symbolized the company's commitment to the Web. The
Redmond, Wash.,-based company pumped millions into its browser to
put it head-to-head with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998, the two companies leapfrogged each other in the race
to release better versions of their browsers _ and Netscape's
customer base dwindled. A University of Illinois study showed that
from early 1996 through mid-1998, Netscape's 70-percent share of
the market eroded to a 50-50 split with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Then Netscape dropped out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, poring through six years' worth of scripted code,
the company's software team threw up its hands and threw out the
Navigator program. Instead of retooling something tethered to a
legacy losing steam, Netscape decided to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The software writers spent 18 months creating a smoother, more
potent engine to power the redesigned software. They toiled under
an aluminum soda-can replica of the Golden Gate Bridge, suspended
with paper clips and spanning the office, and by the
orange-and-green neon lights peeking through a translucent
cylindrical ``Warp Core'' built of empty Aquafina bottles _ both
products of work-numbed minds seeking release.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape 6.0 is now available in a beta version, an early
preview that's still being tweaked and tested but which can be
downloaded via the Internet. The company promises two more betas
before the final product's scheduled release late this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullet you chew is the amount of time it takes to get the
product out, and it's never fast enough for anybody,'' Nalls said.
``But it was absolutely the right decision to take the hit,
redesign and have something glorious when we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, the timing may be optimal.
</P>
<P>
   The federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft centered around
competitive methods the U.S. government claims roughly elbowed
Netscape out of the market _ methods such as distributing Internet
Explorer for free with Windows and inking deals similar to the AOL
pact that once tied that Internet service to Explorer. Federal
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson dubbed Microsoft a monopoly and on
May 7 ordered that the company be split.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit unleashed a torrent of anti-Microsoft sentiment that
could translate into a resurgence for Netscape if its latest
version meets early hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Netscape could come back, that would be great,'' said Bobby
George, a lead software engineer at Question.com Inc. ``We use
I.E., because it's one of those tools that you just have to use,
but I still like to pull for Netscape because everyone hates
Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   FOSTERING INNOVATION
</P>
<P>
   In Netscape's opinion, the guts of its browser are its true
glory.
</P>
<P>
   The engine that powers it all, christened Gecko after a tiny and
spry breed of lizard, is small enough to run on Internet
appliances. Gecko has attracted attention from companies such as
Intel Corp., Gateway Inc. and mobile-phone maker Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving beyond the PC,'' Nalls said. ``We're seeing this
start now, with second and third Internet-access devices in the
home. These new platforms are very interesting to us.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the real buzz _ at least in Netscape's eyes _
is what version 6.0 means to software developers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Netscape is what's called an open-source program.
Developers can access its core code for free and use it to their
advantage, creating new looks and color schemes for the browser
itself or making a specially branded tab for the new ``My Sidebar''
window. Companies and consumer users alike can distribute those
designs to global users, with Netscape's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hate your guts and you could still make a tab for the
browser, or a new program for it,'' said John Nagle, who handles
marketing for Netscape 6.0. ``This is more open to innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said that availability could make it easier to win the
fight for dominance in the Internet-appliance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a developer wanted to build some kind of handheld pad or an
appliance, and needs to get to the market fast, that kind of
openness will be attractive,'' Smiley said. ``There's fierce
competition, but there's no winner, so Netscape could get some real
traction.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract a programmer writing Web-based software, browsers
must be compatible with an ever-expanding list of popular computer
languages, such as JavaScript and XML. Around 1996, some Web pages
could not load on Netscape's product because the browser did not
comprehend Java program code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quick to go with whatever has the best features,'' said
George of Question.com, which bases most of its programs on
Internet Explorer. ``Both products went back and forth through the
cycle of who's going to invent the best thing first, and Netscape
started falling behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape built the new program around newly established
industry-wide standards for designing Web pages _ a raft of
languages that can shorten the time it takes to download certain
pages and which allow for changes to a Web site that can be
processed without having to reload it from the server.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also making its browser more compatible with these
standards, established by the World Wide Web Consortium. Netscape
expects to be the first to meet those standards completely, but
Smiley said its sudden compatibility isn't dramatic enough to
outweigh Microsoft, which all along was quicker to embrace new
languages as they popped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's asking for that stuff any more,'' Smiley said. ``They
want stability, they want it to work and they want customer
service. That will be the test.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NAME GAME
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will notice that Netscape 6.0 bears the footprints of
its parent company, America Online, which bought the company in
late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail messenger on Netscape 6.0 is entwined with AOL's
popular Instant Messenger, denoting with a special icon any message
arriving from someone who's also logged onto the chat service.
Users with AOL accounts can also check that mail through Netscape's
inbox.
</P>
<P>
   But those new features match step-for-step the changes Microsoft
is making to its browser. Internet Explorer 5.5, due in September
as part of the Windows Millennium Edition, similarly marries the
Outlook Express e-mail with Microsoft's MSN real-time message
program and the company's free HotmMail e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And that package comes out before Netscape 6.0 _ thus, there's a
crafty marketing trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naming it '6.0' is fluff,'' Smiley said. ``They did it to put
the version number ahead of Microsoft. There never was or will be a
Netscape 5.''
</P>
<P>
   The most striking changes are cosmetic, like the new dark-blue
color scheme, different icons and a retractable ``My Sidebar''
feature that can stay on-screen as people surf, tracking stocks and
news and storing the most recent search results for quick access.
</P>
<P>
   The program is also a smaller file _ just 5.5 megabytes,
occupying half the space inhabited by earlier versions and less
than the 7.8 megabytes required for Internet Explorer, according to
analyst Smiley.
</P>
<P>
   But even that might not matter in the war on the consumer front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape was too late in its strategy,'' Smiley said. ``With
new high-speed Internet connections and faster computers, the
smaller file is a difference of just a few seconds, which is
meaningless.''

 &HT;    WEB MAKES BIG-TIME DEBUT AT POLITICAL CONVENTIONS
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1948, the television networks broke new ground
by broadcasting the national political conventions from
Philadelphia. People in five East Coast cities were able to watch
the live proceedings via a cable hookup at a time when there were
fewer than 400,000 TV set owners in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as the once huge influence of the TV networks on
political coverage wanes, the upcoming Republican and Democratic
national conventions are emerging as a battleground for the
increasingly robust political Internet culture.
</P>
<P>
   Around each meeting hall, pool cameras operated by C-SPAN will
beam images that can readily be accessed on tens of millions of
computers in every corner of the planet already linked to the
Internet. While most onlookers will lack a TV-quality picture, they
will be free to choose their own camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference between now and four years ago is video,''
said Chris Long, director of new media for C-SPAN, which will offer
pooled convention coverage for both the networks and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers in both convention cities have set aside ``Internet
Alleys'' for about 40 online news organizations, including such
political Web sites as Voter.com, America Online Inc.,
Pseudopolitics.com and Slate, a political journal owned by
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these video-equipped sites will also offer tailored
coverage of what onetime Watergate author Carl Bernstein, now
executive editor of Voter.com, calls ``the shadow convention _ all
the stuff that goes on whenever tens of thousands of political
activists, lobbyists and journalists get together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach will be to stay off the podium to give people the
sound and the feel of what's going on behind the scenes,''
Bernstein said. ``In looking at our potential audience, it will be,
above all else, the 40,000 people who have come to Philadelphia or
Los Angeles as players so they can see what everybody else is up
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Voter.com, a for-profit outlet that also aggregates
coverage from other political sites, will issue ``smart cards'' to
delegates and their associates. The cards can be used to gain
access to Web consoles that will tell them where late evening
parties are taking place _ with links to online maps that show them
how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The Web has even edged its way into those once haughty symbols
of convention coverage: roof-hugging skyboxes. This year, for the
first time, the five veteran networks and their four all-news
commercial cable rivals have new dot-com neighbors ensconced in
customized booths high above the convention floors. Voter.com,
Pseudopolitics.com, AOL and USAToday.com, among others, have
booths.
</P>
<P>
   While the major networks have steadily cut back on their
coverage, the conventions will still each attract upwards of 15,000
traditional media personnel from some 1,500 news outlets. They
include 440 newspapers, 330 television stations, 220 radio stations
and 190 magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the major Internet outlets that have joined them in
depth on the 2000 political scene will seek to create a ``brand''
presence for future years, much as the networks once jockeyed at
these quadrennial affairs to forge a dominant position among
viewers for their overall news programming.
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling broadcast Internet sites will share facilities with
their venerable network relatives. In many cases, they will be
double-teaming coverage, offering viewers their choice of watching
either TV sets or computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Some network reporters will roam the convention floor with
compact digital video cameras. When a story or a hot interview pops
up, it will be uploaded at once to a cooperating Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which lacks a direct cable affilianvention.com) and its
Democratic counterpart in Los Angeles (dems2000.com) have both been
designed as abundant multimedia digital products with lots of
interactive features as well as video and audio clips from the
presidential candidates and other party stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have used their Web site to give ``netizens'' a chance
to help craft the party platform, while Republicans are pushing
what they call a chance to become a ``virtual dot-com delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   During the four-day conclave, GOP registrants are promised
exclusive access to chat rooms with ``key convention
participants,'' tailored news from their state delegations, and
reports on the areas of interest that they had chosen in entering
their ``basic contact information.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson:
``Innovations like these will establish a new standard for all
future conventio

 &HT;    Digital cameras, recordable CDs great for storing memories
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes, to listen to me talk, you'd think that I
didn't like technology at all. A lot of times I end up complaining
about how it has messed with my life in bad ways.
</P>
<P>
   And it's partly true. Cellular phones bug me, junk e-mail drives
me crazy, Internet chat rooms seem like bad parties full of
dull-witted people, the debate between Mac owners and PC folk bores
me, and I will be able to live the rest of my life happily without
receiving another e-mailed joke.
</P>
<P>
   But since I write about technology, there are some things you
need to understand. I do love technology, have loved it since I was
a kid messing with ham radios, sending frog astronauts into near
space _ and usually an early grave _ with homemade rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is great. It's just that it's somehow become a
religion instead of a tool.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some great tools out there, and today I'll tell
you about some of the ones that do impress me and are useful in my
life.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with digital cameras. I started thinking about the
trend toward these filmless cameras last night while _ in a fit of
nostalgia _ looking through some old photographs taken when I was a
kid. Looking at those photographs you'd have thought that I come
from a long line of pastel-colored people.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a lot of good reasons to get a digital camera,
including how easy it makes it to send a photograph by e-mail to
relatives and friends. And those are good reasons. But _ if you are
the kind of person who wants future generations of your family to
see how you really look _ digital cameras have another advantage.
Unlike photographic prints, where the the chemistry that creates
the images are doomed to eventually blotch and fade into
nothingness, a digital photograph should look the same 100 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings me to the second gadget that seems to have a
real future: the recordable CD. If you have a lot of photographs,
you can transfer them to the CD and store it away. Unlike magnetic
recording devices, if stored properly, it should last for a century
or two. (And if your great-great-grandchildren wish, they can copy
it a hundred years from now. Unlike duplicating a videotape, the
copy will be identical to the original with no loss of quality.)
</P>
<P>
   The mass storage available on a CD and its semipermanence make
it a great place to store other family memories including texts
about the family tree, precious letters and other information that
you'd like to keep around. Just one quick tip: Make two copies.
Keep one at home and store another one in a safe deposit box or
with a friend. That way if your home is ever struck by fire or some
other disaster, you won't lose the memories.
</P>
<P>
   The third technological marvel that I recommend to you is a UPS,
an uninterrupted power supply. Years ago, when I started writing
about computers, the UPS was something reserved for businesses and
government. It was too expensive for home users. But nowadays, you
can buy one for $100 or so, and it's worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   A UPS is basically a large battery connected to circuitry that
converts the battery power into current that your PC can use. When
the power goes out at your house _ and, at my house at least, that
happens at least six or seven times a year _ the UPS automatically
kicks in to supply an uninterrupted source of power. That means
you'll have time to shut down your computer normally and save your
work. And since a UPS also provides excellent protection against
power surges and dips, your PC should work better with fewer screen
freezes and also last longer. The power dips and surges gradually
do damage to your machine.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of useless and expensive software and hardware
out there. But I don't know a soul _ truly _ who regrets owning any
of the devices I've mentioned today.

&HT;     SEARCHERS COME UP EMPTY IN HUNT FOR MISSING ATHEIST

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ For the third time since April 1999, federal
agents searched a remote Texas Hill Country site for the remains of
vanished atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair and two of her children. And
for the third time, they came up empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They completed their search around noon today and did not find
the remains of the O'Hairs,'' said FBI spokesman Darren Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were acting on newly acquired information, looking at the
same campground but in a different area than we did on previous
trips,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said the latest search began around 8 a.m. Tuesday and
involved about 15 people from state and federal agencies and four
cadaver dogs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, her son Jon Garth Murray and daughter Robin Murray
O'Hair vanished from San Antonio in late 1995 along with $500,000
in gold coins.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities believe they were kidnapped and murdered for
the coins, and later were dismembered and possibly buried at the
site near Camp Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Karr, 52, was convicted last month of four federal counts
relating to the O'Hair disappearance. Last year, Karr gave police a
map of the site purporting to show where the bodies were buried.
David Waters, another suspect, has not been charged in the case but
is serving two long prison sentences for other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Two earlier searches at the Real County ranch, one involving
nearly 100 agents backed by cadaver dogs and sophisticated
detection equipment, also were futile.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what new information the FBI might have.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's lawyer, Thomas Mills, said he was surprised by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come from us. My client has had no communication
with
</P>
<P>
   them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karr is to be sentenced Aug. 4 in Austin and faces a mandatory
life sentence.

NET AUCTION BRINGING TOP PAY, PERKS TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DIANE E. LEWIS   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a employment agency denied her request for more flexible
hours, Lisa Williams sought a marketing job on an Internet site
that offered to auction her skills to the highest bidder. Days
later, the 33-year-old Web marketing professional walked away with
a $35-an-hour contracting job, $10 an hour more than she had been
making. And she was able to telecommute.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was with the agency, a lot of the companies were
insisting that I work 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., but I wasn't making as much
and I had a long commute,'' said Williams, of Hood River, Ore. ``I
was a divorced mother of three who was just starting out (in the
labor market) and didn't have the networks to find my own jobs. The
auction put me in contact with employers I would have never met.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' annual earnings have increased, too, from $30,000
three years ago to about $100,000 including overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after 16 Internet engineers tried to auction their
services on eBay for $3.14 million, the concept has been
transformed from an online spoof by a bunch of geeks to real-live
marketplaces for independent contractors seeking to sell their
skills for the right pay or perks.
</P>
<P>
   Internet talent or skills auctions have entered the market with
a flourish, vying with job sites, Internet resume sites,
traditional advertisers, and brick-and-mortar recruiters for
freelancers. Some of the most recent players in what is fast
becoming a saturated field: eLancer.com; Monster.com; Advoco.com;
Bid4Geeks.com, an auction site for technical professionals; and
HotDispatch.com, for finding techies here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 30 percent of the nation's 130 million work force are
nonstandard workers, a category that includes temporary workers,
on-call workers, day laborers, independent contractors, leased
workers, and the self-employed _ in short, all individuals who do
not have a regular, ongoing tie to an employer. Of those, 6.4
percent are independent contractors, according to economist Edie
Rasell of the Economic Policy Institute, a policy research
organization in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rasell says there has been a fourfold increase in temporary help
agency workers since 1982. And, although government statistics do
not go back far enough to fully trace the trend, she believes the
number of other nonstandard workers has increased, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the number of temporary help agencies
increased to 1,405 in 1998 from 431 in 1980. At the same time, the
number of people employed by these companies rose to 71,365 from
25,473, according to a report by the Campaign on Contingent Work, a
coalition of unions and community groups.
</P>
<P>
   For employers, the growth in the nation's nonstandard work force
has been a boon, assuring companies of a readily available pool of
flexible employees who can work on demand. For employees, however,
the trend is a double-edged sword: While high-tech and computer
professionals often command top salaries and perks, other
freelancers must scramble for work in a market where the next
paycheck is hardly guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Monster.com and other companies hoping to capitalize on
the rising friction between freelancers and the middlemen who
market their services, by creating sites that permit the freelancer
to set his own terms. They envision a day when nonstandard workers
of all kinds will control how and where they work by simply logging
on to a computer and tapping yes, or no, to an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com's TalentMarket auction works like this: Freelancers
submit profiles as well as pay and other requirements. They specify
the duration of the job they are seeking. Employers, meanwhile, can
list projects for which contractors are needed. If the employer
hires a freelancer after placing a bid, the employer pays a fee to
Monster.com. The fee is determined by the size of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, people do not need an intermediary anymore,'' said
Linda Natansohn, senior vice president of ventures at Maynard,
Mass.-based Monster.com. ``If free agents can negotiate directly
with employers, more will go directly into their pockets than if
they go to a staffing firm that marks up wages 30 percent and then
keeps a good portion of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marion McGovern, president of MSquared, a California-based
executive recruiting firm, bridled at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   She maintains that agencies specializing in brokering the
talents of corporate executives and highly sought-after technical
professionals tend to work with employers less likely to take a
chance on an auction, where the talent they get might not be the
talent they want or actually need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for the cream of the crop. We do a verification
process. People who are looking for true value still want expert
appraisers who can sell that Renoir for them,'' said McGovern, who
likened the executive recruiters' screening process to a critical
appraisal at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we use the online world to come up with consultants
for clients,'' she acknowledged, ``but it certainly is not the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after launching Web magazine Gate39 in September
1999, publisher Shane Stiles of Chicago turned to an auction site
called eLancer.com for freelance writers who were knowledgeable
about Japanese customs and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the conditions of my bid was that the writer could
write about Japan,'' said Stiles, who hired three writers last
year. ``Last month, I chose five writers out of a pool of 15. I put
in an initial bid of $25 for each short article, plus any banner
ads they wanted to put on the site. That allows them to advertise
themselves.'' He concedes the pay was quite low, but ``through our
Web site, people have been able to funnel traffic to their own
personal Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the hoopla about talent auctions, observers say
there have been fewer placements than originally anticipated.
Visits to 30 randomly selected auction sites last week supported
that. On each site, free agent computer professionals and
architectural engineers had specified bid pay rates ranging from
$30 per hour to $60 per hour over the last few weeks. In each case,
no offers had been made by employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an auction, you could ask for $1,000 per day, but you
really have to go with whatever people are willing to bid on you,''
said Wayne Cooper, president of New Hampshire-based Kennedy
Information, publisher of the Recruiting Trends newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auctions started with a lot of fanfare last year, but
there are not a whole lot of placements,'' he said. ``If you go to
these services you will find that a high percentage of the job
listings are actually coming from brick-and-mortar recruiting
companies. So the Web is also making it easier for some of the
middlemen by automating the matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, workplace experts say the trend could bode well
for independent contractors and the self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably a small step in the right direction for these
people,'' said Louis Maltby, president of the National Work Rights
Institute in Princeton, N.J. ``When you can get offers from several
employers, you have bargaining leverage. And that means more
negotiating room.''
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Nishioka can attest to that. Nishioka, 24, of Baltimore,
does niche and target marketing for Web sites and then tracks the
results of the ads she places.
</P>
<P>
   Nishioka, who identified herself on Monster.com's TalentMarket
as ``Mimi the Advertising Queen,'' says she landed a contract job
as director of marketing for picSmart in Washington, D.C., after
posting her profile. She also has a full-time job at an advertising
agency in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I received bids, but I haven't had any
more,'' she said. ``I think it's gotten really saturated. When
Monster first launched, there was a curiosity factor that caused
interest to go up. Now there are five or six other services that do
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com says it has more than 200,000 ``free agents''
registered with the site. They range from IT professionals and
engineers to creative artists and salespeople. Most are new to
freelancing, but some have been consulting for years.
</P>
<P>
   Since she began using a talent auction a year ago, Williams, the
Web marketer from Oregon, has accepted five bids, including one
that led to a six-month job with a Utah company whose
representatives never met her in person.
</P>
<P>
   Williams landed her latest position in March after a
Boston-based human resources manager for Avery Dennison spotted her
profile on Monster.com's TalentMarket auction. Her contract with
Avery Dennison has since been extended to April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started thinking about doing my own thing, I called an
agency and told them my requirements,'' recalled Williams. ``It
said, `Your requirements are not our concern. Our concern is with
the employer and no employer is going to want to give you the
flexibility you want.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency was wrong. After posting my profile, I had calls
from some pretty big firms, and they were completely open to
telecommuting and flexible hours.''

<P>
   And she's in on the wave of the future, online counseling, which
is already causing controversy within the mental health community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I always wished I'd been a pioneer,'' says
Gifford, who is busy these days turning her Phoenix-based Web site,
www.find-a-therapist.com, into a full-service online counseling
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like (beginitalic)Star Trek(enditalic). I love being
`out there.'''
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy is indeed out there to its critics, whose concerns
center on three areas:
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity. It's easier for clients and counselors to
misrepresent themselves online. And visual cues, often vital, are
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy. How can clients be sure that their words aren't going
out to all of cyberspace?
</P>
<P>
   Legality. It's generally agreed that online counselors should be
held responsible for following the guidelines of the state in which
they're licensed to practice. But the Internet knows no
geographical borders, making codes of conduct difficult to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no training or research in Internet therapy, and
there's no definition of what it is,'' psychology ethics expert
Thomas Nagy told the online companion of
(beginitalic)Wired(enditalic) magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But to Gifford and other proponents, much of the skepticism is a
natural fear of the unknown. They say that the benefits of
accessible, affordable care far outweigh the risks. Besides, it's a
wired world, and technology is becoming less intimidating all the
time, particularly to a generation that has grown up with it.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Harris poll, more than 60 million people searched
for health information online last year, and 40percent of those
were looking for information about mental health. Some experts
predict that more than one-fourth of all counseling will be
conducted online within five years.
</P>
<P>
   However, a recent survey by Putnam Investments indicates that
Americans are more than seven times as likely to use the Internet
as a referral for advice than as the actual source of advice. So,
the office visit is far from passi.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe counselor Barbara Albrecht sees advantages in online's
convenience but remains skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can sabotage the authentic experience of face-to-face
interaction (between counselor and client),'' she says. ``A
therapist can't assess body language or physical demeanor and is at
a disadvantage. Clients can hide in their defenses too easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, e-therapy is being put to use, and quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's here, and it's not going to go away,'' says Marian
Dunaway, Gifford's clinical director, who has been recruiting,
screening and interviewing counselors from all over the country for
e-mail, real-time chat and telephone counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Find-a-Therapist is a small-business success story that sprang
from Gifford's traditional practice, FindingStone Counseling Center
which has offices in central Phoenix. The Web site began two years
ago as a counseling directory and referral service and is now the
largest of its kind, with a database of more than 6,000 therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford admits being a former cyberphobe. Terrified of being
left behind by technology, she bought a computer from a friend for
$300 and began to play around with it. When she saw that ``the
whole world could see what I put up,'' she kept refining her own
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford acknowledges that online counseling has limitations, but
she says it shouldn't be invalidated on that basis. She's working
to ensure clients' privacy and to secure the services of first-rate
counselors.
</P>
<P>
   With online, her reputation is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another service delivery model,'' she says. ``The
question is: How do we use this technology and make it the best it
can be, in an ethical, clinical and professionally sound way?''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the whole world may be logging on for the answer.

 &HT;    AOL, STRUGGLING ABROAD, LAUNCHES SERVICE IN MEXICO
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America Online Inc. began offering Internet access
service in Mexico ON Tuesday, hoping to boost its lagging
subscriber base in Latin America while expanding its ranks of
Spanish-speaking U.S. customers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said AOL needs a ``win'' in Mexico to show investors it
can get people in poorer countries to pay monthly fees for online
services, even as other companies offer free Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``All eyes are on them,'' said Will Landers, director of Latin
American technology research for Credit Suisse First Boston.
Analysts question whether AOL can succeed south of the U.S. border
because the company is ``very much tied to the subscription model.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Vienna, Va.-based online giant launched AOL
Brazil. But ``the rollout in Brazil was slower than what the market
expected,'' Landers said. Today, AOL is still running a distant
fourth among Internet providers in the Portuguese-speaking country,
in part because many Brazilians are getting free Internet access
from companies that rely solely on advertising for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Mexico plans to offer a 90-day free trial period, compared
with one free month in the United States. Mexican customers getting
unlimited access will be billed in pesos and will pay about $22 a
month, the same rate as U.S. customers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the price, some analysts believe AOL's emphasis on
``home grown'' content and child-friendly monitoring services may
attract paying customers. ``They're aiming at Mexican families,''
said Gabriel Moreno, a high-tech industry analyst for the
International Data Corp. research firm in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Because AOL offers subscribers seven user names under one
account, it opens up access to a whole family. ``Everyone can have
their own log-in and password, so parents can't read their
children's e-mail,'' Moreno said. ``But they can control what their
children look at.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the world's largest online service, with more than 23
million subscribers. But while the company has been phenomenally
successful in the United States, only a fraction of subscribers
lives abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After years of branching out into Europe, Asia and Latin
America, AOL is still seeing mixed results. In some European
countries, AOL dominates as an Internet access provider. But it has
done poorly in Japan, Australia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is the poorest country where AOL has offered service.
Despite a population of roughly 100 million, only about 1.5 million
Mexicans have Internet accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Latin America is the fastest-growing Internet market in
the world. Analysts estimate that region's the number of users will
shoot from 8.5 million today to 29.4 million by 2003, according to
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish-language content of AOL Mexico will be available at
no increased cost to U.S.-based AOL subscribers, which means
Mexican-born residents in this country will have access to content
produced by 70 AOL staffers in Mexico City, spokeswoman Tricia
Primrose said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the number of Spanish-speaking people in the United
States, this will be an exciting development here, too,'' Primrose
said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Mexico will be operated as part of a joint venture with the
Cisneros Group, a Venezuelan media company that produces popular
soap operas and owns Univision, the largest Spanish-language
television network in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Mexico's competitors include Telefonos de Mexico (TelMex),
Spain's Terra Networks SA and Starmedia Network Inc.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Remember ``Walkie Talkies,'' those flimsy kids' toys that banged
around the backyard or weighed down the belts of park rangers and
security guards? Well they're back, slimmed down and tricked out
for the go-anywhere, do-anything age. Motorola's palm-sized,
lightweight TalkAbout Two-Way Radio ($160; www.motorola.com) with a
NiMH rechargeable battery, offers a solid two-mile communication
range that works in or outdoors. The radio is ideal for trade show
teams scouring the show floors, family members on camping trips,
even for the college convoy on that road trip to the annual kegger
off the beaten path. Utilizing the 14 channels of FRS (Family Radio
Service) _ as opposed to the inconsistent CB (Citizen's Band) _
these units offer high-powered, short-range communication of
professional caliber. With 38 subchannels per channel on which to
stake a claim, the airwaves promise to be traffic-free somewhere
within the allotted range. Best of all, the TalkAbout is inherently
compatible with any FRS radio, meaning it's easy to augment
Motorola's high-end units with less expensive models from any
brand.
</P>
<P>
   A LOGICAL CASE FOR A CD PLAYER AND ACCESSORIES
</P>
<P>
   A combination of elastic strapping, Velcro, a zipper, a clip and
wee bit of nylon makes Case Logic's CD Player TranSport ($10;
www.casedirect.com) the epitome of less-is-more functionality. This
innovative portable CD companion piece allows one's diminutive disc
spinner to assertively attach to a bicycle, backpack, belt,
treadmill or what have you while still allowing easy access to the
player's buttons. There's even an accessory pocket for spare
batteries, locker key, photos and the like.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   We've written a lot about Tony Hawk Pro Skater with good reason
_ it took the world by storm in 1999 as the best skateboard game
ever. Previously available on the Sony PlayStation and the Nintendo
64, the super thrasher has come to Sega with a Dreamcast version
($50; www. dreamcast.com; for the Dreamcast). It might very well be
the best all-around video game, ever. Extending an elemental law of
physics to include ``what goes up must pull off a Varial before it
comes down,'' Tony Hawk Pro Skater brings all the superlative
joyousness and raunchy implied pain of real life skating to video
game land with a large arsenal of tricks and stunts as well as
vivid skull smacks and magnificent blood spurts should one crash
and bail aggressively. Super console graphics and sound heighten
what was already -- cringingly painful looking game on the
PlayStation and a fluffy, bloodless extravaganza on the
family-friendly N64. This is by far the best version yet.
</P>
<P>
   While it's extremely rare to see an original video game concept
in an industry more famous for its peel, steal and market-like-hell
m.o., unique games have been known to pop up now and again. Sega's
Space Channel 5 ($40; www.sega.com; for the Dreamcast) is one such
game, but that's where the righteousness ends. ``Space'' is a
bizarre, damn-near-creepy disco dancing game featuring scantily
clad nymphs and groovy dudes hypnotizing and defeating foes by
mimicking perky, alluring dance steps to the beat of retro-techno
funk. It's got all the charm of the lingerie section of your mom's
Sears catalogue and a Dr. Rhythm drum machine. Rife with clunky
gameplay reminiscent of the electronic toy version of ``Simon,''
this title targets a ``broader'' demographic; actual video game
buffs need not bother. Kudos for trying, though. The next Sears
Catalogue is due out this fall.
</P>
<P>
   If you've played Gauntlet Legends at the arcade, you know how
addictive the game can be. With multiple players going on a hack
and slash quest (here's a wizard, an archer and a barbarian,
slicing through orcs and looking for treasure chests), it was
quarter-plunking video game nirvana. After a blurry two-player-only
PlayStation version and a blotchy-looking translation for Nintendo
64, it took the hardware muscle of the Sega Dreamcast to unleash
the definitive home version. Gauntlet Legends for Dreamcast ($40;
www.midway.com; for the Dreamcast) is pixel-perfect, gorgeous,
fast, and fun. The game is as sharp as the arcade, with four-player
mode, 41 levels and characters taken from the new ``Gauntlet Dark
Legacy'' arcade game. It's one of the most fun cooperative games
out. You can also get free pewter figures in the mail from Midway
after buying the game. So the only question is, if you don't
already have a Dreamcast to enjoy the raft of great games available
for the system (I loved Space Channel 5, by the way), what's
stopping you? The Playstation 2? Happy waiting.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   When you join the thick of battle in Shogun: Total War ($40;
www.totalwar.com; for Windows), it's hard to keep phrases like
''instant classic'' and ''sets a new standard'' from the back of
your mind. This simulation of 15th-century feudal Japanese warfare
has captured the Grail of PC gaming with its immersive 3-D
horizon-to-horizon battles, lovingly detailed from the glint of
sunlight on distant spears to the horror of watching your
1,000-samurai army break and run. Amid these riches, any complaints
_ the skimpy mapless manual comes to mind _ are mere quibbles. For
thinkers who savor strategy, an engaging but optional turn-based,
''Risk''-style campaign game with cinematics provides
empire-building intrigue and context. But the real rush is on the
battlefield. Blizzards howl, lightning strikes and the crackle of
muskets produces a line of drifting smoke amid the gabble and
clatter of pitched fighting. An eight-multiplayer option rounds out
this little masterpiece. Shogun: Total War is a detailed, endlessly
replayable, smooth-running depiction of the earnest struggle for
control of an empire. We've been waiting for this great game all
along and just didn't know it.

 &HT;    Shop for tech support, not gigabytes and megahertz
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When you purchased your last microwave oven, did you
spend much time checking out who made the microwave transmitter? Or
did you make note of the cooking wattage? Did you spend some time
reading ``Microwave Ovens Made Simple''?
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that _ unafraid and untutored by any adult education
classes in the operation of microwaves _ you went down to the store
and simply picked out a microwave that was in your price range and
that looked big enough for your purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you haven't noticed _ you're not alone if you haven't,
because I don't hear many people talking about this yet _ but
personal computers are finally reaching the microwave oven stage in
the market cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, unless you are buying a PC to play games or to perform some
really complex and specialized task, the truth is that it doesn't
much matter what kind of computer you buy. I spent a few minutes
looking through the ads in Sunday's newspaper, and even the bargain
basement machines are much more powerful than my home PC.
</P>
<P>
   I have an old 350-megahertz Pentium II machine. And the slowest
machines I found in the ads were running at 500 megahertz. But the
truth is that _ unlike things were even a year ago _ there is no
real urgency for me to upgrade my PC.
</P>
<P>
   If you've read this column for a long time you may remember
Husted's First Law of Computer Purchasing: Replace your computer
when it can no longer perform your tasks in a reasonably efficient
manner. Despite the fact that I'm practically a computer genius
(just ask my mom), the tasks at my house are pretty simple. I do
word processing, figure my taxes, mess with the Internet and use
the computer to edit and store electronic photographs. And even the
old 350-megahertz PC breezes through those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be surprising. Home PCs are now much more
powerful than the big mainframe computers that businesses used 10
years ago, enormously faster than the computers that were aboard
the Apollo spacecraft that landed on the moon. And, despite the
fact that software programs seem to get fatter and more heavily
laden with mostly useless features each year, most of the programs
that I use still do not strain my dinosaur of a PC.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's what that means to you. If you are an ordinary home
user in the market for a PC, you no longer need to worry about
whether you can pop for the very fastest machine. And frankly you
needn't worry too much about whether the PC you buy has an AMD
Athelon chip or one made by Intel. Both chips are well-proven and
(as computer hardware goes) trouble-free.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays you need a new mind-set for PC buying. Instead of
agonizing over the specs (pondering the merits of a 15-gigabyte
hard disk compared to those of a 21-gigabyte disk, worrying whether
16 megabytes of VRAM is enough for a video card or whether you'd be
happier with 32 megabytes), shift your worries to ones that will be
familiar to most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the type of customer service and technical
support you can expect after the purchase. The rule of thumb is
that big brand-name manufacturers will do the best job. It's simply
a matter of God being on the side of the big battalions. Big
companies can afford to man a tech support line 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. Some of the smaller companies cannot. Be
especially wary of companies that offer support by e-mail and Web
site only.
</P>
<P>
   Find out what the repair policies are. Will you get on-site
repair service? Do you take the PC to a local store or repair
center? Is the PC shipped off to some distant repair center? Or
will you be shipped replacement parts and be expected to replace
them yourself? There are no wrong answers. A lot depends on what
feels comfortable to you. But find out in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Finally pay attention to the offer itself. Some machines are
bundled with useless software, free Internet service or accessories
that you already have in an effort to justify a higher price. Often
you'll do better just selecting the PC you want and then buying the
accessories you actually need.

Don't be afraid to buy online; take precautions _ and never use a
debit card 
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For some people, shopping online is akin to handing
their credit card to a shifty-looking stranger and inviting him to
have at it.
</P>
<P>
   It's scary, stupid and they're just not going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   While experts say you should take precautions when delving into
the wonderful world of e-commerce, they also agree it's often no
more risky than buying something the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are all concerned about Internet security think
nothing about giving their credit card to a waiter who disappears
with it into the back room for 10 minutes,'' says computer author
Mark Minasi, whose most recent book is ``The Software Conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The old advice that we got from our grandfathers _ don't use
credit cards, period _ doesn't really apply in this day and age,''
says Rob Clyde, vice president of security management for Axent
Technologies, a Rockville, Md.-based information security firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use a true credit card number, not a debit card number,
you're already pretty protected by Visa or MasterCard or American
Express, so your liability is $50 maximum. That already leaves you
at a starting point where you don't have to be all that worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean don't worry at all. There are some important
measures you should take before keying in that long list of numbers
and expiration date.
</P>
<P>
   First, be sure to use a credit card, not a debit card, when
shopping online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debit cards are much more risky than are conventional credit
cards. You should never, ever use a debit card on the Web,''
cautions George Hellyer, senior consultant for Janus Associates, a
Stamford, Conn.-based firm that specializes in information
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone gets your debit card number, they can drain all
your bank accounts. With a credit card, you're protected after the
first $50 of fraudulent use. You are not guaranteed that protection
if you use your debit card. All your savings can be wiped out. It's
a very frightening thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, credit card in hand, be sure you shop only on secure
connections. That's where sites use encryption, which basically
scrambles the information as it goes careening around the Internet.
In order to confirm the site is safe, look for that little padlock
on the bottom of your browser. If it's locked, the site is secure.
If it's open, all bets are off. You can also configure your browser
to offer a prompt that alerts you to the fact that you are entering
a secure connection.
</P>
<P>
   Advises Minasi: ``If the lock's not there, don't send the credit
card, period. That's just too easy to steal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are various levels of encryption a site can offer _
usually ranging from 56 bits to 128 bits. The higher the number,
the better. But don't lose sleep over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically what you want to see is over 96 or 128 bits,'' says
Clyde. ``But if it's a legitimate company, 56 is OK. It's important
to put the risk in the proper context. If it's a company you'd do
business with over the phone, it's probably safe to do business
over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're concerned, you can update your browser to a higher
level of encryption. But even if you're using 128, a site could
still be encrypting at 56, says Minasi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this mean you should worry? At 56, the chance would still
be one in one with about 19 zeroes after it,'' he says, laughing.
``I don't know of any significant credit card fraud on the Internet
involving people punching in credit cards on secure sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's not always easy to find out at what level a
company is encrypting. Sometimes it's in the privacy statement.
Often, you have to send an e-mail asking at what level the company
encrypts.
</P>
<P>
   Still worried? You can configure your browser to accept only
sites with 128-bit encryption, so lower-level sites won't even be
accessible. That'll show 'em!
</P>
<P>
   Besides the secure connection, there are other things to
consider before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't rely on a professional-looking Web site as proof
that it's a reliable company,'' warns Holly Cherico, spokeswoman
for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the umbrella
organization for the nation's 132 Better Business Bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the skill, you can make a very sophisticated Web
site look like it's backed by a Fortune 500 company.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's a well-known site _ like amazon.com _ or a company with
a reputable physical presence _ like Sears _ your worries should be
few.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, know who you are buying from,'' advises Hellyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's someplace you've never heard of, try to find more
information. Do a search to see what you can find. Ask for
references. If someone is going to install windows for you or
aluminum siding, you ask for references, so it's the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, be sure there's a way to contact the company offline with
a listed phone number or address. If the only way you can reach the
company is via e-mail and the company disappears, you have no other
way of trying to track it down.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've trusted a site with your credit card data, question
what they are going to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies store credit card information, which
troubles me,'' admits Minasi. ``AOL keeps your credit card number
on file even if you get rid of the service. There are only 5
million people who work for that company. I'm sure no one would
think about stealing that information!''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies give you the option to let them keep your credit
card info to save the hassle next time you shop. You'll get a
prompt along the lines of, ``Would you like us to remember this
credit card so you don't have to enter it again later?'' Then the
choice is yours.
</P>
<P>
   LOOK AT PRIVACY STATEMENT
</P>
<P>
   To find if the company stores your credit card information,
check the privacy statement. If there is no privacy statement, just
flat-out don't do business with the company, Minasi says. If they
store the information without giving you a choice, take action, he
advises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Send them a politely worded e-mail saying, `Give me the choice
like other vendors do,' '' he says. ``Don't just walk away. Tell
them it's an inappropriate lack of protection of your privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you trust the company name and are using a secure
connection, limit the information you are willing to provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never provide your Social Security number or date of birth
over the Internet,'' says Hellyer. ``If they have your name, your
date of birth and your Social Security number, they can counterfeit
your identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the best of intentions, a company just has no business
having that information, says Shirley Rooker, president of Call For
Action, a nonprofit consumer helpline based in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're doing a transaction online, that company has no
right to ask you for your Social Security number, your mother's
maiden name, any information like that,'' she says. ``If they're
asking you all that information, they're collecting it for some
reason, and you just shouldn't give it. That's a sure sign you
should go someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, click on the privacy statement for more information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the company post a privacy policy about how it's going to
use the information it collects about you?'' questions Rooker.
``Are they going to share it with a third party and, if so, how do
you feel about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when you type in information on a Web site _ most
often a password _ asterisks pop up on your screen instead of the
letters or numbers you are typing. Don't be lulled into believing
this is encryption. The company is merely protecting your privacy
from someone who may be looking at your screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That only protects you from people peeking over your shoulder
while you're typing,'' says Minasi. ``It doesn't save you from
people on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   REPORTING FRAUD ON THE NET
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Consumers League reported a 38 percent
increase in the number of e-complaints, with more than 10,000
reported. Here's where you can go if you think you've been had:
</P>
<P>
   Better Business Bureau, www.bbb.org _ In addition to awarding
more than 5,000 sites the BBB Reliability Seal online, the consumer
organization has bestowed its Privacy Seal on more than 50 sites.
You can search those vendors and also report e-commerce problems
online at the BBB's site.
</P>
<P>
   Call For Action, www.callforaction.org _ This nonprofit consumer
advocacy group allows you to report problems and helps you solve
them. You can also call locally 678-422-8466.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Fraud Complaint Center, www.ifccfbi.gov/ _ This is
a partnership between the FBI and the National White Collar Crime
Center through which consumers can report suspected cases of
e-fraud.

 &HT;    Here comes the bride... she's wired
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Meet Peter and Melanie. They are getting married Sept.
6, and you're invited.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, anybody who watches NBC's ``Today'' show is invited.
In fact, anybody with Internet access can log onto the ``Today''
Web site (www.today.msnbc.com) and decide exactly what kind of
wedding Peter and Melanie will have.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ginsberg, Melanie Nelson and millions of amateur wedding
planners around the world are part of a special segment called
``Today ties The Knot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zucker, executive producer of ``Today,'' said allowing
millions of viewers to have a part in the planning of a real
couple's wedding via the Web, then to see it happen right there at
Rockefeller Plaza in New York, would be a groundbreaking event. He
said the combination of the Web and TV can add an entirely new
dimension to the way people plan weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Peter and Melanie's interactive wedding adventure is an amazing
combination of old and new media. ``Today'' show viewers seem to be
an incredibly wired bunch who cast 130,000 votes to decide where
co-anchor Matt Lauer should go on the last stop of his
round-the-world stunt last May.
</P>
<P>
   Even more voters than that have been coming to the ``Today'' Web
site to help plan the couple's wedding. It's bad enough having
everyone from Mom to Aunt Gladys right down to the woman at the
Starbucks counter offering wedding advice. Think about Peter and
Melanie, who have a couple of hundred thousand people they don't
know deciding whether Melanie should go with the Carolina Herrera
or Paloma Blanca wedding gown.
</P>
<P>
   At least they don't have to invite them to the reception.
</P>
<P>
   Back on June 20, ``Today'' and wedding Web site TheKnot.com
(www.theknot.com) formed a 12-week partnership to choose a couple
and help them plan their wedding on live TV, along with the wedding
experts at TheKnot. Each week, viewers can tune in to watch Peter
and Melanie get tips on planning their wedding and then vote on
what one of the most significant days in their lives will be like.
</P>
<P>
   On the July 5 show, the giggling, hand-holding couple were shown
the wedding rings as selected by viewers, who cast more than
100,000 votes on the morning show's Web site. Next came the
opportunity to vote for a wedding gown and tuxedo. Peter seemed
concerned that no cummerbunds were involved, but Carley Roney,
editor-in-chief of TheKnot.com, assured Peter that he'd be hip
enough for his own wedding and possibly even the Oscars in whatever
tux viewers chose for him.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the couple has agreed to go along with voters'
choices without a word of complaint. Clearly this is every
mother-of-the-bride's dream. And a lot of these mothers, even moms
who don't use the Web, are getting vicarious thrills by asking
wired friends to vote to give Peter and Melanie the wedding their
own unruly daughters didn't get.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for TheKnot says people are fascinated with Peter
and Melanie's interactive wedding because most have been to
weddings or endured the trauma of trying to plan one. Now they'd
like to do it right.
</P>
<P>
   That's one way of looking at it, but there could be more to it
than that. This type of reality TV is tailor-made for Internet
tie-ins. See the real people. See their dilemmas. Vote to help them
solve their problems, or vote them out of the limelight. What if
viewers had been able to decide if Puck got voted off ``Real
World'' or which ``Survivor'' cast member gets booted off the
island each week?
</P>
<P>
   However, you won't find anything that drastic or weird on the
``Today'' show, and that's just fine. This is a kinder, gentler way
to watch real people get on with their lives. Peter and Melanie are
real people (read all about them on the MSNBC Web site), and they
really are engaged to be married. They were selected from more than
1,000 couples who wanted to get married on the show, by a panel of
130,000 viewers who went to the Web site and voted for them.
</P>
<P>
   And the Web site makes this little slice of reality TV so
interesting. Not only do we get to plan the couple's wedding, we
also get to watch them get married outfitted with all the wedding
gear we've selected for them.
</P>
<P>
   We'll have to wait until September to find out what Peter and
Melanie really think of all this. Over the next 12 weeks, we'll be
able to vote on everything from who caters the reception to where
they go on their honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are probably a few decisions Peter and Melanie will
make for themselves that we won't get to vote on _ and that's
probably the way it ought to be.

`WHOREHOUSE' AND `DEAD PRESIDENTS' CLUB' GET SIMULTANEOUS FORT
WORTH RUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ In his wilder days, a double for Texas
author/playwright/actor Larry L. King involved whiskey. But this
month in downtown Fort Worth, the relatively clean-living King
achieves a truly rare double in the theater. Two of his plays,
``The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'' and ``The Dead Presidents'
Club,'' will be presented simultaneously at Bass Performance Hall
and Circle Theatre, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a first, at least for me,'' King said by phone from
his home in Washington, D.C. ``It just sort of occurred, but I'm
pleased it did. I'm coming down with my wife and two children to
see both of them. I guess if you last long enough, things like this
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whorehouse,'' a Broadway smash in the '70s that Casa Manana is
staging July 11-23 at Bass Hall, is King's best-known work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That includes plays, books, everything,'' King said. ``
`Whorehouse' is in its 22nd year, and it's about to go out on a
national tour that will last three years more. I suspect it will
always be the thing I was involved with that most people remember
me for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whorehouse,'' which became a 1982 movie starring Burt Reynolds
and Dolly Parton, celebrates a real-life house of ill repute in La
Grange, Texas. The musical is known for lavish production numbers
and larger-than-life characters.
</P>
<P>
   The latter element is also present in King's ``The Dead
Presidents' Club,'' which will run at Circle Theatre from July
19-Aug. 26. But, in the case of this new play, characters even more
controversial than prostitutes are on stage: presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that of all my plays _ `Whorehouse,' `The Night
Hank Williams Died,' `The Golden Shadows Old West Museum,' `The
Kingfish' _ `The Dead Presidents' Club' is the one I derive the
most satisfaction from,'' King said. ``I've always been a political
animal, ever since I was 9 years old and making stump speeches in
West Texas for a candidate named Arch Bint _ who won, by the way. I
worked in Congress for 10 years, mostly for (former House Speaker)
Jim Wright, and I saw politicians, including presidents, pretty
close up.''
</P>
<P>
   King says he first thought of ``The Dead Presidents' Club'' in
1989, ``while I was acting in `The Night Hank Williams Died.'
Darren McGavin had been the lead, but he couldn't remember his
lines. I replaced him for several weeks. So I was sitting backstage
one night and started wondering, `What play am I going to write
next?' and decided I would try first to think of the most
fascinating person I had ever met. Then the play could be about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   King decided that Lyndon B. Johnson fit the bill, ``but Nixon
did, too. So I thought, `Why not pair them up? The afterlife! OK,
what would they be doing there? ... They'd pretend to have an
alliance, but would just be waiting to (betray) each other.''
</P>
<P>
   King began writing the play in 1994, adding former Presidents
Calvin Coolidge and Harry S. Truman to the cast, along with God.
``Coolidge and God are the two I haven't met, at least yet,'' he
says of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   A first reading of the play was staged in 1995 at Southwest
Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas, the alma mater of
Lyndon Johnson, and a full production was staged in Austin in 1997.
Then, dogged by its political subject matter and the difficulties
inherent in casting such well-known characters, it more or less
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Despite good audience and critical reaction to ``Dead
Presidents','' King said: ``I've had trouble getting it produced.
But I hope it will catch on, because it is funny and has something
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose Pearson, executive director of Circle Theatre, said King
and area producer Sharon Benge urged her to read the ``Dead
Presidents'' script.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd done `The Night Hank Williams Died' and `The Golden
Shadows Old West Museum,' '' Pearson said. ``So we read the script
and thought it was hysterical. It fit perfectly into our 1999-2000
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overlap between Circle Theatre's ``Dead
Presidents''' and Casa Manana's ``Best Little Whorehouse,'' Pearson
said she doesn't think either production will lessen ticket sales
for the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theater feeds on theater,'' Pearson said. ``While `Whorehouse'
is better known, it may also steer some new audience in our
direction.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Stirring gospel music just doesn't just roll off in the street
 &HT;    By Khalid Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Although their followers and target audiences
don't always mingle, urban gospel, contemporary Christian and
Southern hymnal music all serve the same purpose: to uplift the
listener (and the performer) to a rarefied plateau of spiritual
awareness so the message of a higher power can sink in.
</P>
<P>
   But stirring spiritual music doesn't just roll in off the
street. It has to be carried in on the voices of talented artists
who have the ability to anoint as well as entertain. The Miami
Valley is blessed with a rich vein of gospel performers who,
regrettably, don't get the exposure they deserve. Thankfully, a
handful of these performers _ along with a splash of national and
regional artists _ will have the chance to showcase their talents
this weekend at three gospel extravaganzas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visions of Faith'' is an inspirational talent show that takes
place Saturday at Memorial Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The program is the brainchild of a Cincinnati native,
24-year-old Isaiah Lowry, president of the sponsoring organization,
Visions of Faith entertainment agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are an entertainment company trying to bring wholesome
entertainment to the Dayton area,'' he said from his Centerville
office. ``We had our first successful talent show in May of 1999 at
Memorial Hall and drew about a thousand people. At this year's
showcase we have solicited talent from Lima, Columbus, Dayton and
Cincinnati along with our national guest artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Karen Clark-Sheard headlines the show. Before Sheard
went solo, she was a member of the award-winning contemporary
gospel trio, the Clark Sisters. Last year, Sheard's debut album,
``Finally Karen,'' was nominated for a Grammy in the category of
Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album. Also appearing will be Charles
Fold, New Harvest, Robert Skinner, spiritual poet Dorothy La'Velle
and local singers and dancers who will compete for cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th annual Gospel Days by the Mad River unfolds Saturday
and Sunday at Eastwood Metropark, Ohio 4 and Harshman Road. This
mammoth gospel blowout, sponsored by Five Rivers MetroParks and the
Coming Together community event groupd, features food, crafts, a
car show and gospel acts covering styles associated with bluegrass,
Southern gospel and their more urbanized cousin, contemporary
Christian music.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Shiveley is founder and president of Coming Together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our festivities start at noon each day and go until it gets
dark,'' Shiveley said. ``We'll have three stages, maybe four. We're
still working on the last one, but basically the stages will
feature bluegrass, contemporary and Southern gospel music. We also
will have a youth area set up for the tots.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiveley said it takes about a year of planning to bring the
festival together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a whole lot of meetings,'' he said. ``At our meetings
we decide what groups to bring in and how many stages we need. We
use mostly local groups but we try to bring in many full-time
groups, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing will be Crimson River, Dumplin Valley Boys, The
Freemans, Zionheirs, Graceway Quartet, The Hall Family, Roarks,
Forgiven, Leta Stroud, Royalty and the Kings Road Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   The contemporary stage will feature the music of Spark, 50,000
Hub Caps, Featherweight, Blind Man Walking, Mindset, Herman's Drew
and Top Flight.
</P>
<P>
   Blankets and lawn chairs are welcome, alcoholic beverages are
not.
</P>
<P>
   And Vandalia Baptist Temple will be the host for a gospel
concert to benefit the Franklin Baptist Church Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, Franklin Baptist Church was destroyed by fire.
Since then, Franklin's pastor, Dale Chambers, and his congregation
have been rebuilding their spiritual home. The Rev. Troy Todd,
leader of Vandalia Baptist Temple, said the concert is a gesture of
fellowship, friendship and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rev. Chambers and I have been the closest of friends for 32
years,'' Todd said. ``This benefit is a helping hand from a
congregation who cares deeply about them. We know it (the fire) was
a low blow, but we've got a couple of singing groups in our church
and we kno

 &HT;    50TH YEAR IN RADIO FINDS VETERAN NEWSCASTER IN A PLACE HE LIKES
 &HT;    Eds: Repeating to restore dropped matter.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's a tad after 7 a.m. _ the middle of the workday
_ and Carl Kasell is sipping coffee from a sky-blue coffee mug
commemorating the Tar Heels of the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Half a century has passed since the newscaster for National
Public Radio's ``Morning Edition'' began his career as a high
school reporter for WGBR-AM in his home town of Goldsboro, N.C. But
Kasell is proud that a trace of the South lingers faintly in his
familiar voice.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 66, he relishes his roots.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the tobacco country of eastern North Carolina. His
dad ``was a guy who kind of bounced from job to job,'' and money
was sometimes scarce in a family with four children.
</P>
<P>
   A young Andy Griffith, just out of college himself, was his high
school drama teacher. After casting Kasell in the lead of ``Father
of the Bride'' during his senior year, Griffith urged him to
consider a theatrical career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, 'No, I'm going to be a radio star,' `` Kasell
recalls with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s had just begun, and television was in its infancy.
Kasell had grown up listening to Jack Benny and ``the Lone Ranger''
and ``Superman'' and ``the Hermit.'' News bored him, but he aspired
to an on-air career as a quiz show host or actor in serial drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Radio was still king,'' he said. ``I always wanted to be a
part of it. It just fascinated me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry that can be so creative. Whereas TV plays to
your eyes, we play to your mind. When radio is done right, it can
create images that are far superior to what television can show you
with pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasell sips his coffee and glances at a studio clock. Every hour
from 5 a.m. through 11 a.m. ET, he delivers a five-minute newscast
as ``Morning Edition'' airs _ live or taped _ across the nation's
time zones. Every newscast must be updated.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, Kasell has arisen an hour after
midnight on weekdays in his home in suburban Annandale, Va. By 2:15
a.m., he's usually chatting with ``Morning Edition'' host Bob
Edwards at the NPR Headquarters in downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations are ``seldom about work,'' he said. They share
a passion for college football _ Edwards for the University of
Louisville Cardinals and Kasell for the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, he had headed to the scenic campus at Chapel
Hill. Coincidentally, UNC graduate Griffith moved back there at
about the same time, leaving teaching and beginning his night club
act. Kasell majored in English and worked at the campus radio
station, sometimes with classmate Charles Kuralt.
</P>
<P>
   After four years of college, he was drafted into the Army.
Stationed in Italy, he met the woman whom he would marry shortly
after his discharge. They celebrated a 37th wedding anniversary
before her death several years ago. Their married son lives in
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Having always worked an early morning shift, Kasell adjusted his
schedule to accommodate family life. After leaving work about 11:30
a.m., he would sleep from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Then he awoke for
several hours to watch his son play baseball from Little League
through high school or for other family activities. Then he slept
again from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining NPR in the mid-1970s, he worked for commercial
radio stations in North Carolina and Virginia. He played pop and
country music and worked for an all-news station that switched to
rock 'n' roll. He sees public radio as his salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care for shock radio. I think it's an insult to our
industry,'' he said. ``Ranting and raving and talking about obscene
topics is not what I envisioned radio to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Literate, leisurely, non-commercial NPR, with its entertaining
whimsy and thoughtful news and analysis and assorted cultural fare,
comes closer to being the radio of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an organization,'' he said. ``I'm glad I found it,
or glad they found me. However that worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Edwards, Kasell has been on ``Morning Edition'' since
its birth 20 years ago. The popular program is broadcast by more
than 520 NPR stations. More recently, Kasell has fulfilled his
boyhood ambition of hosting a radio quiz show _ NPR's weekly
``Wait, Wait ... Don't Tell Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like old-time radio,'' he enthuses. ``I'm official judge
and scorekeeper'' for panelists that include humorist Roy Blount
Jr. and Washington Post columnist Roxanne Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Kasell has also traveled to NPR stations around the country,
giving his audience a chance to see as well has hear him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while, you'll meet somebody who says 'You know, you
look exactly like I thought you would look,' `` he said. But that's
not the usual reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I probably sound younger than I am because a woman in
San Francisco last year said 'You know, you are really more mature
than you sound,'' he said. ``I said, 'You mean older, don't you?'
``
</P>
<P>
   But in his 50th year of broadcasting, he has no plans to leave
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider this work,'' he explained as 8 a.m.
approached and legions of commuters tuned into ``Morning Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun.''

A LITTLE LEVITTOWN ON THE NEVA 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN VAROLI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Several homeowners, cell phones at
hand, tend their lawns and gardens. Others are firing up a barbecue
in the backyard, while on the street children ride mountain bikes
or skate by on Rollerblades. Two little girls talk about going with
their mothers to get a bite to eat at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   It could be Pleasantville, but the pork shish kebab on the
grill, cooked faithfully every weekend instead of hamburgers, is
just one sign that it probably is not. This is Kolomyaga, a
condominium development on the fringes of St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of four tidy rows of eight town houses, aligned in a
square, has shaken this previously poor village, but not because it
is luxurious. Neighboring brick mansions, with Mercedes-Benzes
parked out front, have already numbed local residents to displays
of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   What is turning heads at Kolomyaga is the novelty of
American-style suburban architecture transplanted onto Russian
soil. The signs are small but telling. Lawns neatly manicured where
they used to run wild. A 5-foot security fence and guards to keep
out the riffraff. Volleyball areas for children. Aluminum siding on
the houses. Fords in the driveway. And fast food is a mere
10-minute drive.
</P>
<P>
   No one is saying that St. Petersburg has solved its decades-old
housing problem. Most of the city's 5 million inhabitants still
live in prefab high-rises, a Soviet-era legacy, in which three
generations in a tiny apartment is not uncommon. By the 1990s, the
few with money built year-round country mansions. But beyond the
country house and city apartment, a third way is emerging _ the
small family house _ with some things lost and some gained.
</P>
<P>
   As the American suburban dream infiltrates Russia's second
largest city, it is giving added legitimacy and visibility to
Russia's version of the middle-class homeowner. There is even a new
Russian word for condo: Town khaus.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs and small-business owners, mainly couples in their
30s with small children, the town khausers of Kolomyaga are well
enough off to choose a new $75,000 condo 20 minutes from downtown.
(A nice city apartment costs no less than $50,000, with $20,000
more in renovations.)
</P>
<P>
   ``These condo residents want their house to be their castle, so
they can retreat away from the rest of the world,'' said Viktoriya
Ukhalova, a St. Petersburg architect and interior designer. ``This
is a reaction to decades of forced communal living. Now people have
a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the two-story houses, there is little that impresses. The
goal is basic comfort and function: Kitchen, office, master
bedroom, two bedrooms for the kids and a living room. The big
change is adjusting to country living. Though living rooms are
large, residents still entertain their guests in the kitchen, an
ancient habit of peasant origins, when the warm kitchen was the
most hospitable room during the long, cold Russian winters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must tend the yard, and there are added travel costs,''
said Vasily Ryzhkov, 32, who owns a dental clinic downtown. ``But
it is worth it to live in the fresh air and have your own house.''
</P>
<P>
   As pleasant as life can be outside the inner city, Russian
suburbs have disadvantages. They lack good schools or stores
nearby. Life is still rustic, and the city remains the sole source
of civilized amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kolomyaga residents relish being able to retreat into
their spacious homes, some 1,500 square feet of living space on
three floors. Each unit has a small yard in front and back, and
wives groom their tiny plots, something rare in Russia, where yards
tend to be weedy or dedicated to growing food.
</P>
<P>
   While necessity forces women to work, some successful Russian
businessman regard a working wife as an insult to their
masculinity. ``Here my wife sits home with the children, can sit in
the yard or walk around the area, and is not cooped up,'' Ryzhkov
said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging professional class, with leisure to tend gardens
has even led to the appearance of a retail outlet called Maxidom,
Russia's answer to Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban settlements began in Moscow about five years ago, but
they are just starting to sprout in St. Petersburg. Kolomyaga was
conceived in 1997 by Vladimir Lubomirov, and the first families
moved in a year ago. Lubomirov, 32, who was raised in St.
Petersburg, built his first family home (for a Finnish buyer) in
1991 while still studying for a master's degree in physics.
Kolomyaga is his first large-scale project.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are surprised there are such nice suburban
housing complexes, and here just within the city limits,''
Lubomirov said, giving a tour of the complex one sunny weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers slow down to gawk. Some people remark that the aluminum
siding, banned by zoning laws until a few years ago, makes the
houses look fake, like a toy village. Indeed, the contrast between
old and new is surreal. Across the street from the complex stands a
row of dilapidated wooden shanties, built just after World War II,
yards overgrown with bushes and trees.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the road are two new brick mansions, viewed by many
as emblems of capitalism's criminal element. Looking like medieval
keeps but oddly known as kottedzhi, or cottages, they are
surrounded by 8-foot brick walls.
</P>
<P>
   Change and progress have always been painful in Russia, and old
and new sometimes have trouble coexisting, even at Kolomyaga.
Symbolic of the conflict is a 50-year-old village house, in
relatively good condition, inhabited by a couple in their late 50s.
It, and they, stand in the way of completing a row of condos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way my wife and I plan to give up our home in the
country, in this place, where she grew up and where I've lived for
the last 30 years,'' said one of the owners, who would give only
the name Igor. ``I don't have any ill feeling toward the new
neighbors, and I understand it's progress, but it's too bad that
what was once a real village is now disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Lubomirov's offer of a condo could not sway Igor, who said
there is something special about living in a primitive wooden
house. Indeed, sentimental fondness for the simple rustic life and
a desire to be close to nature run deep in the Russian soul, one
reason that urban Russians, even wealthy ones, retreat to their
dachas on weekends.

<P>
   As one indication of what has been lost in the transition from
village life to suburbia, Kolomyaga has not only a 5-foot metal
fence around its five acres but also two uniformed police officers,
who stand guard around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, the law does not effectively defend private
property, and people do not respect the property of others,''
Lubomirov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, there are no dens of vice that attract a bad element,''
said Dmitri Rakovshchik,'' a resident and vice president of a
Russian insurance company. ``Before, we lived in a nice apartment
in the city center, but our building entrance was filthy and
dangerous. Here, it's safer because in the center there are always
problems with vandals and hooligans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryzhkov said, ``You can park your car in front of your house and
not worry it will be stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   At Kolomyaga, each household owns at least one car, compared
with Russia's national average of 20 percent of households. (Local
roads, dusty and cratered with gaping ditches, do a job on them,
however.)
</P>
<P>
   Living in a condo complex raises issues that hark back to Soviet
living, like communality. Most condo owners escaped from the city
to be masters of their own castles but are finding they must pull
together.
</P>
<P>
   General meetings are held when the need arises _ to collect
money for repairs or improvements _ but no one seems to mind
because they all have interests at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kolomyaga's main selling points are space and security,
the condos are also marketed with a strong element of class
consciousness (middle class in the American understanding but rich
for Russia, where the average person lives on $50 to $100 a month.)
Most marketing was done through word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the pluses that attract buyers to our complex is that
we offer more social homogeneity,'' Lubomirov said. ``In Russia, it
is common for poor and rich to live in the same building. And this
is not always pleasant, for many reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is tempting to see such economic segregation as part of
a turn to American-style class divisions, it confirms Soviet habits
predating the mixed-income high-rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soviet housing was highly segregated, where the ruling elite
lived in large apartments in the best districts, while the masses
lived in communal apartments and prefab high-rises,'' said Lev
Savulkin, a senior analyst at the Leontieff Center for Social and
Economic Research here.
</P>
<P>
   The freedom of the last 10 years has allowed acquiring wealth to
become a personal affair, not tied to a ruling party. And now the
newly rich are banding together.
</P>
<P>
   Lubomirov, however, is careful to keep out those who are too
rich. ``No shaven heads'' _ meaning Russia's mafia elite _ he said.
He has strict face control at Kolomyaga.
</P>
<P>
   Today, demand for middle-of-the-road housing is growing faster
than supply, and he has bought and plans to level a half dozen
shanties, creating space for what he hopes will be 200 units and a
dozen houses in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   Near Kolomyaga, are about six other such suburban settlements.
Indeed, the city government has set the area aside for condo
residences. ``The strong demand indicates how housing tastes, not
to mention income patterns, have changed over the last eight
years,'' said the developer, whose pony tail, soft voice and gaunt
features suggest a struggling artist more than a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be right. Two miles from Kolomyaga, dozens of new
high-rises stand empty, while most condo complexes in the area fill
quickly. Yet as suburban as Kolomyaga may look, its 32
owner-residents have not totally adopted the American way of real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it is difficult to get a mortgage in Russia,
which means buyers make quarterly payments during construction to
pay off the purchase price before they move in.
</P>
<P>
   As the demand for suburban housing expands, local government is
responding with new programs. Moscow and St. Petersburg are both
beginning to offer mortgages, giving home buyers a chance to spread
housing costs over many years.
</P>
<P>
   St. Petersburg is going even further, saying it will provide
roads, sewer hookups and schools on some 1,300 acres of forest land
at the north end of the city, to be called Severnaya Dolina
(Northern Valley), so developers can build hundreds of condos and
houses. This will be the city's first large-scale suburban housing
development.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Valley is only on the drawing board. In a country given
to sudden financial crises like that in August 1998, which wiped
out an emerging middle class, it is too early to say that
American-style suburban living will become widespread in Russia.
Some habits and ways of behavior will never change, no matter how
affluent people become.
</P>
<P>
   Though Russians with money enjoy lavishing it on status symbols
like nice cars, they will cut costs on basics. ``It's funny how
people in the area, even those with money, are too cheap to pay for
garbage removal,'' Lubomirov exclaimed with exasperation. ``So,
what do they do? They load up their Mercedes or Fords with their
garbage and haul it off to a dumpster in one of the nearby pre-fab,
housing projects.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``In some ways, Russians will probably never change.''

 &HT;    SOME HEALTH CARE SAFETY EFFORTS OUTPACE FEDERAL RULE MAKERS
 &HT;    780&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as Congress and the Clinton administration
spar over new safety rules for the workplace, a handful of
hospitals and nursing homes are already acting to ease the
heavy-lifting burden for nursing personnel, who have long suffered
from high numbers of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment, the University of Washington's Medical Center
in Seattle set up a two-person ``lift team'' to take over the most
injury-prone part of health care work, moving patients.
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. health care, lifting patients from bed to chair and from
wheelchair to bath is nearly always assigned to nurses and nursing
assistants, who sometimes suffer career-ending back damage.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing personnel reported more than 600,000 work-related back
and muscle injuries in 1998, more than any other major job
category. The high incidence has been blamed for reducing the
already scarce supply of trained nurses.
</P>
<P>
   To remedy that problem, the system in Seattle aims at shifting
all the heavy lifting to two workers who have been trained in the
latest techniques and furnished with portable mechanical devices.
The lift team moves around the hospital as their services are
requested by nursing staff.
</P>
<P>
   After the first six months, back injuries had dropped by 63
percent during the day shift, when the lift team was on duty. Work
days lost from injuries during patient transfers plummeted by 86
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only injuries during the day shift occurred when
staffers in three cases tried to move patients without the lift
specialists, said Challie Kraus, the registered nurse who oversees
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the experiment a success, but the hospital is now
using the lift team as an important recruiting tool in hiring
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking as a nurse myself, we don't like lifting,'' Kraus
said. ``It puts our backs at risk. Knowing that there's a team that
can come and perform these tasks is a huge selling point.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that this system improves patient care by freeing up
nurses for duties that require their expertise instead of their
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Such voluntary safety reforms, including some that rely more on
high tech devices, have been tested with similar results in a
handful of U.S. hospitals, most of them on the West coast, and in
some nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, much of the health care industry and its allies in
Congress are fighting the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration's proposal to require nearly all of the nation's
work sites to operate by an ``ergonomics'' standard _ meaning that
worker tasks must be redesigned to reduce the risk of back and
muscle damage.
</P>
<P>
   But at a hearing Thursday, the head of the largest trade group
of corporate nursing homes will testify that no new federal
mandates are needed to combat back injuries, since the injuries
have already begun to decline by about 17 percent since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the current system and voluntary efforts to reduce
MSDs (muscular-skeletal disorders) are working,'' Charles H.
Roadman, president of the American Health Care Association, said in
remarks prepared for delivery to the Senate Health, Education,
Labor and Pension Committee's employment safety subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Roadman has said that each nursing home would have to spend an
average $60,000 for mechanical lifts and training to comply with
the new federal regulation. Moreover, he argues in his statement,
mandated use of lifting equipment might conflict with requirements
``that ensure a resident's dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the new safety rules counter that safety measures
would pay for themselves in the long run, improve patient care and
create a more stable work force, which now has a 93 percent
turnover rate in long-term facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could save $10 for every $1 spent,'' asserted Bill
Borwegen, health and safety director for the Service Employees
International Union, the largest union of U.S. nursing home
workers. The union was not invited to address the Senate hearing,
which was called by Sen. Michael Enzi, R-Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were any patient groups or advocates asked to speak, said
Sarah Green Burger, an official with the National Citizens
Coalition for Nursing Home Reform, a private group that advocates
better patient care.
</P>
<P>
   Burger questioned the claim that using more mechanical equipment
for moving patients would interfere with the ``dignity'' of
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is a wheelchair undignified? No,'' she said. Lifting devices
give residents more freedom of movement, such as allowing them to
be taken to a bath, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Such lifts can be frightening for those suffering from dementia,
she said. ``For other people, it really gives them security because
they know it's a safest way to move from one place to another.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Some nursing homes that have instituted voluntary ergonomics
programs report major savings in workmen's compensation costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Lutheran nursing home in Racine, Wis., for example,
instituted a rule in 1994 forbidding its staff to lift more than 30
pounds, except in emergencies, without using a mechanical device.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, the annual number of injuries from patient
care duties dropped by half, the lost work days to injuries fell
from 830 to 90 per year. The cost of worker injuries fell from
$211,000 to $58,000 a year.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Tony Early and his wife, Sarah Bell Early,
were standing in their mustard-yellow kitchen, opening mail.
``French's Mustard yellow,'' Sarah Early said. ``If you hold the
jar up to the wall, it's almost identical.'' The Earlys had been on
the road for six weeks, touring the Southeast to promote Tony
Early's first novel, ``Jim the Boy,'' published by Little, Brown
last month to impressive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Early read a congratulatory postcard from a college
acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stole my girl in 1984,'' Early said, with some humor and
some pique. ``And now he's writing me a postcard. I suppose he
thinks I forgot.''
</P>
<P>
   Things worked out, as stories involving writers often do. The
Earlys, from the same town in North Carolina, Rutherfordton,
married in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a very tiny country Baptist church,'' Early said,
sitting in his $30 used club chair in the vestibule of their
five-room Victorian house in Lockeland, a gentrifying neighborhood
of English-cottage gardens and late-model Saabs and
galvanized-fenced front yards with doghouses in East Nashville. ``I
started going to the Episcopal church in our hometown just to
impress another woman I was dating at the time, and developed a
crush on this girl who sang in the choir. Sitting in church, I felt
like just a complete heel, because I was there with my girlfriend,
but I was longing for this girl in the choir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I married the girl in the choir,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Early's first book, ``Here We Are in Paradise,'' a volume of
stories, was published in 1994. He was chosen by Granta in 1996 as
one of the 20 best young American writers and in 1999 by The New
Yorker as one of ``20 writers for the 21st century,'' a group that
included Rick Moody and David Foster Wallace. Early, 39, has been
an assistant professor of English at Vanderbilt University since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim the Boy'' is the crystalline story of a year in the life
of Jim Glass, a 10-year-old boy growing up in rural North Carolina
during the Depression. Early said that he wrote the book in the
style of children's classics like ``Charlotte's Web'' and ``The
Yearling,'' as ``a children's book for adults.'' Janet Maslin
reviewing it in The New York Times, called the novel a ``radiant,
knowing, pitch-perfect parable of childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Early's own childhood and adulthood have been darker. He battles
depression: The bright scars of his most recent bout grace the
walls of his Nashville home, as colorful folk paintings he made
when he couldn't write.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Here We Are In Paradise' came out, I got sick, and
stayed sick for a couple of years,'' said Early, who speaks quietly
and carefully, and with the occasional running jump of an
enthusiastic boy. ``I was on the suicide watch for a while; I
didn't know if I'd ever write again.'' He started painting on a
stack of discarded storm windows that he found in the neighborhood,
then slowly writing, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a bunch of cheap paint at Wal-Mart, and I started
making big words on them,'' he said. ``That's how I started coming
out of it: One big word at a time.'' Early discounted any
therapeutic interpretation of his new book, but said of the nearly
clairvoyant simplicity of his character Jim's impressions, that
``on some level that I didn't understand, I wrote the book that I
needed to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Without bearing, in unfamiliar country at the end of the book,
Jim asks, ``Which way is home?'' By the author's implication, it is
a child's question that most adults spend their lives answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was way too sensitive for life on planet Earth,'' Early said
of himself when he was Jim's age. ``Noises were too long and lights
were too bright and my feelings were always hurt. It was just
because, I think, I was so incredibly thin-skinned.''
</P>
<P>
   Early's father was a welder; his mother worked in a department
store. His sister was killed in an automobile accident when he was
a freshman at Warren Wilson College in Asheville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grew up in a suburb of a town with 3,000 people in it,'' he
said. Early described his as a ``pretty typical Middle American
unhappy childhood.'' His parents' marriage was troubled until he
returned from college as an adult, a tension he said dispossessed
his happiness in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive by there now, and I don't feel anything at all about
that house,'' he said. Early liked his maternal grandmother's
house, ``a big old folk Victorian'' with a parlor and ``Sunday
furniture'' as he called it, where the preacher sat when he
visited.
</P>
<P>
   In Early's book, he has turned a child's sensitivities into
writerly strengths; domestic events have an extraordinary witness.
</P>
<P>
   Jim's father dies without warning the week before he is born; at
10, he is as old as his mother's unending grief. By his 11th
birthday, he has stepped into the world, wading in its strong
waters on a trip to the Atlantic Ocean with his uncle. At midnight,
he has watched Aliceville, his upland county town, visited like a
disturbing Bible vision by electric light. On the porch of a
moonshiner's shack, he has pressed his nose to a rusted screen,
scratched it with his finger and seen his young father rise like
river mist in the breath of the dying man inside
</P>
<P>
   And, at the center of his family circle, which includes three
kind uncles, Jim's childhood has the buoyant weight of love.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina country is Jim's natural sense of place and the
haunt of his understanding of the importance of home. It is the
other large character in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a family thing,'' said Early, whose family,
``both sides,'' has lived for generations within a five-mile radius
in a corner of western North Carolina. ``When every one of your
ancestors has been looking at the same landscape for 200 years, it
becomes rooted like family, passed on, maybe even genetic,'' he
said. Early said he confuses friends by telling them he will be at
home: He means North Carolina, not the house in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   That kind of orientation _ which closes the book as Jim sights
Aliceville from the top of a mountain, and realizes that only home
has the power to hold the great world's center _ is being lost,
Early fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I notice it in the accents of students,'' he said,
``particularly female students. They have the same accent, no
matter what part of the country they're from _ a sort of a valley
girl, television accent. They sound alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has his own branch of the family, living in Nashville
with Sarah, a former seminary student, and their two Jack Russell
terriers, Jubal and Rastus.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the CEO of the family,'' Early said of his wife as he
stood in her office. ``I'm production, and she's management.'' On
the mantel was a topographical map of North Carolina. Behind a
rocking chair hung three quilts, made by Early's grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not fancy quilts,'' he said. ``Just everyday quilts.''
</P>
<P>
   The house is furnished with modest, friendly looking pieces from
a previous era, which the Earlys bought cheaply as a young married
couple for their first home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just broke,'' he said. ``We lived in a depressed
little steel town outside of Pittsburgh. Because it was so
depressed, we managed to buy and renovate a house. All of our
furniture we bought at used furniture stores in the Ohio River
Valley in these other little depressed steel towns strung out along
the river. I had a route I drove every Saturday looking for nice
furniture that was cheap. Because we got it with smoke and mirrors,
I'm attached to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a storyteller, Early also has a sympathy with the sincerity
and drollness of folk art. In addition to having tried his hand at
it, he collects it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a slight weakness for folk art,'' he said. ``Sarah
manages to keep it under control. I'd have paintings on plywood all
over the house if it were left up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen is a copy of a Cezanne still life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's by a guy we found in Florida who was so excited we were
interested in his pictures he gave us three,'' Early said. ``His
pictures were hanging in a filling station. They'd been there four
years and nobody had ever even asked about them.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife pointed out that the back line of a table in the
picture is untrue, shifting planes behind the globes of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was just his mistake, but in the Cezanne, it's
not even across, either,'' she said. ``It's an accurate copy _ the
colors are just completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   In the vestibule on a bookcase is a wood Madonna nursing a
child, carved with a chain saw by a sculptor in Early's home county
in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baptists wandered up into yard and gave him a hard time about
a nursing Madonna,'' Early recalled. ```Well, Jesus had to eat
didn't he?' he said to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Earlys' bedroom is a hand-lettered sign set on the lintel
of a closet that is naive but not art. ``EVERY DAY I WRITE THE
BOOK,'' the sign says.
</P>
<P>
   Below it is a pad of large papers with fierce red numbers drawn
on them, tacked to the doorjamb like the marks with which a child
measures his height. These numbers are the chapters in ``Jim the
Boy'' _ a lottery that Early fought not to lose for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better I get, the more I feel like I have to lose,'' he
said. ``I don't want to give any ground back. I haven't always been
where I am now. I don't want to go back to where I was. I don't
want to have to climb this hill again.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the terrain of ``Jim the Boy,'' familiarity can vanish
with each new view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too big,'' says Jim, seeing his world from the mountain,
faltering briefly as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Early, who said that he wishes to write ``The Complete Jim
Glass,'' intends to let him grow into it.

&HT;     TOO FEW OF US EXERCISE A VITAL PRIVILEGE _ OUR RIGHT TO VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     For release Sunday, July 16)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON  &Cx1f; _ In the arsenal of rights bequeathed to us by the
Constitution to encourage broader participation in our democracy,
none is more valuable than the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   That single privilege allows us to help shape the destiny of our
nation and to record our approval or disapproval of candidates and
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, to millions of Americans, this sacred right is
not valuable enough to stir them from their homes, jobs or
recreation to cast their ballots. Their oft-repeated refrain is,
``My vote won't change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is wrong. A single vote may not decide the outcome of
an election. but it does provide voters with the satisfaction of
knowing that they have played a role _ small though it may be _ in
the unfolding saga of America.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for an election of any kind to be settled by a single
vote. But it is not uncommon for elections to be determined by a
small number of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 69 million Americans voted in the 1960 contest that
pitted John F. Kennedy against Richard Nixon and featured the first
televised debates between presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's margin of victory was not quite 15,000 votes. The
shift of a few votes in Texas and Illinois would have made Nixon
the victor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1884 the showdown was between Republican James G. Blaine, a
former congressman, senator and secretary of state who had been
implicated in graft from railroad interests, and Democrat Grover
Cleveland, the New York governor who had fathered a child out of
wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   Republican partisans chanted, ``Ma, Ma, where's my Pa? Gone to
the White House, Ha, ha, ha.'' The Democratic battle cry was,
``Blaine! Blaine! James G. Blaine! Continental liar from the state
of Maine!''
</P>
<P>
   Blaine probably would have won had he not listened passively at
a meeting of Protestant ministers when the Rev. Samuel D. Burchard
branded Democrats as the party of ``rum, Romanism and rebellion.''
Catholic voters were offended and many voted for Cleveland, giving
him New York.
</P>
<P>
   If Blaine had carried New York, he would have won the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That election clearly demonstrates how a few popular votes can
determine who will be president.
</P>
<P>
   In the current campaign, the issues are so blurred that it is
almost impossible for some would-be voters to decide which
candidate to choose.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, both Al Gore and George W. Bush have vowed to
protect Social Security, reform Medicare and education, reduce
taxes, continue economic expansion, bolster international trade and
improve health care. Each has his own plan to achieve those goals.
</P>
<P>
   Today's situation is similar to that 40 years ago. As Nixon
explained in accepting his first presidential nomination in 1960,
he and Kennedy generally agreed on their objectives. Where they
differed, he said, was on the means of achieving them.
</P>
<P>
   Today Bush has shrewdly moved to the center of the political
spectrum and forced Gore to the left.
</P>
<P>
   But the election is three-and-a-half months in the future, and
millions of voters have not yet decided who they want as their 43rd
president. If the election were held this week, Bush would probably
win because his smiling, low-key manner has appealed to more voters
than has Gore's attack-dog approach.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president appears to have decided to emulate Harry
Truman, who won a stunning upset victory in 1948 with his
give-'em-hell attacks on the Republican-controlled 80th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But thus far Gore's campaign strategy has reduced rather than
increased his standing in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Many would-be voters are turned off by a campaign that begins
shortly after the first of the year in Iowa and New Hampshire and
continues non-stop until Election Day in November. Many of them do
not pay much attention to the presidential battle until after Labor
Day. Some never do.
</P>
<P>
   Although the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 by the 26th
amendment, which was added to the Constitution in 1971, the vote
among young people is sparse. They either are turned off by what
they see and hear or they lack interest in the issues being debated
by the candidates. Seniors vote in far greater numbers than young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1968 presidential election, in which Nixon
defeated Hubert Humphrey, has the turnout of eligible voters soared
to more than 60 percent. In the 1988, 1992 and 1996 elections, the
turnout of eligible voters was a bit more than 50 percent, 55
percent and 49 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Those are poor performances for citizens of a nation that prides
itself on being the world's only superpower and one whose tradition
of participatory democracy stretches back to 1789.

 &HT;    DEFIANT ORANGE ORDER SHOWS SOME DIVISIONS OVER PROTESTS
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Their fifes and bass drums
reverberating through the city's shuttered streets, thousands of
members of the Orange Order paraded Wednesday, the climactic day of
the annual rite to celebrate winning a war that ended three
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid a sectarian confrontation, security forces in
the morning installed a massive, drab green steel wall on the
Ormeau Bridge to prevent the Protestant Orangemen from marching
into a hostile Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When the Orangemen reached the steel wall, they stated their
objections to being permitted to carry on. An Anglican minister,
the Rev. William Hoey, stood in front of the wall to lead the crowd
in the Lord's Prayer _ and an attack on Catholic politicians and
the British government. Many Protestants believe that British
politicians trying to resolve the ancient sectarian dispute have
been siding more often with the minority Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no peace in this land so long as republicanism calls
the shots,'' Hoey said, referring to militant Catholics associated
with the Irish Republic Army. ``We say to the government, take them
on and put them down once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and politicians hope the close of a particularly riotous
marching season will bring an end to a 10-day spasm of violence
that has caused millions of dollars in lost business and reminded
everyone that peace has still not taken hold in this troubled
province.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 80,000 members of the Orange Order marched throughout
the province. Most of the
</P>
<P>
   parades like the ones here in Belfast were uneventful. Thousand
of supporters, many wearing or waving the British Union Jack flag,
lined the routes.
</P>
<P>
   With a police helicopter keeping watch from a gray cloudy sky,
the mood of the crowd was sour. There were few cheers as the crowds
watched the parade of grimly serious men carrying banners and
swords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot deny that I hate the Catholics _ even though I have
some friends who go to the Pope church _ and now the police too,''
said Charles Moye, a car mechanic who brought his two small
children and their mother to the parade. ``The police should be
with us as we are loyal to the same things they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't letting us March on the queen's road, which is our
sacred right,'' he added. ``All that's happened here that we've all
seen on TV every night is because of the Parades Commission. It's
all on their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years straight, the government's Parades Commission
has forbidden the Protestants from marching through Catholic
neighborhoods. The commission's most controversial decision has
been to forbid the Orange Order from marching into a Catholic
neighborhood in Drumcree near Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   The Drumcree stand-off has become a sacred cause for the
Orangemen, who called for widespread demonstrations against the
decision. These demonstrations evolved into nightly outbursts of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Orange leaders had appealed for protests to stay peaceful but
their pleas fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Watson, an Orange Order leader, condemned the violence.
``Violence cannot be justified as we have witnessed in recent days,
and it does nothing to enhance the cause of Orange-ism,'' Watson
told a crowd Wednesday. ``Those who wish to infiltrate and attend
the protest for their own ulterior motive have no part to play in
support of the Orange Order.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, riots in Portadown left 21 policemen injured.
Near a bonfire in Larne, north of Belfast, a man was f into a
hostile Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When the Orangemen reached the steel wall, they stated their
objections to being permitted to carry on. An Anglican minister,
the Rev. William Hoey, stood in front of the wall to lead the crowd

some friends who go to the Pope church _ and now the police too,''
said Charles Moye, a car mechanic who brought his two small
children and their mother to the parade. ``The police should be
with us as we are loyal to the same things they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't letting us March on the queen's road, which is our
sacred right,'' he added. ``All that's happened here that we've all
seen on TV every night is because of the Parades Commission. It's
all on their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years straight, the government's Parades Commission
has forbidden the Protestants from marching through Catholic
neighborhoods. The commission's most controversial decision has
been to forbid the Orange Order from marching into a Catholic
neighborhood in Drumcree near Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   The Drumcree stand-off has become a sacred cause for the
Orangemen, who called for widespread demonstrations against the
decision. These demonstrations evolved into nightly outbursts of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Orange leaders had appealed for protests to stay peaceful but
their pleas fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Watson, an Orange Order leader, condemned the violence.
``Violence cannot be justified as we have witnessed in recent days,
and it does nothing to enhance the cause of Orange-ism,'' Watson
told a crowd Wednesday. ``Those who wish to infiltrate and attend
the protest for their own ulterior motive have no part to play in
support of the Orange Order.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, riots in Portadown left 21 policemen injured.
Near a bonfire in Larne, north of Belfast, a man was found dead
from gunshot wounds. Police believe he was killed by Protestant
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Police used water cannons overnight on rioters in Portadown who
rained gasoline bombs, bottles and bricks at security forces near
two Protestant neighborhoods. At one point a home-made pipe bomb
was tossed at security forces.
</P>
<P>
   In an unsettling development, masked guerrillas from the
outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters came out of the shadows near at
least two Belfast bonfires and fired repeated volleys in the air
with handguns and semi-automatic assault rifles. The organization
is supposed to be observing a cease-fire in support of the 1998
Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Sectarian tensions intensify each year in the run-up to July 12,
the anniversary of the day when Protestant William of Orange
triumphed over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in
1690.
</P>
<P>
   Some moderates within the Orange Order complained their
provocative protests made the violence inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear my (Orange) collarette with the pride I used to,
not when I see people blocking roads with pipes in their hands,''
William Brown, a one-time senior Belfast Orangeman, told the
Associated Press.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta

<P>
   Q: I understand that James Carville and Dick Morris spent some
time in Mexico before the recent presidential election there.
Apparently they were campaigning for one of the candidates. Can you
tell me which party?
</P>
<P>
   A: The political consultants indeed were involved as
behind-the-scenes players in Mexico's presidential race _ but on
opposite sides of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Carville was there to advise the PRI (Institutional
Revolutionary Party) and its candidate, Francisco Labastida. Morris
was aligned with the winner, Vicente Fox, candidate of the PAN
(National Action Party).
</P>
<P>
   As reported by the Associated Press last January, the idea of
Mexican politicians taking advice from U.S. advisers was a
sensitive issue, because any hint of U.S. influence could be blown
up into a sovereignity issue. So there wasn't a lot of publicity
for Carville and Morris, or several other American political
operatives reportedly involved in the campaign. There were no news
conferences and no photo ops, and the candidates appeared to hide
the fact that they even talked to the American advisers.
</P>
<P>
   When Morris said he had worked with Fox, the Fox camp hotly
denied it. And at a primary debate, when the last-place candidate
challenged his opponents to say whether they had U.S. advisers,
none answered.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Atlanta Track Club claims that the Peachtree Road Race is
the largest 10K in the world with 55,000 participants. My husband
and I were in the Bay to Breakers race in San Francisco several
years ago, and I'm sure it had more than 55,000 people. Can you
explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bay to Breakers, sponsored by the San Francisco Examiner,
is a 12K race. It attracted about 75,000 people this year, down
from a peak of 100,000-plus in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Medeia Cohan, a spokeswoman for the race, called it ``the
largest race in the world,'' but added that a half-marathon
somewhere in Europe _ she didn't know where _ may break the record
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Information online: www.baytobreakers.com/. Next race date: May
20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article quoted Vice President Al Gore as ``speaking
favorably of the fractals,'' and the word ``fractals'' appears in
the article three more times, never defined. I checked seven
dictionaries and can't find this word. What does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's a mathematical term. Fractal geometry examines the
irregular patterns that repeat and are similar at all size scales.
In nature, an example is a mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard many stories about how kudzu came to the
Southeast. One was that it was brought from China to stop erosion.
Is that really the case?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's about it. The plant _ which belongs to the pea family
and whose scientific name is Pueraria lobata _ is native to China
and Japan. It was long grown there for its edible, starchy roots
and for a fiber, kohemp, made from its stems.
</P>
<P>
   It was transplanted to North America in the late 1880s and first
was grown as an ornamental porch vine and for livestock feed. In
the 1930s, farmers in the South began to plant kudzu as ground
cover to prevent soil erosion. And we all know what has happened in
the decades since.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article about electric vehicles not catching on with
consumers didn't mention one I have been hoping to see for several
years. It's a sports can manufactured by Zebra Motors in
California. Do you have any information about the car and its
status _ performance, availability, price?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Zeba apparently didn't make it into production. Although
there's a Web site for Zebra Motors _ http://zebramotors.com/ _ and
lots of photos of the handsome car, e-mail messages sent to the
company for information didn't go through, and the telephone number
listed on the Web site reaches a recording saying it no longer is
in service.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has anything about it appeared in the media in several
years, and even then mentions were brief and couched in terms such
as ``a fledgling company'' trying to bring a new product to market.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the recent interest in alternative-fuel vehicles, if
the Zebra had caught on we surely would have heard about it by now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard several people mention an incident that supposedly
occurred a couple of years ago. It involves an American couple
vacationing in Australia who went scuba diving and were mistakenly
left out in the open water by the dive boat. They weren't
discovered missing until several days later, and nothing ever was
found except some diving gear. Is this another urban legend?
</P>
<P>
   A: No urban legend. The incident occurred Jan. 25, 1998, when
Thomas Joseph Lonergan, 33, and Eileen Cassidy Lonergan, 28, of
Baton Rouge, La., went diving off the boat Outer Edge at St.
Crispen Reef, 45 miles northeast of Port Douglas, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   They were among 26 people diving at the reef, but weren't aboard
the vessel when it returned to dock later that day. Crew members
didn't report the couple missing until more than 48 hours later,
after finding their personal items on the boat.
</P>
<P>
   At a preliminary inquest in July 1998, a coroner found that the
Lonergans were left behind and drowned. Their bodies were never
found, and were thought to have been taken by a shark.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1999, a 12-day trial in Australia ended when a jury
found the skipper of the Outer Edge not guilty of manslaughter.
``I'm absolutely shocked,'' said Nancy Weir, Lonergan's sister, in
New Orleans. ``I think it's a terrible injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the RMS in RMS Titanic stand for? How about SS in
SS Minnow?
</P>
<P>
   A: RMS: Royal Mail Steamship. SS: steamship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a newspaper photo of an airplane with its nose to the
ground, the caption said a student pilot was the only person on
board when the nose gear collapsed. Doesn't the FAA require an
instructor to fly with a student pilot?
</P>
<P>
   A: At some point in training a pilot must fly solo. Without
directing her comments toward this particular incident, FAA
spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said it is one of the requirements that
a student pilot must fulfill before earning a private pilot's
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Once the student pilot has received instruction and met certain
proficiency requirements, and has been endorsed by the instructor
to make solo flights, then the student flies alone as the next
step. So there's no impropriety or illegality involved when a
student pilot flies alone.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recent book, ``Flags of Our Fathers,'' briefly mentions a
young Marine, Jack Lucas, who won the Medal of Honor as a
14-year-old on Iwo Jima. The book provides no followup on his life.
Can you provide a brief biography?
</P>
<P>
   A: To clarify one point, Jacklyn Harold Lucas was barely 17 when
his act of ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of
his life above and beyond the call of duty'' occurred on Iwo Jima.
He was 14 _ he lied about his age _ when he enlisted.
</P>
<P>
   It was on Feb. 20, 1945, when the Marine Corps private and three
other men were ambushed by an enemy patrol that attacked them at
Iwo Jima with rifle fire and grenades. Lucas saved the others by
hurling himself atop a grenade, then pulling another one under his
body, absorbing the blasting forces. He suffered wounds to his
chest, right arm and hand, right thigh, neck and chin that required
months of hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   President Truman, who conferred the Medal of Honor on Lucas,
later helped him get a job with the Veterans Administration in
Winston-Salem, N.C. Lucas finished high school and college and
pursued several business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he enlisted in the Army, saying he was eager to go to
Vietnam, but was assigned to train troops at Fort Bragg, N.C. He
was discharged as a captain in 1965. He was married three times.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, Lucas was one of the heroes President Clinton
introduced during the State of the Union address, and he was in the
news again last month when he joined several other Medal of Honor
winners participating in the National D-Day Museum opening in New
Orelans.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, 72, lives in Hattiesburg, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I received a call from someone who claimed to be with the
Census Bureau asking more questions than were on our original form.
We were told that if we didn't answer by the 14th time we were
called, we would be arrested. Is this a scam from someone or some
organization trying to get information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mary Vetter of the U.S. Census Bureau said that while
responding to the census was mandatory, she didn't know anything
about any arrest threats, ``and for nonresponding households, we
called three times and visited three times to obtain the
information.''
</P>
<P>
   She did say, however, that several census ``operations'' are
continuing, including the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation Survey,
a follow-up to the 2000 Census intended to see if anyone was missed
or counted twice; and the American Community Survey, which will be
used to provide accurate, up-to-date profiles of American
communities every year.
</P>
<P>
   If there's uncertainty about the legitimacy of a caller claiming
to represent the Census Bureau, call your local office of the
bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article said video poker machines were being banned in
South Carolina. I enjoyed playing the machines at Harrah's Cherokee
Casino. Are they banned, too?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Harrah's Cherokee Casino is on a tribal reservation in
western North Carolina. Its video poker operations are not affected
by South Carolina's laws. Information: 1-800-427-7247.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you explain why Kenyans always seem to do so well in
marathons and 10Ks? Do they have some kind of special training or
diet? Are they tested for steroid use?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kenyans, and other East Africans, certainly do well. The
perennial success of the Kenyans in running has nothing to do with
drug use or gene pools or anything like that, in the view of Julia
Emmons, director of Atlanta's Peachtree Road Race and the Atlanta
Track Club.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a combination of factors makes many of them superb
athletes, she said, including ``a rugged existence and challenging
life'' from childhood, in which youngsters typically run back and
forth from school, with no motorized transportation available; an
intense focus on this one sport, compared to many countries in
which gifted athletes can choose from a number of sports; and an
``extraordinary work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's altitude also is a factor. That aspect is a draw for
American runners who go there to train. ``But it's attitude, more
than altitude, that makes the Kenyans great runners,'' Emmons said.

<P>
   The first windows were holes in the walls that allowed an
exchange of stagnant interior air with fresh outdoor air. Since
they also allowed heat to escape they were probably small and
covered with cloth, reed mats or leather. With the introduction of
glass panes, windows became larger to let light in and provide a
view. These windows had to be custom made for each house. Yet they
were not well sealed, and they let cold drafts inside during the
winter months. Still a window was a valuable commodity and in
Colonial times, homeowners would remove their windows and take them
along when they moved to a new house.
</P>
<P>
   Today, windows are mass produced from durable weather-resistant
materials. They come in a variety of styles and sizes. This makes
it easy to replace a worn, outmoded window when it starts to
deteriorate or change to a more stylish window when you want to
remodel.
</P>
<P>
   If you are simply replacing an old window, then you will
probably choose a new window of the same style, size and shape. If,
however, you are remodeling, then there are other options you may
want to consider.
</P>
<P>
   You could, for example, reposition a window to reflect the
daylight that is coming into the room. Do this by moving the window
closer to an adjacent perpendicular wall. The wall then becomes a
reflector that bounces the light at a different angle from the
incoming rays of the sun. This brightens the room by removing
shadows and at the same time tends to diminish the difference
between the interior and exterior, thus creating the illusion of a
larger living space.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, if you move the window away from the adjacent wall,
less light is reflected and a dark area develops in the corner.
This creates a cooler, more subdued atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The size of windows can also affect the mood of the interior.
Large windows in a room admit a lot of light, provide a view of the
outside and brighten a room. But overly large windows may offer too
much of a good thing. They can create a feeling of agoraphobia and
destroy the intimacy of the room. It's best to install large
windows in sunrooms and activity rooms, and smaller windows in
libraries, dens and formal dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   You can also group different size windows into an overall
composition that becomes the focal point in a room. One large
window can have a row of smaller windows on either side; or a
rectangular window frame may be topped with a semi-circular fan
window. Beware of having too many window combinations around the
house. It is best to place a single large window composition in the
main room and use similar but smaller patterns in the other rooms.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to replace your old windows with new ones, you may
be surprised at number of options available. First there are five
basic window styles to choose from: Double hung, casement, awning,
gliding and fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The double-hung window is still the most popular style. It
consists of two sashes that slide up and down in a frame. Casement
windows have sashes that are hinged at the top and bottom. They
swing out (like a door) by means of a crank mechanism. Awning
windows have sashes that are hinged at the top. They swing outward
from the bottom and when open resemble a storefront awning. Gliding
windows contain two sashes that slide horizontally in tracks in the
frame. Fixed windows cannot open and are installed to provide a
view (like picture windows) or as decorative accents (like oval or
circular windows).
</P>
<P>
   Besides selecting a style, you will want to choose windows that
are durable and resistant to the onslaughts of the weather. Windows
with metal frames are especially rugged, but some homeowners find
they lack the warmth and elegance of wood frames. Many
manufacturers offer windows made of wood but with exterior surfaces
clad in maintenance-free vinyl or aluminum. Aluminum- or vinyl-clad
windows will cost more than windows made of wood, but they will
help save time and money that would be used later to scrape and
repaint wooden sashes.
</P>
<P>
   Modern windows are more energy efficient than older windows. In
the past, no matter how well the sashes were sealed around the
jambs, some heat was lost through the glass. Now manufacturers
offer windows with thermal panes _ essentially an envelope of glass
_ filled with inert argon gas.
</P>
<P>
   They also apply a low-E coating to the surface of the glass; it
adds even more insulation value to the window. The low-E coating
acts like an invisible two-sided mirror that reflects heat in
either direction. During the summer, it reflects the hot rays from
sun to keep them from entering the house. In the winter, the glass
contains the house heat and helps keep fuel bills down.

<P>
   Q: It was reported that the Lower Snake River Navigation in
Idaho is No. 7 on a list of 10 worst Army Corps of Engineers
projects. How is the Corps of Engineers involved, since the Lower
Snake River is under the Bureau of Reclamation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Four dams on the Lower Snake River were built in the 1960s
and '70s by the Corps of Engineers for multipurpose benefits, said
Jerry Gregg of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's Pacific Northwest
Region. These dams are managed by the Corps of Engineers. The
Bureau of Reclamation doesn't have any facilities on this stretch
of the river.
</P>
<P>
   According to Taxpayers for Common Sense and the National
Wildlife Federation, which produced the list of ``Troubled Waters
Top 10,'' the Corps spends about $32 million each year relating to
the four dams to subsidize navigation. The two organizations, which
endorse retiring the dams, say that they're the major cause of the
decline of five endangered species of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does one submit a name for consideration for a MacArthur
Foundation ``genius grant''?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you mean how do people apply for themselves, that isn't
possible. Applications for fellowships are neither solicited nor
accepted. That was among restrictions imposed by the IRS in
approving the MacArthur Fellows Program.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that the individuals sought as MacArthur
Fellows often don't work in categories established by conventional
funding agencies, so the foundation relies on a network of
nominators to bring those people to its attention.
</P>
<P>
   Nominators invited by the foundation are identified for their
expertise and familiarity with ``exceptionally creative people'' in
their respective fields, the foundation says. It invites a new
group of nominators every year to bring ``fresh perspectives.''
Nominators write a letter to the program director describing the
person being nominated and their reasons for doing so. No one,
obviously, can nominate oneself.
</P>
<P>
   Information online: www.macfdn.org/programs/fel/faq.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A mentioned that Supreme Court vacancies can occur only
when a justice dies, resigns, retires or is removed through
impeachment. Has a justice ever been impeached?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes _ but not removed. A Supreme Court justice can be removed
from office only through impeachment in the House of
Representatives and conviction by two-thirds of the Senate. While
no justice has been removed by impeachment, Justice Samuel Chase
was impeached in 1804 and tried in the Senate on charges of
injudicious behavior. The trial ended in 1805 in an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Two other justices, Abe Fortas and William O. Douglas, have
faced serious attempts at impeachment, but neither was actually
impeached. Fortas resigned in 1969 after some House members laid
plans for an inquiry into charges of financial misconduct. And the
House investigated impeachment charges against Douglas in 1953 and
1970, but rejected the resolutions after subcommittee hearings.
</P>
<P>
   There were scattered calls in the 1950s and '60s for the
impeachment of Chief Justice Earl Warren, but no serious
impeachment effort ever was initiated in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read recently that scientists have discovered something new
that will destroy kudzu without harming the foliage that it clings
to. Can you elaborate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Progress is being made, but don't look for it on the market
in the near future, said Doug Boyette of the Stoneville, Miss.,
Southern Weed Science Research Unit of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   His agency is conducting research to develop plant pathogens as
``bioherbicides'' to control various weeds. One of the fungal
pathogens being developed is Myrothecium verrucaria for controlling
kudzu. It kills leaves and stems of kudzu as well as some other
weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Field test plots reveal that the fungus is highly effective in
controlling this weed, Boyette explained. His agency, meanwhile,
has applied for a patent to use it as a bioherbicide. The material
then will require Environmental Protection Agency registration,
followed by commercial development, before it's available to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   More immediate kudzu control can be accomplished by starving it
(cutting off all foliage for several years in a row) or with such
herbicides as glyphosate (RoundUp) and triclopyr (Brush-B-Gon),
said University of Georgia Extension Service horticulture educator
Walter Reeves. Or you can cut the vine where it emerges from the
ground and paint the stump with either of those chemicals to
minimize resprouting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A report about endangered historic sites mentioned Abraham
Lincoln's Anderson Cottage retreat in Washington. I'm not familiar
with this. Do you have more information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Also known as The Soldiers' Home, Anderson Cottage was
Lincoln's summer residence. He spent one-fourth of his presidency
at the home, and it is where he drafted the Emancipation
Proclamation. It's on the grounds of the 320-acre campus of the
U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home just north of the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1842-43 as the home of George Riggs Jr., the retreat
was bought in 1851 by the federal government to form the core of
the U.S. Soldiers' Home. The 14-room Gothic Revival cottage served
as the summer residence of the Lincoln family from 1862 to 1864. It
later was named after Maj. Robert Anderson, who commanded Fort
Sumter at the outbreak of the Civil War and was an advocate for
establishing a home for soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson Cottage is the only major Lincoln site in the United
States that hasn't been restored, said Richard Moe, president of
the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Donations are
welcome: 202-588-6308 (Sophia Lynn, project manager).
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will the new South Carolina commemorative quarters be
minted? My bank has no information.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Mint says the S.C. coins went to the Federal Reserve on
May 22. A Mint spokeswoman said they should be ``readily
available'' at banks by now. Information online: www.usmint.gov.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read that the military vehicle that came into wide
use in early World War ll was called simply General Purpose. People
used the initials GP, which became ``jeep.'' However, in past years
I also heard that it was a ``peep.'' Could you clear this up?
</P>
<P>
   A: The term ``jeep'' was applied to a rugged, four-wheel-drive,
four-cylinder 1 1/4-ton ( 1/4 ton in carrying capacity) vehicle in
the armored forces of World War II. In those units and forces, a
smaller vehicle was called a ``peep.'' The latter term didn't catch
on, however. When capitalized, Jeep is a trademark for a civilian
automotive vehicle that was patterned after the military forces
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   While some sources say the term jeep derived from GP, another
theory traces the origin to the comic strip ``Popeye.'' It had a
character with extraordinary powers named Eugene the Jeep.

<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported that the Boeing 717-200 is that company's newest
commercial aircraft. But on a recent trip to Paris on a 777-200, we
were told that was the newest. Can you clarify? Also, how big is
the 777? It had the longest wingspan I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   A: The first model of the initial version of the 777-200 was
delivered in May 1995, Boeing says. The first extended-range
version was delivered in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What is the present Boeing 717-200 started life as the MD-95,
introduced by McDonnell Douglas in October 1995. Boeing reassigned
the 717 model designation to it in January 1998, and AirTran
Airways began taking deliveries in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 777-200 has a wingspan of 199 feet, 11 inches, an overall
length of 209 feet, 1 inch, and a passenger capacity of 305-328.
The 717-200 is much smaller: wingspan, 93.3 feet; overall length,
124 feet; capacity, 100-106.

<P>
   Q: Can you tell the many fans of ``The Andy Griffith Show''
about the name of Sheriff Andy's son, Opie? Was it short for
something? Also, was the death of Opie's mother ever mentioned?
</P>
<P>
   A: The story goes that Opie (played by Ronny Howard) was named
for Opie Cates, a prominent bandleader of the '40s-'50s whom Andy
Griffith and producer-director Sheldon Leonard both admired. Opie
Taylor spelled his name that way in two episodes, on the love note
he wrote to Miss Crump in ``Opie Loves Helen,'' and on the board he
burned his name into in ``Barney's Sidecar.''
</P>
<P>
   Opie's mother's death was mentioned first on the pilot for ``The
Andy Griffith Show,'' which appeared on ``The Danny Thomas Show.''
After Opie's pet turtle, Wilford, was stepped on and killed by a
Mrs. Balford in front of an ice cream parlor, Opie wanted Andy to
arrest her for ``murder,'' give her a fair trial, and ``hang her.''
Andy tried to help Opie deal with the loss by talking about how it
was when Opie's ``ma'' died. Opie looked to Andy and said, ``Who
stepped on Ma?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wedding Bells for Aunt Bee,'' Opie asked Andy, ``Did you
and Ma have that kind of love?'' Andy replied, ``Yes, son, we
did.''
</P>

UBS TO BUY PAINEWEBBER IN $10.8 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a half-stock, half-cash deal valued at $10.8 billion, Swiss
investment bank UBS (UBS:NYSE) will buy New York-based PaineWebber
(PWJ:NYSE), the companies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   UBS said it would pay $73.50 a share, a 47 percent premium to
PaineWebber's Tuesday closing price, although the price shot up
over 8 percent on the day on rumors of an imminent takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, UBS will pay half in cash and half
in UBS stock, at a ratio of 0.4954 UBS shares for each PaineWebber
share. Based on Tuesday's closing price, the deal represents a
multiple of 18.1 times PaineWebber's estimated 2000 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Both General Electric (GE:NYSE) and Yasuda Mutual Life,
PaineWebber's two largest shareholders who together own about 30
percent, have entered into agreements with UBS to vote in favor of
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to boost UBS' earnings per share
beginning in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber, the fourth-largest U.S. brokerage, will continue to
operate under its brand name. The deal must still garner approval
from both companies' shareholders, and is expected to close by
November.
</P>
<P>
   The story was originally reported by FT.com Tuesday. The story
was also reported Wednesday by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, PaineWebber announced Wednesday that its
second-quarter earnings beat Wall Street estimates. It said
earnings per share for the quarter that ended June 30 were 95 cents
a share, up 3 cents from the 92-cent Wall Street consensus,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Still, it was a 10.5
percent decrease from last year's second-quarter earnings per share
of $1.02.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its net income was $146.3 million, compared to
$163.5 million in the same period last year. Revenues for the
quarter were $1.411 billion, an increase of 4.7 percent from the
$1.348 billion generated in last year's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the earnings figures were before costs
associated with its merger of J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co, which will bring
final profit figures down $30 million, or 13 cents per share.

 &HT;    DEFIANT ORANGE ORDER SHOWS SOME DIVISIONS OVER PROTESTS
 &HT;    (550&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Their fifes and bass drums
reverberating through the city's shuttered streets, thousands of
members of the Orange Order paraded Wednesday, the climactic day of
the annual rite to celebrate winning a war that ended three
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to avoid a sectarian confrontation, security forces in
the morning installed a massive, drab green steel wall on the
Ormeau Bridge to prevent the Protestant Orangemen from marching
into a hostile Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   When the Orangemen reached the steel wall, they stated their
objections to being permitted to carry on. An Anglican minister,
the Rev. William Hoey, stood in front of the wall to lead the crowd
in the Lord's Prayer _ and an attack on Catholic politicians and
the British government. Many Protestants believe that British
politicians trying to resolve the ancient sectarian dispute have
been siding more often with the minority Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no peace in this land so long as republicanism calls
the shots,'' Hoey said, referring to militant Catholics associated
with the Irish Republic Army. ``We say to the government, take them
on and put them down once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and politicians hope the close of a particularly riotous
marching season will bring an end to a 10-day spasm of violence
that has caused millions of dollars in lost business and reminded
everyone that peace has still not taken hold in this troubled
province.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 80,000 members of the Orange Order marched throughout
the province. Most of the
</P>
<P>
   parades like the ones here in Belfast were uneventful. Thousand
of supporters, many wearing or waving the British Union Jack flag,
lined the routes.
</P>
<P>
   With a police helicopter keeping watch from a gray cloudy sky,
the mood of the crowd was sour. There were few cheers as the crowds
watched the parade of grimly serious men carrying banners and
swords.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot deny that I hate the Catholics _ even though I have
some friends who go to the Pope church _ and now the police too,''
said Charles Moye, a car mechanic who brought his two small
children and their mother to the parade. ``The police should be
with us as we are loyal to the same things they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't letting us March on the queen's road, which is our
sacred right,'' he added. ``All that's happened here that we've all
seen on TV every night is because of the Parades Commission. It's
all on their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years straight, the government's Parades Commission
has forbidden the Protestants from marching through Catholic
neighborhoods. The commission's most controversial decision has
been to forbid the Orange Order from marching into a Catholic
neighborhood in Drumcree near Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   The Drumcree stand-off has become a sacred cause for the
Orangemen, who called for widespread demonstrations against the
decision. These demonstrations evolved into nightly outbursts of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Orange leaders had appealed for protests to stay peaceful but
their pleas fell on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
   Denis Watson, an Orange Order leader, condemned the violence.
``Violence cannot be justified as we have witnessed in recent days,
and it does nothing to enhance the cause of Orange-ism,'' Watson
told a crowd Wednesday. ``Those who wish to infiltrate and attend
the protest for their own ulterior motive have no part to play in
support of the Orange Order.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, riots in Portadown left 21 policemen injured.
Near a bonfire in Larne, north of Belfast, a man was found dead
from gunshot wounds. Police believe he was killed by Protestant
paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Police used water cannons overnight on rioters in Portadown who
rained gasoline bombs, bottles and bricks at security forces near
two Protestant neighborhoods. At one point a home-made pipe bomb
was tossed at security forces.
</P>
<P>
   In an unsettling development, masked guerrillas from the
outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters came out of the shadows near at
least two Belfast bonfires and fired repeated volleys in the air
with handguns and semi-automatic assault rifles. The organization
is supposed to be observing a cease-fire in support of the 1998
Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Sectarian tensions intensify each year in the run-up to July 12,
the anniversary of the day when Protestant William of Orange
triumphed over Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in
1690.
</P>
<P>
   Some moderates within the Orange Order complained their
provocative protests made the violence inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wear my (Orange) collarette with the pride I used to,
not when I see people blocking roads with pipes in their hands,''
William Brown, a one-time senior Belfast Orangeman, told the
Associated Press.

   VIETNAM-U.S.-TRADE (Undated) _ After more than four years of

   PAGO PAGO, American Samoa _ On this remote South Pacific island,
the students at Pago Pago Elementary School put on a show each year
of traditional songs and dances to raise money for school
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   One year, with the money that parents and relatives stuffed into
the students' costumes as they sang and danced, the school bought a
portable public address system. This year's goal, the school
principal, Evelyn Bowles-Weilenman, said, is a new drinking
fountain.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one addition to the school's resources that the
parents have not had to help pay for _ 25 computers, housed in one
of the few air-conditioned rooms on the run-down campus of
screen-walled buildings on the main island of Tutuila. The
computers are hooked by satellite to a high-speed line in Hawaii.
This on an island where it can take up to six months to get a phone
line installed.
</P>
<P>
   The project was financed with nearly $4 million in grants from
the E-rate program of the U.S. government. It connects every public
and private school and library on this group of islands, providing
an example of the way the program has brought a small and remote
educational system into the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   From Pago Pago to major cities in the continental United States
to Aniak, Alaska _ a town accessible only by air _ the Clinton
administration is pushing to meet its goal of connecting every
classroom to the Internet. As the program enters its third year,
nearly $4 billion has been awarded to schools and libraries in the
United States and in territories like Puerto Rico and American
Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of last year, 95 percent of the nation's public
schools had at least one site with Internet access, and 63 percent
of all classrooms had been wired, according to the Federal
Communications Commission, which oversees the program.
</P>
<P>
   The E-rate was nearly defeated by Republican lawmakers, who
called it the ``Gore tax'' because Vice President Al Gore had
championed the program, which imposed a fee on long-distance
telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   While the issue had threatened to dog Gore in the presidential
campaign, the political firestorm has largely been extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gore touts the success of the E-rate as he campaigns, and
Texas, the state of his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush,
has put together a $1.5 billion Telecommunications Infrastructure
Fund to spread Internet access to schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to attack success,'' said William Kennard, the
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   While the political rhetoric has slowed, there are still
questions from educators and research groups about the value of
having computers in every classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for teachers and students in far-flung places like
American Samoa _ a small group of islands just south of the equator
with a population of about 65,000, about half way between Hawaii
and Australia _ the program has been a lifeline of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 1,000 Internet-connected computers in the 46
schools and one public library in American Samoa, all bought with
E-rate funds and other federal grants. Two years ago, there were
only 89 computers in the schools, said Russ Aab, grants coordinator
and technology supervisor for the territory's Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Aab said, 500 more computers will be
added, meaning each of the territory's 900 classrooms will have a
computer with Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of curriculum, it has brought it to life,''
Bowles-Weilenman said. ``Pago elementary has participated in a
number of video teleconferences. We are currently working with
other schools to develop problems which will be solved by schools
in various parts of the world to learn how similar problems are
solved depending on geographic region.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has also provided a wealth of information for the
schools, which have few traditional library resources.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Southworth, an eighth grader at Pago Pago Elementary,
said her class used the Internet to learn about protecting the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to researchers, and we got to ask questions about
the ocean,'' Tiffany said, ``how to protect the ocean and save the
animals and plants.''
</P>
<P>
   The school also has a ukulele band that performs for schools in
the United States via the Internet as part of their social studies
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as important as the doors the Internet has opened
for students are the opportunities it offers teachers, many of whom
are not certified. With the reliable high-speed line, they can more
easily participate in online continuing education programs through
universities in Hawaii and California.
</P>
<P>
   At Taputapu elementary in a remote spot on the island of
Tutuila, the principal, Donna Gurr, said children often stay after
school to use the computers to communicate with friends and
relatives in the States. And sometimes they bring in their parents,
few of whom have computers at home.
</P>
<P>
   Before the high-speed line was connected, she said, the school
had only one computer. And because of the island's poor phone
service, connections were difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the benefits the program has brought, the
principals and teachers face the same challenges as educators
around the United States who are trying to incorporate technology
into their curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles-Weilenman this spring lost her computer laboratory
teacher to the island's new library. And Gurr's computer teacher
left for a job at the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, there is no curriculum or lesson plan teachers can
follow,'' Bowles-Weilenman said. ``This to me is our greatest
weakness. Often times, computer instructors rely on games, though
educational ones, which rely solely on students' interaction, not
creativity or production.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bowles-Weilenman _ who is the daughter of one of the first
teachers on the island who participated in another federally
financed experiment, bringing certified teachers to village schools
via television _ said she and others are working to overcome that
problem.
</P>
<P>
   She has conducted several Internet workshops for principals and
teachers on the island, she said. And she and a group of teachers
are developing lesson plans that can be used at various grade
levels.
</P>
<P>
   How to incorporate technology into schools could become the
spinoff political battle. President Clinton recently announced $128
million in grants to help train teachers on computers. House
Republicans, however, have opposed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, meanwhile, said the program is ``the most revolutionary
thing to happen to education in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is traveling, he said, he likes to visit schools that
are benefiting from the program.
</P>
<P>
   On one visit, to a poor school district in Newark, N.J., he
recalled sitting with a 9-year-old boy named John who had never
used a computer before.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he showed John how to get on the Internet, then
took him to the commission's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What do you think of this?''' Kennard recalled. ``He
said, `It's boring.' So I took him to some Martin Luther King sites
and started surfing around.
</P>
<P>
   ``His face just lit up. He said: `It's so cool. It's so fast.
It's so much better than books.'''

WAGING A BATTLE AGAINST INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Idaho, Ore., Ill.)   By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 14 years as an agent for the Allstate Insurance Co., Gene
Romero thought he had mastered the art of keeping quiet. When the
company required him to work weekends, he says, he did not
complain. When it cut back on office help and had him do his own
paperwork, he uttered no protest. At 51, Romero thought that his
silence would pave the way to an easy retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The job had been a good one. Though most insurance companies
have long relied on independent contractors to sell their policies,
Allstate was among the few to hire agents as employees with
benefits, arousing a fierce loyalty from its sale force.
</P>
<P>
   But, last November, Romero, in Kansas City, Mo., and about 6,000
other employee agents were told that their jobs would be terminated
on June 30, their benefits canceled and their pensions frozen. They
could stay with Allstate and earn higher commissions, but only as
independent contractors who paid their own expenses, got no
benefits and could be dismissed at any time. Or they could leave,
taking a severance package or selling their business to fellow
agents. In all cases, the agents had to waive their rights to sue
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Romero signed the waiver and sold his business. But all he could
think about, he says, was how difficult it would be to find a new
job with the same security and perquisites. ``I felt betrayed,'' he
said. ``Ever since I have been with Allstate, they've always said
the agent is the backbone of the company, but now they've changed
their story.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Romero filed a complaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission over the waiver, starting a feud that has
spread around the country. Since then, at least 50 agents have
filed similar complaints, contending that Allstate, the nation's
second-largest insurance company after State Farm, violated federal
law by forcing them to surrender their civil rights to keep their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has yet to rule, but it calls the number of
complaints fairly large and cause for concern, considering how
rarely unhappy employees overcome fear of repercussion and take
action.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is the latest skirmish in a long-simmering conflict
over the use of independent contractors in the American workplace.
The practice has long been scrutinized by the Internal Revenue
Service because it enables businesses to escape payroll taxes, and
labor unions attack it as a means for employers to evade benefits
like pensions, sick pay and paid vacations.
</P>
<P>
   But independent contractors have become an increasingly popular
option for businesses in recent years, in part because Congress
pressured the IRS to scale back its 20 restrictions governing their
use.
</P>
<P>
   After paying severance packages and higher commissions, Allstate
says the move is actually costing the company money. As independent
contractors, though, agents will be free from the many restrictions
typically imposed on employees, the company says, allowing them
greater flexibility in an increasingly competitive marketplace that
has been recast by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The disgruntled agents, Allstate adds, are but a small fraction
of the thousands who have stayed with the company. Hundreds of
agents were so bullish on their prospects that they bought out
departing employees, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not investing large sums of money into a company
that they are not happy about,'' said Barry L. Hutton, a vice
president for sales for Allstate, which is based in Northbrook,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But many agents say they agreed only reluctantly to remain, in
hopes of preserving careers that span 10 to 20 years or more. To
them, the waiver represents the collapse of a relationship that was
once the envy of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went with a company that I thought would be there for me,''
said Leanne McCurley, 52, an agent of 17 years in Brookings, Ore.,
who also filed an EEOC complaint. Before joining the company,
McCurley read employee surveys indicating a 99 percent satisfaction
rate among Allstate agents. Skeptical, she herself interviewed
about 20 agents, all of whom poured out praise for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Morale only rose in the mid-1980s after Allstate ventured beyond
its box-like booths at Sears department stores to set up
neighborhood branches. With allowances provided by Allstate, agents
could rent offices, advertise and build their own customer bases
with virtual autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like having your own business, but completely without
the risk,'' said Dick Roberts, 54, who left the company in May
after 26 years in Lewiston, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   But the office allowance remained flat, agents contend, and as
inflation drove their costs up, many began dipping into their own
pockets. Then, Allstate began cutting back on its support staff,
leaving agents to take up the paperwork slack. Some brought in
their spouses to help at no pay. Others hired staff at their own
expense.
</P>
<P>
   To recoup costs, many agents began deducting the expenses on
their income tax returns, a common practice for independent
contractors. But in 1998 the IRS ordered them to stop the practice
to retain their status as employees.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say that the productivity of its employee
agents began to fall at that point. Without the flexibility to
invest in their businesses, the agents could no longer compete with
Allstate's corps of about 9,000 independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster sales, Allstate then ordered offices to be open for
set hours every day except Sunday, putting a huge burden on agents
who worked alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went to lunch and closed my office, if I went on
vacation, if I was sick and couldn't go to work, I was told I would
be fired,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing tensions, many agents say they remained with the
company for fear of losing their benefits, especially their
pensions, since most of them are over 45.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pensions are frozen, meaning that the accounts accrue no
interest or additional contributions from the company. Nor can
employees take the money and invest it elsewhere until after they
turn 65.
</P>
<P>
   Some agents also say that the new commissions are lower than the
industry average and hardly offset the cost of going into business
for themselves. ``We were in good hands up until now,'' McCurley
said. ``Then somebody dropped us.''

&HT;     14-YEAR-OLD'S DIARY DEEMED ADMISSIBLE IN NEW RAPE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A former university student who spent nearly two
years in prison for a rape he has denied committing has been
granted a new trial by an appellate court that said the jury should
have heard evidence from the alleged victim's diary.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling made public Tuesday, California's 1st District Court
of Appeal said the diary might have undermined the credibility of
the young woman whose testimony sent Brendan Loftus to prison.
</P>
<P>
   In one diary entry, written more than nine months after the
alleged rape, the 14-year-old described a recent sexual encounter
and said she was ``no longer innocent.'' The court said the jury
could have interpreted that language to mean she had just lost her
virginity and had not been raped previously.
</P>
<P>
   Loftus was 23 and a senior at the University of California at
Berkeley, with no criminal record, at the time of the incident at
Konocti Harbor in Lake County, Calif., during the July 4 weekend in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman identified by the court as Melissa F. testified
that Loftus and another UC-Berkeley student, Arvind Balu, had raped
her in a motel room where she and some friends were staying. Balu
was also convicted and is appealing separately.
</P>
<P>
   Loftus testified he had left the room before any attack
occurred. Two women testified Loftus had been with them at an
outdoor swimming pool all afternoon, including the time Melissa
said she was raped.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Robert Crone denied a defense request to
let the jury hear about Melissa's March 1997 diary entry in which
she said she had just had sex with a friend, was ``no longer
innocent'' and feared she was pregnant. Crone said the evidence was
irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Loftus was sentenced to five years in prison but was freed on
bail last
</P>
<P>
   September after the appeals court said the diary was relevant to
the case and ordered Crone to reconsider its admissibility.
</P>
<P>
   However, after a hearing at which Melissa reaffirmed her account
of
</P>
<P>
   rape and said the word ``innocent'' referred to consensual sex,
Crone again
</P>
<P>
   ruled the diary inadmissible and reinstated Loftus' conviction.
In its 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the appeals court said he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Melissa's original testimony against Loftus as
``vague, uncertain and self-contradictory,'' the court said that
``the diary entry could have raised a reasonable doubt about
exactly what happened in the motel room.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion by Presiding Justice Gary Strankman also noted that
the prosecutor had argued that Melissa's emotional distress at the
time of the trial tended to prove she had been raped. The diary
entry, which showed her confusion and anguish shortly before she
told police she was raped, would have allowed the defense to offer
an alternative explanation, Strankman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Loftus was entitled to offer evidence of the diary at a
new trial. But Loftus' appellate attorney, Dennis Riordan, said
Lake County prosecutors should drop the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the diary is admitted, as it always should have been, the
case is untriable because it shows (Loftus) is innocent,'' Riordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy District Attorney Jon Hopkins said his office had not
decided on its next step.

NASHVILLE NETWORK NOT JUST COUNTRY, ANYMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when the Nashville Network was all about music?
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the transition will be pretty much complete when TNN
_ please don't call it The Nashville Network _ wrestles away from
USA Network the highest-rated weekly series on cable.
</P>
<P>
   Yup. TNN is the new home of WWF, the World Wrestling Federation,
and with a remarkably straight face, Brian Hughes, vice president
of programming for TNN, says that while the direction of the
network has changed, ``we haven't departed from any of those brand
elements the network had previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Okeydokey. Whatever you say, Mr. Hughes. Except anyone looking
for Crook and Chase will have to be content with smash and grab
from now on.
</P>
<P>
   TNN's metamorphosis, which began last year after CBS acquired
the channel, has since been hastened by CBS's merger with Viacom,
which now throws TNN (and sister channel CMT) into the MTV Networks
family with MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon and TV Land. Indeed, WWF's new
five-year deal with CBS/Viacom has Monday night's ``Raw Is War''
and the weekend morning shows ``Livewire'' and ``WWF Superstars''
airing on TNN, while ``Sunday Night Heat'' moves to MTV in October.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about chasing the young male viewing demographic, the
new darling of broadcasters, narrowcasters and flycasters. That
means more ``high-energy'' sports and sports/entertainment shows on
TNN, plus a continuation of testosterone-soaked series like old
``Starsky &AMP; Hutch'' reruns and new ``18 Wheels of Justice''
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the $28.6 million WWF deal wouldn't be possible if
TNN weren't part of a huge company. Although its subscriber base _
nearly 77 million households in the United States, 6.3 million in
Canada _ puts it among the 10 largest cable channels, TNN's
audience lagged behind as long as it was rooted in programming
preferred by older viewers. Last year, in terms of viewership, it
ranked 12th.
</P>
<P>
   USA Network, the top-rated cable operation in prime time, lost
the WWF franchise when a court said it failed to match CBS/Viacom's
bid. The matter is still in litigation, so USA Cable president
Stephen Chao wouldn't comment yesterday on the half-nelson being
administered by TNN, other than to say: ``With or without WWF,
we're forging forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 20 years old, TLC _ please don't call it The Learning
Channel _ will never be confused with MTV or VH1. But knowing that
music can be a powerful educator and motivator, the Discovery
Channel sibling leaped at the chance to present ``Stand and Be
Counted,'' a four-hour documentary about raising consciousness
through music.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by activist/musician David Crosby and scheduled to air
Aug. 22 and 23 at 9 p.m., the special looks at music and the
artists behind it who have worked for social change. It grew out of
a book, also titled ``Stand and Be Counted,'' that Crosby and David
Bender wrote about the artists and causes that changed America.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring performances by and interviews with dozens of artists,
from The Weavers to Jewel, from Bob Dylan to Bob Marley, ``Stand
and Be Counted'' traces the origins of protest music and follows
along as the torch is passed to the next generation of musical
messengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more powerful in the world than an idea,''
Crosby said, ``and the idea of a human being doing exemplary acts
of humanity inspires other people. ... If you believe in something
strongly enough, and you are willing to stand up for what you
believe in, it will affect people around you in a ripple that
spreads out. You can affect the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Game-show mania isn't dead yet. ESPN is tooling up a quiz show
for sports nuts (more on that tomorrow), and even The History
Channel has succumbed. In the wake of its ``Great American History
Quiz,'' which will continue as a quarterly special, History Channel
will introduce ``History IQ'' on Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at the history buff with a mind for arcana, the half-hour
show is scheduled to air daily at 7:30 p.m., directly opposite
``Jeopardy!'' in the Seattle area and many other markets around the
country.

 &HT;    Recognize slave labor in Capitol construction, congressmen urge
 &HT;    By Miriam A. Garcia
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The payroll stub from the late 1700s documented the
$5 the U.S. Department of Treasury paid Joseph Forest for work on
the U.S. Capitol building.
</P>
<P>
   Only the $5 wasn't for work done by Forest. It was for work done
by his slave. Forest's servant was one of 400 enslaved African
Americans, between 1792 and 1800, who helped build the Capitol
while their masters received the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the Capitol Wednesday, several congressmen stood
beside an enlarged copy of Forest's payroll stub and called for
recognizing the contributions of African American slaves in the
construction of the historic building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should take the history books and add another page,'' said
Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Watts and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., introduced a resolution
Wednesday that calls for the creation of a task force to study the
history and contributions of slaves in constructing the nation's
``most prized symbol of freedom.'' The congressmen hope the task
force will recommend the construction of a monument in the Capitol
building to honor the slaves whose efforts have been ignored by
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find a fitting and lasting memorial for these men
in the building they built,'' said Lewis. ``It is strange and very
sad that the men that laid the very foundation of the best known
symbol of our democracy were denied the right to participate in our
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution follows a report from Washington's NBC Channel 4
reporter, Edward Hotaling, documenting the role African American
slaves played in building the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation would like to see this type of
recognition spread throughout the country. Rep. Jack Kingston,
R-Ga., held a deteriorated book in his hand and said there are
missing chapters in history books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today in Savannah, Georgia, we do not have a monument to our
African American heritage,'' Kingston said. ``Once we can rewrite
this chapter in history without fear and preservation, but with
openness and honesty on a bipartisan and biracial basis, then we
can go back to the cities and say ... slave contributions are all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts said ``it is time to recognize the people who made that
possible'' this year during the bicentennial celebration of the
arrival of Congress in the District.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's resolution comes four weeks after Rep. Tony Hall,
D-Ohio, and Lewis co-sponsored a resolution calling on Congress to
apologize for America's role in slavery.

CHRIS ISAAK DOES A GOOD, GOOD THING WITH NEW TV SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKI TURNER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA Calif. _ Speak of the devil.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Isaak, best known for talents in the recording studio, has
joined the ranks of ``reality'' television. The man who penned
``Baby Did a Bad, Bad Thing'' and ``Speak of the Devil'' has
decided to get real with a self-titled show that will premiere on
Showtime in December.
</P>
<P>
   Although it tips its hat to lava-hot shows like ``Survivor'' and
``The Real World,'' ``The Chris Isaak Show'' won't feature the rock
star getting voted off an island or sharing his San Francisco flat
with 20 strangers. Instead, it will provide viewers with an
up-close and personal look at this mad, mad rocker doing a good,
good thing. Namely, following a script. Well, at least most of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer and writer Andrew Schneider, who spoke
Saturday at the annual Television Critics Association gathering,
said the show is an almost-real behind-the-music look at the life
of a prolific rock icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's not a documentary show,'' Schneider says.
``It is not following Chris Isaak around with a camera. They're
fictional stories _ some of which are based on incidents in his
life. He plays a version of himself. He
doesn't really play himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the real Isaak and the TV Isaak can be
subtle. In real life, Isaak is an avid surfer, so we'll see him
riding some waves. In his fictional life, he's a bumbling idiot who
tries to make a dead rabbit appear alive with his blow dryer.
(Believe it or not, the rabbit act makes sense, in a twisted kind
of way.)
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the mix, members of Isaak's real-life band _ Kenney
Dale Johnson, Hershel Yatovitz, Rowland Salley _ and a motley crew
of created characters will also be featured.
</P>
<P>
   It all seems to be working out exactly the way Isaak imagined,
meaning that the rocker and his gang are going where no rock band
has gone before _ at least on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're church people, so we know we're going to have
kind of a family values show,'' Isaak said just before he and his
band performed an impromptu gospel hymn called ``Tell Me When Was
Jesus Born'' via satellite at a news conference Saturday. Then he
deadpanned, ``But on the same hand _ or not on the same hand ... we
also want to make sure we delve into ... bestiality right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Isaak bypasses the chance to sully rock 'n' roll's image
by going there, his would still be one of the most talked-about
shows on display at this year's gathering, which is the TV
industry's annual opportunity to present its wares to a captive
News media audience. Which seems to be as much a surprise to Isaak
as to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime ``came to me and they said, `Chris, you have relatively
little or no talent,' '' Isaak said with a smile. ``Well, they
actually didn't say that. They just said, `You have no talent.' And
they said maybe rock 'n' roll wasn't the place for me. Maybe TV was
where I'd be better used.''
</P>
<P>
   So Isaak loaded up his boys and headed for the hills of San
Francisco, where the series will be shot. Showtime has ordered 17
episodes. Although the show is based on his life, and Isaak hints
that some of it will be made up as they go along, he says they
aren't trying to take advantage of the present reality-TV craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to copy or kind of hop on (that) bandwagon,''
he said. ``Although every week we do vote out one'' band member.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Isaak says, he plans on taking full advantage of his
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you know, they're going to script it so that for the
first time I will be leading a normal life,'' Isaak, who is also an
executive producer, deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Although it might appear that the San Francisco native got his
start at the Comedy Store, Isaak actually gained minor fame as a
semipro boxer before launching his music career in the mid-'80s
with his first album, ``Silvertone and Chris Isaak.'' His sultry
blend of rock and pop quickly caught on in the Bay Area, where he
was a favorite at Folsom Street clubs such as Boz Scaggs' Bimbo's.
</P>
<P>
   His breakthrough came in 1989, with the hit single ``Wicked
Game,'' from his ``Heart-Shaped World'' CD. He quickly followed
that with ``San Francisco Days'' and ``Forever Blue.'' He released
his next effort, ``Baja Sessions,'' in 1996. In the middle of all
of that, Isaak began moonlighting as an actor, appearing in such
films as ``Married to the Mob,'' ``Silence of the Lambs'' and
``That Thing You Do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of his successes, a few folks have never heard the
name Chris Isaak. But television being the powerful medium that it
is, that might just change soon. Isaak says he's ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I figure more people will know me, but you know, I'm not
breaking any laws or anything,'' he says. ``It's not like I'm
running from the cops, so I'm really not worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But how does he think his peers in the music industry might
react?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're musicians, you know,'' Isaak says. ``They'll see it
and they'll go, `How are you here? I saw you on TV.' We'll be lucky
if they don't take a little hammer and break it open and try and
take us out of the set.''

<P>
   When Ann Strawser's son graduated from high school, after
working in many fast-food restaurants, he concluded that he and his
mother should go into the restaurant business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought my potato salad, meatloaf, ham loaf and chocolate
cake with whipped buttercream frosting would make it go,'' the
Arlington, Texas, mother wrote in an e-mail message. ``But after
cooking for a husband and five kids for so many years, the last
thing I wanted to do was go into the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to a break.''
</P>
<P>
   But her meatloaf is apparently legendary. When her son finished
school and went out on his own, she recalled, the family could
always tell when he had a new girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   He would call home to get new copies of his mom's recipes after
the old girlfriend absconded with them.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people call Strawser for her meatloaf recipe, although
it used to be a regular item on the back of the Quaker Oats boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Strawser said even one of her own daughters called from Ohio in
a panic one day when she reached for the Quaker Oats box and
realized that the recipe was no longer there. Fortunately, Mom had
it written down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among my friends, mostly in Arlington Newcomers, the word has
gotten around and I think most of them, by now, have gotten their
copy of the recipe,'' she said. ``They asked me why I didn't submit
it for the cookbook that we did a few years ago, but I didn't
realize then what poor excuses for meatloaf other people had.''
</P>
<P>
   The topping is a personal addition, she said, and is what the
kids really like. It must be the ketchup thing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently made a meatloaf for friends who have a boy _ about
8 years old _ and he was `very skeptical,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But after trying a few bites, he ``ate three pieces and asked
his mom not to eat the leftovers'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were home in Ohio for our spring visit, the kids were
discussing what foods they grew up on, and this meatloaf was the
one thing they remembered most,'' she concluded.
</P>
<P>
   They also remembered the potato salad, which was the reason for
the e-mail to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   In the last column, I talked about the picnic dish _ some likes
and dislikes _ and the response was fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Potato Head,'' the more vitriolic correspondences began.
They went down from there. Others, more kindly folks, offered new
recipes. Some even invited me over for a taste.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Strawser e-mailed me about her mother's potato salad: ``Our
family thinks the `only' kind is Grandma Jones','' she wrote. ``We
are from Ohio and don't care for the mashed potato salad that is so
popular here.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawser went on to explain that the secret to her mother's
potato salad was to pour a hot dressing over the potatoes to bring
out the flavor of the celery seed and onion.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't dare alter the potato salad recipe, she said, but
did recently consider a change to the meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been tempted to alter it but, this week when I
saw Martha Stewart make one with shredded carrots in it, I thought
I might try that,'' she said. ``Actually, I have made it with V8
juice and that was good.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Zinnias peak when other blooms fade
 &HT;    By Diana Blowers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ They may be at the end of alphabetical listings
of annuals, but zinnias are at the top of the list when it comes to
garden appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In late summer, when other flowers are fading, zinnias are just
reaching their peak, blooming into October. They grow 6 inches to 4
feet tall and come in every color but blue. Their blooms range from
buttonlike heads and daisylike flowers to double blossoms that
resemble dahlias. They are American natives, originating as a
purplish wildflower from the Southwest United States, Mexico and
Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Z. elegans, known as the common zinnia, offers single and double
flower heads 1 to 7 inches across in multi- and solid colors. Z.
angustifolia produces single, daisy-like golden-orange blooms on
plants with very narrow leaves. Z. haageana, also known as the
Mexican zinnia, bears 1- to 2-inch single and double flower heads
in tones of red, mahogany, yellow and orange in solid colors and
two-tone variations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of new, improved varieties out, but people
still go with the old standbys, the ones they grew up with. One
that seemed to be popular this year was the `State Fair' mix, which
is a taller variety,'' said Kathy Matousch, a greenhouse supervisor
for the Siebenthaler Co.
</P>
<P>
   Two new zinnias that have received a lot of attention in the
past year are the 1999 All American Selections gold-medal winners
`Profusion Orange' and `Profusion Cherry.'
</P>
<P>
   The National Garden Bureau has declared 2000 as ``The Year of
the Zinnia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Zinnias are very easy to grow from either seed or from started
plants,'' said Nona Koivula, executive director of both All
American Selections and the National Garden Bureau, two nonprofit
organizations that share facilities and staff in Downers Grove,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's mission is to ``disseminate accurate information on
gardening,'' and All American Selections is an organization that
tests and introduces new varieties of flowers and vegetables to the
public, Koivula said.
</P>
<P>
   The two `Profusion' zinnias won gold medals for their prolific
blooming and for their tolerance to diseases that plague zinnias,
including powdery mildew and bacterial leaf spot. Also, unlike most
zinnias, they don't need to be deadheaded to promote continuous
bloom. The `Profusion' zinnias, which produce single-form blooms,
are considered Zinnia interspecific or Z. hybrida because they are
a cross between Z. angustifolia and Z. elegans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really a neat flower. They start blooming earlier
than the others and they just bloom like crazy,'' Matousch said.
They are also on the shorter side, 12 to 18 inches tall, which
makes them a nice plant at the front of the flower border.
</P>
<P>
   All zinnias are susceptible to rust, powdery mildew and leaf
spot if they are grown where there is too much moisture, too much
shade and overcrowding, Matousch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when they are planted too close together, they
don't get a lot of good air movement, and that causes the disease
problems,'' she said. A general fungicide, used early in the
season, often wards off disease problems, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ZINNIA VARIETIES TO CONSIDER
</P>
<P>
   - `Profusion Orange': Single, orange, 2- to 3-inch blooms on 12-
to 18-inch plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Profusion Cherry': Single, rose, 2- to 3-inch blooms on 12-
to 18-inch plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Crystal White': 1997 AAS winner. Single, white blooms with
golden yellow centers that are 1 to 1 1/4 inches wide on 8- to
10-inch plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Border Beauty' series: Semi-double to fully double blooms,
about 3 1/2 inches across on 20-inch plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Peter Pan' series: Slightly curled, double flowers up to 5
inches wide on 12-inch plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Ruffles' series: Ball-shaped, 2 1/2-inch heads with ruffled
petals on 24- to 30-inch-tall plants. These make good cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Thumbelina' mix: 1 1/2- to 2-inch blooms on 10- to 12-inch
plants. Good choice for window boxes and other containers.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Zenith' hybrids: Available in many colors, with cactus-type
flowers on 30-inch-tall plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ `State Fair' mix: Purple, red, yellow and orange 5- to 6-inch
blooms on 30-inch plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Common name: Zinnia.
</P>
<P>
   _ Genus: Zinnia (ZIN-nee-ah).
</P>
<P>
   _ Family: Compositae (daisy family).
</P>
<P>
   _ Plant type: Annual.
</P>
<P>
   _ Size: 6 inches to 4 feet high and 6 inches to 14 inches wide.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bloom season: Summer until frost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Color: All colors except blue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Light: Sun half day or more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Soil: Well-drained, moist to on the dry side.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fertilizer: 5-10-5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pests: Japanese beetle, spider mites, aphids (usually not a
problem).
</P>
<P>
   _ Diseases: Leaf spot, powdery mildew, rust.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some that grow here: Z. elegans (common zinnia), Z.
angustifolia (narrowleaf or classic zinnia, formerly called Z.
linearis), Z. haageana (Mexican zinnia).
</P>
<P>
   _ Propagation: Seed or nursery-grown plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Uses: Beds, borders, edging/hedging, pots and bouquets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Special note: Deadheading increases bloom. Encourage bushiness
by pinching plants when they are young. Cutting blooms for bouquets
also encourages new growth. Water in the morning and avoid wetting
foliage to prevent disease. They last a long time as a cut flower.

<P>
   SHEBAA, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ Like everything else in Lebanon, land
is about history. And in the case of the hot, jagged, grey rocks
above Shebaa, it's about occupation and war and annexation and a
half-century-old trail upon which Jews were once smuggled into
mandate Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Shebaa farms,'' they call these walls of stone and
windswept trees and unkempt fields and _ since they may yet cause
another war in southern Lebanon _ it's as well to visit the little
village of Shebaa where an old man remembers history with the
coldness of a book.
</P>
<P>
   High up above Assad Khalil Farhat's grape-vined roof garden, on
the slopes of Mount Hermon, an Israeli early-warning station winks
at us in the morning sun.
</P>
<P>
   A dish or parabola must be swaying in the hot breeze, for two
great searchlights burn down across the wadis, bright white even in
the midday light.
</P>
<P>
   But Farhat _ the ``mukhtar'' of Shebaa _ is not interested in
technology as he squints through the haze opposite his concrete
home. ``They're on Lebanese land,'' he says. ``And it is our
principle that our land is our honor and our dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Israelis don't want to discuss what the world now
calls the ``Shebaa farms'' or the square miles around them.
</P>
<P>
   How many millions went into building this state-of-the-art
listening station high above us? And how many hundreds of square
dunums lie through the narrow, tree-fringed ravine to the right
where, more than three decades ago, 15,000 Lebanese farmers and
goatherds and fruit-pickers lived and worked?
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis say the land is Syrian, occupied and subsequently
annexed by them after the 1967 war. The Syrians say the land is
Lebanese. So do the Lebanese. And all the evidence suggests the
Lebanese are right.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like everything else in Lebanon, the ``Shebaa farms''
are not quite what they seem; not really farms at all, more like
Irish townlands.
</P>
<P>
   They are 14 parcels of territory worked over for generations by
men and women who were once Ottoman Syrians, then Lebanese, who
kept sheep and goats and cattle and _ when the Israelis took the
land in 1967 _ tried to make the untended fields yield olives and
cactus fruits and prickly pears and almonds on the high, bright
land behind the ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis must leave Shebaa, the Lebanese government say, if
they wish to complete their withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, say the Israelis. And it's true that Israel was
already established on the Shebaa farmlands nine years before its
first ``invasion'' of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you the whole story and I remember what happened,''
Farhat says. ``Before the war between the Palestinians and the Jews
_ when the land up there was the frontier between Palestine and
Lebanon _ there was a smuggling group which took Jews from Damascus
to Palestine. It was 1947 and they used to cross the mountains at
night, using jackasses and mules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to take money from the Jews who wanted to immigrate
illegally into Palestine. Then the Syrian government told the
Lebanese government in Beirut that they wanted us _ the Lebanese _
to close the smuggling trail to stop the Syrian Jews leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Chebaa villagers, Lebanon's first president,
Bishara Khoury, foolishly ignored the Syrian protest _ a fatal
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policemen used to go onto the farms to get taxes but we
couldn't patrol them,'' Farhat says. ``The farms were in Lebanon,
on the edge of the border of Syria and Palestine _ and my father
helped delineate the border; there was an olive tree with two
trunks, one trunk pointed to Syria, the other to Lebanon. That was
the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when Syria got no reply about the Jewish immigration from
our government, it built a police station on the land. The Syrian
policemen who had to stop the Jewish smuggling were put into a
house at Zibdin three kilometers on the Lebanese side of the
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a room which they turned into a gendarmerie and put
up a Syrian flag and over the top of the house. They erected a sign
that said: `The Temporary Police Station of Zibdin.' I saw the sign
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting their way up the Golan Heights in 1967, the Israelis
probably didn't see it _ or if they did, assumed it was Syrian
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from two Lebanese farmers who clung onto their land _
Mohamed Zahara and Ali Abdullah, who remain there to this day _ the
hundreds of other Lebanese farmers were dispossessed by the
Israelis. The Shebaa farms _ ``mazraa'' in Arabic _ were then
annexed, along with the Syrian Golan Heights, to become part of
Israel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Farhat understands the politics of Lebanon all too well, just as
he knows the worth of Shebaa. ``If you sleep for two hours here,''
he says, sniffing the cool mountain air at 6,000 feet, ``you wake
up as if you've been asleep for 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Lebanese government, ``it was its duty to submit a
complaint to the U.N. in 1967 when we lost these lands _ even if
the complaint ended up in a U.N. drawer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, suddenly _ after all those years _ the Shebaa farms
have acquired new importance to the Lebanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli withdrawal cannot be regarded as complete until the
Israelis hand back the Shebaa lands, the Beirut government insists.
The Syrians _ who have never before been so keen to claim that
territory regarded as theirs belonged to someone else _ insist that
the farms are Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   And behind this, as everyone here knows, lies a threat: if
Israel remains on Lebanese land, then the occupation of Lebanon has
not ended and the Hezbollah guerrillas have reason _ if they choose
to do so _ to fire at Israeli troops inside that early warning
station high above us on Mount Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N., needless to say, acknowledges three continued Israeli
infringements of Lebanese territory but says that the problem of
the Shebaa ``farms'' must be resolved in a final Lebanese-Syrian
agreement. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,025, OR CONTINUE TO 1,200) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Up the road from Farhat's home, however, lives a man who
disagrees. Mohamed Mustafa Deli still holds the land deeds to his
father's property on the Shebaa lands, the last of them dated May
28, 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year _ the final full year of Israeli occupation in
southern Lebanon _ the Israelis allowed him a few weeks in every 12
months to work on his old family land: proof, surely that Israel,
too, acknowledges the territory to be Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis gave me a pass and I picked the olives on our
farm and made olive oil from it,'' Deli says. ``The Israelis then
took the pass away when I left to come back to Shebaa village in
October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get my pass to go there from the Israelis in the
Lebanese town of Hasbaya. But now that the rest of the Israeli
occupation has ended, it will be difficult to get that permission.
Maybe I'll never get it again.'' &QL;

<P>
   SHEBAA, SOUTHERN LEBANON _ Like everything else in Lebanon, land
is about history. And in the case of the hot, jagged, grey rocks
above Shebaa, it's about occupation and war and annexation and a
half-century-old trail upon which Jews were once smuggled into
mandate Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Shebaa farms,'' they call these walls of stone and
windswept trees and unkempt fields and _ since they may yet cause
another war in southern Lebanon _ it's as well to visit the little
village of Shebaa where an old man remembers history with the
coldness of a book.
</P>
<P>
   High up above Assad Khalil Farhat's grape-vined roof garden, on
the slopes of Mount Hermon, an Israeli early-warning station winks
at us in the morning sun.
</P>
<P>
   A dish or parabola must be swaying in the hot breeze, for two
great searchlights burn down across the wadis, bright white even in
the midday light.
</P>
<P>
   But Farhat _ the ``mukhtar'' of Shebaa _ is not interested in
technology as he squints through the haze opposite his concrete
home. ``They're on Lebanese land,'' he says. ``And it is our
principle that our land is our honor and our dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Israelis don't want to discuss what the world now
calls the ``Shebaa farms'' or the square miles around them.
</P>
<P>
   How many millions went into building this state-of-the-art
listening station high above us? And how many hundreds of square
dunums lie through the narrow, tree-fringed ravine to the right
where, more than three decades ago, 15,000 Lebanese farmers and
goatherds and fruit-pickers lived and worked?
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis say the land is Syrian, occupied and subsequently
annexed by them after the 1967 war. The Syrians say the land is
Lebanese. So do the Lebanese. And all the evidence suggests the
Lebanese are right.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like everything else in Lebanon, the ``Shebaa farms''
are not quite what they seem; not really farms at all, more like
Irish townlands.
</P>
<P>
   They are 14 parcels of territory worked over for generations by
men and women who were once Ottoman Syrians, then Lebanese, who
kept sheep and goats and cattle and _ when the Israelis took the
land in 1967 _ tried to make the untended fields yield olives and
cactus fruits and prickly pears and almonds on the high, bright
land behind the ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis must leave Shebaa, the Lebanese government say, if
they wish to complete their withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, say the Israelis. And it's true that Israel was
already established on the Shebaa farmlands nine years before its
first ``invasion'' of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you the whole story and I remember what happened,''
Farhat says. ``Before the war between the Palestinians and the Jews
_ when the land up there was the frontier between Palestine and
Lebanon _ there was a smuggling group which took Jews from Damascus
to Palestine. It was 1947 and they used to cross the mountains at
night, using jackasses and mules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to take money from the Jews who wanted to immigrate
illegally into Palestine. Then the Syrian government told the
Lebanese government in Beirut that they wanted us _ the Lebanese _
to close the smuggling trail to stop the Syrian Jews leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Chebaa villagers, Lebanon's first president,
Bishara Khoury, foolishly ignored the Syrian protest _ a fatal
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policemen used to go onto the farms to get taxes but we
couldn't patrol them,'' Farhat says. ``The farms were in Lebanon,
on the edge of the border of Syria and Palestine _ and my father
helped delineate the border; there was an olive tree with two
trunks, one trunk pointed to Syria, the other to Lebanon. That was
the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when Syria got no reply about the Jewish immigration from
our government, it built a police station on the land. The Syrian
policemen who had to stop the Jewish smuggling were put into a
house at Zibdin three kilometers on the Lebanese side of the
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took a room which they turned into a gendarmerie and put
up a Syrian flag and over the top of the house. They erected a sign
that said: `The Temporary Police Station of Zibdin.' I saw the sign
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting their way up the Golan Heights in 1967, the Israelis
probably didn't see it _ or if they did, assumed it was Syrian
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from two Lebanese farmers who clung onto their land _
Mohamed Zahara and Ali Abdullah, who remain there to this day _ the
hundreds of other Lebanese farmers were dispossessed by the
Israelis. The Shebaa farms _ ``mazraa'' in Arabic _ were then
annexed, along with the Syrian Golan Heights, to become part of
Israel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 100 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Farhat understands the politics of Lebanon all too well, just as
he knows the worth of Shebaa. ``If you sleep for two hours here,''
he says, sniffing the cool mountain air at 6,000 feet, ``you wake
up as if you've been asleep for 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Lebanese government, ``it was its duty to submit a
complaint to the U.N. in 1967 when we lost these lands _ even if
the complaint ended up in a U.N. drawer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, suddenly _ after all those years _ the Shebaa farms
have acquired new importance to the Lebanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli withdrawal cannot be regarded as complete until the
Israelis hand back the Shebaa lands, the Beirut government insists.
The Syrians _ who have never before been so keen to claim that
territory regarded as theirs belonged to someone else _ insist that
the farms are Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   And behind this, as everyone here knows, lies a threat: if
Israel remains on Lebanese land, then the occupation of Lebanon has
not ended and the Hezbollah guerrillas have reason _ if they choose
to do so _ to fire at Israeli troops inside that early warning
station high above us on Mount Herman.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After making a brief _ and rare _ public speech at a
lavish luncheon the other day, the Queen Mother asked the guests to
drink a toast their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the event organized at Guild Hall to celebrate the
Queen Mum's upcoming 100th birthday complied by raising a glass.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except the guest of honor, who couldn't find
her wine. After glancing around her place setting at the head
table, the Queen Mum fixed a stare at the archbishop of Canterbury
and pointed at the glass of red wine he clutched in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's mine,'' she said, sweetly but sternly, to the head of
the Anglican Church, who instantly relinquished it to the senior
royal.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were charmed by this moment, which reminded them all
that the plucky matriarch of this country's often troubled,
occasionally unwieldy first family continues on _ a rock in a time
of sometimes wrenching change.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother _ she
demanded the two royal designations in her official title _ will
celebrate her birthday at a quiet family gathering at Clarence
House, her longtime London home. An official celebration will be
held July 19.
</P>
<P>
   At a thanksgiving service for her Tuesday at St. Paul's
Cathedral, George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury who pinched
her wine glass, said her place in the hearts of Britons is secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when such a premium is placed on the young and the
new, it is glorious indeed to be celebrating the birthday of
someone who can help us travel that country called 'life' _ and
someone, indeed, who so fully continues to inhabit it,'' he said.
``For we cherish in you, ma'am, a continuing openness and
responsiveness to people, not just of all backgrounds, but of all
ages.''
</P>
<P>
   After the service the Queen Mum, aided by a walking stick and
handrail erected for her, walked the length of the massive
cathedral and down its 22 front steps. Prince Charles hovered near,
but she walked on her own, smiling demurely at people in the crowd
as she passed.
</P>
<P>
   With her warm smile and spry personality the mother of Queen
Elizabeth II remains by far the most popular royal _ for many the
personification of an ideal of ``British-ness'' that is fading
rapidly in the new century. She has seen two world wars, the
dissolution of an empire and counted among her friends Sir Winston
Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she is most revered for her easy, relaxed style that allows
for a fondness for gin, jokes and race horses.
</P>
<P>
   The country is full of people with memories of her, like a young
Manchester policeman who once guarded her parade route. Peering
into the Queen Mother's car, he noticed that she seemed to be
chewing on something. She saw him staring and the next thing he
knew, she had tossed him a
</P>
<P>
   caramel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other royals, the Queen Mum relishes a good joke with
the press and seems to not take it all so seriously. Lunching with
Queen Elizabeth some years ago, she was reportedly surprised when
her daughter, who normally doesn't drink, ordered some wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you should, dear?'' teased the Queen Mum, who is
known to enjoy a G&AMP;T now and then. ``After all, you have to reign
all afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   She also holds a grudge. Biographies suggest she will never
forgive Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee who King Edward VIII
surrendered his throne to marry. The abdication of her husband's
older brother in 1936 forced him to become King George VI and her
to become queen _ a role she never wanted. She blames Simpson for
her husband's early death in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   She also is said to be annoyed with Jimmy Carter for kissing her
on the lips at a 1977 meeting _ the first man, she complained, to
do so since the death of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The sun had not yet begun to set on the British Empire when she
was born to an aristocratic Scottish family. Elizabeth Angela
Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the ninth child of the Earl and Countess
of Strathmore. The family's Glamis Castle in northeast Scotland is
the legendary home of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
</P>
<P>
   When the First World War started _ coincidentally on her 14th
birthday _ Glamis Castle became a hospital. One of her brothers,
Fergus, was killed at the battle of Loos in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Her family periodically entertained King George V and Queen Mary
and their children _ among them Albert. After twice refusing
Albert, Elizabeth married him in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, the bashful and stuttering Albert became
King George VI.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She became queen in the turbulent pre-war years with the
monarchy severely shaken by the abdication. She is credited with
restoring stability to the royal family and transforming her shy
husband into a people's king.
</P>
<P>
   During Word War II, she became a symbol of Britain, refusing to
leave Buckingham Palace, which was hit nine times by the German
bombers. She ignored then-Prime Minister Churchill's suggestion to
send her daughters Elizabeth _ the future queen _ and Margaret, to
the safety of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children won't go without me,'' she responded. ``I won't
leave the King. And the King will never leave.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She sent the princesses to Windsor Palace outside London. And
with King George she roamed the country in the royal train,
cheering factory workers on, visiting army camps and hospitals, and
inspecting bomb damage.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the prospect of a German invasion, the Queen
learned to use a revolver, practicing on a shooting range
constructed at Buckingham Palace. She and the king went often to
London's frequently bombed East End. She picked her way through the
rubble in high heels to offer
</P>
<P>
   encouragement to East Enders.
</P>
<P>
   After one bombing attack left the palace substantially damaged,
she responded: ``I'm glad we've been bombed. It makes me feel we
can look the East End in the face.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, George died of lung cancer, leaving her a widow at age
51. She moved out of Buckingham Palace to make way for her daughter
and went into seclusion until Churchill cajoled her into returning
to public life.
</P>
<P>
   She still refers to her husband as ``the king'' and declines
public appearances on the anniversaries of his birth, marriage, and
death.
</P>
<P>
   Even now she continues a rigorous public schedule, which she is
said to regard as a sacred duty of her position. Unlike other
royals, she seems to enjoy the regimen of tree plantings, plaque
dedications and visits to old folks homes _ mostly occupied by
people much younger than she is. She has made more than 40 trips
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She always wears pearls, even when salmon fishing in Scotland _
a passion she still enjoys when she's up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mother awakens each morning to the sound of bagpipe
music from her own recorded collection, and reads an assortment of
newspapers before meeting with her private secretary.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasion when she is lunching without family or
friends, she snacks with the staff at Clarence House, her London
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest pleasure comes from horse racing. She is so devoted
to the sport that she had a ``blower,'' a device used by bookmakers
to provide live race commentary, installed in her home.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   She is said to have no intention of retiring after her 100th
birthday. Local newspapers say she has opened discussions on her
role in the bash being planned for the Golden Jubilee of her
daughter's ascending the throne. That would take place in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As she was leaving the recent luncheon in her honor, the Queen
Mum stopped her party to listen as a small group guests began
singing one of her long-time favorite songs, ``If You Were The Only
Girl In The World.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled and urged them to sing louder. The rest of the crowd
joined in as the royal guest of honor beamed in pleasure.

<P>
   SREBRENICA, BOSNIA _ ``I will never forget this plae,'' said
Tima Mehmedovic, trembling on the verge of hysteria. ``It was where
I saw my husband for the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mehmedovic, 47, came Tuesday to a wrecked battery factory
on the outskirts of Srebrenica to mark the fifth anniversary of the
worst war crime in Europe since the Nazi era, and the worst
humiliation that United Nations peacekeepers have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the 3,000 Bosnian Muslims brought in by bus were
women: at this spot five years ago they were separated from their
husbands, brothers and sons, never to see them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by the entrance there they took my husband, Smajl, and my
son, Asmir, and told me to get on a truck to be evacuated,'' said
Mrs. Mehmedovic. ``Then a Serb sent my son back to me. He said: `My
name is Zoran Ilich. Remember I let you both go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asmir had not come Tuesday from Tuzla, where they now live. ``He
is too afraid,'' said his mother, ``but even though this is hard, I
am not scared of anything anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, 1995, the U.N.-declared ``safe area'' of Srebrenica
fell to Serbian troops as several hundred Dutch peacekeepers,
denied reinforcements, stood by helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, 7,000 to 8,000 Muslim men were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   War-crimes investigators have filled 4,700 bags with remains
found on the hillsides around the town or buried in mass graves but
only 80 victims have been identified. Smajl Mehmedovic is not one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``ethnic cleansing'' achieved its aim: Srebrenica is now
deep in the Serbian half of Bosnia and the town's former
inhabitants had to pass Tuesday along roads lined with jeering
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of peacekeeping troops and police were mobilized to
prevent trouble at the ceremony, which was purely religious,
despite the presence of Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic,
international officials and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   As an imam read from the Koran, distant whistling could be heard
from Serbs on the hillside above, watching from the porches of
homes they had taken over from their Muslim owners. They in turn
were drowned out by the clatter of an Apache helicopter keeping
watch on the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other towns in the Serb-run ``Republika Srpska,''
Srebrenica still looks much as it did in 1995, with almost every
building marked by the thousands of shells and mortars fired into
the town during the two-year Serbian siege.

<P>
   Roberto Paganini, a human-rights worker in Srebrenica with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the
town's history had delayed the process of reconstruction and
bringing back former inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the damage and lack of running water, Srebrenica has
filled up with Serbs displaced from Muslim and Croat areas who fear
events like Tuesday's commemoration might mean they will be
displaced again.
</P>
<P>
   At the factory Hajrudin Nalic, 45, was greeting his former
neighbors. Apart from one other elderly couple, he is the only
Muslim to have returned to Srebrenica in the past five years.
Sitting in his reclaimed apartment earlier, he chose his words
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back on May 19th and I have no problem with the Serbs I
used to know. I walk around the town, I drink coffee with people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left in 1992, when the war started, because we could see
the way things were going,'' he said. ``I think that makes it
easier for my Serb friends. They know I did not see what happened
here in 1995. But we never discuss those things.''
</P>
<P>
   It took persistent questioning before he disclosed that his
elder brother, Ibro, was killed five years ago, with several
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   Nalic, a former worker with the Srebrenica municipality, also
owned a coffee bar in the town. What happened to it? Reluctantly he
disclosed that it was still functioning when he returned but after
he began efforts to get it back, it was demolished ``brick by
brick.'' Despite this, he is planning to bring back his wife and
two daughters from Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
   Other heads of families have come back to explore the
possibility of returning but in recent weeks four houses belonging
to Muslims have been burned.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Serb men was loitering at a kiosk near the battery
factory to watch Tuesday's comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never live together again,'' said one. ``If Muslims
come back here, there will be another war after 10 years.'' &QL;

   SREBRENICA, BOSNIA _ ``I will never forget this place,'' said
Tima Mehmedovic, trembling on the verge of hysteria. ``It was where
I saw my husband for the last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mehmedovic, 47, came Tuesday to a wrecked battery factory
on the outskirts of Srebrenica to mark the fifth anniversary of the
worst war crime in Europe since the Nazi era, and the worst
humiliation that United Nations peacekeepers have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the 3,000 Bosnian Muslims brought in by bus were
women: at this spot five years ago they were separated from their
husbands, brothers and sons, never to see them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by the entrance there they took my husband, Smajl, and my
son, Asmir, and told me to get on a truck to be evacuated,'' said
Mrs. Mehmedovic. ``Then a Serb sent my son back to me. He said: `My
name is Zoran Ilich. Remember I let you both go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asmir had not come Tuesday from Tuzla, where they now live. ``He
is too afraid,'' said his mother, ``but even though this is hard, I
am not scared of anything anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 11, 1995, the U.N.-declared ``safe area'' of Srebrenica
fell to Serbian troops as several hundred Dutch peacekeepers,
denied reinforcements, stood by helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, 7,000 to 8,000 Muslim men were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   War-crimes investigators have filled 4,700 bags with remains
found on the hillsides around the town or buried in mass graves but
only 80 victims have been identified. Smajl Mehmedovic is not one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``ethnic cleansing'' achieved its aim: Srebrenica is now
deep in the Serbian half of Bosnia and the town's former
inhabitants had to pass Tuesday along roads lined with jeering
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of peacekeeping troops and police were mobilized to
prevent trouble at the ceremony, which was purely religious,
despite the presence of Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic,
international officials and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   As an imam read from the Koran, distant whistling could be heard
from Serbs on the hillside above, watching from the porches of
homes they had taken over from their Muslim owners. They in turn
were drowned out by the clatter of an Apache helicopter keeping
watch on the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other towns in the Serb-run ``Republika Srpska,''
Srebrenica still looks much as it did in 1995, with almost every
building marked by the thousands of shells and mortars fired into
the town during the two-year Serbian siege.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Paganini, a human-rights worker in Srebrenica with the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said the
town's history had delayed the process of reconstruction and
bringing back former inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the damage and lack of running water, Srebrenica has

   MEXICO CITY _ When border police in Texas stopped a team of
racing bicyclists in lycra jerseys and helmets it was the end of
the road for one of the most innovative ``coyotes''_ people
smugglers on the Mexican frontier.
</P>
<P>
   His ingenious scheme was finally halted last week when patrolmen
operating near Laredo found that the ``cyclists'' were all
undocumented Mexican migrants who had allegedly paid the smuggler
to take them across the border.
</P>
<P>
   They were not the first. Over the past year, hundreds of
clandestine Mexican migrants have allegedly paid the ingenious
smuggler $1500 each to take part in what Texan analyst John Tedesco
terms a ``Tour de Fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the area had become accustomed to seeing clusters
of lycra-clad cyclists zip along the narrow access road that runs
between the official checkpoint at Laredo and the I-35 highway
leading to San Antonio, the nearest big city.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from local ranchers and cycling teams training for
endurance, there was rarely any traffic on this unmarked strip.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, Pedro Gonzalez, a wealthy San Antonio
resident, would direct groups of up to four cyclists in borrowed
gear to ride past.
</P>
<P>
   By putting their water supply in sporty clip-on bottles rather
than in the plastic jugs which illegal migrants usually carry on
their way north from Nuevo Laredo, and then suiting up in the
latest cycling attire, these bogus bikers avoided detection even
though their cycling skills were sometimes distinctly wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of them were young men, between the ages of 18 and
40.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Smietana, a border patrol agent, the novel
scheme took advantage of a constant backlog of bulky recreational
vehicles and trucks at the main checkpoint that effectively blocked
the officials' view of the access road.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 42, would regularly haul his collection of ten-speed
racing bicycles in the back of his pickup truck along with his
human cargo and unsuspecting officials recognized him and waved him
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would drop the aliens south of the checkpoint, drive
through, and wait up north for them,'' Smietana said. ``They'd
pedal past on the access road. Then about a mile up the road, he'd
pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was arrested on charges of aiding and abetting illegal
entry after undercover agents, tipped off to the scheme, witnessed
two cyclists stashing their equipment inside his pickup on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always looking for innovative ways to beat us and this
was very innovative,'' said Al Moreno, the head intelligence agent
along the Laredo frontier. ``They will stop. Their method has been
revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   The cycling scam apparently was limited to the main highway into
San Antonio. At lonelier outposts, groups of amateur cyclists would
have been much more conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Texas border patrolmen have intercepted over
120,000 undocumented Mexicans and say there has been a 23 percent
increase in illegal migrants who pay smuggling rings.
</P>
<P>
   With standard border crossings reinforced with extra security,
and an outbreak of volunteer ranchers who stop migrants at gunpoint
and hand them over to the border patrol, job-seekers sneaking into
the United States rarely go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   They regularly risk crossing unpatrolled barren stretches with
the help of unscrupulous ``coyotes,'' who are apt to abandon them
if officials approach.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months, 238 Mexicans have died of exposure
while trying to cross high desert, and surveillance planes used by
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service patrols are
increasingly deployed for search and rescue.
</P>
<P>
   To boost their chances of arrival, many cross-border immigrants
are willing to pay ``coyote'' guides large sums for their
expertise. The $1,500 fee charged by Gonzalez represents a full
year's savings for most of these would-be workers.
</P>
<P>
   Once they find jobs in the United States, Mexican migrants send
home an annual $8 billion in revenues to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's new president-elect, Vicente Fox, said ``You will never
stop immigration with guns or by building fences'' and promotes an
open border and rapid economic growth that will eventually increase
wages on both sides of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-business politician envisions a common market and single
currency economy in place within decades. Rocio Culebro, Amnesty
International's director in Mexico, has urged the new president to
guarantee the human rights of citizens crossing the border when he
assumes office in December. &QL;

latest cycling attire, these bogus bikers avoided detection even
though their cycling skills were sometimes distinctly wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of them were young men, between the ages of 18 and
40.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Smietana, a border patrol agent, the novel
scheme took advantage of a constant backlog of bulky recreational
vehicles and trucks at the main checkpoint that effectively blocked
the officials' view of the access road.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 42, would regularly haul his collection of ten-speed
racing bicycles in the back of his pickup truck along with his
human cargo and unsuspecting officials recognized him and waved him
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would drop the aliens south of the checkpoint, drive
through, and wait up north for them,'' Smietana said. ``They'd
pedal past on the access road. Then about a mile up the road, he'd
pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was arrested on charges of aiding and abetting illegal
entry after undercover agents, tipped off to the scheme, witnessed
two cyclists stashing their equipment inside his pickup on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always looking for innovative ways to beat us and this
was very innovative,'' said Al Moreno, the head intelligence agent
along the Laredo frontier. ``They will stop. Their method has been
revealed.''
</P>
<P>
   The cycling scam apparently was limited to the main highway into
San Antonio. At lonelier outposts, groups of amateur cyclists would
have been much more conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, Texas border patrolmen have intercepted over
120,000 undocumented Mexicans and say there has been a 23 percent
increase in illegal migrants who pay smuggling rings.
</P>
<P>
   With standard border crossings reinforced with extra security,
and an outbreak of volunteer ranchers who stop migrants at gunpoint
and hand them over to the border patrol, job-seekers sneaking into
the United States rarely go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   They regularly risk crossing unpatrolled barren stretches with
the help of unscrupulous ``coyotes,'' who are apt to abandon them
if officials approach.
</P>
<P>
   In the past nine months, 238 Mexicans have died of exposure
while trying to cross high desert, and surveillance planes used by
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service patrols are
increasingly deployed for search and rescue.
</P>
<P>
   To boost their chances of arrival, many cross-border immigrants
are willing to pay ``coyote'' guides large sums for their
expertise. The $1,500 fee charged by Gonzalez represents a full
year's savings for most of these would-be workers.
</P>
<P>
   Once they find jobs in the United States, Mexican migrants send
home an annual $8 billion in revenues to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's new president-elect, Vicente Fox, said ``You will never
stop immigration with guns or by building fences'' and promotes an
open border and rapid economic growth that will eventually increase
wages on both sides of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-business politician envisions a common market and single
currency economy in place within decades. Rocio Culebro, Amnesty
International's director in Mexico, has urged the new president to
guarantee the human rights of citizens crossing the border when he
assumes office in December. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES _ When Patty Hearst made her stunning transformation
from society heiress to urban terrorist in the mid-1970s, she
described her family as ``capitalist pigs'' and urged them to
redistribute their ill-gotten millions to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a society heiress once again, she is embracing her family
with open arms just as her guerrilla past is rushing to catch up
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a U.S. cable station announced she would be conducting
guided tours of Hearst Castle, the extravagant Californian dream
mansion built by her grandfather, the press magnate William
Randolph Hearst, for a two-part television special to be aired
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   That will coincide with the start of a high-profile trial in Los
Angeles which promises to re-examine the whole sordid history of
the Symbionese Liberation Army, the guerrilla group that abducted
and then recruited Hearst in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hearst will be a prosecution witness, not a defendant,
the trial is likely to raise many old questions about how willingly
she went along with the SLA's string of bank robberies, kidnappings
and murders.
</P>
<P>
   Having long since served her own jail time, she has complained
bitterly about being called to testify against her erstwhile
comrade-in-arms Sara Jane Olson, and has spent the past few months
working furiously to hone her image as a respectable socialite and
housewife.
</P>
<P>
   The television special will take her right to the heart of her
family's fanciful capitalist values.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Castle, which sits on a clifftop on the central
Californian coast, was the model for Xanadu in Orson Welles' film
``Citizen Kane'' _ a vast expression of egocentric opulence on the
outside concealing a great spiritual emptiness within.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Travel Channel said Tuesday that the
televised tours would be ``a labor of love'' for Hearst and an
opportunity to relive her idyllic childhood memories.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers flicking through the channels next spring will thus be
presented with a bizarre choice of imagery: on the news channels,
Hearst as the gun-toting class warrior known by the nom de guerre
Tania, and on cable, the perfumed, middle-aged daughter of wealth
talking about her grandfather's passion for European art and
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy of each of these images will be at the heart of the
trial, which Olson recently described as a credibility contest
between herself and Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the case is about the attempted bombing of two
police cars in Los Angeles in 1975, the charge on which Olson was
arrested last year after 25 years on the run.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecution has turned the case into a major rehash of
history, filing more than 15,000 pages of deposition papers and
issuing subpoenas obliging Hearst and others to testify. The trial
is expected to last at least eight months. &QL;

   LONDON _ After making a brief _ and rare _ public speech at a
lavish luncheon the other day, the Queen Mother asked the guests to
drink a toast their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the event organized at Guild Hall to celebrate the
Queen Mum's upcoming 100th birthday complied by raising a glass.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except the guest of honor, who couldn't find
her wine. After glancing around her place setting at the head
table, the Queen Mum fixed a stare at the archbishop of Canterbury
and pointed at the glass of red wine he clutched in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's mine,'' she said, sweetly but sternly, to the head of
the Anglican Church, who instantly relinquished it to the senior
royal.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were charmed by this moment, which reminded them all
that the plucky matriarch of this country's often troubled,
occasionally unwieldy first family continues on _ a rock in a time
of sometimes wrenching change.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother _ she
demanded the two royal designats. Prince Charles hovered near, but
she walked on her own, smiling demurely at people in the crowd as
she passed.
</P>
<P>
   With her warm smile and spry personality the mother of Queen
Elizabeth II remains by far the most popular royal _ for many the
personification of an ideal of ``British-ness'' that is fading
rapidly in the new century. She has seen two world wars, the
dissolution of an empire and counted among her friends Sir Winston
Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she is most revered for her easy, relaxed style that allows
for a fondness for gin, jokes and race horses.
</P>
<P>
   The country is full of people with memories of her, like a young
Manchester policeman who once guarded her parade route. Peering
into the Queen Mother's car, he noticed that she seemed t

Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush, dismissing Al Gore as ``the same old sequel,''
pledged today to close a ``tired episode'' in U.S. politics by
winning the White House in November. But he also predicted the race
would be ``hard and close.'' Bush confessed he's been ``somewhat
surprised'' by the reaction of Gore and President Clinton to his
campaign: ``They seem to be talking about me a lot. They're talking
about me, and I'm talking about me, and that's the way I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   RAH-RAH AND POLL NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   Although George W. Bush leads Al Gore in national polls, state
GOP party leaders in swing states remain cautious about Bush's
chances, saying it's too early to get overly confident. ``There are
a large percentage of people who haven't made up their minds,''
said Alan Novak, the Pennsylvania GOP chairman, one of about 150
state party leaders and worker bees convening in Texas today.
Besides a lot of pep session to energize the troops, they were
concentrating on how to push Bush's poll numbers up into more
comfortable ranges.
</P>
<P>
   CLEARLY THE NAACP'S FAVORITE
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of NAACP members leapt atop chairs as Al Gore entered
the convention hall in Baltimore today with a dance in his step,
grabbing hands, hugs and high-fives two or three at a time. He
swiped at George W. Bush, suggesting his opponent's interest in
black voters is pure politics. ``I am a member of the NAACP. It's
good to be home,'' he said. Speaking two days after Bush addressed
the civil rights group, Gore said, ``I have come here not just in
an election year, but year after year. I have worked with you. I
have stood with you. I am proud to have won some battles alongside
you.''
</P>
<P>
   PASSIONATE ABOUT COMPASSION
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton jabbed at George W. Bush's Republican mantra of
``compassionate conservatism'' while delivering an energetic
endorsement of racial equity in a speech to 2,000 NAACP members in
Baltimore. ``Just talking the talk doesn't get us where we need to
go,'' she said. Clinton, locked in a close race with Rick Lazio for
a Senate seat from New York, didn't mention Bush by name during her
35-minute spech. But on several occasions, she said more than
``compassion'' is needed for a leader to achieve racial equity and
justice.
</P>
<P>
   BYGONES, AS THEY SAY ON `ALLY MCBEAL'
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign press releases rehash weekly one of Bill Bradley's
most notable successes during his primary run against Al Gore:
labeling him a first-class fibber. ``Why should we believe you will
tell the truth as president if you don't tell the truth as a
candidate?'' Bradley asked Gore on Jan. 26. When Bradley announced
his withdrawal from the campaign on March 9, he pledged to support
Gore, but immediately went into seclusion. But now, after months of
travel, reflection, writing, family time and even a bit of mountain
climbing, Bradley is ready to campaign Thursday in Green Bay, Wis.,
for his former arch rival.
</P>
<P>
   A BIG DEAL FOR CABLE NEWS
</P>
<P>
   After seeing a report on the reluctance of broadcast networks to
pre-empt prime-time entertainment for the national political
conventions, CNN's Bernard Shaw let it be known that things were
different on cable. CNN, he said, ``will cover the Republican and
Democratic conventions until the lights burn out.'' That's because
the same economic factors that punish ABC, CBS and NBC for covering
politics reward the cable stations for every hour on the air. CNN
vows to spend nearly 100 hours on each convention, nearly a third
more time than in 1996. Fox News Channel plans about 10 hours a day
on its first conventions. MSNBC, in its infancy in 1996, also
promises an increase.
</P>
<P>
   URGING BLACKS TO GO GREEN
</P>
<P>
   Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader urged NAACP
members to join his progressive brand of politics, saying liberals
aren't appreciated as much by the Democratic Party. ``When you are
taken for granted, you are being taken,'' he said. Nader, a
longtime consumer advocate, said the two-party system ignores those
who want social change more radical than either the Democratic or
Republican parties have offered. In stark contrast to the rousing
address moments earlier by Hillary Clinton, Nader's talk to a
smaller audience of about 1,500 centered more on statistics chosen
to illustrate the striking gaps between the haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   GOING TO MINNESOTA? YOU BETCHA
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura has become a visit for presidential
contenders, and Ralph Nader, the Green Party nominee, plans to come
calling on Friday. Nader said he asked for a meeting with Ventura
because he has ``a lot of ideas for him as governor.'' Nader also
wants to seek Ventura's counsel on ballot access matters _ and on
finding his way into the presidential debates. Does Nader want an
endorsement, too? He said he never asks for endorsements, and that
Ventura is not about to make one. But, Nader said, ``You don't have
to leap a chasm of logic to realize I'd like that.''
</P>
<P>
   RALPH DOGGY-DOG?
</P>
<P>
   The adman whose irreverent work helped propel Jesse Ventura into
the governor's office in Minnesota, has signed on with Ralph Nader.
William Hillsman created a series of offbeat, funny and ultimately
successful ads for Ventura. It's unclear whether Nader will have
enough money to mount much of a TV campaign, but Hillsman says
he'll work with whatever budget he's given. And it's highly
unlikely that Nader's TV spots will feature him rapping a tune or
portraying an action figure battling Evil Special Interest Man, as
Minnesota voters saw two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   PAT IN THE PEACH STATE
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer Buchanan Brigade was busy announcing by e-mail the
news that Pat Buchanan has qualified for the ballot in Georgia.
Georgia Buchanan backer Glenn Jackson thanked the volunteer core
for ``working gun shows, flea markets, shopping centers _ you name
it _ in this Georgia heat'' to ensure Buchanan's name would appear
on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   STAPLING TOGETHER A LABOR ACCORD
</P>
<P>
   The last remaining group of workers without a union contract at
the site for next months' Democratic convention in Los Angeles has
resolved a labor dispute, calming fears that Staples Center
employees could disrupt the Democrats' big party. The International
Union of Operating Engineers Local 501 accepted the latest contract
offer from Sempra Energy, said union president Don Mear. Specifics
of the deal were not released. The engineers are responsible for
the arena's heating, cooling and electrical systems. The Democrats
now hope for a final deal with all the unions by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   A RIDGE TOO FAR?
</P>
<P>
   The Pennsylvania presidential race remains close, but a poll
released today suggests George W. Bush could gain an edge there by
picking popular Gov. Tom Ridge as his running mate. The Keystone
Poll, conducted by Millersville University's Center for Politics
and Public Affairs (4 percentage point margin of error) showed Bush
with 44 percent support and Al Gore with 40 percent. But the poll
also showed that if Ridge were on the ticket, Bush's support
climbed to 51 percent and Gore's dropped to 39 percent. Ridge's
support for abortion rights, however, is at odds with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   STRONG WATTAGE FOR KEATING
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, the only black Republican in
Congress, gave a plug for the vice presidential hopes of his home
state governor, Frank Keating: ``I think he'd be a good debater.
He's pro-life, so that helps. He's probably much safer than a
pro-choice candidate.'' Watts said he is encouraging Bush to select
an anti-abortion candidate. Oklahoma borders Texas, but Watts said
the Bush campaign told him early on that geography would not be a
factor in selecting a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   SHOW-ME STATE SHOWS FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Up by only two points in February, George W. Bush has surged to
an 11-point lead over Al Gore in Missouri, one of the key swing
states in the presidential race. A new Mason-Dixon poll conducted
for the Kansas City Star (4 percentage point margin of error) shows
Bush leading Gore by 48-37 percent as the candidates approach their
party conventions. Third-party contenders barely registered. Reform
Party's Pat Buchanan and the Green Party's Ralph Nader both
attracted 2 percent support. Undecideds totaled 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   NECK AND NECK IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   A new poll shows Hillary Clinton and Rick Lazio still in a dead
heat in their New York Senate race. The survey, conducted by the
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute (3 percentage point margin
of error) found the first lady and the Long Island congressman each
favored by 45 percent of voters statewide. Other polls have shown
the race to be equally close since Lazio declared his candidacy May
20. The Quinnipiac breakdown: Lazio has a slim lead upstate, 47-41
percent. Clinton leads in New York City, 61-30 percent. Lazio is
ahead in the New York City suburbs, 59-33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   DEBATES FOUND TO BE CRUCIAL
</P>
<P>
   Debates played critical roles in this year's presidential
primary contests, according to findings of a huge polling project
conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University
of Pennsylvania. Nightly tracking polls of voters in Iowa and New
Hampshire, for example, showed that Al Gore's Jan. 5 debate attack
on Bill Bradley over health care and his Jan. 8 blast over a
Bradley vote on flood relief had a distinct effect on Democratic
voters, and halted the former New Jersey senator's momentum. ``In
two debates, Bradley effectively lost the nomination,'' said
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg center.

   BUT WHEN YOUR WALLET'S FATTER _
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, each of the major presidential candidates
has given a greater percentage of his income to charities than has
the average American household, according to records released by
the candidates. From 1991-99, Al and Tipper Gore have donated at
least $120,365, or 4.2 percent, of their $2.9 million income during
that period to charity. Over the same period, George W. and Laura
Bush gave $702,451, or 3.14 percent of their $22.4 million income.
Said Sara E. Melendez, head of Independent Sector, a nonprofit
group that studies and encourages philanthropic efforts: ``When
they practice what they preach, the message is more powerful _ and
they both do.''
</P>
<P>
   REVERSAL OF FORTUNE
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats, who once believed Republicans might
enjoy a permanent financial advantage in campaigns, say they're
stunned to find that their campaign committees have more money
going into this fall's elections, despite their minority status in
both chambers. Fund-raisers attribute this partly to heavy spending
by the two GOP campaign organizations on overhead expenses such as
consultants, and partly to the unprecedented amount of GOP money
that George W. Bush has siphoned into his own campaign. But the
Democrats, according to the Washington Post, also say they've been
``more ruthless'' in demanding that their members raise big dollars
for the party.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR EXECUTIVE DECISIONS
</P>
<P>
   Both major parties have been looking to corporate America to
help pick up the tab for their convention costs. The Austin
American-Statesman reports that 16 corporations have given at least
$500,000 for the Republican convention, and 10 corporations have
been at least that generous to Democratic convention organizers.
</P>
<P>
   FOR SOME, BUT NOT ALL, TEXANS
</P>
<P>
   The American Jewish Congress scolded George W. Bush for
declaring a ``Jesus Day'' in Texas. Said the New York-based
organization, which works to maintain the separation of church and
state: ``The principal problem ... is not that it acknowledges the
important civic contributions of a particular faith, but that it
assumes that the profound regard in which the teachings and person
of Jesus Christ are held by the Christian community are the norm
for all residents of the state of Texas.'' The Bush proclamation
was issued in conjunction with June 10 ``March for Jesus,'' an
annual event.
</P>
<P>
   CAN YOU CALL FOR JUST 5 CENTS A MINUTE?
</P>
<P>
   Continuing his attack on the Republican Party leadership, Al
Gore wagged an accusing finger at George W. Bush, holding him
accountable for Congress' failure to pass a patients' bill of
rights. ``If he is willing to pick up the phone and call the
leadership of Congress, he can help us pry loose that one last
Republican vote'' to approve the legislation, Gore told health
professionals at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in
Little Rock. Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett countered that Gore was
refusing to take responsibility for ``his own failure to provide
leadership in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   BUT RONNIE'S V.P. DIDN'T GET ELECTED
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's new campaign chairman, William Daley, said that
Democratic convention organizers hope to convince voters that Gore
is not ``just a boring stiff.'' Daley said President Clinton will
kick off the convention Aug. 14 in Los Angeles with a speech
designed to be ``a celebration'' of his eight years in office while
offering a ``look into the future.'' Hillary Clinton is tentatively
scheduled for the same night, leaving the spotlight to Gore after
that. Daley compared Clinton's role to Ronald Reagan's appearance
at the GOP convention in 1988, when then-Vice President George Bush
got the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   FOR RENDELL, THE CONVENTION JOB'S OVER
</P>
<P>
   He, more than anyone else, snagged the Republican National
Convention for Philadelphia against formidable odds, but the party
now will go ahead without him. Democratic ex-Mayor Ed Rendell will
not be stopping by the First Union Center the week of July 31,
avoiding a potentially awkward moment born of his new job:
defeating George W. Bush. Now general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, Rendell will be making TV appearances from
Philadelphia during the convention, said Holly Kinser, a Democratic
adviser, presumably portraying Al Gore as the superior candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A WIDDLE ADVICE FOR PHILADELPHIANS
</P>
<P>
   You want to be a good host to the folks arriving in town for the
Republican convention? A little tip on being a good host in
Philadelphia, straight from the convention organizers who were
coaching 250 volunteers at a massive training session at Drexel
University: When out-of-towners ask where they can get a pack of
cigarettes, don't say, ``Go to the Wawa _ they're going to look at
you like you're 4 years old,'' said Mark Beyerle, head of volunteer
training for Philadelphia 2000, the nonprofit bipartisan host
committee organizing the convention. Wawa is a major convenience
store.

<P>
   ABBASIYEH, SOUTH LEBANON _ The lost villages of southern Lebanon
are a disgrace. Some, like Ein Arab, have been used as a target
range for Israel's proxy ``South Lebanon Army'' militia, a crumpled
mass of cement porches and bedrooms and wild gardens below Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Ghajar, lie on the other side of the Israeli
frontier wire, a clutch of houses _ half in occupied Lebanon, half
in occupied (and annexed) Syria, so the Lebanese say _ that ripple
in the afternoon heat.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Abbasiyeh, have no memorial. Just a single,
slightly rusted sign shows where Abbasiyeh stood. ``Danger Mines!''
it says in English, Hebrew and Arabic _ as if we needed to be told.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in crude paint on a cardboard sign beside the old
Israeli border fence _ and note that odd phrase ``the old Israeli
border fence'' _ it says: ``Abassiyeh welcomes you _ in front of
you is a Lebanese village that is still occupied.''
</P>
<P>
   As if acres of Israeli barbed wire and unguarded giant gates and
a windswept, ploughed strip _ an eerie, post-nuclear image of the
world _ could provide comfort to any stranger in this dangerous
land.
</P>
<P>
   I walked through the gate, through the Israeli fence, past a
tent wherein dwells one of Abbasiyeh's surviving residents, to a
rough embankment of dark red earth.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, an Israeli flag snapped in the hot breeze, a
tarpaulined tank basking beneath the Star of David and a soldier
who _ when I forelornly waved _ waved back. Who did he think I was?
And what was he doing, here in the hot plain of northern Galilee,
the ``border'' fence hissing in the mini-gale that swept the north
of Israel?
</P>
<P>
   Was I in Lebanon or Israel? In Lebanon, I think. For Abbasiyeh _
before the Israelis razed it to the ground 22 years ago _ was half
in Lebanon half in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And now, forced by the United Nations to acknowledge their
little infringements, the Israelis have pulled back from the
original frontier wire _ the great wire swathe through which I
walked _ to a border they have not yet prepared to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the rampart of earth and the covered tank and the acres of
sparkling new, grey barbed wire curled beside it. Even now, the
Israelis have not built their new defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   To the Hezbollah officer sitting a few meters away, the
cartography is simple. ``Abbasiyeh was always Lebanese and with the
efforts of our fighters, it will all return to Lebanon,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how far it stretches, right down there to the car
park.'' But it's not parking lot _ it's a three-square mile
concrete abscess packed with heat-shimmering trucks and limousines
and family cars, abandoned by the collapsing ``South Lebanon Army''
militia when they crossed from Lebanon into Israel during the
recent final retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there is Ghajar,'' the Hezbollah man tells me as the
poplars hiss and sway above us. ``It is partly in Syria and partly
in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian bit was annexed by Israel after the 1967 war. The
Lebanese bit remains Lebanese _ but inside Israel. And, so the word
goes in the hay fields along the old frontier wire; the Arabs who
live there prefer to keep their Israeli passports than campaign to
become Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   It's an argument that would be easier to accept if the evidence
of Israel's encroachment on Abbasiyeh was not so obvious. For when
the United Nations followed the old 1923 border line, they found
that Israel had indeed moved its border fence forward by a quarter
of a mile over the ruins of Abbasiyeh _ a discovery so obvious that
the Israelis abandoned the fence and withdrew to the earthen
revetments where I found the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger Mines!'' it says again beside my feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger Mines!'' it announces beside the cracked asphalt road
that leads from the old Israeli frontier gate to the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger Mines!'' it says on an Israeli metal flag a few feet
from the Hezbollah man's feet.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if the whole of southern Lebanon is a minefield. Which
is, in a sense, true. They say that a minimum of 15,000 mines lie
around here. I can believe it. Eight Lebanese have been blown to
pieces since Israel withdrew from these lands.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it a bit of an anticlimax, I ask the Hezbollah man,
his beard ruffled by the wind? I tell him that when I _ as a
schoolboy _ approached the end of term, I wanted to look forward to
the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   What was the point of arguing about a few square miles of land
now? He grins. ``If we get to the end of term and don't pass the
final exam,'' he asks, ``what was our struggle worth?'' A man who
knows how to pick up on a metaphor. Worrying.
</P>
<P>
   He hands me his binoculars. ``The Israelis are now reinforcing
their position up there on the hill near Shebaa fields,'' he says.
``See how they are digging in rather than preparing to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   And I look through the binoculars and, sure enough, there is an
orange digger cutting into the soft turf on top of a Lebanese
hilltop, the road beside it humming with Israeli vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   When I drive north, I come to the village of Ein Arab.
``Village'' is a preposterous name. It was used by the SLA as a
firing range, its population dispossessed more than two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now its silly ruins, clinging to hillsides, palm trees thrusting
through old steps, roses twined around crippled pillars are witness
to what occupation means.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, a Lebanese car pulls up and a man or woman
takes a picture. They do not step from the curbside into the long,
tangled, dangerous wild grass.
</P>
<P>
   Danger Mines! Danger Mines! Danger Mines! The words become a
kind of mantra.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have withdrawn _ up to a point _ but the village is
dead and the soil is now too dangerous to tread on.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot walk off the road in Ein Arab. Nor in Abbasiyeh. So
what is liberation worth? &QL;

DOWN ON THE FARM, UP ON TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By CATHERINE GREENMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   While farmers rely largely on experience and careful guesswork,
many are beginning to practice what has come to be known as
precision agriculture: the use of technology to cope with the
variables that jeopardize their crops.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who may have blanketed entire fields with uniform sprays
of of fertilizers or pesticides a few years ago may today use soil
and crop analyses linked to precise location data to deliver just
the right amount of chemicals in just the right spots. And farmers
can now use digital yield monitors attached to their combines to
track the performance of a field, practically row by row.
</P>
<P>
   Much of precision agriculture technology relies on Global
Positioning System devices and software that links information
about weather patterns, soil properties and pest management to
points on a map. That information is used to direct variable-rate
applicators that can tailor the amount of fertilizer or pesticide
needed in each part of a field. The technology has been most widely
adopted in the Midwest for sugar beets, corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers who employ precision agriculture say the methods give
them new ways to analyze the relationship between what they put
into the soil and what they get out of it and allow them to manage
more acres for the same cost. But adoption has been slow, largely
because of the cost of equipment and services, an expense that can
be prohibitive for small farms, and because the benefits are not
always clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers of wheat in the Dakotas and Montana are finding it
really difficult to make any profit with the price of wheat in the
world market,'' said Dr. Pierre Robert, director of the Precision
Agriculture Center at the University of Minnesota. ``If you don't
make any profit, you don't have the extra change to practice and
invest in new techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that it can be frustrating and intimidating
to try to make different kinds of farm software and GPS data
formats work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most farmers do not want to spend hours and hours in front of
a computer,'' said John Reifsteck, who runs an 1,800-acre corn and
soybean farm in Champaign, Ill. ``You can get very frustrated when
all you want to do is print a nice map and things don't work that
well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a 10-40-50 rule,'' said Dr. Steven Sonka, a professor
of agricultural management at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. ``Ten percent are using variable rate application
and yield monitors because it's interesting to them and it seems
like a good thing to do. Forty percent are watching and will start
using them as soon as they're convinced it's economical. Then there
are the 50 percent of farmers who are waiting to retire and not
have to worry about all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Most buyers in the agriculture industry agree that the
components of precision agriculture are necessary for success.
``The people who are resistant to precision methods aren't
surviving,'' said Thomas Facer, vice president for agricultural
services at Agrilink Foods, a food cooperative based in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   One farmer who is using precision methods is Ken Mattingly,
owner of M-B Farms in LeRoy, N.Y., about 50 miles southwest of
Rochester. Before planting sweet corn on 900 of his 2,000 acres,
Mattingly hired Agricultural Consulting Services, a crop consultant
company based in Rochester, to analyze the soil in different parts
of his field and decide how much fertilizer the different parts
needed.
</P>
<P>
   During the year, the consulting company had sent Richard Wildman
to take 400 soil samples in Mattingly's field, one sample for each
four- or five-acre section. The soil samples were analyzed for
about 15 components, including concentrations of calcium, phosphate
and nitrogen. Wildman then compared the soil analyses with yield
maps based on the previous year's harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Early one morning last month, Mattingly was at the field with
Wildman and Mike Belmore, a spray rig operator with J.D. Buckley &AMP;
Son, a fertilizer and pesticide company in Stafford, N.Y. Hunched
over the side of a truck, the three men pored over a digitized
field map prepared by Wildman to show where phosphate and nitrogen
would be sprayed at high, medium and low rates.
</P>
<P>
   That same map was also loaded into a computer inside the
spreader tractor, a tall vehicle loaded with fertilizer tanks; the
computer was hooked up to a GPS unit. Two 15-foot booms on either
side of the tractor were lined with nozzles about every 30 inches.
A controller in the tractor linked the fertilizer map to the
nozzles, controlling the application rates and alternating
fertilizer types as the tractor moved from one part of the field to
another.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Belmore, who spreads fertilizer across as
much as 520 acres a day, navigated the tractor based on the GPS
coordinates on his screen, which told him where he was in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, Mattingly drove a planter tractor to spread
the seeds across the field. And then a a few weeks into the
planting season, Belmore returned to apply herbicides to any weedy
areas and spray pesticides to protect the crop against corn borers
and other pests. Farm consultants can look at aerial images and see
signs of pest damage, then apply pesticides where they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all looking for the optimums,'' Mattingly said, ``and we
don't want to waste money on the chemicals. It costs me money to
hire these guys, but I think I'm doing a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattingly said he was spreading fertilizer more carefully and
using fewer pesticides than he did a few years ago because of the
variable-rate applicators. But he said it was still too early to
tell what effect that would have on his crop yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many variables that enter into what a crop yields
that it's hard to tell yet whether this is making a difference,''
he said. ``I think it will be four or five years before we can
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   After a field has been fertilized and planted, farmers and crop
consultants can use satellite and aerial imagery to monitor their
crops each week or month. The images are particularly helpful for
large farms, where it is difficult for the farmer to monitor
different areas of the field from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large farms need the ability to know what is going on across
the range of their acres, remotely,'' said Wildman, the
agricultural consultant. ``It's impractical for that one manager to
go out and check all those fields. They physically cannot do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The satellite images used by farmers come from Landsat, the
system of land-observing satellites operated by the federal
government. The satellites take infrared photographs from about
20,000 feet above Earth; each pixel represents a little more than 5
to 10 square yards on the ground. The infrared camera can detect a
field's heat and moisture levels. These images can be overlaid onto
farm mapping programs to show areas of drought or flooding. Such
images cost the farmer $2 to $3 per acre.
</P>
<P>
   But if a farmer commissions Landsat to take an image of a farm
at a time of day when there are clouds blocking the view, the
farmer is out of luck and still has to pay the bill. And satellite
images are less useful for small farms because the image
resolutions are so low.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial infrared photography costs $5 to $6 per acre, but it
offers slightly better resolutions without the same risks of
clouds. Zeke Hurd, a pilot based in Rochester, charges about $200
an hour to fly a small aircraft at low elevations to take infrared
photographs of farmland. The plane can fly as slow as 40 miles per
hour, allowing Hurd's Hasselblad digital infrared camera to take
images that have a resolution of about 6 square inches per pixel. A
GPS unit on top of the camera automatically links every shot that
is taken to a geographic spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's an alteration in the moisture levels,'' Hurd said,
``you won't be able to see it with the naked eye, but the infrared
will pick up the reflection. An image might illustrate a need for
irrigation in a specific area. Hurd said he was also working on a
software program that will help farmers record the data and compare
images from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Yield monitors, introduced in the early 1990s, are the most
widely adopted tools in precision agriculture. About half of the
new combines built by companies like the Pixall Corp., Oxbo
International and John Deere are equipped with yield monitors. The
monitors can also be added to combines for about $5,000 to $7,000
each.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If the maps of fertilizer application and aerial images are
the X-rays, the yield monitors are the autopsy report,'' said Jim
Kinsella, who operates an 850-acre corn and soybean farm in
Lexington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Yield monitors placed on combines as they harvest grain or wheat
can tell the farmer how many bushels are being harvested per acre
in any part of the field.
</P>
<P>
   As a combine rolls across rows of field corn, for example, it
delivers the ears of corn to a machine where the husk is removed
and the kernels are extracted from the cob and collected in a bin.
The husks and bare cobs are spit out of the back of the combine.
</P>
<P>
   The kernels move on a conveyor belt, where a sensor analyzes
their moisture content and compares that measurement with the
volume being harvested on a bushels-per-acre basis.
</P>
<P>
   The whole system is attached to a GPS unit, which keeps track of
the location of the combine, storing each set of coordinates on a
flash memory card. After the harvest, the data can be used to
generate a map showing yields in various parts of the field.
Similar technology can be used for the harvesting of wheat and
soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to a lot of farmers, and never has anyone said
they're sorry to have invested in a yield monitor,'' said
Reifsteck, the farmer from Champaign, Ill. ``It seems to satisfy an
innate curiosity.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm equipment industry has been slower to build yield
monitors for crops like sweet corn (where the kernels remain on the
cob) and cotton. But last year, Oxbo International, based in Byron,
N.Y., introduced a sweet-corn yield monitor that attaches to a
combine. The monitor weighs the corncobs as they are harvested and
comes up with a tons-per-acre figure that is based on the speed of
the combine size of the swath it is harvesting. The company is also
working on yield monitors for lima and green beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to apply this technology to other combine
equipment,'' said Alan Russell, project engineer at Oxbo
International, ``but we need interest from our growers and the food
processing companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Case IH, based in Racine, Wis., is working on yield monitors
that will use near-infrared sensors to detect the oil and protein
content of wheat, corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   Yield monitors let farmers pinpoint crop values, and that helps
them decide whether to put less profitable land in government
reserve programs. The Conservation Reserve Program, part of the
1985 Farm Bill, for example, encourages farmers to plant buffer
grasses and trees on some of their land so there will be less
erosion and less runoff of pesticides and fertilizers into
waterways. The government pays 90 percent of the cost of the
plantings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a real different mind-set to start breaking down the
field into different areas,'' said Dan Towery, an agronomist with
the Conservation Technology Information Center, a public-private
partnership that focuses on conservation issues and is based in
West Lafayette, Ind., ``but a yield monitor gives a farmer an idea
of how much money he'll make planting versus how much he'll make if
he enrolls it in a conservation reserve program. If he doesn't have
a yield monitor, he's just guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers who use precision agriculture systems say they hope
that the systems will allow them to exchange data with other
farmers and work more effectively with members of the food
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a system to document that a field in New York that
sends cabbage to Kentucky Fried Chicken,'' said Craig Yunkers,
owner of C-Y Farms in Elba, N.Y., ``we have the ability to trace it
back to what field it was harvested in, when it was harvested and
what pesticides were used. It's a huge challenge, but with consumer
safety and accountability issues at the forefront, the pressure is
on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sites like VantagePoint _ a joint venture of Deere &AMP; Co.,
Gromark and Farmland Industries _ and Rooster.com _ started by
Cargill, Cenex Harvest States Cooperatives and DuPont _ are
offering farmers in different regions of the country forums where
they can exchange information and get market information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a great appreciation that precision
agriculture is about an information system and not just what
happens on individual farms,'' said Sonka, of the University of
Illinois. ``The values are greater if we look at the whole
production system.''

<P>
   ABBASIYEH, SOUTH LEBANON _ The lost villages of southern Lebanon
are a disgrace. Some, like Ein Arab, have been used as a target
range for Israel's proxy ``South Lebanon Army'' militia, a crumpled
mass of cement porches and bedrooms and wild gardens below Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Ghajar, lie on the other side of the Israeli
frontier wire, a clutch of houses _ half in occupied Lebanon, half
in occupied (and annexed) Syria, so the Lebanese say _ that ripple
in the afternoon heat.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Abbasiyeh, have no memorial. Just a single,
slightly rusted sign shows where Abbasiyeh stood. ``Danger Mines!''
it says in English, Hebrew and Arabic _ as if we needed to be told.
</P>
<P>
   And then, in crude paint on a cardboard sign beside the old
Israeli border fence _ and note that odd phrase ``the old Israeli
border fence'' _ it says: ``Abassiyeh welcomes you _ in front of
you is a Lebanese village that is still occupied.''
</P>
<P>
   As if acres of Israeli barbed wire and unguarded giant gates and
a windswept, ploughed strip _ an eerie, post-nuclear image of the
world _ could provide comfort to any stranger in this dangerous
land.
</P>
<P>
   I walked through the gate, through the Israeli fence, past a
tent wherein dwells one of Abbasiyeh's surviving residents, to a
rough embankment of dark red earth.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, an Israeli flag snapped in the hot breeze, a
tarpaulined tank basking beneath the Star of David and a soldier
who _ when I forelornly waved _ waved back. Who did he think I was?
And what was he doing, here in the hot plain of northern Galilee,
the ``border'' fence hissing in the mini-gale that swept the north
of Israel?
</P>
<P>
   Was I in Lebanon or Israel? In Lebanon, I think. For Abbasiyeh _
before the Israelis razed it to the ground 22 years ago _ was half
in Lebanon half in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   And now, forced by the United Nations to acknowledge their
little infringements, the Israelis have pulled back from the
original frontier wire _ the great wire swathe through which I
walked _ to a border they have not yet prepared to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the rampart of earth and the covered tank and the acres of
sparkling new, grey barbed wire curled beside it. Even now, the
Israelis have not built their new defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   To the Hezbollah officer sitting a few meters away, the
cartography is simple. ``Abbasiyeh was always Lebanese and with the
efforts of our fighters, it will all return to Lebanon,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how far it stretches, right down there to the car
park.'' But it's not parking lot _ it's a three-square mile
concrete abscess packed with heat-shimmering trucks and limousines
and family cars, abandoned by the collapsing ``South Lebanon Army''
militia when they crossed from Lebanon into Israel during the
recent final retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over there is Ghajar,'' the Hezbollah man tells me as the
poplars hiss and sway above us. ``It is partly in Syria and partly
in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian bit was annexed by Israel after the 1967 war. The
Lebanese bit remains Lebanese _ but inside Israel. And, so the word
goes in the hay fields along the old frontier wire; the Arabs who
live there prefer to keep their Israeli passports than campaign to
become Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
   It's an argument that would be easier to accept if the evidence
of Israel's encroachment on Abbasiyeh was not so obvious. For when
the United Nations followed the old 1923 border line, they found
that Israel had indeed moved its border fence forward by a quarter
of a mile over the ruins of Abbasiyeh _ a discovery so obvious that
the Israelis abandoned the fence and withdrew to the earthen
revetments where I found the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger Mines!'' it says again beside my feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger Mines!'' it announces beside the cracked asphalt road
that leads from the old Israeli frontier gate to the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danger Mines!'' it says on an Israeli metal flag a few feet
from the Hezbollah man's feet.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if the whole of southern Lebanon is a minefield. Which
is, in a sense, true. They say that a minimum of 15,000 mines lie
around here. I can believe it. Eight Lebanese have been blown to
pieces since Israel withdrew from these lands.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it a bit of an anticlimax, I ask the Hezbollah man,
his beard ruffled by the wind? I tell him that when I _ as a
schoolboy _ approached the end of term, I wanted to look forward to
the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   What was the point of arguing about a few square miles of land
now? He grins. ``If we get to the end of term and don't pass the
final exam,'' he asks, ``what was our struggle worth?'' A man who
knows how to pick up on a metaphor. Worrying.
</P>
<P>
   He hands me his binoculars. ``The Israelis are now reinforcing
their position up there on the hill near Shebaa fields,'' he says.
``See how they are digging in rather than preparing to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   And I look through the binoculars and, sure enough, there is an
orange digger cutting into the soft turf on top of a Lebanese
hilltop, the road beside it humming with Israeli vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   When I drive north, I come to the village of Ein Arab.
``Village'' is a preposterous name. It was used by the SLA as a
firing range, its population dispossessed more than two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now its silly ruins, clinging to hillsides, palm trees thrusting
through old steps, roses twined around crippled pillars are witness
to what occupation means.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, a Lebanese car pulls up and a man or woman
takes a picture. They do not step from the curbside into the long,
tangled, dangerous wild grass.
</P>
<P>
   Danger Mines! Danger Mines! Danger Mines! The words become a
kind of mantra.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have withdrawn _ up to a point _ but the village is
dead and the soil is now too dangerous to tread on.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot walk off the road in Ein Arab. Nor in Abbasiyeh. So
what is liberation worth? &QL;

   DURBAN _ The hatch slams shut, a bell rings and Raphael Kayamba
has the future of yet another anonymous individual on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   A deacon at Berea Baptist Mission in Johannesburg, Kayamba deals
with the living, kicking proof of the South African AIDS crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mothers who are abandoning their babies are young,'' said
Kayamba, a 39-year-old engineer who for the past year has dedicated
his life to finding homes for infants left at his church's ``door
of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mothers come here almost as soon as they are out of labor
at Johannesburg Hospital nearby, bringing their small children. The
reason is AIDS. But some of the babies are so small that you can
tell they were brought to us even before the mother received the
result of her child's HIV test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some of the mothers have AIDS and are worried about
their child's future. We do not really know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the year since the ``door of hope'' has been installed in the
white brick wall of the inner-city church, 32 mothers have lifted
the aluminium hatch and lain their newborn on a thin layer of white
foam beneath which a mechanism triggers a bell in a house in the
church compound. On hearing the bell, which usually rings at night,
a church volunteer collects the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miraculously, only four of our babies have tested HIV
positive, and I think that proves that the mothers generally do not
know their child's status,'' said Kayamba.
</P>
<P>
   Not all children born to women with the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) test positive at birth, and other infants shake it off.
But in South Africa mother-to-baby transmission of HIV is a
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Due to government resistance, there is only limited access to
the single-dose drugs, AZT and Nevirapine, which many studies have
shown can banish the virus from the child's system at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 22.4 percent of women attending South African
antenatal clinics were HIV positive. In KwaZulu-Natal, the province
hosting this week's Durban AIDS Conference, the figure was 32.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that, unless they are given powerful
anti-retroviral drugs, between 30 and 40 percent of HIV-positive
mothers pass the virus on to their children.
</P>
<P>
   In Durban this week, it has been the failure of the South
African government to provide those drugs _ a measure it could
afford because the anti-retroviral drug regimen is short and costs
only $4 per birth _ that has met with the most criticism both from
international experts and AIDS activists.
</P>
<P>
   The government claims that to provide AZT or Nevirapine would be
too expensive, but most observers disagree, pointing to the
devastating economic cost to South Africa of allowing a generation
to be born with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as part of a growing program it has initiated for
Africa, the Bill &AMP; Melinda Gates Foundation gave a United States
charity over $60 million to reduce mother-to-child transmission in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Kayamba, whose church is linked to and funded by the U.S.
Baptists' Union, said the idea for the ``door of hope'' came from
Latin America and is to be expanded to other South African cities.
He admitted it is controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We introduced the door of hope because 100 babies are
abandoned every month in the streets of Johannesburg and 55 percent
of them are HIV-positive. They are abandoned in dustbins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say the door encourages women to abandon their
babies. But we just care about saving lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the year that the ``door of hope'' has been in operation, the
church's reputation for finding foster homes for abandoned babies
has grown. ``Most mothers do not want to leave their babies
anonymously. They come during the day and hand them to us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven babies were brought to us in this way last month and it
is much better because we can counsel the woman and fill in the
correct paperwork,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The children taken in by Kayamba are taken to a baby home while
foster parents are found through the church. ``We find parents
pretty quickly. We even found a couple who agree to take one of the
HIV-positive babies,'' he said. &QL;

FEDERAL REGULATIONS OFFER LITTLE TO ALLEVIATE AIR TRAVEL DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HIELSCHER   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you're a frequent flier or an occasional vacationer,
chances are that someday your airline flight will be delayed or
canceled. Although the major U.S. airlines pledged last year to
treat customers better, complaints about commercial jet service has
soared.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Transportation Department said it received more than
6,900 passenger complaints in the first four months of 2000, a 74
percent increase over last year. The No. 1 gripe was delays in
arrivals and departures. Federal officials estimate that airlines
receive 100 to 400 complaints for every one filed with the DOT.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines say they are working to improve service. Last year,
in an effort to avoid federal legislation that would enforce
passenger rights, the carriers and the Air Transport Association
vowed to reduce flight problems and to do a better job of informing
passengers about delays or cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   But travel agents say the airlines' initiative is not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes as no surprise to travel agents that the voluntary
plans put forth by the airlines have not yielded satisfactory
results,'' said Joe Galloway, president of the American Society of
Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   ASTA has called for a moratorium on airline mergers until the
industry solves passenger service problems. The trade association
also is calling for passage of a federal Air Travelers Bill of
Rights, which it says would establish a national policy of fair
treatment for passengers and travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   DOT said complaints about flight delays are up 84 percent over
last year. Airlines don't guarantee schedules, and problems such as
bad weather, air traffic delays and mechanical repairs are hard to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   When flights are delayed or canceled, each airline has its own
policy about what it will do for passengers at the airport. In the
deregulated airline industry, there are no federal rules forcing
airlines to compensate passengers whose flights are delayed or
canceled. Compensation is required by law only for those who are
bumped from an overbooked flight.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ``contract of carriage'' on each ticket _ that
small-type legalese few people read _ passengers are given an
abbreviated version of their rights on flight delays, cancellations
or misconnections.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers should not assume they are automatically entitled to
meals, hotel rooms and other amenities if they are stuck at an
airport because they miss a connection or their flight isn't
departing.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines responsibilities and passenger rights are governed by
the federal General Rule 240. It spells out what the carriers'
obligations are for a ``schedule irregularity'' _ a flight delay
that causes a missed connection, a flight cancellation, a
substitute of equipment to a different class of service or a
schedule change that requires rerouting.
</P>
<P>
   When a flight is delayed or canceled, or the passenger misses a
connection under those circumstances, the airline is required to
offer the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ It must confirm you on the next flight, if space is available,
at no additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ If an alternate flight on the same airline will get you to
your destination earlier than the alternate you have been offered,
you can take that flight at no additional cost, even if first-class
space is all that is available.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the airline's alternate flight is unacceptable to you, you
have the right to be seated on a flight of a different airline at
no additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the different airline has a flight that will arrive at your
city earlier than the one offered, you can take that flight, even
if only first class is available, at no additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ If no alternate flight on any airline is acceptable to you,
the airline must refund your money, even if you have a
nonrefundable ticket.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a flight is canceled for reasons beyond the airline's
control _ weather, acts of God, labor disputes, shortage of fuel _
the airline's only obligation is to refund your ticket. (Most major
carriers will try to reroute such passengers to an alternate
flight, but under Rule 420, they are not required to do so.)
</P>
<P>
   Airlines also have guidelines they follow when providing hotel
rooms and meal vouchers to passengers whose flights are canceled
when other flights are unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Delta will provide a hotel room if the delay will
exceed four hours from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. Delta and some other
airlines offer this even if bad weather is the cause for delay,
although they are not required to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Delta implemented a 12-point ``Customer Commitment'' last year
in response to the travel agents' effort at federal passenger
rights legislation. Other airlines have similar customer service
statements. They include trying to contact ticketed passengers
ahead of time about time changes or canceled flights.

CELEBRITY NEIGHBORS? LET'S TALK REAL ESTATE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE QUEENAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the least examined mysteries of modern suburban life is
the impact a small community experiences when its most famous
citizen suddenly ups and leaves. Did residents of Nyack, N.Y., feel
they had failed last year when Rosie O'Donnell packed up her three
children and moved to Greenwich, Conn.? Will they feel redeemed if
she indeed buys a house nearby and returns to the greater Nyack
area?
</P>
<P>
   Do house prices in Bedford, N.Y., go up or down when Mariah
Carey leaves town? And would Americans once again start confusing
Chappaqua with Pound Ridge should Hillary Clinton lose her
senatorial race and grab the next train to a place called Hope? Or,
for that matter, a place called Chicago?
</P>
<P>
   Although I am as concerned about the psychological well-being of
Nyackers, Bedfordians and Chappaquii as the next person, it is the
impact of celebrity defections on house prices that has consumed my
waking hours. As a 17-year resident of historic Tarrytown, an
intermittently idyllic, but celebrity-deprived Hudson River hamlet,
I've been spending a lot of time wondering whether luring a Celine
Dion or at least one of the Backstreet Boys to our
headless-horsemanlike community might not put some juice into house
prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, I have given much thought to whether
Tarrytowners could withstand the devastating blow of having a
mega-deity _ say, Regis _ briefly alight among us, only to turn
around and blow town a few months later. But mostly I've been
thinking about those house prices.
</P>
<P>
   As is usually the case when I begin to fantasize about sudden
Croesian windfalls, my dreams are cruelly dashed as soon as I
subject them to the sober review of seasoned professionals. Real
estate agents in Bedford, Chappaqua and Nyack are unanimous in
their belief that the peregrinations of celebrities have little or
no effect on house prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might make an impact on the ultra-ultra top level of the
market,'' says Lois Barnett, the owner of Vincent &AMP; Whittemore Real
Estate in Bedford. But for every Mariah that high-tails it back to
Manhattan, 10 more will spring up in her place. And, in some cases,
already have. As Barnett noted: ``When Martha Stewart moves in,
Michael Crichton and George Soros already live right down the
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedford is not the only village that can fall back on its
daunting reservoir of equally radiant celebrities when a Mariah
Carey defects. The same is true of Nyack. When I visit this quirky,
quasi-Bohemian village that seems to taunt stolid, un-quirky
Tarrytown from across the Hudson, it is clear that residents had
been cushioned from the blow of Rosie O'Donnell's departure by the
presence of myriad celebrities of comparable luminosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person I ever waited on, 23 years ago, was Helen
Hayes,'' said Kenneth Kral, ``assistant everything'' at the
Pickwick Bookshop. In fact, it was Hayes' beloved house, Pretty
Penny, that O'Donnell purchased for $770,000 in 1996, remodeled for
hundreds of thousands of dollars with things like security cameras
and then abruptly unloaded for something like $2.75 million. Yet
locals did not seem chastened, slighted or rebuked by her
departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Murray was in here last week,'' said a waitress at a
pastry shop called The Runcible Spoon, located not far from Edward
Hopper's boyhood home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see William Hurt, Al Pacino and one of the Baldwins all
the time,'' added another merchant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Hollywood on the Hudson!'' chimed in a second waitress
from The Runcible Spoon, located not far from Carson McCullers'
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Edward James Olmos sitting right in that very chair,''
observed a man in a local thrift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a town frequented by the likes of Edward James Olmos
(most of the famous people sighted in Nyack actually live in nearby
villages) does not need a Rosie O'Donnell to bolster its image.
Even if she should decide to buy that new $2 million house on 25
acres on top of a mountain in the adjoining Valley Cottage, for
Nyackers, this will only be icing on what is already quite a
remarkable cake.
</P>
<P>
   But what about an equally charming, much more upscale, yet less
overtly cool community like Chappaqua? Does the arrival of the
Clintons substantially boost the town's self-esteem? Would that
self-esteem evaporate if they suddenly vamoosed? And what about
those house prices?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely seen as a victory for Chappaqua,'' said Colin
Calhoun, the owner of Calhoun's Restaurant. ``People feel
validated.''
</P>
<P>
   But would the locals feel de-validated if Hillary Clinton lost
the senatorial election and left?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Calhoun said. ``If she loses, 90 percent of the people
would expect her to leave. But the Clintons being here is already a
victory for Chappaqua.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Atkinson, a real estate agent at Houlihan Lawrence in
Chappaqua, agreed that having the president of the United States
and an aspiring U.S. senator as neighbors has given the Chappaquii
some sort of psychological boost. But she doesn't see how that
affects house prices. Instead, she mentioned the excellent schools,
the easy commute to the city, the guaranteed parking spaces at the
train station and other unquantifiable quality-of-life elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to Chappaqua because it's very child-oriented,''
she explained. ``It's an easy town. Who wouldn't want to live
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. But here's an even better one. Tarrytown is also
an easy town. It is also a child-oriented town. And it is a town
that offers an even easier commute to the city than Chappaqua.
Moreover, it is not a snooty town, not the sort of town that acts
as if celebrities are no big deal. Indeed, I would be willing to
wager that if an Al Pacino or a Bill Murray or even a Jonathan
Demme were willing to ford the Hudson and set down roots in our
community, most of the locals would be ready to lay out the red
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Why then the delay? Is it possible that Tarrytown's
well-documented parking problems are all that is keeping
celebrities away? Were these parking problems eased, might not
Mariah Carey be willing to give Westchester County a second chance?
And if so, wouldn't that do wonders for house prices? Specifically,
mine?
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, a knowledgeable real estate agent blithely
dismisses my dreams of imminent Tarrytownian cultural and economic
suzerainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrities don't raise house prices,'' she said. ``SAT scores
raise house prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but I still think Madonna could help.

 (ATTN: Ind.)   (Ronald Dollens is chief executive of Guidant, a medical technology
company; this was written with Patricia R. Olsen)  
 By RONALD DOLLENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a teen-ager growing up in Indiana, I worked in my father's
grocery for 75 cents an hour. Since I was the boss' son, I got all
the lousy jobs, like cleaning up spilled milk that had soured in
the refrigerator, so that no one would think I was getting special
treatment. I was paid for a 40-hour week, but I was working my
father's hours. We'd get up at 5:30 a.m. to stop by a market and
pick up the produce, and we didn't get home until 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On the hour drive to the store and on the trip home _ at least
the times I was awake _ I learned life's lessons from my father. He
taught me about integrity and respecting people no matter what
their stature. He had a wallhanging in the kitchen: ``Don't try to
teach a pig to sing. It wastes your time and annoys the pig.'' I
have that saying framed in my office. It reminds me that you have
to start with a certain amount of capability or you're pretty
limited in what you can do.
</P>
<P>
   Every Memorial Day at our backyard barbecue, we'd listen to the
Indy 500 on the radio and keep track of who was leading. I had
oversized postcards of all the drivers on my bedroom wall, and I
still remember the year _ 1955 _ that Bill Vukovich, who had won
two years in a row, was killed while leading a third consecutive
time.
</P>
<P>
   Working at Eli Lilly had a special aura in my town. One summer I
asked a neighbor who worked there as a trucker if he knew of any
jobs. I got a summer job unloading coal cars and cleaning boilers,
and I worked weekends there while attending Purdue. In my junior
year I learned that they were only hiring pharmacists, so I
switched my major from chemistry to pharmacy. After Purdue I went
straight to Indiana University for my M.B.A. in marketing, but when
Lilly recruited on campus I couldn't get an interview. Now they
were only hiring accountants. Luckily, I had developed a few
contacts, so I got a job.
</P>
<P>
   Then they asked my geographical preference, and I said Denver or
Dallas or San Francisco. They came back with Terre Haute, and I
said ``no thanks,'' assuming I had a choice. The second time, they
explained it so that there could be no doubt _ I'd be going to
Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   When Eli Lilly was spinning off the division that became
Guidant, I went to J.P. Morgan in New York to seek debt financing.
My daughter, a high school senior, had quite a reputation as a
cross-country runner and soccer player. One of the bankers came up
to me afterward, and I thought he wanted to acknowledge me. Instead
he asked: ``Are you Stephanie Dollens' father?''
</P>
<P>
   For the IPO road show, a few of us went on a 10-day trip and
gave 55 presentations. By the 55th time I spoke, I even bored
myself. On one trip, from Boston to New York, we hadn't eaten all
day, so we ordered a pizza on the way to the Lilly corporate plane
and told them what hangar we'd be in. We persuaded the pilot to
hold the plane so we could have the pizza delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Once, in San Francisco, we had a new person in human resources.
He was a corporate type who was from the Midwest like me. He wanted
to fire a scientist found sleeping under a workbench in the R&AMP;D
lab, and he needed my approval. I asked the man's name.
</P>
<P>
   When he told me who it was, I suggested he go and look at the
patent wall and count the number of times the man's name appeared.
I said that the scientist had probably been working all night and
that the next time he saw him under the bench he might want to get
him a pillow.

&HT;     COURT AFFIRMS JUDGES' POWER OVER EXTRADITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The federal appeals court in San Francisco says
judges can enforce a ban on extraditing foreigners who face likely
torture in their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected arguments by the
Justice Department that the secretary of State has the last word on
extraditing immigrants accused of crimes abroad. An immigrant can
ask a federal judge to overrule the State Department's decision
that a claim of torture is unfounded or unlikely to recur, the
court ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, in a case from Orange County, could help immigrants
fighting deportation as well as extradition to numerous countries
where police torture has been reported, said Marc Van Der Hout, an
immigration lawyer in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   He said some illegal immigrants who face abuse in their
homelands might not qualify for political asylum in the United
States, because of their criminal records or inability to prove
political persecution, but could avoid deportation under Tuesday's
ruling if they showed a likelihood of torture. Judicial review is
crucial because government decisions on extradition or deportation
are often driven by politics, Van Der Hout said.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Linda Aouate, who argued against court
review of extradition decisions, was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved the 1984 United Nations Convention Against
Torture, which bars nations from returning or extraditing people
who are likely to face torture. The treaty defines torture as
severe pain or suffering, inflicted with government participation
or consent, for such purposes as intimidation, discrimination or
obtaining a confession. The United States ratified the convention
in 1994 and implemented it with a federal law that took effect last
year.
</P>
<P>
   It was invoked by Ramiro Cornejo-Barreto, a Mexican-born legal
U.S. resident in the Orange County community of Dana Point, who was
charged with the May 1989 robbery of a jewelry store and killing of
a state policeman in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Cornejo was arrested in California in 1996 on an extradition
warrant based on his confessions. In federal court, he denied guilt
and said he signed blank papers after the Mexican police shoved
chili up his nostrils, beat him with fists and rifle butts,
deprived him of food and water, hooded him with a plastic bag until
he passed out, hung him by his wrists, shocked him with electrodes
and threatened him with death.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer also offered medical evidence that he had been
tortured, as well as reports by the State Department and Amnesty
International finding instances of police torture in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Elgin Edwards found that Cornejo was likely to
be tortured if extradited to Mexico. But he said there was evidence
of his guilt, apart from the purported confessions, that justified
extradition. That evidence consisted of new eyewitness statements
submitted seven years after the fact by the Mexican government,
said Cornejo's lawyer, Deputy Federal Public Defender Craig Wilke.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling means that Cornejo can return to court with a
new appeal if the State Department decides he should be extradited.
That decision has not been made, but Wilke said he knows of no case
in which the department has refused extradition because of torture.
</P>
<P>
   The department has also adopted regulations saying the secretary
of State's decisions on extradition are final and not subject to
court challenge. However, the appeals court said judicial review
was provided by the new federal law, which requires the government
to abide by the terms of the U.N. Convention Against Torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual's right to be free from torture is an
international standard of the highest order,'' said the opinion
written by Judge Betty Fletcher. ``The secretary's duty to
implement the (law) is non-discretionary.''

`BIG BROTHER' IS WATCHING _ SHOULD YOU? 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   I am not sure why television
viewers might want to put aside an hour of their lives each
weeknight to watch television as it watches the lives of 10
strangers cooped up in a house for three months.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least the 10 people in the house have lives to live _ mainly
because they don't have a television to watch. So they have to
interact with each other.
</P>
<P>
   What a novel concept. CBS _ the network with, appropriately, a
big, unblinking eye for a logo _ introduced its ``Big Brother''
program to viewers last week. It's the urban version of
``Survivor,'' which precedes it by an hour on Wednesday evenings.
</P>
<P>
   CBS won the bidding war for what was originally a Dutch program
that the Netherlands Institute of Psychologists called
``irresponsible and unethical.'' But when a program's successful,
the idea is to spin off as many imitators as possible. So just as
``Greed'' is a knock-off of the chart-busting ``Who Wants to be a
Millionaire'' program, so is ``Big Brother'' the copycat of
``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   For those not content to watch merely five hours a week, there
is an official Web site where the cameras are always available:
www.bigbrother2000.com. (AOL users can simply type ``big brother''
_ without the quotes _ into their browser.) Finding it with a
search engine isn't easy, for in this paranoid world, there are
abundant sites concerned about Big Brother. But they're all antsy
about government watching people. This effort is a capitalistic
corporation doing the eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   Why anyone would want to watch live video feed connected through
a telephone modem on the Web is even a further mystery. The screens
are matchbox size. The resolution is far below television quality.
</P>
<P>
   But the viewing is unscripted. And that brings us to note of
another Web site mentioned on the Big Brother one:
www.getnetwise.org. (Note the ``.org'' ending instead of the more
common dot-com one.)
</P>
<P>
   GetNetWise is a consortium of Internet corporations and
public-interest organizations designed to help parents determine
how much access their children will have to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Established about a year ago, the site has four major areas. It
provides Internet safety tips to parents, teen-agers and children.
There are links to more than 100 tools that parents can use to
filter or block Internet activity, or to limit the amount of time a
child spends on the Web. Most are commercial programs available for
purchase; the site gives detailed descriptions of the software.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can learn how to report trouble online and information
about the Exploited Children CyberTipline. And finally, there is a
guide to ``green spaces'' that provide content appropriate for
children.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a link to the American Library Association's 700
Great Web Sites for Children
(http://www.ala.org/parentspage/greatsites/amazing.html).
</P>
<P>
   There are some very interesting sites there for children. And if
adults can turn off the television long enough, they, too, might
find some things of interest. Who knows: Once the television is
turned off, you might find you've been living with strangers in the
house all this time.

MY JOB: PAINS AND ROYAL PAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTINE KARLSSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I tell people at parties that I am a nurse, the question I
often get is: How on earth can you bear to empty bedpans? I usually
stop them short with this reply: ``My patients are too sick to use
bedpans.''
</P>
<P>
   I had never planned on nursing as a life-long career. But after
a few years into it, I realized I possessed a passion for working
with very sick people, and I took a job in the coronary intensive
care unit at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York's Greenwich
Village. I've been there for 14 years now.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day might start out quiet, but it rarely stays that
way. Suddenly, a three-star alarm reverberates in my well-trained
ear, my eyes dart to the monitor, and instead of normal heartbeats
passing on the screen, I see a wavy line indicating someone's heart
is about to stop. Panic comes close, but then I tell myself I must
remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   Even a moment of indecision can lead to severe harm or death to
a patient. As a team, doctors and nurses, we rush to the patient's
room and try to save him.
</P>
<P>
   When the resuscitation effort is over, there isn't much chance
to bask in the knowledge that I assisted in saving a life or, if
the patient dies, to grieve the loss and assist the family in their
grief, because my other patients need my attention.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I entered a patient's room after losing someone in a
cardiac arrest and was greeted with, ``Where were you? I asked you
for a box of tissues an hour ago.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to say, ``Listen, I just lost a patient.''
</P>
<P>
   But I realized he was scared and felt no control over the most
basic functions of his existence. My compassion overrode my
irritation, and I replied: ``I'm sorry you had to wait; I'll get
your tissues right now.''
</P>
<P>
   My career has also led me on adventures outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   One summer I worked as a volunteer in a clinic in North Carolina
that treated migrant workers from Central America who were employed
on the surrounding tobacco and potato farms.
</P>
<P>
   They were hard workers and wouldn't take time out for illness or
even to take medicine for their high blood pressure or diabetes. In
the evenings we would travel to the migrant camps and question the
occupants about any symptoms they might have experienced. This way
we could catch a few people before they were too ill for help at
the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   A year later I traveled to Tanzania, in Africa, as a member of a
medical team. We saw up to 200 patients a day in old buildings left
over from a mission.
</P>
<P>
   As we drove up, people lined the road and clapped. They were so
happy to have us there, they kept repeating, ``Asanti sana,'' which
is Swahili for ``thank you.'' I saw many symptoms of malnutrition,
which included thyroid problems in young children and infants
dehydrated because their mothers couldn't produce milk to feed
them.
</P>
<P>
   Two surgeons, another nurse and I set up an operating room. We
hung our IV's from the light fixtures and used the light of
midafternoon, along with two lamps, to work by. The high pain
threshold of the people amazed me. One man, after we removed a
hernia from his groin, got off the table and walked to a truck full
of people waiting for him. Surprisingly, there were no
postoperative infections.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people we saw there complained of general aches and
pains and we gave them aspirin and Tylenol. Soon people were coming
in asking for the pills. We thought the news of our great drugs for
treating pain had traveled.
</P>
<P>
   But the interpreters informed us the people were using the pills
as money to barter for goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   We laughed at ourselves for thinking we could impose our culture
on theirs.

  (Publication notes at end of review) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the course of her new book, ``Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel
and Women's Liberation,'' Andrea Dworkin makes some extraordinary
remarks aimed at bringing home her main point: that hatred of Jews
and hatred of women are two closely related consequences of a
similar thirst to dominate the weak.
</P>
<P>
   She quotes from a 1995 book on Arab women, for example,
asserting that the Israeli army ``may be the only one in the
world'' whose members routinely ``sexually expose themselves'' as
``a means to disperse Arab women demonstrators or groups of
women.'' Then, in a passage on the supposed subordination of women
in Judaism, she cites a rabbinical interpretation of adultery that,
according to Dworkin, allows men to be unfaithful to their wives.
One result of this theological ruse, she writes, is that ``Orthodox
Jews, post-Holocaust and in Israel, are major users of
prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   It is statements like these _ and there are numerous others in
Dworkin's new book _ that illustrate the intemperate, extremist and
intellectually seedy side to a book that in other respects is a
learned and thought-provoking etiology of hatred through history.
You don't have to be an avid supporter of Israel to feel a surge of
skepticism over that report of routine exposure as a crowd-control
method.
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin, however, ever ready to believe the worst about male
behavior, accepts it and reproduces it without any visible attempt
at verification. As for the frequency with which Israeli Orthodox
men visit prostitutes, one is naturally led to ask how Dworkin
would know that. She gives no source at all for this information,
though her book is generally heavily footnoted.
</P>
<P>
   There are, in short, many problems with this passionate,
overburdened and overwrought book, not the least of them that it is
more an angry rant than a cogent, careful argument. Dworkin's main
point is that the oppression both of women and of Jews through
history, of which there has certainly been a horrifyingly large
amount, reflects a kind of sexualized violence, a will to dominate.
In this sense, she argues, the Jews have been turned into women by
those who wanted to dominate them, the women into Jews. Or, as
Dworkin puts it:
</P>
<P>
   ``Contempt for Jews is warranted because contempt for women is
normative; both Jews and women have been locked in at night, Jews
in ghettos, women in houses. Because, like women, Jews have not
fought back, the men are taken to be biologically deviant in having
none of the violent pride that distinguishes men from women.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving aside that subtly insinuated notion that violent pride
is a universal male characteristic, there is certainly something to
that argument, which Dworkin substantiates in a wide-ranging ramble
through the rich history of human cruelty and depravity. She writes
with stylistic eloquence and command, and she has read widely. Her
new book is full of gripping passages on Nazi behavior, which
Dworkin rightly sees as an apex of sexualized human cruelty, and
she distills many of her ideas into pithy aphorisms: ``Every one of
these rapists is a Nazi; and every one of the raped is a Jew: Which
is to say that rape is a manifestation of sexual fascism, the woman
the scapegoated victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Scapegoat'' makes you think of one of those arcade
games in which enemies are always appearing out of the scenery and
you have to blow them away quickly, before you have a good chance
to see exactly who they are, and Dworkin sees many enemies. Her
overall conviction is that a sexualized will to dominate is a
historical constant, one that women will escape only when they hold
ultimate political power: ``Women either are the state or women are
resubordinated.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, ``Scapegoat'' continues the themes already
developed in past work by Dworkin, who has written many books on
violence against women. Her comment about Orthodox men and
prostitutes is part of a larger thesis developed in ``Scapegoat'':
Israelis have overcompensated for the historical weakness of
European Jews, their womanlike character of passivity in the face
of oppression, by becoming macho dominators themselves, of women
and of Palestinians, whose manhood has been taken away from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course once Jewish men became physical, no longer gentle or
weak, they had to own Jewish women in a new roughhouse sort of
way,'' she writes. And then: ``In male culture the nature of women
is simply a movable feast from whip wielder to abject victim; but
both justify eventual male violence.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if one shares Dworkin's natural horror at the
prevalence of violence against women, and at such phenomena as
female infanticide in China or the sexual apartheid practiced
against women in some Muslim countries, ``Scapegoat'' remains
untrustworthy, troubling in its extremism. Dworkin's book reads
like a catalog of infamous things with what often seem to be
isolated, or even aberrational instances, generalized to represent
an unspeakable whole.
</P>
<P>
   Her summary of Jewish theology and practice contains so many
half-truths and misinterpretations that it would take another book
to refute them all. Suffice it to say that it is not true that 613
of the religious commandments apply to men and only two to women,
or that women granted divorces by religious courts in Israel are
required to exit the scene bowing gratefully to their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Dworkin's indefatigable quest for the violence of the male
culture leads her to range widely. For example, she cites the
practice of suttee _ by which widows are burned alive on the
funeral pyres of their husbands _ to represent pretty much the
whole of the female condition in India. Nowhere does she tell us
how widespread this barbaric and illegal practice is, but she does
make this rather remarkable declaration: ``In India, women can be
murdered with impunity any time in life.'' No reasonable person
would declare India to be a feminist paradise, but Dworkin's
unsubstantiated allegations show more of a superheated imagination
than assiduous research.
</P>
<P>
   The unreliability of her reporting, the very avidity of her
quest to prove the absolute inevitability of testosterone-driven
violence, transforms ``Scapegoat'' from scholarship to a kind of
agitprop and spoils what might otherwise have been a vigorous
explanation for the worst in human behavior.

&HT;     HAMMER THROWER ON OLYMPIC THRESHOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Being the second-best hammer thrower in the
United States confers no special status for Kevin McMahon. He
throws the darn thing, he has to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
   It's like playing fetch with your dog . . . minus the dog.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon on a neglected practice field adjacent to
the running track at San Jose City College, McMahon went through
his lonely preparations for this week's U.S. Olympic Track &AMP; Field
Trials in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   He wound his body through four ever-faster rotations in the
7-foot cement throwing circle and released his 16-pound implement
at the peak of his momentum so as to take advantage of the
centrifugal force he generated.
</P>
<P>
   Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Once airborne, the hammer _ iron ball, steel cable and handle _
sailed out near a line of trees at ir,6p9,14l 230 feet. Once in a
while he nails a tree dead-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate doing that,'' he said, practically wincing at the
thought of wreaking damage to a living organism. Better a tree than
a person, a visitor suggests.
</P>
<P>
   At the Prefontaine Classic three weeks ago in Eugene, Ore.,
McMahon was witness to one of the horrors of the hammer throw. An
unwary official was struck on the arm by the cable of a flying
implement and suffered a compound fracture. McMahon saw the
accident as he waited his turn to throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I watched it, I fell to the ground. It was sickening,''
he said. ``My legs literally came out from under me. It was a
shock, a reality check. It's just a game and here this guy's life's
in danger. This is the only time I've seen that happen, and I've
been doing this 14 years.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon's is one of those stories that emerge in an Olympic
year, even though he's been at this arcane pursuit since he was 15.
Now 28, McMahon has been on three World Championship teams and one
Olympic team. He'll try for his second Olympic team on July 21 at
Sacramento State's Hornet Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on the threshold now of stepping up and making the final
in Sydney,'' said Ed Burke, McMahon's coach and himself an Olympic
hammer thrower in 1964, '68 and '84. ``That would be a huge
accomplishment for him. I know what he's capable of and he'll get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year McMahon extended his personal best to an even 260
feet, making him No. 2 in the country behind Lance Deal, whose
American record is 270-9. With Deal set to retire after the
Olympics, McMahon is poised to become No. 1 in the least glamorous
event in track and field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get in a competition with Lance and see how far we
can throw,'' McMahon said. ``He's retiring and that puts me in a
good spot. But I'd like to beat him before he retires.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon described throwing the hammer as a ``counterintuitive,
Zen movement,'' and explained by saying, ``You're doing less and
more is happening. You're letting go and the ball is throwing
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a little old-fashioned encouragement helps, too. Before
throwing his personal-best 260-0 last year, McMahon was going
through his paces in practice and not feeling too good about
himself. Then he noticed an indigent soul pushing a shopping cart
down the sidewalk next to the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This homeless guy stopped to watch me,'' McMahon said. ``He
said, `Keep it up,' and kept going. I believe in signs. It was one
more push in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a little Zen, a little Up With People or a word of
encouragement from a stranger, McMahon will take it. Being the
second-best hammer thrower in America doesn't come with many perks.

ISRAELI HIGH COURT UPHOLDS CONVICTION OF ORTHODOX POLITICAL
LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the
once-powerful leader of the strictly Orthodox Shas Party, Aryeh
Deri, should be jailed for three years, upholding his conviction
for bribery and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of investigations and litigation, the ruling
dashed Deri's hopes of returning to the party leadership and
disrupted what had been a meteoric career at the helm of the third
largest party in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept the sentence with love and happiness,'' said Deri,
41, as he left court surrounded by weeping and shouting supporters.
``This is from heaven. Although the judges are flesh and blood and
have free will, I believe that this is another test from God that
has to be passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Deri, for years a power broker whose support was
vital for governments of the left and the right, has riveted
Israelis and inflamed ethnic passions, exposing rifts between
Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews as well as secular and Orthodox
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The court scenes were broadcast live on television and replayed
on radio, overshadowing reports from the talks at Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling on an appeal by Deri, the court confirmed most of his
conviction by a lower court last year for bribery, fraud and breach
of trust. But it took a year off his four-year sentence, citing the
time elapsed since the crimes were committed and the damage already
inflicted on Deri's career. He will begin his term on Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Deri had been convicted of accepting bribes from three
associates in return for channeling large sums of public money to a
yeshiva in the late 1980s, he was director-general of the Interior
Ministry and interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   He is now barred from being a cabinet minister for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Deri has been sidelined from active politics since he resigned
as party chairman after the elections last year. Prime Minister
Ehud Barak made Deri's departure a condition for adding Shas to his
governing coalition, although Shas left the coalition this week to
protest Barak's participation in the Camp David talks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Drawing on religious sentiment and ethnic resentment among
working-class Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern and North African
origins, Deri, who was born in Morocco, built Shas into a party
able to make or break governments with its 17 seats in the
120-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his investigation and prosecution for corruption,
Deri had portrayed himself as a victim of religious and ethnic
persecution by secular Ashkenazic Jews of European origin, and he
mined feelings of resentment to reap gains at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   After news of the court ruling filtered to his supporters, they
denounced the sentence as another example of ethnic and
anti-religious oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are there trials against Jews in Iran, in the holy
city of Jerusalem Jews are judged in show trials,'' said Aryeh
Gamliel, a legislator from Shas. ``Secular judges, elites. If he
had blue eyes, he would have been acquitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Shas, Eli Yishai, compared Deri's conviction to
the handling of suspicions of bribery against former President Ezer
Weizman, who was not prosecuted, but resigned this week. ``This is
an indication of serious discrimination,'' Yishai said. ``It leaves
the Sephardic community with very hard feelings. As far as we're
concerned, Aryeh Deri is innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Deri went from court directly to the house of Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef, his mentor and the spiritual leader of Shas. Rabbi Yosef
declared that according to religious law Deri was innocent, and he
pronounced the Supreme Court judges ``wicked,'' Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Although Deri will be politically crippled, it is far from clear
that he will be permanently removed from political life.
Commentators noted that his sentence could eventually be reduced by
a third for good behavior and that he could be free in two years,
ready for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   A Shas statement said that Deri would ``continue to lead the
Sephardic community'' under Yosef's guidance. Yair Peretz, a
legislator who read the declaration, added that Deri would remain
``an active partner,'' but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Yishai, the party chairman, who is generally expected to
consolidate his leadership with Deri's departure, took pains to
declare his loyalty. ``When Aryeh Deri is released from jail,'' he
said, ``I'm handing him the leadership of the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   For the party faithful, Deri became something of a martyr.
``You're a righteous man, Aryeh,'' a supporter told him as he left
the courtroom. Another shouted, ``You're innocent and a political
scapegoat!''

 &HT;    GORE DISMISSES BUSH'S NAACP SPEECH AS ``CHEAP TALK''
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Vice President Al Gore, in an unusually spirited
appearance before a jubilant NAACP audience Wednesday, urged the
nation's largest and oldest civil rights organization to judge
Republican foe George W. Bush by his efforts on their behalf rather
than by his compassionate rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk is cheap _ it is deeds that matter,'' Gore, the
soon-to-be Democratic presidential nominee, said in reference to
the Texas governor's appearance at the NAACP's national convention
two days earlier, an appearance widely criticized for its lack of
specific proposals for combating racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you heard some nice sounding words,'' Gore, a former
seminary student, said as he created an old time Southern church
revival atmosphere in the dark cavernous meeting hall of the
downtown Baltimore Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   With some delegates shouting ``preach,'' the vice president then
quoted Christian scripture, from the New Testament Book of James:
``Yeah, a man may say thou has faith and I have works. Show me thy
faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my
works.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is MY text today,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, repeating the phrase ``talk doesn't cost much,''
contrasted his positions with Bush's on the issues most important
to the NAACP, noting his support for affirmative action, hate
crimes legislation, gun controls, an increase in the minimum wage,
expanded health care and combatting AIDs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to offer you generalities,'' he said. ``I want to
offer you specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his vow to end racial profiling by police, to
increase funding for school construction and teachers, to oppose
school voucher systems and to build on the economic policies of the
Clinton administration that has produced the lowest unemployment
among African Americans since the federal government began keeping
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Gore compared Bush's speech to the NAACP to his refusal to
support hate crime legislation in Texas at the request of the
family of James Byrd Jr., the African American who was dragged to
death by three white men in Jasper, Texas, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``When James Byrd is dragged to his death behind a pickup truck,
then the governor of his home state ought to at least heed the
family's plea for action,'' Gore said. ``One brief sentence that
said the word 'yes' would have mattered a whole lot more to the
cause of justice than a whole speech that didn't even mention hate
crimes, the future of the Supreme Court, taking down the
Confederate flag, ending racial profiling, or defending affirmative
action, or Bob Jones University.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing off the broken anti-tax-increase promise of Bush's
father, former President George Bush, Gore said, ``I'm not asking
you to read my lips. I'm asking you to read my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He also took aim at actor Charlton Heston, who is the president
of the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the leading critic of
Gore's gun control proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Heston's most famous role, as Moses in ``The Ten
Commandments,'' Gore again cautioned the NRA against counting on a
Bush victory in the fall election. In a line he has used before,
Gore said, ``The last time Moses took advice from a bush, his
people wandered in the wilderness for 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the only one of the four major presidential candidates who
is a member of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, referred several times to ``our people'' and
``marching together'' and opened his remarks with: ``It's good to
be home.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in reaction to the vice president's speech, NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume pronounced Gore ``a family member.''
Similarly, NAACP Chairman Julian Bond called Gore ``an old friend''
of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   William Lucy, an NAACP board member and fellow Tennessean,
introduced the vice president as someone who, ``unlike a lot of
people, has not just discovered the NAACP, has not just discovered
the problems of poor people, African-American people and people of
color.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy's remarks apparently sought to contrast Gore's numerous
appearances at previous NAACP conventions with the refusal of the
two most recent Republican presidential nominations to attend the
organization's annual gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on Monday, contrasted himself with other Republicans who
``have avoided the NAACP.'' But beyond vowing to enforce existing
civil rights laws, Bush did not specify to the NAACP how he would
combat racism in America.

civil rights laws, Bush did not specify to the NAACP how he would
combat racism in America.

<P>
   Last year Lance Armstrong, of Austin, Texas, won the grueling
Tour de France bicycle race after recovering from a brush with
death from testicular cancer. Despite the attention Armstrong
received, the United States remains one of the few places on earth
where cycling fans can't get live television broadcasts of all 21
races that make up the Tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   That may be just as well. The time difference between here and
France means that depending on where you are, catching an entire
daily stage of the three-week Tour live would mean losing sleep or
skipping work.
</P>
<P>
   But for cycling fans, temptation lurks in the form of the World
Wide Web. Although it doesn't offer live video of cycling's most
important race, at least one site has live audio in English and
many others offer up-to-the-minute text reports. For those patient
enough to wait until the action is over each day, the best Web
sites for the race shame traditional American media in terms of the
completeness of their information.
</P>
<P>
   The Societe du Tour de France was one of cycling's first
governing bodies to use the Web. It remains the master. The most
prominent feature of the site (www.letour.fr/2000/us/) is a stream
of text reports updating the race while it is underway. The updates
are largely based on reports from spotters in cars and on
motorcycles who travel close to the action. Known as Radio Tour,
this system is the main source of information for nearly everyone
following the race.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the route, a three-dimensional view of the mountains
and, of course, every result and race statistic are available on
the site. Elaborate graphics sometimes slow downloads.
</P>
<P>
   A new feature allows Web spectators to share an experience
formerly limited to the press corps: the daily post-race news
conferences. Now the whole world can watch the goings-on through
Webcasts, which are sometimes translated into English. Web visitors
can't ask questions, and when they see how stilted and artificial
the news conferences generally are, they may be thankful. This
portion of the site promises that visitors will ``experience it
like you were there.'' Unfortunately, it follows through.
</P>
<P>
   A particular page on the French language part of the site is
worth visiting even for those who can't read a word in the
language. It is a photo gallery depicting parts of the publicity
caravan, a shamelessly commercial parade of often bizarre vehicles
(www.letour.fr/caravane/fr/). It precedes the riders by about one
hour and tries to amuse one of the world's largest live, captive
audiences with noise, loud music and, above all, attractive young
men and women who toss out trinkets, free product samples and empty
shopping bags to hold all the junk.
</P>
<P>
   VeloNews is the only U.S.-based magazine devoted to bicycle
racing, as opposed to training or equipment. This year the magazine
has expanded its Tour de France coverage on the Web
(www.greatoutdoors.com/velonews/race/road/00tdf/). The experience
of the magazine staff _ the editorial director, John Wilcockson,
has followed the Tour for 32 years _ is apparent in its full race
reports. Unfortunately several hours sometimes pass between the end
of racing and their appearance. The site also offers the same
updated race reports found at the official Tour de France site.
</P>
<P>
   Not all VeloNews journalists are professional writers. Three
American professional riders in the race _ Tyler Hamilton, a
teammate of Armstrong's; Fred Rodriguez; and Chann McRae _ take
turns producing a behind-the-scenes diary for the site. Hamilton,
the most successful cyclist of the trio, is also the most promising
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one offers streaming video of the live race,
Eurosport (tour2000.eurosport.com/home.asp?LangueID(EQ)2) at least
has a poor man's substitute. While the race is in progress, the
satellite sports channel gives a streaming feed of the audio
portion of its broadcasts. To reach it, users click on a button
marked Radio Tour. Its English language television broadcast is
mainly viewed in the United Kingdom, so the coverage pays
particular _ sometimes excessive _ attention to riders from that
country.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, TV without pictures has limitations. The early and
ultimately meaningless portions of nonstrategic stages seem even
more tedious without views of the attractive French countryside to
pass the time. When something does happen, it can be frustrating to
listen to Eurosport's announcers pick apart something from an
invisible video replay.
</P>
<P>
   But this is as close to a live broadcast as Americans can get.
The expert commentary on many stages is provided by Sean Kelly, a
retired Irish rider who was once a leading Tour sprinter.
Unfortunately, one famous (and very plausible) cycling legend is
that the taciturn Kelly once shook his head to answer yes or no
during a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   A small daily video highlight package is also available. Its
viewers might first want to turn their speakers off. The soundtrack
is always a jarring mix of screams from the crowd and European
disco music.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site of Lance Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service cycling
team (www.uspsprocycling.com) offers two daily race reports. One is
written by a team official, the other by a public affairs person
from the sponsor. Neither is among the best reports available on
the Web, but the site does have some interesting features, like the
detailed description of a team bike by one of the team's mechanic,
Geoff Brown, who also offers an essay on the mechanic's role in
racing. There is also an excerpt from Armstrong's autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Far more elaborate is Nike's Tour site, which is reached through
the company's home page (www.nike.com), a sponsor of Armstrong and
the supplier of his team's clothing. In addition to the usual daily
stage reports, which focus mostly on Armstrong's analysis, the site
has a number of video and multimedia features. That means that
downloads can be taxing at dial-up modem speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Tour de France began in 1903 as a publicity gimmick for the
newspaper L'Auto, a predecessor of L'Equipe, a daily sports
newspaper based in Paris. The yellow leader's jersey that Armstrong
hopes to wear into Paris on July 23 is colored to match the paper
on which both newspapers were once printed.
</P>
<P>
   The race and the newspaper are operated separately today but are
part of the same corporate group. And no organization in the world
covers the Tour as thoroughly as L'Equipe. For all the race
participants, including the riders, it is the final word on the
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the newspaper's site (www.lequipe.fr) is costly by
Web standards. Once users register by setting up an awkward online
debit account, they can spend 1 Euro (about 95 cents) to buy the
right to view a specific issue of the paper electronically for up
to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with L'Equipe's awkward online purchasing process is the
least of most people's problems, because the site is written in
French. But for cycling fans who read French or have a willing
human translator or a reliable electronic one, there is no more
complete Tour source.

<P>
   This supposed return of the hip-hop collective Ruff Ryders is
really just rap trio the Lox _ more specifically, Jadakiss _
sluggishly boasting over Swizz Beatz's muscular tracks. Ruff Ryder
Eve shows up beside him on the likable Caribbean-tinged retread
``Got It All.'' And the rapid fire of Twista and Drag-On's
``Twisted Heat'' should have instant down-South appeal. But when
you think ``Ryde or Die Vol. II,'' you think follow-up to the
compilation on which Jay-Z and DMX were such standouts. Jay-Z's not
on this. And DMX only rears his barking head on the second to the
last song, as if an afterthought. Meanwhile, lesser storyteller
Jadakiss has basically released his upcoming solo album under
another title.

   Reunion albums like this one typically come in two varieties:
nostalgic dreck that merely relives a band's glory days or a strong
return that enhances, rather than tarnishes, its reputation. This
outing by these veteran Atlanta prog-rockers is squarely in the
latter camp and may be the best album Kansas has produced since
1976's ``Leftoverture.'' The first record in 16 years with original
composer-guitarist Kerry Livgren, ``Somewhere'' seamlessly fuses
Brit art-rock textures with an American-heartland sound and ranks
with the band's best. Four tracks are 7-minute-plus orchestral-rock
suites _ critics will hate them, fans will relish the '70s-style
workouts. And two standout tracks, ``Icarus II'' and ``When the
World Was Young,'' emphasize the band's unabashed return to form by
quoting themes from earlier Kansas masterworks, ``Icarus'' and
``Magnum Opus.''Kansas plays Lakewood Amphitheater with Yes on July
30.

   London prog-rockers Yes are still the best reason to deprogram
classic rock from your car stereo, but there's a point on the new
album by Sunny Day Real Estate that the Seattle-born band really
makes you appreciate Yes. It's in the flowery but mighty song ``The
Ocean.'' Sunny Day's humorless singer Jeremy Enigk raises his voice
falsetto-like over some crisp, electrified guitar chords, sounding
like Jon Anderson had he been a Husker Du fan (Husker producer Lou
Giordano is at the helm). The tune is powerful, arty and emotional,
but it's largely unlike anything SDRE has ever done. The band is
mixing things up like never before. The music is mellower, but the
differences are more complex. Sunny Day Real Estate performs
tonight at the Masquerade.

 &HT;    Washington packs a punch as boxer
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Part bio, part revisionist hogwash, ``The Hurricane'' is the
hard-hitting story of boxer Rubin ``Hurricane'' Carter, a talented
1960s middleweight contender convicted of three murders he didn't
commit and who, once railroaded, ended up serving nearly 20 years
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Director Norman Jewison's film often ducks, dodges and dances
around the truth. But it does have Denzel Washington, whose
performance as the sometimes punchy, sometimes spiritual pugilist
is darned near perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Was Washington robbed of a best actor Oscar? (He lost this year
to ``American Beauty's'' Kevin Spacey.) Many think so. As Carter,
Washington is often a revelation. The actor spent months beefing up
his body and preparing for the wonderfully filmed fight sequences.
And mentally, he captures both Carter's toughness and his spiritual
awakening with remarkable believability.
</P>

   OTHER NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``All About My Mother'' (R) _ Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro
Almodovar grows up with this humane, Oscar-winning celebration of
nurturing women. A tribute to actresses (of all kinds), ``All About
My Mother'' is a virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by
that backstage classic, ``All About Eve.'' It's a movie that can
wink at its own campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the
gut. Dark and tender in equal measures, the movie beautifully
balances humor and heartache. In Spanish with subtitles. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Boiler Room'' (R) _ A high-powered descendant of ``Wall
Street'' and ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed
stockbrokers aiming to make their first million before getting
their first wrinkle pays onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's
a bracing reminder that greed is still good _ so long as you don't
get caught when you pretzel the rules. Grade: B +
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``My Dog Skip'' (PG) _ Good dog movie. Based on the late
Willie Morris' best seller about growing up in small-town 1940s
Mississippi, this family film is a gentle remembrance of how things
can pass from our lives but never really leave us. Nine-year-old
Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz) is a shy only
child whose life changes when his mother (Diane Lane) gives him a
Jack Russell terrier puppy, despite dad's (Kevin Bacon) objection.
Priced to buy: $22.96 VHS, $24.98 DVD. Grade: B +
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mansfield Park'' (PG-13) _ A bit clueless. Patricia Rozema's
contemporary take on Jane Austen's third novel adds dollops of
lesbianism, feminism and social consciousness to Austen's
19th-century tale of Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a poor girl
shipped off to live with her wealthy relatives, the Bertrams, at
Mansfield Park. Rozema extrapolates bits of Austen's journals into
Fanny's own writing. The result is a kind of grad student thesis,
melding character and author. It seems that Rozema didn't trust her
material. Grade: C

 &HT;    Hollywood trains wary eye on television
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will we survive ``Big Brother''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, we made it past George Orwell's ``1984'' _ and two film
versions of it. So, with luck, television's ``Survivor,'' ``Making
the Band,'' ``The 1900 House,'' ``The Real World'' and ``Road
Rules'' won't do us in.
</P>
<P>
   When Hollywood isn't spending time being afraid of television,
it makes movies about television. Like ``EdTV'' and ``The Truman
Show.'' Anybody wonder anymore whether Jim Carrey's big-screen
dramedy was too far-fetched or that a U.S. network would be dumb
enough to re-create it?
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few more videos that take a harder look at TV:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Being There'' (1979) _ Peter Sellers plays the childlike
Chauncy Gardner, a man who knows life only through television and
whose odd, near silent responses are perceived by powerful people
as luminous. It's a biting, sometimes savage, depiction of modern
America adapted by Jerzy Kosinski from his own novel.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Face in the Crowd'' (1957) _ Or, perhaps, the life story
of ``Survivor's'' Richard Hatch. Andy Griffith plays a homespun
gadabout who gets discovered and is put on TV. His ego soars into
the stratosphere. ``This whole country's just like my flock of
sheep,'' Griffith's Lonesome Rhodes says. ``Hillbillies, hausfraus
_ everybodies that got to jump when somebody blows a whistle!
They're mine!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Videodrome'' (1983) _ James Woods is plagued by
hallucinatory transmissions in David Cronenberg's out-there tale of
a throbbing TV set. Andy Warhol reportedly called the film ``The
`Clockwork Orange' of the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Manchurian Candidate'' (1962) _ Director John
Frankenheimer's intriguing Cold War tale of politics and
brainwashing includes a riveting Capitol Hill scene illustrating
television's potential as a means to power. It's a televised press
conference with plenty of McCarthy-like grandstanding. Insider
fact: All the platoon members held in Korea were named after the
cast and crew of 1955's ``The Phil Silvers Show.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Pleasantville'' (1998) _ Two modern teens (Tobey Maguire and
Reese Witherspoon) are sucked into their TV and transported to the
swell world of a '50s black-and-white series.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``THX 1138'' (1971) _ George Lucas expanded upon the short
film he made at the University of Southern California, depicting a
futuristic world where sex is not allowed and mankind is closely
monitored via television.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Network'' (1976) _ We're mad as hell, and not going to take
this anymore. Paddy Chayefsky's devastating black comedy marries
news and entertainment, features a mad prophet of the airwaves
(Oscar winner Peter Finch's Howard Beale) and bitterly displays how
and why a network will do anything for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Quiz Show'' (1994) _ Based on the TV game show scandal of
the 1950s, it's Robert Redford's ``Who Wants to Be a Cad?'' with a
solid performance from Ralph Fiennes and a remarkable one from John
Turturro. Memorable lines: ``Sixty-four thousand dollars for a
question. I hope they're asking you the meaning of life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``My Favorite Year'' (1982) _ Live television of the '50s gets
skewered in this comedy about an alcoholic action-adventure movie
star (the Oscar-nominated Peter O'Toole) guest-starring on 1954's
top comedy show.

 &HT;    `Nutty Professor II' soundtrack makes the grade
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, it's only fitting that a movie featuring Eddie Murphy
playing more than one character would have an accompanying
soundtrack of rappers and singers taking on different _ and often
flattering _ roles.
</P>
<P>
   Balladeer Brian McKnight does a Babyface imitation on ``Thinkin'
Bout Me,'' a left-at-the-altar lament that shares the building song
structure, lush arrangement and yearning of Face's standards. (The
difference being Babyface probably wouldn't do a cocky song
claiming his ex-girlfriend is thinking about him while she's with
her new husband.)
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta producers Tim &AMP; Bob drop gritty vocalist Case into a
swirl of strings and elegance on ``Missing You,'' the kind of
backdrop usually associated with McKnight or Joe.
</P>
<P>
   And artist Musiq introduces himself on ``Just Friends (Sunny)''
by wrapping himself in the warm keyboards and coolness of D'Angelo
_ minus a little of D'Angelo's smoothness. But the scene snatchers
are Jay-Z's charismatic boast ``Hey Papi'' and Redman &AMP; Eminem's
rugged and appropriately titled ``Off the Wall.'' Both earn the
starring role of lead single that Janet Jackson holds, and lazily
portrays, on the airy collection of coos called ``Doesn't Really
Matter.'' Rightly so.
</P>

   `Nutty Professor II' soundtrack

 &HT;    Bruschetta: A slice of heaven, with love from Italy
 &HT;    By Susan Puckett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Still riding the high of a two-week vacation in Italy, my
husband and I contemplated what to have for dinner our first night
back in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   We weren't up to any heavy-duty cooking or multi-course
feasting, but we did hope to prolong our euphoria at least a little
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll come up with something,'' Jim offered.
</P>
<P>
   When I got home from work, Jim was outside grilling. I saw what
he had in his tongs: a slice of bread. I smiled. We were both
craving the same thing: bruschetta.
</P>
<P>
   He rubbed the hot bread with a cut garlic clove and doused it
with our best extra-virgin olive oil, just as they do in Italy.
With the topping, though, he took a few creative liberties; to the
usual chopped tomato and fresh herb base, he added diced grilled
Japanese eggplant and grilled corn kernels.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, that was one combination we never encountered in our
travels. But since bruschetta toppings tend to reflect the best of
the region's bounty, to me it remained true to the spirit of what
we sampled everywhere we went _ from Venice to Florence to Rome,
and everywhere we stopped in between.
</P>
<P>
   Before our vacation, I thought I pretty much knew everything
there was to know about bruschetta. For the past couple of decades,
Italy's version of garlic bread has shown up in some form at just
about every Italian-influenced restaurant and
trying-hard-to-be-trendy cocktail party in America. So mainstream
is it nowadays that even Betty Crocker has an interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for me to realize _ thanks to a polite
Florentine waiter who corrected me _ that I didn't even know how to
pronounce it (broo-SKETT-ah, not broo-shett-ah). Or that nearly all
my previous bruschetta encounters were but pale imitations of the
real thing: flame-toasted, rustic bread, redolent of fresh garlic,
grill smoke and fruity, peppery-tasting olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   That is bruschetta at its most elemental _ as it has been for
hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   In her award-winning book, ``The Italian Country Table,'' Lynne
Rossetto Kasper writes that making bruschetta (derived from
bruciare, meaning to burn or toast) has long been a ritual at
olive-harvesting time in the fall and winter. When the farm
families haul the olives to the local mill to be crushed into oil,
there's usually an open fire nearby to warm cold hands, and to
toast bread.
</P>
<P>
   As the fresh oil pours from the mill's spigot, the farmers rub a
little oil onto their hands and inhale its fragrance. They taste it
from a spoon to discern its individual flavor qualities. Then they
saturate freshly toasted bread with the brand-new oil and eat it
with reckless abandon. In their homes throughout the year, they
take it a step further, rubbing the bread first with garlic before
adding the oil, then topping it with whatever they like.
</P>
<P>
   I got hooked on the most popular version, in which the sweet,
summery juices of perfectly ripe, diced scarlet tomatoes saturate
the bread and intermingle with the oil and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Often the topping was flecked with a few shreds of basil or
arugula, as well as a sprinkling of coarse-grained sea salt,
intensifying the flavors all the more. I found myself ordering it
as a starter to a four-course dinner in white-tablecloth hideaways,
as well as for a quick bite from a snack bar in a tourist-packed
piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Even in clearly mediocre eateries, I discovered, bruschetta was
generally a safe bet.
</P>
<P>
   So was the crostini (``little toasts'') _ similar to bruschetta
but usually thinner and crunchier, with somewhat more refined
toppings that usually are warm: a chicken liver spread, a spicy
tomato sauce, or tapenade covered with melted mozzarella. But there
are so many interpretations nowadays of each that the words are
often used interchangeably.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Betti knows the difference. He and his chef brother,
Alessandro, serve both _ often as part of an antipasto platter _ at
Antica Posta, the popular Tuscan restaurant they opened in Buckhead
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Just as their family still does at its other restaurant back
home in the Chianti region near Florence, they keep the toppings
brazenly simple _ tomatoes or cannellini beans for the bruschetta;
chicken liver spread or sauteed wild mushrooms for the crostini.
</P>
<P>
   While crostini has been around at least as long as bruschetta,
its heritage is more aristocratic than agrarian, Betti explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``At even the best tables, it was very common for meals to be
served without plates or utensils. Instead, the food was placed on
slices of bread, and people would eat with their hands. The
crostini bread was normally baked only once a week, so it was hard
to bite. But back then, food _ especially inexpensive cuts _ were
cooked for a longer time, and the sauce that collected at the
bottom of the pot would help soften the bread and make it easier to
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   The chicken liver spread, which they flavor with anchovies,
capers and sage, is his favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crostini and chicken liver has been around forever in Italy,''
he points out. ``There is a reason it has lasted so long: It is the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summertime, he also likes bruschetta (Tuscans call it
``fettunta'') that's been rubbed heavily with the cut side of a
tomato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people take the seeds out first; I don't _ I love them,''
he says. ``It's a personal thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Or he'll chop the tomato and let it marinate in olive oil with
salt and pepper, along with a whole, peeled garlic clove _ then
heap it on toast the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an Italian breakfast, good for when you're too busy to
sit down and eat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, bruschetta is a healthy, delicious alternative to
convenience food if we're eating on the run, especially during hot
weather, when appetites wane.
</P>
<P>
   But it also adapts easily to just about any type of
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   While you've got the grill fired up for a cookout, toss a few
bread slices on and whip out a near-instant appetizer before you
put on the steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Or pack them for a picnic: Most are best eaten at room
temperature, making them ideal candidates for toting.
</P>
<P>
   A friend recently told me about her mom's fabulous bruschetta
parties: She sets a buffet with trays of olive oil-slathered toast,
along with bowls of toppings and garnishes, and invites guests to
assemble their own.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the perfect plan to lure our friends over for the
Italy vacation picture show.

 &HT;    Cultivating Caribbean cuisine
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps this won't be your year for that dreamed-of Caribbean
vacation. Or maybe you got that wonderful white island sand between
your toes already and want to keep the feeling alive. Besides
looking longingly at travel brochures or vacation pictures and
listening to steel drum CDs, one effective way to sustain the magic
of the Caribbean is to bring the taste of the islands into your
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   While more ethnic and specialty markets make acquiring
ingredients much easier, Caribbean cuisine is difficult to
pigeonhole. The culinary influence and traditions of the French,
Spanish, British, Dutch, Indian, West African, Portuguese, Italian,
Moroccan, Chinese and others have co-mingled with the luscious and
abundant native fruits, vegetables, seafood and spices to produce a
heady melange that is hard to define. And to this worldly pastiche,
don't forget to add the contributions of the original inhabitants
of the Caribbean, the Arawaks and the Carib Indians. Food
historians credit them with bringing to the world nothing less than
the gastronomic institutions of spicing food with chili peppers and
barbecuing.
</P>
<P>
   If the seasonings are bold and unique, the rubs and marinades
ambrosial, colors bodacious, sauces light, with imaginative and
unexpected pairings of fruits and vegetables with fish and meat, it
just might come from one of the islands of the Caribbean. Finding
out exactly what Caribbean cuisine encompasses can lead you on a
pleasant voyage of discovery.

Caribbean cuisine has a fatty reputation you can still have your
arroz y frijoles and eat them too.
</P>
<P>
   For an insider's look at what's happening in Caribbean kitchens,
see Paul Franson's article ``Finding the New Caribbean Cuisine'' at
www.franson.com/caribean.htm. The author -- uggests that if you
want to find the real food of the Caribbean you won't find it at
many tourist restaurants. Franson says that ``nobody has ever gone
to an English (or Dutch) island for the food,'' which is not the
case with the French islands. He also sheds some light on how
politics and history influence what visitors eat. He sites Antigua,
which revolted against slavery 150 years ago, but the local people
still don't like to work in the fields picking food they know will
be consumed by wealthy tourists. As a result, the most common food
on Antigua is chicken imported from Georgia or Arkansas. Franson
offers authentic recipes including roti, an East Indian burrito
that has become popular; akkras, a spicy fritter composed primarily
of black-eyed peas that suggests falafel of the Middle East;
avocado and papaya salad and the classic conch chowder.

 &HT;    Hold the mayo? With pasteurized eggs, not anymore
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've discovered mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   I realize this is a bit like saying Columbus discovered America,
never mind the folks who were already here. And I know some are
wondering how I could possibly be a true Southerner if I'm only now
discovering mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is I grew up on Miracle Whip. But I'm not talking about
Duke's or Hellman's anyway. I'm talking about the real stuff,
homespun with just the right drizzle of oil and squirt of lemon
juice.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I started venturing beyond cooking basics, health
safety experts were bellowing raw-egg warnings full blast. So
making something that consisted largely of raw eggs seemed like a
full-blown invitation to salmonella enteritis.
</P>
<P>
   Enter pasteurized eggs. Currently, Harris-Teeter grocery stores
have the exclusive rights on the eggs, sold under the brand name of
Davidson's. Soon they'll be offered in most major grocery store
chains. The eggs have been gently rolled through a series of warm
water baths to kill bacteria, making them safe for such once
forbidden delights as meringue, mousse and mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Recipe tester Margaret Ann Surber and I recently put the eggs to
the test, to see how well they'd perform in a number of recipes
from simple scrambled eggs to a genoise.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the eggs performed well, with only slight differences
detectable in side-by-side taste tests. The home cook, of course,
is unlikely to be offering side-by-side samples. More likely, folks
will pick up a dozen to make a recipe calling for raw eggs and then
wonder if it's cool to use the rest in daily cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes. With one exception, the differences are
slight. The pasteurized eggs have cloudy whites, a paler color and
a tad less flavor than regular eggs. This is most noticeable with
scrambled eggs, less so with baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   We tried the eggs in two different cakes _ a dense flourless
chocolate cake and a lighter, spongy genoise. In both cases, the
pasteurized egg batter puffed up more by about 20 percent. But once
cooled, it fell and was shorter than the cake made with regular
eggs. The taste was virtually the same.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference came with whipping egg whites. The
pasteurized eggs are harder to separate and the whites take much
longer to whip. We whipped five regular eggs to stiff peaks in 1
minute and 10 seconds, yielding 6 cups. The pasteurized eggs took 8
minutes and yielded only 3 1/2 cups.
</P>
<P>
   We used the whipped whites to make a chocolate mousse and found
both versions tasty, though the pasteurized egg version was thinner
because of less egg white volume.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, mayonnaise. Here, the pasteurized eggs work like
champs, accentuating the flavor of the oil and lemon. So, now that
it's safe, why not give homemade a try?
</P>
<P>
   Mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1 3/4 cup oil into a measuring cup and set aside. It can be
vegetable oil or olive oil or a combination. In a blender or food
processor, add 1 whole egg, 2 egg yolks, 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard,
1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   Begin blending on a medium speed and slowly drizzle in the oil.
It should take about 3 minutes to drizzle in 1 cup oil. Stop the
blender, stir and taste. Add more lemon juice if desired. Begin
blending again, taking another 2-3 minutes to drizzle in remaining
oil. You'll have about 2 cups.

 &HT;    Cobb salad isn't always what you think
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Usually a Cobb salad's a plateful of lettuce topped by your
favorite ingredients. Restaurants often serve them in the style of
the original, born at Hollywood's Brown Derby restaurant _ with
pretty lines of grilled chicken, avocados, blue cheese, bacon, eggs
and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   June Florence of Douglasville, Ga., saw an all-fruit version on
a TV cooking show, but couldn't jot down the ingredients. So she
asked our readers for help.
</P>
<P>
   No one came forward, and a quick search at foodtv.com proved
futile.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we came across a main-dish version that's Chicago
chef Charlie Trotter's favorite _ mesclun mix lined with grilled
beef, prosciutto, avocado and quail eggs. It's certain to appeal to
those with heartier summertime appetites for meatier toppings.
</P>
<P>
   As for the lighter fruit toppings, we'll keep searching.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Cooking time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Trotter, known for his five-star namesake restaurant in
Chicago, five cookbooks and a television series called ``The
Kitchen Sessions With Charlie Trotter,'' says laying out the
ingredients in artful rows creates a striking composition that's
worth the extra trouble.
</P>
<P>
   1 shallot, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups peeled and diced (see directions) red and yellow
tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   8 cups (about 1/2 pound) mesclun mix
</P>
<P>
   8 slices prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   16 quail eggs (available at Harry's Farmers Markets)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups diced avocado (about 2 large, or 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces beef tenderloin, grilled, cooled and diced
</P>
<P>
   12 grilled green onions, chilled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups crumbled blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons 1-inch pieces chives
</P>
<P>
   To make the vinaigrette: Place shallot and lemon juice in a
small bowl. Slowly whisk in olive oil, fold in chopped chives and
season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare the salad: Bring a small pot of water to a boil.
Using a paring knife, cut a small X at the bottom of each tomato.
Put tomatoes in boiling water and let boil approximately 5 minutes.
Remove tomatoes. Peel and dice. Toss with 2 tablespoons vinaigrette
and season to taste. Set aside. Toss mesclun mix with half the
vinaigrette and season to taste. Set aside. Cut prosciutto into
narrow strips and set aside. Place quail eggs in a small pot of
water. Bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Cool, peel and
quarter. Set aside. Peel and chop avocado and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place tenderloin on hot grill and cook for 15 to 20 minutes,
depending on thickness. Place green onions on grill and cook for 5
to 8 minutes, turning often and watching carefully because they can
burn quickly. When cool, cut tenderloin into cubes and chop onions.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange some of the mesclun greens in the center of each plate.
Place some of the prosciutto in a vertical line along the left side
of the greens. Next arrange some of the quail eggs, avocado,
tomatoes, beef, blue cheese and green onions. Top with freshly
ground black pepper and sprinkle with chive pieces. Drizzle with
remaining vinaigrette.

 &HT;    Apartment makeover that goes from drab to fab
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little apartment, little furniture, little money? No problem.
With a little creativity, you can still turn the space you're in
into the home you want.
</P>
<P>
   Begin by picking a theme that reflects your personal style and
that makes the most of the furnishings you already have.
</P>
<P>
   If what you own is a product of garage sales, thrift shops and
hand-me-downs, think eclectic. When done right, the look can be hip
and Bohemian.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to go for an ethnic theme that incorporates
accessories such as African sculptures, Asian screens or Indian
batik prints. One suggestion: Avoid the United Nations approach and
stick to one country.
</P>
<P>
   Got a sense of humor and a collection of offbeat whatnots? Go
kitsch. Or, if you prefer a chic, clean look without knickknacks,
try a minimalist theme.
</P>
<P>
   Defining your home's look is the easy part. The challenge is
putting it together without breaking your bank account.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate how to create your home's personalized look, we
consulted the professionals: Interior designers Candace A. McNair,
of Bright Ideas Interior Design in Marietta, Ga., and Heriberto J.
Brito and Margaret Gilchrist Serrato, of the Atlanta design firm
Brito Serrato.
</P>
<P>
   On a budget of $500 per room, the team transformed a dark,
sparsely furnished, one-bedroom unit at the Post Stratford
apartments in Buckhead into an inviting pad with an urban
contemporary theme. If $500 is too much for you right now, set a
figure that you can live with and take your time decorating.
There's no need to buy everything at once.
</P>
<P>
   The key to shopping is looking for merchandise that makes a
statement that's uniquely yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always personalize with something nobody else has, whether
it's handmade or something from e-bay,'' advises Brito.
</P>
<P>
   LIVING/DINING ROOM
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The challenge: ``The room was very dull and cold,'' says
McNair. ``My job was to warm it up and give it personality and
character.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The solution: McNair created a boundary between the living and
dining areas by placing a brown print throw rug under the coffee
table. The colors in the rug coordinate with the gold-brown, green
and blue shades in the sofa and pillows. This helps draw attention
away from the mousy gray wall-to-wall carpet. Two of the four
dining table chairs were placed in the living room against a wall
facing the sofa. Fewer chairs made the dining area appear more
spacious. McNair placed multicolor square tableware on the dining
room table. The green bowl, yellow salad plate and blue dinner
plate complement the colors in the area rug and pillows on the
sofa. The square shape of the dishes resembles the square patterns
on the pillows, creating an effect of repetition. McNair made life
imitate art by putting fresh irises in a vase on the dining table,
to mirror a scene in a van Gogh print she hung on the dining room
wall. Faux grass in square metal containers was placed on either
side of the table settings to add a splash of greenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every space needs a sense of humor. This brings a
little outdoors in, and it's just kind of fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other accessories purchased to jazz up the living/dining room
include metal picture frames for family photos, two pieces of
contemporary art for the walls, coffee-table books on Atlanta and
abstract art, an antique compote of Italian fruit, a rock fountain,
a silver vase and coaster set, and a trio of candles with glass
candleholders and decorative rocks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Total for two rooms: $847.56
</P>
<P>
   BEDROOM
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The challenge: ``To work on a room that was claustrophobic,
dark and awkward to circulate in,'' says Brito.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The solution: He gave the room more space by removing a large
chest of drawers that swallowed an entire wall and by rearranging
the bed so the headboard can be seen from the hallway. Black
plastic modular drawers were placed side by side at the foot of the
bed, providing nine drawers for personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have something at the end of the bed to hold bed
linen,'' Brito said.
</P>
<P>
   Brito and Serrato thought the room's table lamps were clunky, so
they replaced them with an adjustable goose-neck lamp for the night
table. A mirror was placed on the other night table to create an
illusion of space. They also put a floor lamp in a corner to bounce
light toward the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The animal-print bedding gives the room a strong graphic pattern
and blends with the candles on the night stand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of one large picture, Brito and Serrato put three
similarly themed pictures on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They add a certain horizontal effect,'' Brito said.
</P>
<P>
   For final touches and to make the room feel homier, they added a
bed tray and a small handful of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One fresh flower can do more than two static arrangements,''
Brito said. ``You want to create visual impact by using quality,
not quantity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Total: $484
</P>
<P>
   KITCHEN
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The challenge: ``The kitchen was bland. It was black and
white, and it needed to have some personality and zip,'' McNair
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The solution: Fresh flowers and fruit placed in colorful
ceramic bowls and a miniature metal shopping cart add color,
texture and shape to the kitchen. Artificial fern and grape ivy
were spread on top of the cabinets to soften the room without
cluttering it. A teapot designed by architect Michael Graves and a
set of knives in a butcher-block holder from J. A. Henckles
International are both decorative and functional.
</P>
<P>
   McNair made the kitchen more inviting by adding cookbooks, a
miniature wicker chair that doubles as a conversation piece and
bookend, a framed mirror, a wall clock, a black leather throw rug,
checkered dish towels, a decorative olive oil set, a small black
easel that can be used for recipes or messages and a framed picture
of a chef.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Total: $418.23

<P>
   Decorating your pad
</P>
<P>
   Whether your pad is small, medium-sized or large, some general
things to take into consideration when decorating are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lighting. Use it for warmth and function. Low voltage light is
clear and crisp and can be directed where it's needed most.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Furniture: Make sure the size of furniture fits the space.
Don't put large, oversized pieces in a small room unless you limit
it to one or two items. A sectional couch has limited use because
it is designed to fit an ``L'' shaped space and the units don't
separate well.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Think flexibility and dual-function when buying and arranging
furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Continuity: Don't send mixed signals when decorating. For
example, don't do one room in a contemporary theme and country in
another because it confuses the eye, especially in small
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mirrors reflect light and make a room feel more open. Candles
soften a room and provide a sense of peace and tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Area rugs can be used to define space, provide color and
texture or mask badly stained or ugly carpets. When using more than
one rug, make sure they are compatible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Eliminate clutter. Edit your rooms by removing objects you
don't use or that don't blend with the decor. Keep it simple,
whatever the theme.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When decorating on a thin budget, visit garage sales, thrift
shops, Dollar stores and discount chains. Furniture that requires
assembly looks good and can tide you over until you can afford
better quality items. Go to stores out of your price range to scout
for items you like. Then look for knockoffs at stores you can
afford.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Deep warm colors such as reds, oranges and yellows make a room
feel intimate and cozy. Cool colors such as blues and greens make a
room seem more spacious. If your landlord won't let you paint white
or neutral toned walls, play up your color scheme with curtains,
pillows, lamps, candles, throws, rugs and other accessories.

 &HT;    Neighborly chats now extend beyond the fence
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gardeners always have known that talking about plants, sharing
experiences, is a large part of what makes digging in the dirt such
a powerful connection. What gardener hasn't chatted with a stranger
at a nursery, making a comfortable acquaintance _ and sometimes a
friend?
</P>
<P>
   These days, gardening chats extend beyond the neighborly fence
and the plant nursery and the words on paper. Now, more and more,
we chat electronically. Not that our e-chats ever will replace
face-to-face ones, but what a pleasure it is to read impassioned
words about the natural world, transmitted through technology so
different from a shovelful of dirt. Thankfully, such chats make the
technology seem more a part of life, natural life.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some of my electronic gardening talk with Alice Bengel of
Norcross, Ga., who writes about her coneflower conversion and a
revealing visit to an area store:
</P>
<P>
   I stood before an outdoor display of sun-parched perennials,
mostly coneflowers, that had been badly neglected. Bone dry, the
soil in their one-gallon pots was cracked and had pulled away from
the edges. Many were wilted to the point of being crisp, but as I
picked through them, I saw that some were merely limp and perhaps
salvageable. For the others, most of which were echinacea's stately
'Bravado' variety, I had simply arrived too late.
</P>
<P>
   When we purchased our first house in the winter of 1996, we
unknowingly inherited several perennial beds and a mailbox full of
gardening catalogs addressed to the former occupants or ``current
resident.'' The gorgeous blooms in the catalogs hypnotized me, and
it was in those catalogs that I saw my first purple coneflower. It
did not impress me. It was too simple, not showy enough, weedy
even, and I allowed myself to be seduced by more delicate and
graceful flowers as I eagerly filled out the order forms, sans
coneflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, though, I found myself turning back to the
coneflowers. I studied the catalog photos and looked up echinacea
in my brand-new gardening books. Drought-tolerant, I found. Grows
in full sun or part shade. Tolerates poor soil. As I continued to
study the pictures and pore over their descriptions, I felt a
conversion taking place. I planted my first purple coneflowers last
summer _ in the voids left by the more delicate and graceful
flowers that had failed me -_ and they have exceeded my
expectations. I am hooked.
</P>
<P>
   I have found a kinship with these plants, seen their inner
beauty even asl as yet, and with the rest of a parched summer ahead
of them, they are not out of the woods. As forecasts call for much
sun and little rain, planting perennials over July 4 weekend is
barely short of reckless. Still, I could no more have left them
where they were than I could have left a friend in a pit of
alligators.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Alice Bengel,
</P>
<P>
   I do understand. Many a time I've rescued suffering but not yet
dead plants from killer nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   Your conversion is familiar. And I predict it will intensify. I
am drawn to natives for all the reasons you know _ their hardiness,
drought-tolerance. Increasingly, I love them for their essence;
native plants dispense with frills but don't skimp on beauty and
fragrance. Their sharp smells and lean profiles and natural angles
provide pleasures unrivaled by cultivated cousins.
</P>
<P>
   While your holiday weekend focused on planting rescued
coneflowers, mine was spent on my spit of land in Fannin County,
Ga., putting in gift plants from friends across the ridge in Rabun:
mountain mint, big-leaf trillium, ginseng, bee balm. Great joy. For
you, too, with coneflowers, I hope.

 &HT;    Lifetime's Katie Brown puts paint, borders in prime spot
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Katie Brown, a lifestyle expert and host of Lifetime
TV's ``Next Door With Katie Brown,'' knows how to decorate a home
on the cheap. For her, it's all about color.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite decorating tool when you don't have much money is
paint,'' Brown said during a recent visit to Atlanta. ``You bring
more life in with shades of yellow, blue and colors you find in
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't paint an entire room or accent wall, you can
improvise by designing your own border.
</P>
<P>
   They are easy to make with brown packing tape, Brown said. The
adhesive backing is strong enough to stick to walls without
buckling and can be removed without chipping paint.
</P>
<P>
   To create a border: Trace the pattern you want to use; cut out
the pattern and glue it to a sanding block; dip the block in paint
and blot it on the smooth side of the tape until the strip is
covered. When it dries, apply the tape to the wall as you would any
border.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips from Brown:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Paint mismatched wood furniture with a colorful, high-gloss
marine paint to make the pieces look uniform and coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Have photos or postcards enlarged to be used as pictures.
Purchase inexpensive picture frames from a discount or thrift
store. Border the glass on the frame with etching cream to create a
mat effect. Let dry, then insert the photo or postcard in the frame
and hang.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Give a bed without a headboard a new look with a curtain rod.
Install the rod behind the bed and drape a sheet around it that
matches your bedding or decor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make reversible curtains using winter and summer fabrics. Sew
the two sides together and hang on top of blinds, with the pattern
appropriate for the season facing the room.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Improve the lighting in your home by purchasing inexpensive
lamps from garage sales or thrift stores. Then replace the shades
with new ones that blend with your decor.

HIGH-BANDWIDTH WEB CONNECTIONS WILL LET PASSENGERS SURF AS THEY
FLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people have fallen for the lure of high-speed Internet
access only to find it hard to get. Now Boeing is promising to make
it available to people traveling 500 miles per hour at 30,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Airplanes stopped being a refuge for business travelers when
satellite telephones were installed. On many planes, passengers can
make calls or send and receive e-mail messages (to some extent).
</P>
<P>
   The next step, according to a partnership led by Boeing Co., is
to develop Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at this major piece of time that could and
should be more productively used,'' said Kenneth Medlin, vice
president and general manager of Boeing Commercial Information
Systems, a unit of the Boeing Space and Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   This broadband access, expected to become available on some
domestic flights late next year, will let people surf the Web and
send e-mail messages and other files at an impressive rate:
messages will be uploaded at 1.5 megabits per second _ about the
same speed as a T-1 line found in many offices _ and Web pages will
be downloaded at 5 megabits per second, the rate of a smooth
functioning cable modem link.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in a world where maintaining a reliable link to the
Internet from a fixed desk is sometimes a challenge, trying to do
the same thing in an airplane is particularly daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some planes allow passengers to make calls and send
and receive e-mail, such service is spotty and slow, limited on
some systems to 64 kilobits per second. The key to the increased
capacity of the Boeing system is the antenna, Medlin said.
</P>
<P>
   A system like this, he said, must rely on the use of satellites
to relay signals. Communications satellites have large coverage
areas, and transmissions from airplanes would generally be
unobstructed. To achieve the speed needed for high-bandwidth
connections, the Boeing system will rely on high-frequency
satellites, which are now primarily used by television networks to
beam their broadcasts to local stations and cable companies as well
as by telephone companies for moving large numbers of long-distance
calls.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch. Satellites, unlike most ground-based radio
systems, can send and receive signals only through relatively
narrow, focused radio waves.
</P>
<P>
   To make things simple for customers on the ground, most
communications satellites are placed in geostationary orbits. That
is, they match Earth's rotation so they stay above the same spot.
Because of that, ground-based satellite users aim their dishes at a
single fixed point in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Airliners, of course, are anything but stationary, so a
geostationary satellite becomes a moving target. Space shuttles
avoid the problem by communicating with ground-based satellite
dishes that move mechanically to follow their flight. But designing
a conventional dish that is light enough to install on aircraft but
can respond to every twist and turn is impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Boeing and its partners are using an antenna technology
that can electronically steer its radio beams. One thousand small
antenna modules, each shaped more like a jumbo pizza box than an
antenna dish, are joined into a single grid. Boeing began
developing these phased-array antennas 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A computer on the aircraft directs the beam by altering the
synchronization of the individual radio waves generated by the
antenna modules. The signals from the individual antenna modules
ultimately combine into a single beam in much the same way that a
pianist combines several notes to create a chord. The antenna's
computer alters the beam's direction by changing the pattern that
joins the signals into the final beam.
</P>
<P>
   The antenna computer's work does not stop there. Just as a cell
phone switches from one transmitter's territory to another's, the
antenna computer must be able to jump from one satellite to another
as the aircraft moves. A link between the system and the aircraft's
flight control systems allow it to monitor the airplane's motion,
adjusting the signal to compensate for turns and altitude changes.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of the Connexion system is being tested, and the
final version is expected to consist of two phase-array antennas,
each about 18 inches long, 15 inches wide and 2{ inches thick, on
the top of the fuselage. One is for receiving, the other for
transmitting. A cable connects the antenna to the computer inside
the aircraft, and the computer is linked to a conventional Web and
e-mail server.
</P>
<P>
   All of that will be invisible to passengers. What they will see,
Medlin said, are two jacks on back of the seat in front of them.
One would be for users with conventional modems in their laptop
computers. Their Web surfing would be limited to the maximum speeds
of their modems. The other jack would be a standard Ethernet
connection, like those commonly found in offices. People with
Ethernet cards will be able to plug in to those jacks to get the
system's full high-speed experience.
</P>
<P>
   Such service is likely to cost $20 to $25 per hour, Medlin said,
but Boeing and its partners _ Loral Space &AMP; Communications,
Mitsubishi and Finmeccanica _ must still work out details with
airlines. Some services, like online duty-free shopping, travel
information and live television programs, will probably be offered
for free, Medlin said. CNN Inflight Services and CNBC are also
expected to provide news programs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before service begins, Boeing would have to show the Federal
Aviation Administration that the system would not interfere with
the aircraft's communications or electronic operations. The system
is designed for installation on all major airliners, including
those made by Airbus Industrie, Boeing's rival.
</P>
<P>
   While Medlin expects service to begin in the United States late
next year, the rest of the world will take a bit longer. That is
because there are few television viewers _ and therefore few
geostationary satellites _ in the middle of the oceans. Medlin said
Loral was developing satellites that would be able to deflect a
portion of their signals into regions not served by high-frequency
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will not be alone. Inmarsat, a satellite operator in
London that said it provides phone service in 78 percent of the
world's long-haul airliners, is developing a system that would be
based on a new generation of satellites. Until that system becomes
available in 2004, Inmarsat plans to offer a service beginning next
year that allows Web browsing and e-mail exchanges at 64 kilobits
per second, slightly faster than the best dial-in modems.
</P>
<P>
   And some airlines are looking at systems that at least simulate
the experience of on-board e-mail by gathering messages in an
on-board server, which then downloads the messages and sends them
on after the plane lands.
</P>
<P>
   What about those business travelers who view airplanes as a
place to rest rather than as a flying office? Medlin insisted that
high-bandwidth connections will make their lives even better.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns from a long flight, Medlin said, the first thing
he does is go to a home office to exchange e-mail messages with his
office. But once he is able to do that while flying, Medlin said,
he will be able to devote that time to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really gives people back time,'' he said. ``I would
rather have my leisure time when I want it, rather than have it
forced into two or three hours on an airplane.''

EXECUTIVES OF RUSSIA'S BIGGEST AUTOMAKER CHARGED WITH TAX EVASION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SABRINA TAVERNISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Russian authorities brought tax evasion charges
Wednesday against top executives at the country's biggest
automaker, as part of President Vladimir Putin's stated campaign to
loosen the grip of Russia's richest men on the country s most
profitable enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The charges came a day after the authorities filed suit against
managers at Russia's biggest oil company, also on charges of tax
evasion. Since May, the authorities have swept through offices of
media and oil companies, and have brought charges against others.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's against the carmaker AvtoVAZ targets another of
Russia's most influential men, Boris Berezovsky. A member of
Parliament and a friend of former President Boris Yeltsin s family,
Berezovsky helped create the company that owns a third of AvtoVAZ.
</P>
<P>
   In his election campaign earlier this year, Putin vowed to limit
the influence of Russia s oligarchs, the handful of businessmen who
amassed fortunes during the sale of prize assets over the last
decade, and who at times have influenced government policy. But
critics say the crackdowns could lead to another selective
distribution of property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying about catching fish in muddy waters,'' Putin
said in a television interview with Reuters. ``There are fishermen
here who have already caught a lot and want to keep the situation
as it is for a long-term historical period. I don't think this is
acceptable for the Russian people or for our partners abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   AvtoVAZ, a longtime tax deadbeat, also was raided in May. The
company last year handed the government a controlling stake in
exchange for delaying the payment of about $100 million in tax
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the tax police accused the company of hiding sales by
duplicating car serial numbers to avoid taxes. A company spokesman
denied the charges and said AvtoVAZ had already filed suit against
a previous tax audit.
</P>
<P>
   With a factory in southern Russia built by Fiat of Italy,
AvtoVAZ produces about three-quarters of Russia's cars. The company
has been in talks with General Motors on setting up a joint
venture, though GM has refrained from setting a starting date.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and ordinary citizens have applauded Putin's efforts
to curb the influence of the oligarchs. The benchmark RTS stock
index rose 2.8 percent Wednesday, and Putin's popularity ratings
remain high.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, top executives at Lukoil Holding, Russia's biggest
oil company, were accused of tax evasion, while investigators
demanded that Vladimir Potanin, who has vast holdings in Russian
banks, metals and media companies, reimburse the state for losses
incurred during a privatization in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In comments carried on Russian television, the tax police chief,
Vyacheslav Soltaganonv, said the police planned to bring charges
against another company on Thursday.

`FEAR OF FICTION': ROAD PICTURE SPUTTERS TO A HALT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. The name of band in
fifth graf, ?, is cq.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Fear of Fiction,'' the first film from the director Charlie
Ahearn since his 1982 high-velocity documentary, ``Wild Style,''
explodes with colors and random thoughts. He works to weave
coincidence, twins, faith and the nourishing blast of '60s
protopunk _ garage bands with the keening Farfisa organ solos that
you can't shake from your head _ into the fabric of a road picture.
But he doesn't quite bring it off. The grafts won't take.
</P>
<P>
   This is the journey of Sigrid Andersson (Melissa Leo), an almost
novelist. She's still working on her opus, ``Fear of Fiction,'' and
at the beginning of the movie she goes blank while giving a
reading. To clear her head she decides to take a road trip and
answers the ad of Red (Sam Trammell), who's driving across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after they start, they pick up Red's identical twin
brother, Tom (also played by Trammell), and the looniness begins.
Sigrid is twice Red's age, but that doesn't stop her from acting
just as childishly. Given to tantrums when she can't have what she
wants _ like a cigarette, since the smoke makes Red sick _ she's
working her way up to diva status.
</P>
<P>
   Red and Tom separate, and the brothers end up in different cars
but on the same path. Tom hitchhikes and is picked up by Gary
(Clark Johnson), who stopped just short of taking his priestly
vows, and later by Albert (Penn Jillette), a motormouth obsessed
with garage bands. A big man with huge hands wrapped around a tiny
steering wheel, Albert riffs on music as intensely as he drives. He
and Tom start bouncing off the walls of the car with the help of
Albert's stash, and their drug-addled rap about relative time and
speed is a howl and feels real.
</P>
<P>
   Jillette's gig as a performer is to pull everyone else along
with him; he has his own gravitational field. ``Fabulous Failures,
a moniker all punk bands should aspire to,'' he sputters about his
favorite group. (The music of the fictional Failures is by Evan
Lurie, with an assist from Ahearn and Lee Ranaldo, though actual
'60s garage bands like the Mysterians and ? are also on the
soundtrack.)
</P>
<P>
   Whenever outsiders join the main characters, ``Fiction'' becomes
likably trippy. Tom is also picked up by a pair of stoners, Liz
(Linda Larkin) and Debbie (Annie Giobbe). ``I'm looking for someone
who looks just like me, my twin,'' he explains from the back seat.
Liz asks, ``How do we know you're not him?''
</P>
<P>
   Such moments aside, ``Fiction'' is a shambles, aspiring to
philosophical trajectories it couldn't possibly reach and
amateurish enough that one gets lost trying to decide what is
supposed to be funny. The movie isn't involving enough to make
anyone care about the blurring of truth and fantasy that may, or
may not, be taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual murk has a few high points. There's a stunning
underwater rescue that could be a swim in velvety blue amniotic
fluids. For the most part, though, despite glimmers of ability from
Ahearn, ``Fear of Fiction'' is a washout.

regrettably, don't get the exposure they deserve. Thankfully, a

   XMEN _ It started in 1963 as The Uncanny X-Men. The comic book
by Stan Lee introduced five pupils at Xavier's School for Gifted
Youngsters. They possessed a mutant ``X gene'' that gives them
special powers that humans fear and distrust. Professor Charles
Xavier teaches these five X-Men to control their emerging powers to
fight evil and help mutants and humans coexist. While the comic
book has been a top seller for decades and spawned a popular Fox
cartoon, not many people know just who the X-Men are. That may
change with Friday's big-screen movie X-Men, starring Patrick
Stewart, Ian McKellen and Halle Berry, and directed by Bryan Singer
(''The Usual Suspects''). So, you're not a cult comic book reader.
Here's a guide to the characters and story of the superhero tales.

ROBERT RUNCIE, FORMER ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Robert Runcie, the former archbishop of Canterbury
known for his outspoken views on the royal family and the
government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, died on Tuesday
night at his home in St. Albans, Hertfordshire.
</P>
<P>
   He was 78 and had prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   As the spiritual leader of the world's Anglicans from 1980 to
his retirement in 1991, he was considered a reform-minded if
provocative churchman, favoring the ordination of women, choosing
theological liberals as bishops and working for reconciliation with
Roman Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   He conducted the wedding of Prince Charles and Diana Spencer but
later fell out with the couple by saying the marriage was an
``arranged'' one, and by accusing the prince of having abandoned
his belief in the church and the princess of being an ``actress, a
schemer.'' She in turn said, ``I'll never forgive his treachery.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative backers of Thatcher saw him as a political meddler
for his comments on striking miners whom he accused the government
of treating like ``scum,'' on the country's ``lunatic'' nuclear
arsenal and on the British economy's disregard for the poor and the
emergence in Britain of a ``Pharisee society'' of self-interest and
intolerance. He caused fury by telling a St. Paul's thanksgiving
service after Britain's victory in the 1981 Falkland Islands war
that prayers should be offered for the families of dead Argentine
soldiers as well as for the Britons who perished.
</P>
<P>
   Tory members of Parliament denounced as ``Marxist'' and ``far
left'' a 1985 report he sponsored on inner city problems that led
to the creation of the Church Urban Fund, a charity devoted to
employment and social projects in some of the country's most
deprived areas, which he accused the Thatcher government of
neglecting.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Runcie, as he was known after his elevation to the peerage
in 1991, maintained a public profile as archbishop of Canterbury.
Appearances on radio and television, in newspapers and at state
occasions made his face, Oxbridge-accented speech and robust humor
familiar to millions.
</P>
<P>
   But he experienced deep sadness when Terry Waite, the man
described as his ``personal envoy,'' was kidnapped in Beirut in
January 1987 by the men holding hostages he was seeking to free.
Though he had tried to persuade Waite not to undertake the mission,
Lord Runcie made it a point during the four years he remained
prisoner to pray for his release every day before a candle in the
medieval crypt of Lambeth Palace, the Thames-side official home of
archbishops of Canterbury.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed satisfaction that he had ``rocked the boat'' from
time to time and shortly before his retirement, he said, ``The
church has come through a period when so many questions were deeply
divisive _ ordination of women, remarriage of divorcees,
homosexuality, issues of war and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics who felt his vaunted pragmatism masked indecisiveness
pointed to his stance on homosexuals where he spoke out against
discrimination against them, admitted knowingly ordaining them but
opposed the practice of doing so and then later added that gay
priests could live together as long as they forswore having sex
with each other. A biographer, Adrian Hastings, rejected the
indecisiveness charge, saying instead that Lord Runcie moved
cautiously to avoid division.
</P>
<P>
   The comments on Charles and Diana and his admission that he had
known before the royal wedding of the prince's relationship with
his companion, Camilla Parker Bowles, emerged in a 1996 biography
called ``Runcie: The Reluctant Archbishop.'' Though Lord Runcie
scorned the book as ``irresponsible and misleading,'' he did not
contest its accuracy, and he seemed to acknowledge the effect its
publication would have when he sent a letter to the author,
Humphrey Carpenter, saying, ``I have done my best to die before
this book is published.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Alexander Kennedy Runcie was born in Liverpool on Oct. 2,
1921, and, though his father, an electrical engineer, disliked
clergymen, he attended confirmation classes at a local church and
became a committed Anglican as a teenager. He later confessed that
he had gone only because he had a crush on a girl in his class.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a scholarship to Brasenose College in Oxford, but left
at the end of his freshman year to join the Scots Guards and fight
in World War II. After the war he returned to Oxford, was ordained,
served in a Newcastle parish and went on to Cambridge, where he
became dean of Trinity Hall, teaching classics and church history.
</P>
<P>
   There he met and married Rosalind Turner, known as Lindey,
daughter of a senior fellow. She was to prove an active cleric's
wife, pursuing her twin passions for piano and gardening by raising
money for charity from concerts and recitals and supervising the
replanting and redesign of the famous grounds at Lambeth Palace.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of their marriage, she explained her need for
diversion by saying that ``too much religion makes me go pop.''
Lord Runcie was later to describe their marriage as a ``union of
duty with delight.'' He is survived by her and the couple's two
children, James and Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 he became principal of a theological college near Oxford
and in 1970 was consecrated bshop of St. Albans. He made himself
an expert on the Anglican church's relations with Orthodox churches
and traveled widely in Eastern Europe, but he was a relative
unknown and a great surprise as the choice to succeed the retiring
Donald Coggan.
</P>
<P>
   His enthronement speech at Canterbury Cathedral as the 102nd
archbishop set out his agenda. The church, he said, must give a
firm lead ``against rigid thinking'' and counter ``the disposition
to oversimplify difficult and complex problems.'' In a speech soon
after, he said ``the Christian voice must be loud and clear on the
great political issues of the time _ race relations, unemployment,
disarmament and the proper distribution of the world's resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Months later he began pursuing another goal, a drawing together
of Anglicans and Catholics, when he met Pope John Paul II in Ghana.
In 1982 the pope visited Britain, and Lord Runcie welcomed him to
Canterbury Cathedral. In a deeply symbolic moment the two men knelt
in prayer at the site where Thomas a Becket was murdered in 1170.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1989, Lord Runcie visited Rome for four days of
talks with the pope, but despite warm personal relationships
between the two men, the pope did not respond to his pleas for
greater unity between the churches. In a final statement, they
jointly acknowledged that the issue of whether to have women as
priests stood in the way.
</P>
<P>
   He was made a life peer by Prime Minister John Major, with whom
he had a better relationship than with Thatcher. A common love of
cricket was said to be the bond.
</P>
<P>
   But even in retirement he continued to roil church waters,
warning of an overly ``management'' style at Lambeth Palace, an
apparent rebuke of his more buttoned-up successor, George Carey.
While acknowledging that Dr. Carey's reforms would lead to a better
organization of finances, he warned that the church was losing
influence and respect among decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, he tried to disarm critics with
self-deprecating humor, and he held to that habit in his last
formal interview, published in The Daily Telegraph in April. Asked
about the prospect of coming face to face with God, he said: ``I
cannot flannel you. I have had opportunities and position and
blessings that I have not deserved. I just hope I haven't made a
mess of them all. But then the heart of my faith is a belief in
God's mercy and forgiveness.''

&HT;     NINERS NAME NEW PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE ADAMS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The San Francisco 49ers on Wednesday named
a former toy company executive to take over the franchise as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Peter L. Harris, who in 1985 resurrected failing FAO Schwarz,
will run business operations, while General Manager Bill Walsh will
continue to oversee the football side of the business.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Harris' agenda will be the ambitious football
stadium and shopping mall proposed by former owner Edward DeBartolo
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the project at Candlestick Point were reborn _ and the
search for the new president intensified _ in March, when the lines
of team ownership finally were cleared.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, who owned the team for 23 years, and his sister,
Denise DeBartolo York, agreed then that she would take full
ownership of the team while he would assume the majority of the
family's substantial real estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
   She took control of the team in 1997 when her brother took a
leave after becoming involved in a federal gambling probe in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the NFL prohibited DeBartolo from being
involved with the team while that fraud investigation continued.
(Former Louisiana Gov. Edwin W. Edwards was convicted of
racketeering and fraud in May, largely on DeBartolo's testimony
that he paid Edwards $400,000 to facilitate a gambling and real
estate project in the state.)
</P>
<P>
   The franchise's leadership was further set back when Carmen
Policy resigned as president July 21, 1998, to accept a similar
position with the start-up franchise Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Larry Thrailkill acted as president. But his primary
job remained chief operating officer for the DeBartolo Corp. Most
recently, York's husband, John York, has run the team under the
title of vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the new stadium stalled during the family fight over
team ownership, including a dispute over who held the rights to
developing that project.
</P>
<P>
   At the NFL owners meeting in March, York said that the 49ers
were ready to get moving on the stadium project and replace aging
Candlestick Park with a football-only facility. He said the first
order of business would be to try to restore the combination
stadium-shopping complex as envisioned by his brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 56, brings a reputation as a strong businessman. At FAO
Schwarz, he increased profits fourfold in five years. He heads
Picture People, a studio portrait chain based in Foster City,
Calif., that has grown to 183 franchises in 19 states. Before that
he worked at Accolade, a video game company in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Yorks live in Youngstown, Ohio, and have said all along they
intended to hire a full-time president to take over at the team
headquarters in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Others considered in the search included Carl Pascarelle, chief
executive and president of Visa U.S.A., and Gene Washington, a
former 49ers player and the NFL's director of operations.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a comfortably cool dawn, humidity will gradually increase
over the Northeast, setting the stage for unsettled weather in the
next several days. Thursday will have sun mixing with increasing
clouds, especially over the interior. Scattered thundershowers will
develop near the central Appalachians as moist air flows north
along the west slopes of the mountain chain.
</P>
<P>
   Some sunshine and sultry air will combine to promote scattered
strong thunderstorms from the Carolinas to the Gulf Coast States.
Meanwhile, dull conditions and patchy rain will occur near the
southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The very warm air mass that has covered much of the eastern
Rockies and southern Plains for the past two weeks will remain in
place. Afternoon thunderstorms will erupt over the mountains of New
Mexico and Colorado and will drift into parts of the western Plains
before sunset.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: COLD DAYS IN JULY
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, N.Y., the first 10 days of July were colder than any
such period since records began in 1874. The average temperature of
67.3 degrees was nearly 5 degrees a day below the seasonal average.
The early summer pattern near North America has been dominated by
two prominent zones of warm high pressure; one centered in the
Plains and another near Bermuda. Cool air masses from eastern
Canada regularly have been able to flow south between the two
bubbles of heat bringing refreshing air masses into parts of the
Northeast.

<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ It is time for the ``SMS Dating Game'' on
Radio X3M. Romance is in the airwaves, and Cupid carries a cell
phone. Thumbs ready? In 160 characters or less, use the keypad on
your mobile phone to type a description of yourself and your
interests, and send it to the disc jockey's phone using the wildly
popular Short Messaging Service.
</P>
<P>
   In minutes, if your description catches the fancy of another
mobile phone user _ and the odds are good, considering that most
Finns over age 15 carry a wireless phone _ the phone will chirp,
warble, vibrate or beep out a riff from a popular rock song,
signaling that you have a text reply waiting on your phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently it's more fun than actually talking to the other
person,'' said Richard Nordgren, head of programming for Radio X3M.
</P>
<P>
   But that is nothing compared with what's planned in Sweden,
where a company is developing a mobile Internet dating service that
tracks the location of the phone. When two seemingly compatible
people come into range of each other, the dating service will alert
them by phone, enabling them to arrange a rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is indisputably the business leader in personal
computer and Internet technologies, the United States is Old World
when it comes to what many analysts and entrepreneurs see as the
next big wave of technology: wireless Internet communications.
</P>
<P>
   Market researchers are nearly unanimous in predicting that in
three years more people around the world will gain access to the
Internet through mobile devices than through personal computers.
But to preview this transformation, which some call the ``mobile
lifestyle,'' one has to leave the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just starting to see it in the U.S., but here it is
everywhere,'' said Rolf Skoglund, a venture capitalist in
Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   According to the market research company International Data
Corp., Sweden has passed the United States and is now the world's
dominant ``information economy,'' measured in terms of the
percentage of citizens who have access to computers, the Internet,
wireless phones and other information technologies. Finland, Norway
and Denmark round out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   The Nordic countries are digital Valhalla, the forefront of the
new information economy based on wireless communications. As a
result, U.S. technology companies and venture capitalists are
rushing to set up or expand their offices in the growing high-tech
centers near Helsinki and Stockholm. Microsoft opened a new
research and development office in Stockholm last month, as did
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the best companies are being forced into setting up
sites in Europe or Japan, where they have working test beds to
proceed with critical development,'' said Mark R. Anderson, a
technology analyst who recently returned from touring northern
Europe. ``There's a reason why all these people are rushing over to
Sweden. They have no choice. It could be that the wireless markets
won't appear here in the United States for years after the markets
are mature in Sweden and in Japan and in China.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nordic countries are also in the vanguard of mobile
electronic commerce, or m-commerce. Although it is still a novelty,
people in Finland are beginning to use their phones to pay for soft
drinks from a vending machine, for parking and for car washes. In
Sweden, trials are under way to allow people to check train
schedules and to book and pay for tickets by phone. An
advertisement in Stockholm shows a shopkeeper asking, ``Will that
be cash or phone?''
</P>
<P>
   In Finland, it is difficult to find any young people who have a
friend or relative who does not have a mobile phone. In fact, the
question seemed to startle almost everyone, as if they had been
asked whether they had friends who rode reindeer. Finally, after
pausing a moment to contemplate the question, one Finn said: ``Yes,
my grandmother. But she is 83.''
</P>
<P>
   Such things are inevitable in a culture in which last year 78
percent of the country's 2.35 million households had at least one
mobile phone, according to Statistics Finland, a research company.
About one household in four no longer even has a traditional wired
phone, relying entirely on mobile phones. The report stated,
``nearly all Finns aged between 15 and 39 used the mobile phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The mobile lifestyle is only slightly more subdued in Sweden.
``Why would you be glued to a wall to talk to someone?'' asked
Cyril Holm, a young entrepreneur in Stockholm who carried a phone
with a built-in keyboard. ``What a terrible, stinking idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But why Scandinavia, and not the United States, which views
itself as the center of the technology revolution?
</P>
<P>
   Several factors came together to make this the forefront of
mobile telephones: an extremely high penetration of wireless phones
among consumers, estimated as high as 70 percent among people over
10 years of age; the aggressive growth of wireless system operators
like Telia and Sonera; and the headquarters of two of the biggest
makers of mobile phones and equipment, Nokia in Finland and
Ericsson in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Technology experts in Scandinavia offer several other
explanations. Part of the answer is geography. The Nordic countries
are relatively large and remote, fostering the need for reliable
communications. And beginning in the 1980s, the Scandinavian
countries agreed on a common mobile phone standard, which evolved
into GSM, or Global System for Mobile communications. The United
States, meanwhile, uses two incompatible standards, called TDMA and
CDMA. Some carriers in the United States use a variant of GSM, but
it uses a different frequency and is incompatible with the global
standard, which has been adopted by 105 countries.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, it means that most Americans cannot use
their phones overseas, while someone in Estonia can call easily
from London or Rome without needing a new phone.
</P>
<P>
   Another impediment is the curious U.S. billing system in which
the recipient of a mobile call pays the toll, which is just the
opposite of the European standard. The effect is that many
Americans keep their phones turned off, unless they are expecting a
call, and carry pagers instead. In Scandinavia, where the caller
pays, phones are left on all the time and thus are used more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen a pager for years,'' said Antti Laaksonen, a
young programmer who is working to develop entertainment services
for a new generation of cell phones. The last company in Finland to
offer pagers recently closed its service, succumbing to the SMS
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, there is no way to distinguish between a
mobile phone number and a fixed line number. They have the same
number of digits. In Scandinavia, mobile numbers have an extra
digit, so a caller can tell at a glance whether the other's
person's phone is in his pocket or on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   But more than all this, it appears that the idea of mobility has
caught fire here in digital Valhalla in a way that even the highly
mobile American society has not grasped.
</P>
<P>
   The use of phones for nonverbal communication is one of the more
striking differences between Europe and the United States. Finland,
with a population of about 5 million, sends 75 million SMS messages
a month. SMS allows people to send up to 160 characters of text to
another phone, with the message displayed on the phone's tiny
screen.
</P>
<P>
   It typically costs the equivalent of 15 cents to 20 cents to
send a message and nothing to receive one, unless you subscribe to
one of the many SMS services, like the joke of the day or a daily
horoscope, which are among the most popular services. Despite the
cost, SMS is a cultural phenomenon among young people, who appear
to possess an uncanny ability to type swiftly using their thumbs on
the phone's tiny keypad.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the phones can be set to vibrate silently instead of
ring, which has led to a new problem: Some schoolteachers have
complained that students are using their phones to send test
answers to one another in class.
</P>
<P>
   Esa Puokannen, a Finn who studied at the University of Texas,
said that in his family only his 8-year-old does not carry a phone.
His 12-year-old son got a phone and ran up a tab of 400 markaa
(more than $60) the first month sending SMS messages to his
friends. He has since been put on a pre-paid card, and once he
exhausts his limit he can only receive messages, not send them.
</P>
<P>
   The phones can be used to send simple pictures and musical
compositions, and to play games. In Finland, Nokia phones come with
a built-in game called Snake, which is so popular that there was
recently a national Snake championship. And the recreational use of
the phones is not restricted to schoolchildren. In a Helsinki bar,
one Finn showed a lewd graphic on his phone that he said a friend
had sent him.
</P>
<P>
   A popular Finnish rock band recently released its new song not
on CD or over the radio, but as a digital download created
especially for mobile phones. Another radio station in Helsinki
that used to play the Top Ten hits on Wednesday mornings now plays
the Top Ten musical cell phone ring downloads.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, the Top cell phone ring last week in Finland
was the theme song from ``Batman.''

   VIETNAM-U.S.-TRADE (Undated) _ After more than four years of
negotiations, the United States and Vietnam plan to sign a historic
trade pact later this week or early next week, trade sources said
Wednesday. (Summary from wires) By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   This story was filed Tuesday night, in full and abridged

</P>
<P>
   RACE-HOUSTON (Houston) _ In Houston, the fourth-largest city in
the United States, blacks, Anglos and Hispanics each make up
roughly a third of the population. So the election in 1998 of Lee
P. Brown as the city's first black mayor was more than a
celebration of victory for blacks. It was also a testament to how
racial and ethnic groups in Houston had put aside their suspicions
and rivalries and come together largely out of self-interest to
achieve power. By Mireya Navarro.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Thurmont, Md.) _ On the second day of the Camp
David summit meeting, Israel announced that it had canceled its
sale of a sophisticated airborne radar system to China, a decision
that came after harsh congressional criticism and personal requests
from President Clinton to halt the $250 million deal. The move
appeared carefully calibrated to improve the mood in Congress for
Israel's request for increased military assistance if some kind of
peace accord is reached between the Palestinians and Israelis. By
Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-PRICES (Undated) _ Gasoline prices have risen sharply, but
the owners of gasoline stations are not benefiting from higher
prices at the pump. Elsewhere along the supply chain, however,
higher gasoline and oil prices have meant staggering profits: Major
oil companies are expected to report earnings growth of 117 percent
on average for the second quarter, compared with the quarter a year
ago. Such prosperity has attracted the notice of a number of
politicians, including Vice President Al Gore, and the Federal
Trade Commission has started an inquiry into possible industry
collusion. By Richard A. Oppel Jr.
</P>
<P>
   GENERIC-DRUGS-SUIT (Washington) _ Mylan Laboratories, the FTC,
and 35 states announce they are on the verge of completing a $147
million settlement to resolve the lawsuit that had accused the
company of violating antitrust laws by cornering the market on raw
materials and then jacking up the price of generic drugs. By
Stephen Labaton.
</P>

   TEXAS-DEATH-PENALTY (Houston) _ Folo on reports that new DNA
tests have failed to exonerate a Texas inmate, Ricky McGinn, who
given a reprieve by Gov. George W. Bush last month. McGinn is
fighting convictions on rape and murder charges and his lawyers had
sought additional DNA testing. (Summary from wires) By Jim Yardley.

EGGPLANT FROM THE GARDEN GETS THE FULL TREATMENT
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beryl Scroggins has a good memory.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered that several years ago we ran a recipe for the
baked eggplant served at Wyatt's cafeterias. Now that her son is
growing eggplant in his garden, she needs the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, indeed, we did run that recipe along with several others
from Wyatt's in 1993. So here's the eggplant recipe, along with a
couple of other Wyatt's concoctions to round out a vegetable plate.
Please note that the cheese sauce is used in both the spinach and
the squash recipe.

</P>
<P>
   ``The Owl, the Raven, &AMP; the Dove'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By G. Ronald Murphy, $25 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Oxford University Press) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before Harry Potter was a twinkle in J.K. Rowling's literary
eye, Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm were telling magic stories now
familiar to all: Snow White and the evil queen who must dance in
red-hot shoes until she dies; Cinderella and her two stepsisters,
who mutilate their feet to try to win the prince ...
</P>
<P>
   Not so familiar after all? Well, these are the versions of the
Brothers Grimm, not Walt Disney; and G. Ronald Murphy's ``The Owl,
the Raven, &AMP; the Dove: The Religious Meaning of the Grimms' Magic
Fairy Tales'' has other surprises in store, as well.
</P>

<P>
   ``The Owl, the Raven, &AMP; the Dove'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By G. Ronald Murphy, $25 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Oxford University Press) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before Harry Potter was a twinkle in J.K. Rowling's literary
eye, Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm were telling magic stories now
familiar to all: Snow White and the evil queen who must dance in
red-hot shoes until she dies; Cinderella and her two stepsisters,
who mutilate their feet to try to win the prince ...
</P>
<P>
   Not so familiar after all? Well, these are the versions of the
Brothers Grimm, not Walt Disney; and G. Ronald Murphy's ``The Owl,
the Raven, &AMP; the Dove: The Religious Meaning of the Grimms' Magic
Fairy Tales'' has other surprises in store, as well.

SMALL-TIME MUSICIANS DON'T LONG FOR THE BIG TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: food or beer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the Gospel Swingers, an over-the-top,
punk-meets-R&AMP;B outfit led by Fort Worth resident Quincy Holloway,
who is also a member of the dub-rock band Sub Oslo. Every member of
the Swingers, which formed two years ago, is or has been affiliated
with other underground rock outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never included myself in the mainstream of anything,''
Merlick says. ``That's definitely gonna be reflected in the music
that I play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gospel Swingers are definitely an acquired taste. At a
recent show opening for Dallas alternative-country giants the Old
97's, a good chunk of the crowd either turned away or looked
horrified, the band's noisy mingling of rock and R&AMP;B apparently too
unconventional for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the band is the same way, fortunately. We've never
listened to mainstream rock or FM radio,'' Merlick says. ``We're
not interested in what's popular or what most people like.''
</P>
<P>
   The band _ which, in step with its anti-popularity disposition,
refused to have traditional photos taken for this article _ plays
gigs at small, punk-rock venues such as Rubber Gloves Rehearsal
Studios in Denton; their day jobs, mostly computer-related, pay the
bills. The swingers are among the few high-profile local bands that
do not have a CD.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the Swingers are unambitious; the band _ which
is rounded out by bassist Alex Sargent, organ player Kari Luna and
drummer Steve Adkins _ simply does things on a smaller scale than
other bands.
</P>
<P>
   They have two singles scheduled for release this year, but
they're on small labels, one of which is Swedish. If a larger label
approached, Merlick says, they would at least hear it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would at least entertain the idea'' of signing, he says.
``But that's not what I'm looking for. Right now, this band is just
a way to express myself creatively. If I was doing this to make
money, I would have given up a long time ago.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An African-American man with hair as white as the ice in his
drink, Al Dupree sits at his grand piano at Dallas' Balcony Club,
gently plucking its keys. Drummer Bobby Samuels and bassist Charles
Nugent are nearby, surveying the room, which is filled with an
older slice of Dallas' yupscale population, most of whom drink and
smoke and talk loudly. At least they clap when the trio is finished
playing a song.
</P>
<P>
   On the piano sits a tip jar; it has about three ones in it.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the 77-year-old Dupree makes his living these days,
playing four to five nights a week at this quaint club tucked
inside Dallas' historic Lakewood Theater. He gets a regular check
from the club, plus tips. Combined with his retirement check from
the Postal Service, Dupree says, he makes enough to scrape by,
occasionally help out his three kids.
</P>
<P>
   Dupree is the epitome of the musician who has absolutely no
desire to become popular. He has played in uncelebrated bands all
his life _ since 1937 to be exact, when he was 13 _ and he says
he's had no reason to change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is and has always been, if I can pay my bills
and have a dollar left over, I'm happy,'' Dupree says. ``Because
you don't take anything with you when you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Trained in piano at age 5, clarinet at 11 and saxophone at 12,
Dupree grew up in the Dallas area and attended school at Booker T.
Washington, where he joined his first group; he looks back at his
beginning years with a combination of fondness and longing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started playing, you could bring your children to the
clubs and enjoy a good show without worrying about what's reaching
their ears,'' he says. ``You wouldn't wanna take your children to a
show today; the music's so sexist now. Unless you just don't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Dupree's music then, as now, was steeped in the roots of jazz.
He names Duke Ellington as a major influence. At the Balcony Club,
that influence is evident, as he and his band play romantic,
complex ballads and upbeat free-for-alls.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities for him to cash in have come and gone throughout
his career; he didn't jump on any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is something that's a part of me. It's just like my
right arm or my eyes,'' he says. ``But frankly, I've never seen any
point at being popular. I just don't even worry about it. I've been
like this all my life. To hell with it if people don't understand
that. That's the way I am.'' &QL;

SMALL-TIME MUSICIANS DON'T LONG FOR THE BIG TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not every musician makes it big. Not every musician wants to.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people play music simply for the love of it. They're
not concerned about signing with a big record label. They don't
hound the news media for coverage. Money to pay the bills _ that's
good enough for them.
</P>
<P>
   These are the musicians and singers who play the gigs that no
one else will: a Wednesday night at a hole-in-the-wall, a punk-rock
club hidden on the outskirts of town, a hotel bar, a restaurant.
They're so far in the background as to be almost invisible, their
music buried under loud conversation, bar glasses clinking,
obnoxious, inattentive audiences.
</P>
<P>
   As Al Dupree, George Norris and the members of the Gospel
Swingers will tell you, it can be a tough life, especially if
performing is their only income source. But shying away from the
music industry in favor of doing things independently does have its
rewards. And in the eyes of these musicians, those rewards are far
more important than fame. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a Wednesday night at the White Elephant Saloon in the Fort
Worth Stockyards, and George Norris is playing to, well, virtually
no one. Two guys sit at the bar and smoke. A table full of rowdy
yahoos orders several rounds of drinks. Tourists peek in and out.
</P>
<P>
   The night after July 4 is notoriously slow for live music, but
Norris is undaunted. For 20 years, he has had a regular gig at the
Elephant, playing early, weekday shows, afternoon matinees, the
occasional Friday or Saturday night; he has seen his share of empty
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And some full ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, we used to be the only thing on the block,'' says the
52-year-old singer, who started playing the Elephant a few years
after it opened, way before Billy Bob's Texas and all the other
clubs in the Stockyards arrived.
</P>
<P>
   His set is a simple one: He plays solo, accompanied only by an
acoustic guitar and a drum machine, which he controls with the
twist of a knob. Most of his material belongs to someone else:
Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, George Jones, all the country greats.
</P>
<P>
   There's no original material in his set, and Norris has never
released a CD of his own. ``I don't write,'' he says
matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   But Norris is not a novelty act, nor should he be dismissed as a
one-man cover band; he is an apt musician, a strong, robust singer,
and he has stage presence to spare. On a dead night, he cracks
jokes, and the few listeners are
</P>
<P>
   immediately entranced.
</P>
<P>
   Performing is old hat to Norris; he's been on stage since he was
14. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my first show was my 14th birthday,'' says Norris.
``I've played in all kinds of bands: rock bands, jazz bands,
country bands. But everything I did had a country sound to it, so I
thought I'd just go back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushes with fame have come and gone. In the late '60s, Norris
and a drummer friend moved from Texas to Hollywood, searching for
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't find very much,'' Norris says, laughing. ``I was a
country boy in the wrong place. It was a good experience, but I
really couldn't make a living out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris moved back at just the right time _ when a new club was
opening. ``Two weeks after I got back home, a guy called and asked
if I wanted to play a new private club that was opening in a
hotel,'' he said. ``From then on, I've been working pretty
steadily.''
</P>
<P>
   Solo and with a band, Norris played a local-music circuit that
took him to clubs, hotels and piano bars. His other brush with fame
came in Abilene, where he and his band often performed with
then-unknowns Johnny Bush and Johnny Paycheck. In the late '70s the
Elephant opened, and Norris has since taken up permanent residence.
</P>
<P>
   When he was younger, Norris admits, fame was an issue. Today,
with a wife and two boys in their late teens, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   Success ``has always been on my mind,'' he says. ``But I know as
you get older, the chances of becoming successful go down. So it's
not the driving force in my life anymore. You know what I'm
concerned about now? Going to Little League baseball games with my
kids. I mean, I'm able to make a living at a place that I like,
around people I like, doing what I like. That's good enough for
me.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chris Merlick started playing in bands in 1984; he's been broke
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 20 years, Merlick has been in bands that buck the
mainstream. He is a longtime Dallas-based musician who has played
drums and guitar for several area punk-rock and underground groups
_ bands whose left-of-center sensibilites are not rewarded with a
lot of money. What little his bands have made is spent on gas, food
or beer. MORE &QL;

IN A SHOOT-'EM-UP, THREE'S COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By PETER OLAFSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; John Romero's ``Daikatana,'' from Eidos Interactive; for
Windows 95, 98 and NT; $39.95; for mature players. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I will say this for John Romero's ``Daikatana'': For better or
worse, it has kept me company.
</P>
<P>
   One of the defining qualities of three-dimensional shoot-'em-ups
has been solitude. Invariably, you are on your own in a
persistently evil world. Enemies are everywhere, friends are rare
and allies rarer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, ``Half-Life'' adjusted that equation. While still
centered on the player's character, it allowed you to recruit
security guards and scientists who would obligingly follow you
through the ravaged Black Mesa complex, opening locked doors and
fighting to the death on your behalf. But these helpers operated
within a limited area, accepted a narrow range of commands and
ignored all the weapons and supplies lying around on the floor. And
they didn't have much personality. Indeed, they were pretty much
interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   Allies with personality is the defining feature of
``Daikatana,'' which gives the main character two sidekicks, named
Superfly Johnson and Mikiko Ebihara. They are more than interactive
flotsam and jetsam. Once recruited by the player, they follow the
main character, Hiro Miyamoto, from level to level. You can order
them to fight, back off, hold position, follow the player or
retrieve equipment for their own use. (Just as Hiro does, each
sidekick has levels of health and armor.) You can't complete a
section of the game without the sidekicks' accompanying you in
close formation, and if one of them dies, the game ends.
</P>
<P>
   This long-awaited shooter sends the player through 24 enormous
levels in four time periods _ ranging from ancient Greece to
25th-century Japan _ to seek out a mythic sword of power and
restore life to a dark and decimated world. I found Johnson _ a
bald bruiser with revenge in his heart _ suspended from a torture
machine in a prison in the Japanese segment. (Mikiko turns up in a
frozen laboratory toward the end of the same segment.) Johnson, a
former security chief at the jail, proved pleasantly adept at
clearing a room, obeying orders and keeping pace with my character.
He climbed ladders, rode elevators and vaulted over gaps without
special handling. Following me (as Hiro) at a significant distance,
Johnson made his way through a series of rooms, jumped onto two
wall fixtures and then a bookcase and crouched to enter the duct
where I was waiting. When I sought to retrace my steps to the duct
entrance, he turned around before I reached him and headed back the
way we had come. Along the way, he commented on the grisly
discoveries our little party made, and if I bumped into him, he
told me off. He also gave me a hard time if I took too long to find
a way out of a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Johnson had his faults. He lacked a certain level of
self-awareness, and I had to guard against random acts of
stupidity. Although he was initially unarmed, he took off with a
vengeance after the first enemy he spotted and took him out, only
to be immediately blindsided by a giant, missile-firing robot.
</P>
<P>
   When I dropped down an elevator shaft, Johnson failed to follow.
And he was nowhere in sight when I finally made my way back to the
top of the shaft. I had to restore a saved game and order him to
stay at a crucial location.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I found it agreeable to look after someone else's
welfare. Even in a shoot-'em-up with the noblest of story lines,
you can wind up feeling as if you are on a one-man killing spree _
an ugly sensation. Shepherding other characters through this
gantlet lends the game a sense of community. It was not so much you
against them as us against them. And this sense of community became
even more palpable when the two sidekicks started talking to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The sidekicks are not ``Daikatana's'' only strong point. The
layout of the levels recalls classics like ``Doom'' and ``Quake'' _
games Romero helped create before leaving Id Software to become a
founder of Ion Storm, the company that developed ``Daikatana.''
These levels use space creatively. They abound in side roads,
hideaways and secrets within secrets, and they dare and defy you to
explore them thoroughly. Occasionally, wandering through explored
terrain, I would wend my way to a place that I did not recognize,
and that was a nice feeling.
</P>
<P>
   But although I am almost a quarter of the way through the game,
``Daikatana'' has yet to mature into the sum of its interesting
parts. It may have to do with the game's soporific opening
sequence. It may be the background noise. Johnson's idle chatter
quickly became annoying and the high-pitched screaming that issued
from the industrial workers in the Japanese levels when they saw a
monster almost induced me to join them. Maybe it was the monsters
themselves, which for all the effort put into the artificial
intelligence of your allies were as dumb as the monsters in any
shooter I have played. (I have yet to find a monster that puts the
fear of God into me.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the other innovations were not as effective as
``Daikatana's'' use of sidekicks. The gems you will need to find to
save a game are a clever twist that entices the player into
``Daikatana's'' many remote and secret areas. But they can also be
infuriating. Every time you save, it costs you a gem. You may not
find another until you have completed a run of difficult action
sequences, and hence will have to repeat the tougher sections until
you find one. In the apparently gem-free bowels of one level, I
must have fallen to my death a dozen times or more while trying to
cross a volcanic chasm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Daikatana'' borrows a page from role-playing
games. For each kill, Hiro receives experience points that allow
him to advance to higher levels. At each level, the player can
assign a point to make him faster or to enhance one of four other
skills. But this tends to reiterate, rather than supplement,
tendencies that occur naturally within ``Daikatana.'' For example,
even without an enhanced attack skill, the weapons you find grow
more powerful as you progress into the game. The ability to
increase the player's maximum vitality doesn't feel meaningful in
an environment strewn with health-replenishing supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Romero has hit upon something with the sidekick
idea, and it will be interesting to see where he goes with it. I
would like to see interactive dialogue _ perhaps via an ``advise''
command that would allow the sidekicks to offer tips within their
areas of expertise _ and the ability to direct a character to a
specific location.
</P>
<P>
   I also envision a wider variety of sidekicks with specialized
abilities. A given sidekick's participation or nonparticipation
could have a genuine impact on how the game plays out. You might
find that you had inadvertently killed an expert hacker who might
have smoothed your path through a difficult sequence, or enlisted a
coward or a traitor. The possibilities are inviting.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I'm at least grateful to have some company.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After making a brief _ and rare _ public speech at a
lavish luncheon the other day, the Queen Mother asked the guests to
drink a toast their hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone at the event organized at Guild Hall to celebrate the
Queen Mum's upcoming 100th birthday complied by raising a glass.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, except the guest of honor, who couldn't find
her wine. After glancing around her place setting at the head
table, the Queen Mum fixed a stare at the archbishop of Canterbury
and pointed at the glass of red wine he clutched in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's mine,'' she said, sweetly but sternly, to the head of
the Anglican Church, who instantly relinquished it to the senior
royal.
</P>
<P>
   The guests were charmed by this moment, which reminded them all
that the plucky matriarch of this country's often troubled,
occasionally unwieldy first family continues on _ a rock in a time
of sometimes wrenching change.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother _ she
demanded the two royal designations in her official title _ will
celebrate her birthday at a quiet family gathering at Clarence
House, her longtime London home. An official celebration will be
held July 19.
</P>
<P>
   At a thanksgiving service for her Tuesday at St. Paul's
Cathedral, George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury who pinched
her wine glass, said her place in the hearts of Britons is secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when such a premium is placed on the young and the
new, it is glorious indeed to be celebrating the birthday of
someone who can help us travel that country called 'life' _ and
someone, indeed, who so fully continues to inhabit it,'' he said.
``For we cherish in you, ma'am, a continuing openness and
responsiveness to people, not just of all backgrounds, but of all
ages.''
</P>
<P>
   After the service the Queen Mum, aided by a walking stick and
handrail erected for her, walked the length of the massive
cathedral and down its 22 front steps. Prince Charles hovered near,
but she walked on her own, smiling demurely at people in the crowd
as she passed.
</P>
<P>
   With her warm smile and spry personality the mother of Queen
Elizabeth II remains by far the most popular royal _ for many the
personification of an ideal of ``British-ness'' that is fading
rapidly in the new century. She has seen two world wars, the
dissolution of an empire and counted among her friends Sir Winston
Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she is most revered for her easy, relaxed style that allows
for a fondness for gin, jokes and race horses.
</P>
<P>
   The country is full of people with memories of her, like a young
Manchester policeman who once guarded her parade route. Peering
into the Queen Mother's car, he noticed that she seemed to be
chewing on something. She saw him staring and the next thing he
knew, she had tossed him a
</P>
<P>
   caramel.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other royals, the Queen Mum relishes a good joke with
the press and seems to not take it all so seriously. Lunching with
Queen Elizabeth some years ago, she was reportedly surprised when
her daughter, who normally doesn't drink, ordered some wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you should, dear?'' teased the Queen Mum, who is
known to enjoy a G&AMP;T now and then. ``After all, you have to reign
all afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   She also holds a grudge. Biographies suggest she will never
forgive Wallis Simpson, the American divorcee who King Edward VIII
surrendered his throne to marry. The abdication of her husband's
older brother in 1936 forced him to become King George VI and her
to become queen _ a role she never wanted. She blames Simpson for
her husband's early death in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   She also is said to be annoyed with Jimmy Carter for kissing her
on the lips at a 1977 meeting _ the first man, she complained, to
do so since the death of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The sun had not yet begun to set on the British Empire when she
was born to an aristocratic Scottish family. Elizabeth Angela
Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the ninth child of the Earl and Countess
of Strathmore. The family's Glamis Castle in northeast Scotland is
the legendary home of Shakespeare's Macbeth.
</P>
<P>
   When the First World War started _ coincidentally on her 14th
birthday _ Glamis Castle became a hospital. One of her brothers,
Fergus, was killed at the battle of Loos in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   Her family periodically entertained King George V and Queen Mary
and their children _ among them Albert. After twice refusing
Albert, Elizabeth married him in 1923.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years later, the bashful and stuttering Albert became
King George VI.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She became queen in the turbulent pre-war years with the
monarchy severely shaken by the abdication. She is credited with
restoring stability to the royal family and transforming her shy
husband into a people's king.
</P>
<P>
   During Word War II, she became a symbol of Britain, refusing to
leave Buckingham Palace, which was hit nine times by the German
bombers. She ignored then-Prime Minister Churchill's suggestion to
send her daughters Elizabeth _ the future queen _ and Margaret, to
the safety of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children won't go without me,'' she responded. ``I won't
leave the King. And the King will never leave.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She sent the princesses to Windsor Palace outside London. And
with King George she roamed the country in the royal train,
cheering factory workers on, visiting army camps and hospitals, and
inspecting bomb damage.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the prospect of a German invasion, the Queen
learned to use a revolver, practicing on a shooting range
constructed at Buckingham Palace. She and the king went often to
London's frequently bombed East End. She picked her way through the
rubble in high heels to offer
</P>
<P>
   encouragement to East Enders.
</P>
<P>
   After one bombing attack left the palace substantially damaged,
she responded: ``I'm glad we've been bombed. It makes me feel we
can look the East End in the face.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, George died of lung cancer, leaving her a widow at age
51. She moved out of Buckingham Palace to make way for her daughter
and went into seclusion until Churchill cajoled her into returning
to public life.
</P>
<P>
   She still refers to her husband as ``the king'' and declines
public appearances on the anniversaries of his birth, marriage, and
death.
</P>
<P>
   Even now she continues a rigorous public schedule, which she is
said to regard as a sacred duty of her position. Unlike other
royals, she seems to enjoy the regimen of tree plantings, plaque
dedications and visits to old folks homes _ mostly occupied by
people much younger than she is. She has made more than 40 trips
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   She always wears pearls, even when salmon fishing in Scotland _
a passion she still enjoys when she's up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen Mother awakens each morning to the sound of bagpipe
music from her own recorded collection, and reads an assortment of
newspapers before meeting with her private secretary.
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasion when she is lunching without family or
friends, she snacks with the staff at Clarence House, her London
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest pleasure comes from horse racing. She is so devoted
to the sport that she had a ``blower,'' a device used by bookmakers
to provide live race commentary, installed in her home.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   She is said to have no intention of retiring after her 100th
birthday. Local newspapers say she has opened discussions on her
role in the bash being planned for the Golden Jubilee of her
daughter's ascending the throne. That would take place in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   As she was leaving the recent luncheon in her honor, the Queen
Mum stopped her party to listen as a small group guests began
singing one of her long-time favorite songs, ``If You Were The Only
Girl In The World.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled and urged them to sing louder. The rest of the crowd
joined in as the royal guest of honor beamed in pleasure.

GLOBAL CROSSING SELLS PHONE SERVICE TO CITIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Iowa, Minn., N.Y., Pa., Wis., Bermuda)   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Global Crossing, the telecommunications company,
agreed on Wednesday to sell its local phone operations to Citizens
Communications for $3.65 billion in cash, which Global will use to
further its construction of a worldwide communications network.
</P>
<P>
   The deal transfers to Citizens about one million phone lines in
Iowa, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and about
3,000 employees. Citizens, of Stamford, Conn., is increasingly
focused on telecommunications as it sheds its utility businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, of Hamilton, Bermuda, acquired the local phone
business last year in its takeover of the Frontier Corp. Global
Crossing decided to get out of the local phone market to
concentrate on building a network capable of handling huge amounts
of Internet and data traffic worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downside of this deal is that it removes an important
source of cash flow for Global Crossing,'' said Michael Hodel, a
telecommunications analyst with Morningstar, the mutual fund and
stock analysis company. ``But at least it alleviates some concern
over funding since the rest of their operations are burning through
cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors responded by bidding up Global Crossing shares
$2.9375, to $32.0625.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares have been slumping, down more than 30
percent this year, amid concern over problems in raising money in a
dampened capital market for unprofitable companies focused on the
Internet. In the first quarter, Global Crossing posted an operating
loss of $234.1 million as it scrambled to build its network.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the deal with Citizens, investors and analysts
absorbed reports that Global Crossing was considering selling
GlobalCenter, its business that offers storage and maintenance
facilities for Web sites and other Internet services, to the rival
Exodus Communications for as much as $7 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing and Exodus declined to comment on the reports,
which said a deal would give Global Crossing a substantial equity
stake in Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   While it builds its network, Global Crossing has also been
trying to expand through acquisitions, although an overture to buy
Equant of the Netherlands, the owner of the world's largest data
network, ended abruptly last month when the two companies could not
agree on terms.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Hindrey Jr., who recently joined Global Crossing as chief
executive, did not support that deal, people close to the
negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Given Global Crossing's wide-reaching strategies, some concern
has emerged. In addition to acquiring Frontier last year, Global
Crossing bought the cable installer Global Marine Systems and Racal
Telecom of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global Crossing is not doing a great job of articulating
strategy,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications
analyst. ``It's a young company that seems to still be deciding
what they'll do when they grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally aimed at linking the two sides of the Atlantic,
Global Crossing operates or is building 12 fiber optic networks
connecting Asia, the Americas and Europe in an effort to set up a
worldwide, broadband network to meet the growing demand for
Internet and data services.
</P>
<P>
   While Global Crossing grows globally, smaller companies like
Citizens Communications are seeking to fill gaps in local services.
Earlier this year, the company sold its electric utilities business
and changed its name from Citizens Utilities to Citizens
Communications to reflect its switch in emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens looks like they're becoming the Wal-Mart of phone
service, getting into a lot of small communities,'' Kagan said.
``The people living in those places will probably benefit from the
attention they will get from a Citizens, as opposed to a Global
Crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Citizens rose 12.75 cents, to $18.8125.

 &HT;    Planned Parenthood ad campaign to target Bush on abortion issue
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Planned Parenthood, eager to blunt Gov. George W.
Bush's compassionate conservative mantra, is launching a $2.5
million advertising campaign aimed at Republican and independent
women who support abortion rights and at swing voters in key
Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   The Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group's political arm,
commissioned a poll of 1,000 registered likely voters earlier this
year. The group identified 300 of those surveyed as ``compassionate
conservative'' voters because they like Bush, call themselves
conservatives and tend to vote Republican. They also said they
support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five percent of the compassionate conservative sample told
Planned Parenthood pollsters that they would not vote for a
candidate who would ban abortion. Sixty five percent said they
would be less likely to support such a candidate. The margin of
error was 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these voters are introduced to Gov. George W. Bush's
positions on family planning and abortion, they move solidly
against him,'' Planned Parenthood President Gloria Feldt said
Wednesday. ``Compassionate conservative women have the ability to
turn this election and, armed with the truth, we believe they
will.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's first television ad will run on national cable
stations in time for the Republican National Convention, which
begins July 31 in Philadelphia. A second round targeted at swing
states such as Ohio and Michigan will be launched closer to the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposes abortion except in cases of rape or incest or to
save a mother's life. He has said he won't make abortion a litmus
test for his vice-presidential choice or for nominees to the U.S.
Supreme Court. These positions have left both abortion supporters
and opponents suspicious of where Bush really stands.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt said she is not heartened by speculation that Bush is
considering Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Republican who supports
Roe v. Wade, as his running mate. Ridge opposes government funding
for abortion and late-term procedures called, ``partial birth'' by
opponents. Like Bush, Ridge backs requiring minors to obtain
parental consent before having abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so beholden now to the hardline right wing of the party
that my guess is, when push comes to shove, he will go with an
anti-choice running mate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Feldt characterized Bush's abortion stance as hardline, a fact
she said abortion rights supporters don't fully understand because,
``he doesn't make these positions the centerpiece of his
campaign.''

LONG-OVERDUE LAUNCH BOOSTS US-RUSSIAN SPACE STATION PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAIKONUR, Kazakhstan _ Bearing a Pizza Hut logo and the hopes of
an ambitious project to assemble a giant laboratory in space, a
huge Proton-K rocket Wednesday boosted into orbit the long-delayed
module that will house astronauts working in the International
Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   The successful launch, which followed two years of delays and
sometimes bitter recrimination between Moscow and Washington, means
that the $60 billion space station can be occupied by Russian and
American astronauts as early as this fall, NASA officials said. It
also gave a much-needed boost to Russia's storied but
now-beleaguered space program.
</P>
<P>
   In a burst of yellow flame and brown smoke, the 22-ton
Russian-made rocket boosted the 26-ton Zvezda life-support module
into orbit through clear blue skies.
</P>
<P>
   A deafening roar echoed over the arid steppe at the Baikonur
Launch Facility in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan.
Hundreds of spectators, standing about two miles from the launch
pad, cheered wildly as the ground rumbled beneath their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to the races,'' said Jeff Worley, an engineer with
Boeing who has worked on the International Space Station for seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   The $320 million Zvezda _ it means ``star'' in Russian _ is
tentatively scheduled to dock with the first two modules of the
space station on July 26 under computer guidance. Those modules,
which have been in space since 1998, are the Russian-built Zarya
(``dawn'' in Russian) and the US-made Unity. It will take about 35
more launches before the space station is complete in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The launch, originally scheduled for April 1998, was delayed six
times over the past two years as the cash-strapped Russian space
program struggled to come up with funds to complete the module. As
a result, some US officials began to question the wisdom of working
with the Russians, who often appeared unable to pull their own
weight on the 16-nation project.
</P>
<P>
   To help defray the costs, Russia agreed to display the logo of
US-based Pizza Hut fast-food chain for a reported payment of $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't worry about skeptics, said an elated National
Aeronautics and Space Administration chief Daniel Goldin, standing
on the steps of the viewing platform after the launch. ``We know
where we are going.'' Goldin said he had confidence in Russia's
ability to contribute to the space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians have gone through all sorts of difficulty with
their economy, the political changes, and a whole variety of other
problems, and they came through and did what they said they were
going to do,'' he said. ``I have to say that this is one of the
happiest and proudest days of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldin said the US has put up $35 billion in development funds
for the space station, while Japan and Europe combined providef $9
billion. Nobody could provide figures for the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   He warned, however, that a lot of work remains to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tough work. We aren't going to Disneyland, We are
going to space,'' he said. ``Before we pop the champagne corks, we
have two more weeks before we dock, but I have a sense everything
will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Yury Koptev, director of the Russian Space Agency, said the
launch had decided ``whether Russia's space program will go on
existing or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have traveled a very long and difficult road. We wish the
road had been a highway, but a highway it was not. It was often
closed for repairs, and we experienced detours,'' Koptev said.
``Our strength in carrying out this epoch-making project is in our
unity, in our support for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The first manned flight to the space station has been set
tentatively for October, when Russians Sergei Krikalyov and Yury
Gidzenko and American Bill Shepherd are scheduled to become the
first crew to inhabit the space ship.
</P>
<P>
   The launch came almost 25 years to the day after the historic
Apollo-Soyuz mission, the first joint space effort by Moscow and
Washington, which laid the groundwork for today's cooperation. On
July 15, 1975, the United States launched an Apollo spaceship and
the Soviet Union launched a Soyuz craft. Two days later, they
docked in space.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the astronauts on that mission, Americans Tom Stafford
and Vance Brand and Russians Alexei Leonov and Valery Kubasov, were
on hand to witness Wednesday's launch. A fifth crew member,
American Donald ``Deke'' Slayton, died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have waited for this for a long time. Our cooperation with
the Americans in space, which we began 25 years ago, depends on
this launch,'' Kubasov said. ``When we started this we hoped it
would continue.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Zvezda shot into space, Stafford, the US commander of
Apollo-Soyuz, cheered it on. `Come on, go baby go,'' said Stafford,
now 69, as he pumped his fist.
</P>
<P>
   The United States initiated the International Space Station
project in 1984. When completed, its supporters say it will be a
giant laboratory in space with a living area equal to a 747 jumbo
jet. Some officials, however, have complained about the station's
high price tag _ some estimates say the original $60 billion cost
will climb as high as $95 billion _ and some scientists have
questioned whether the project is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The first manned space station was Skylab, which the United
States launched and maintained from May 1973 until July 1979. In
February 1986, the Soviet Union launched the Mir space station,
which remains in orbit. Moscow planned to abandon the Mir last
year, but it has since found foreign investors to keep it
operational.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the United States brought Russia into the project to
build the Zvezda, hoping to save time and money. But Russia, with
just a $100 million annual budget for its space program, was unable
to produce the Zvezda module on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Zvezda was finally ready last year, but a scheduled launch
in November was delayed after two Proton rockets crashed onto
Kazakhstan's steppe. Afraid to risk losing Zvezda, Moscow delayed
the launch until engineers could work out the kinks in the massive
Proton rockets, the world's biggest. The delays added an estimated
$3 billion to the cost of the space station.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials have claimed in the past that funds targeted for
the Zvezda were diverted to keep the Mir space station, an object
of intense pride for the Russian space program, in orbit. In April
of last year, Goldin told Congress that Moscow ``always seem to
have a little extra money around for Mir but not for the
International Space Station.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the US
Congress, has warned that crews will face increased risk and noise
because of Russia's failure to meet NASA safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Baikonur Launch Facility, where the Zvezda module lifted off
at 10:56 a.m. local time (12:56 AM EDT), is the world's largest,
occupying 2,700 square miles of barren steppe. Russia rents
Baikonur from Kazakhstan for $150 million a year and pays the
Kazakh government a commission of 3 percent-5 percent on commercial
launches there.
</P>
<P>
   Baikonur was the launch site for the once-formidable Soviet
space program's greatest triumphs. It was here that the space race
began when the Soviet Union shocked and terrified the world by
launching Sputnik on Oct. 4, 1957.
</P>
<P>
   And it was here, on April 12, 1961, where Yury Gagarin blasted
off in the spacecraft Vostok _ gleefully shouting ``Away we go!'' _
on his way to becoming the first man in space.

   THURMONT, Md. _ With the cool breath of morning on his face and
his chocolate retriever, Buddy, at his side, President Clinton
began his day Wednesday with a solitary stroll along the wooded
mountain pathways running through the presidential retreat at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat for breakfast inside a pale green clapboard
lodge, where they helped themselves to warm eggs, chicken sausage
and, in a nod toward Mideast cuisine, cashew nuts.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed about the news photos of Arafat and Barak jostling
at the lodge doorway the day before, and doubtless shared a chuckle
over how little the reporters gathered in this Catoctin Mountain
hamlet know of what's really going on inside the secluded compound
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Is that any way to begin a day of high-stakes negotiations
centered on matters of war and peace?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think it is, because you want to create a sense of
partnership,'' said Mideast expert Jon Alterman. ``The way to start
is to create good atmospherics.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton, Arafat and Barak got down to brass tacks on day two
of the Camp David summit, the Mideast foes were focused on the
life-and-death issues at the core of their 52-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to statecraft, however, than the search for an
acceptable territorial and security formula.
</P>
<P>
   Personal diplomacy, simple human relations, will play a key
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that the president will work hard on,'' said
Alterman, a program director at the U.S. Institute for Peace, a
Washington think tank. ``I am certain that it will be Clinton's
personal relationship with both these leaders that will be the
decisive factor if the summit is successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's relationship with Arafat dates to Sept. 1993, just
eight months after the president took office, when he hosted Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin for the South Lawn signing
of the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Arafat and Clinton have met more than a dozen times,
at the White House, at the Wye River Plantation where Clinton
hosted Mideast peace talks two years ago, and even in Gaza City,
where in 1998 Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit
Palestinian-controlled land.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hosted Barak at the White House just days after the
Israeli leader took office last July. Since then the two have met
repeatedly, in Washington, twice in Europe, and over the course of
the week-long Syrian-Israeli talks Clinton hosted last January in
Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a stretch to call the three men friends. Over the
span of their relationships, however, they've learned how to
communicate and, essentially, how to do business with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has a very good relationship with both Chairman
Arafat and Prime Minister Barak,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now worked with them extensively. I think just watching
the interaction, you can see that they believe that they can engage
in discussions and that there is a certain level of trust,''
Lockhart told reporters Wednesday. ``That is something that's
essential to this process here.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It was critical, certainly, to the success of the Camp David
summit President Jimmy Carter hosted in 1978. That summit produced
a breakthrough peace accord between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, but not without first
hitting a roadblock that took intensive personal intervention by
Carter to circumvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the impasse arose at Camp David I, as is inevitable in
this kind of negotiation, Carter turned to his friend Sadat and
imposed extremely heavy pressure on him to get an agreement,'' said
William Quandt, who was the senior Mideast expert on Carter's
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton follows suit, at a crucial moment he will press
Arafat to settle for less than he is asking for,'' said Quandt, now
professor of government and foreign policy at the University of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Clinton has repeatedly advertised, he'll also inveigh
upon Barak to strike a deal that falls shy of the Israeli's wish
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no success without principled compromise,''
Clinton warned on Tuesday. ``The road to peace, as always, is a
two-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Clinton shows a politician's gifts for compelling with
charm, or the force of reason. Behind closed doors, however, he has
a reputation as a master arm-twister, as former negotiating
partners have testified.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Clinton spent 82 hours over nine days and eight
nights in grinding negotiations between Arafat and then-Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Wye River Plantation on
Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   The talks hit a last-minute snag when the Israeli balked at the
terms of a framed-up accord, and Clinton worked on Netanyahu for
seven hours to bring him around.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon at a White House ceremony, Netanyahu, depleted
after 28 hours of sleepless negotiations, called Clinton ``a
warrior for peace,'' and portrayed Clinton as a tireless, even
pesky advocate who used Wye ``to nudge and prod,'' the parties to
make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean,'' said Netanyahu, ``he doesn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The title for personal diplomacy in the quest for Mideast peace,
however, probably still belongs to Carter, who rescued the
Begin-Sadat talks from certain failure by signing a handful of
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   With leaders angered after 11 days of difficult talks, and both
packing their bags to leave Camp David in failure, Carter
remembered that Begin had requested an autographed photo of the two
men together as a souvenir for his grandchildren back in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   An aide brought Carter eight photographs, the former president
recalled in a speech at the University of Maryland two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of just signing Jimmy Carter, I put, 'With love,' to
every one of his grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin was ''hardly speaking to me,'' Carter recalled, when he
dropped by the Israeli leaders' cabin to deliver the souvenir
photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said 'Thank you, Mr. president,' and turned around,
dismissing me, in effect,'' said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he looked down and he read the first photograph, and
he called out the name of his granddaughter,'' Carter said. ``And
then one by one he read out the names of his grandchildren. And
tears ran down his cheeks. And, when I saw them, I also cried. And
he said, 'Why don't we try one more time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carter, ''To make a long story short, we concluded the
agreement.''

BUILDING A BETTER WEB WITH CONTENT BLUEPRINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever gone to a Web site to find a specific piece of
information and found yourself falling through a series of pages
while clicking around helplessly, trying to find what you want? Do
you feel as if you have opened the door to the basement of your new
house only to find that the architect forgot to design the
staircase that leads to the lower level?
</P>
<P>
   A good architect won't forget your staircase, and a good
information architect _ a job that is becoming increasingly more
important as the world moves to the Web _ will make sure that
visitors to a site will be able to find their way around easily as
well. Although some in the new-media industry have lumped the job
with that of a Web site's graphic designer, the role of an
information architect in the creation of a site is actually much
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``With apologies to `Shoeless Joe,' the maxim `If you build it,
they will come' simply does not apply to the Web,'' said Colin
Furness, a senior information architect at Iguana Studios, a Web
design company in New York that has designed sites for the Zagat
restaurant guides and the American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. ``And many storefronts have not figured this
out yet. Poor usability that alienates users _ especially mom and
pop _ is cheap and easy, which is perhaps why it is so plentiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The information architect's job, Furness says, is to organize
the structure and content of all the material on a Web site, as
well as figure out how users can effectively navigate through the
site to find the one or two things they might be looking for _ say,
for instance, a pair of khaki pants on a large clothing retailer's
site. Once this blueprint has been laid out, the Web site's graphic
designer will concentrate on the visual look of the site. Or, to
put it back into building terms, the information architect decides
where the window will go, and the designer decides what the window
will look like.
</P>
<P>
   The look and feel of a Web page itself, including, for example,
where the site puts its search box for users to quickly seek out
specific words on the site, still lack uniform standards, Furness
said. He noted that while some Web page conventions, like colored,
underlined hyperlinks to other Web sites, are quickly understood by
most new users, other inconsistencies in design and layout may make
the Web hard to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules for navigation, information classification and
hierarchy and widgets such as drop-down menus _ and there are
actually rules _ have not been consistently applied,'' Furness
said, ``so no standards have emerged, and this has hindered users'
abilities to learn and master cyberspace.'' He likened it to the
early days of automobiles, when dashboards varied so widely that
drivers had to learn a new set of controls before they could
operate a car.
</P>
<P>
   Information architecture may also be aimed at a specific
audience. Older users, said Furness, who may have less familiarity
with computers as well as the Web, are likely to respond
differently to an e-commerce site that features loud, snazzy
animations and graphics than someone who is more used to the visual
style of the online world. In his work, Furness has noticed that
newer users tend to feel more comfortable ``when clickable links
are larger, when there is less information density per page, when
colors are softer, and things are explained in more detail using
suitable language and symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web itself is barely a decade old, and standards are bound
to emerge as it evolves. Once the technology is in place, it is
just a matter of adapting it to suit the needs of people, instead
of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has been slow to realize that the Web is nothing
more than a very big information system that can benefit from the
same attention to human factors,'' Furness said.

   COXNET FOCUS 0716: CLASSIC CARS, ANCIENT CITY -- The names come
out a little differently in Arabic. DeSoto becomes something like
``Tozata'' and Chrysler sounds like ``Kleezler.'' But those old
bombs you might find in an auto collector's garage in America make
for colorful and practical transportation in Syria. The country's
streets are flush with fins and crawling with chrome. Stroll the
centuries-old bazaars and you're likely to be passed not only your
father's Oldsmobile, but his father's before him. (Kaplow, Cox

   UPS _ The drivers of those chocolate brown trucks with gold trim

the parole board's business still just as secretive as it used to

Flatbush and DeKalb avenues _ that I began to realize what a
melting pot New York's most populous borough is. In Brooklyn,
habitat of Hassids and homeboys, matzah ball soup is served side by
side with collard greens and salmon croquettes. Over a recent long
weekend, I didn't have nearly enough time to eat my way around this
ethnic-food lover's paradise. But I did hopscotch around
sufficiently to see why it's New York's new ground zero of cool,
why trendies from ``The City'' are subwaying over to check out the

   THURMONT, Md. _ With the cool breath of morning on his face and
his chocolate retriever, Buddy, at his side, President Clinton
began his day Wednesday with a solitary stroll along the wooded
mountain pathways running through the presidential retreat at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat for breakfast inside a pale green clapboard
lodge, where they helped themselves to warm eggs, chicken sausage
and, in a nod toward Mideast cuisine, cashew nuts.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed about the news photos of Arafat and Barak jostling
at the lodge doorway the day before, and doubtless shared a chuckle
over how little the reporters gathered in this Catoctin Mountain
hamlet know of what's really going on inside the secluded compound
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Is that any way to begin a day of high-stakes negotiations
centered on matters of war and peace?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think it is, because you want to create a sense of
partnership,'' said Mideast expert Jon Alterman. ``The way to start
is to create good atmospherics.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton, Arafat and Barak got down to brass tacks on day two
of the Camp David summit, the Mideast foes were focused on the
life-and-death issues at the core of their 52-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to statecraft, however, than the search for an
acceptable territorial and security formula.
</P>
<P>
   Personal diplomacy, simple human relations, will play a key
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that the president will work hard on,'' said
Alterman, a program director at the U.S. Institute for Peace, a
Washington think tank. ``I am certain that it will be Clinton's
personal relationship with both these leaders that will be the
decisive factor if the summit is successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's relationship with Arafat dates to Sept. 1993, just
eight months after the president took office, when he hosted Arafat
and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin for the South Lawn signing
of the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Arafat and Clinton have met more than a dozen times,
at the White House, at the Wye River Plantation where Clinton
hosted Mideast peace talks two years ago, and even in Gaza City,
where in 1998 Clinton became the first U.S. president to visit
Palestinian-controlled land.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hosted Barak at the White House just days after the
Israeli leader took office last July. Since then the two have met
repeatedly, in Washington, twice in Europe, and over the course of
the week-long Syrian-Israeli talks Clinton hosted last January in
Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a stretch to call the three men friends. Over the
span of their relationships, however, they've learned how to
communicate and, essentially, how to do business with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has a very good relationship with both Chairman
Arafat and Prime Minister Barak,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now worked with them extensively. I think just watching
the interaction, you can see that they believe that they can engage
in discussions and that there is a certain level of trust,''
Lockhart told reporters Wednesday. ``That is something that's
essential to this process here.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It was critical, certainly, to the success of the Camp David
summit President Jimmy Carter hosted in 1978. That summit produced
a breakthrough peace accord between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, but not without first
hitting a roadblock that took intensive personal intervention by
Carter to circumvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the impasse arose at Camp David I, as is inevitable in
this kind of negotiation, Carter turned to his friend Sadat and
imposed extremely heavy pressure on him to get an agreement,'' said
William Quandt, who was the senior Mideast expert on Carter's
National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton follows suit, at a crucial moment he will press
Arafat to settle for less than he is asking for,'' said Quandt, now
professor of government and foreign policy at the University of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Clinton has repeatedly advertised, he'll also inveigh
upon Barak to strike a deal that falls shy of the Israeli's wish
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no success without principled compromise,''
Clinton warned on Tuesday. ``The road to peace, as always, is a
two-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Clinton shows a politician's gifts for compelling with
charm, or the force of reason. Behind closed doors, however, he has
a reputation as a master arm-twister, as former negotiating
partners have testified.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Clinton spent 82 hours over nine days and eight
nights in grinding negotiations between Arafat and then-Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Wye River Plantation on
Maryland's Eastern Shore.
</P>
<P>
   The talks hit a last-minute snag when the Israeli balked at the
terms of a framed-up accord, and Clinton worked on Netanyahu for
seven hours to bring him around.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon at a White House ceremony, Netanyahu, depleted
after 28 hours of sleepless negotiations, called Clinton ``a
warrior for peace,'' and portrayed Clinton as a tireless, even
pesky advocate who used Wye ``to nudge and prod,'' the parties to
make peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean,'' said Netanyahu, ``he doesn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The title for personal diplomacy in the quest for Mideast peace,
however, probably still belongs to Carter, who rescued the
Begin-Sadat talks from certain failure by signing a handful of
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   With leaders angered after 11 days of difficult talks, and both
packing their bags to leave Camp David in failure, Carter
remembered that Begin had requested an autographed photo of the two
men together as a souvenir for his grandchildren back in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   An aide brought Carter eight photographs, the former president
recalled in a speech at the University of Maryland two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of just signing Jimmy Carter, I put, 'With love,' to
every one of his grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin was ''hardly speaking to me,'' Carter recalled, when he
dropped by the Israeli leaders' cabin to deliver the souvenir
photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said 'Thank you, Mr. president,' and turned around,
dismissing me, in effect,'' said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he looked down and he read the first photograph, and
he called out the name of his granddaughter,'' Carter said. ``And
then one by one he read out the names of his grandchildren. And
tears ran down his cheeks. And, when I saw them, I also cried. And
he said, 'Why don't we try one more time.'''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carter, ''To make a long story short, we concluded the
agreement.''

PRO-BRITISH LOYALISTS IN ULSTER CLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENNISKILLEN, Northern Ireland _ On the day of their biggest
cultural celebration, when a premium is placed on solidarity,
pro-British loyalists turned on each other Wednesday, focusing
their anger and violence on themselves rather than their
traditional enemies.
</P>
<P>
   A rash of stabbings broke out at the traditional bonfires held
overnight to celebrate the victory in 1690 of the Protestant king,
William of Orange, over the Catholic king, James II, the biggest
annual gathering of Northern Ireland loyalists. And a leading
Protestant unionist politician, appealing for an end to the
violence, was heckled.
</P>
<P>
   Some Orangemen have denounced leading Protestant clergy for a
call to end the violence accompanying a protest by the Orange
Order, a Protestant fraternal group. The order is denouncing a
refusal to let it march through a Catholic neighborhood in
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   According to seasoned observers here, including some prominent
loyalists, the dissension has never been greater within the
unionist community.
</P>
<P>
   David Ervine, a former loyalist paramilitary leader who has
sworn off violence and has embraced democratic politics, said he
was disgusted by the internal fighting and recrimination. For
years, he said, the unionist community had blamed republicans for
their problems. Now, Ervine said, it was time to look into the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enemy is within. We're commiting hara-kiri,'' said Ervine,
leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, the political wing of the
Ulster Volunteer Force paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight Wednesday, a man was murdered in what police
said was part of a feud between loyalist paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Cairns, 22, was chased, by as many as a dozen men,beaten,
then shot in the back of the head, according to Detective Inspector
George Montgomery of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Police said
Cairns was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force. His attackers
are believed to be members of the Ulster Defense Association, the
largest loyalist paramilitary group. Those sources suggested that
Cairns had been arguing with his attackers at a loyalist drinking
club.
</P>
<P>
   Cairns was attacked as loyalists gathered around a bonfire in
Larne, a harbor town north of Belfast. Bonfires are the traditional
venue where those who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the
United Kingdom express solidarity, and celebrate their British
heritage and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ervine said the murder of Cairns, and the stabbings of two other
men, one of whom was critically injured, at other bonfires, had
made a mockery of the annual celebration of loyalism, and had
exposed deep rifts in the pro-British community in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the unionist community feels our culture is under attack
from outside, the reality is it is under attack from within,''
Ervine said. ``Andrew Cairns was murdered as he celebrated his
culture. I am disgusted.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Ulster Volunteer Force of which Cairns was reputedly a
member staunchly supports the peace process, many members of the
Ulster Defense Association, including those who appeared at a
bonfire in West Belfast early Wednesday and fired shots from
automatic weapons into the air, want to keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The two loyalist groups have feuded for the past two years,
while a leading member of the Ulster Defense Association, Johnny
Adair, has aligned himself with loyalist dissidents who vow to keep
fighting. Adair has been a presence at Portadown since Orangemen
began the protest there almost two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions within loyalism were in evidence not just at the
bonfires. When Orangemen and other loyalists gathered at Ormeau
Park in Belfast, Jim Rodgers, an Ulster Unionist councilor, was
heckled after he said that the violence that has accompanied Orange
Order protests for the last 10 days, especially attacks on the
police and British army, is ``totally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers said that Orangemen risked leaving themselves without
allies. The British government, which has traditionally represented
the interests of unionists, is furious with what it sees as the
Orangemen's intransigence over refusing to negotiate the parade's
terms with Catholic residents who live along the disputed route in
Portadown, and with the cozy alliance between Portadown Orangemen
and loyalist paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Portadown, meanwhile, loyalists burned an effigy of a
policeman early Wednesday and had running battles with police and
soliders _ the security forces of a government to which they
profess loyalty. A ``blast bomb,'' like the one loyalists used to
kill a police officer last year, was thrown at police lines
Wednesday, but no one was seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not most, mainstream Protestants found the burning of
the police in effigy outrageous, given that one of the biggest
grievances of the unionist community is its demand that the Royal
Ulster Constabulary keep its name and its ethos. A change in the
police force, which is more than 90 percent Protestant, is a
cornerstone of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Ervine said the effigy burning reflected the counterproductive
mentality of the Portadown protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no concept of the widows, the wives and daughters,''
he said, referring to the more than 300 police officers killed by
the Irish Republican Army and other republican paramilitary groups.
``What are we coming to if we have to burn, beat and even kill our
own people?''
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order staged 18 parades and celebrations across
Northern Ireland, the largest in Belfast. There was little reported
trouble at any of the events. But police feared that as night fell,
violence would resume, as has been the pattern for nearly two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   David Jones, a spokesman for the Orange Order in Portadown,
vowed that their protest would continue indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   At the spot where Cairns was murdered, meanwhile, someone left
behind a bouquet of flowers with a card that read, ``A true
loyalist.''

CONFIDENT BUSH TELLS SUPPORTERS HE'S READY FOR PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A supremely confident George W. Bush rallied his
supporters from across the country Wednesday, telling them, ``I
can't wait to get sworn in as the next president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   State Republican chairmen and state Bush committee heads huddled
with top advisers to the Texas governor Wednesday in a hotel
ballroom to talk strategy and tactics for the fall. Those meetings
were private, but Bush's speech was open to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he's been surprised during the campaign thus far that
Vice President Al Gore and President Clinton have spent so much
time leveling criticism at him. But he also said the pattern is
telling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're talking about me and I'm talking about me and that's
the way I like it,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must be seeing something in those polls and focus groups
that make them nervous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bush crowed a bit about surveys showing him
ahead of Gore nationally and in most of the key battleground
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that I'm leading in the polls,'' he said.
``The bad news is that the election isn't tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his exuberance, Bush said he's taking nothing for
granted, and described the race as ``hard and close.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, he said, is a formidable opponent but also one prone to
``shifting around a lot'' -- most recently in his incarnation as
the fiery foe of what the vice president labels a
``do-nothing-for-people'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of reinventing government, Vice President Gore
continues to reinvent himself right in the middle of a campaign,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this week, he decided to attack the Congress, even though
he himself is president of the Senate,'' Bush said. ``He offers
more of the same, the same old sequel to a tired period of time.
Four more years of a president at war with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's optimism, and concomitant caution, was echoed throughout
the gathering by cheerful Republicans worried about jinxing their
good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McDaniel, the chairman of the state GOP chairs who comes
from Indiana, said the stars are aligning to boost Bush's
candidacy. Many voters want to be rid of the Clinton-Gore
``regime,'' he said. And many voters also like Bush's message of
compassionate conservatism, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hungry to win,'' McDaniel said. ``They're more
united than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, where McDaniel serves as both the state party
chairman and the state Bush chairman, Bush is poised to take the
state with the help of the popular Senator Richard Lugar running
for a fifth term this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, McDaniel said he doesn't want to get too carried
away: ``120 days out is a political eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duprey, the New Hampshire Republican chairman, said he
only hopes the polls stay as they are now for the rest of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough race all the way,'' Duprey said.
``These things change from week to week.''

FOR HUNTING DOWN THE `PERFECT' OUTFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fashion guru I consulted last week told me that if I wanted to
look ``daring,'' I should shop online for a certain outfit that
consists of a peacock blue camisole and matching skirt, then
accessorize with a turquoise necklace and wedge-heeled sandals to
avoid concealing any toe ring I might happen to be wearing.
</P>
<P>
   This outfit, not including toe ring, would cost me $597, but the
consultant assured me that it would be worth it if I wanted to
``stand out'' while attending a social event like, say, a friend's
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   It was tempting, if only because I didn't have to do all the
hard work. The service was free from an e-mail newsletter called
StyleSpeak by Sombasa Media, whose parent company is About.com.
Inspired by the success of its BargainDog newsletter, which sends
e-mail updates to more than a million subscribers looking for
online discounts, Sombasa Media began offering StyleSpeak last
month. I subscribed to the weekly newsletter, which offers two
editions, one for women's clothing and one for men's, at
www.stylespeak.com.
</P>
<P>
   My online mentor hunted down accessories and chose colors that
work well together, then rounded up thumbnail photos of all the
items so I could scrutinize them online. All I had to do to look
put together really well was to click on the links beneath the
photos to go directly to the Web sites of the merchants selling the
various pieces of my outfit.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the only people who have consistently displayed
that level of concern over my personal appearance have been my
mother, whose interest waned about 30 years ago after I announced
that I would no longer wear appliqued pinafores, and my husband,
who hopes in vain that I'll stop blaming him for letting me buy
that ghastly brown skirt at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create a type of online catalog that would show
people what goes together,'' said David Beisel, a Sombasa
spokesman, ``which wristwatch you should wear with which pants, how
to put together a whole style and look, and then buy it easily
online.''
</P>
<P>
   But StyleSpeak is not a typical catalog, I decided after reading
the first two editions. What sets it apart is personality.
</P>
<P>
   With a friendly orange background, a clean layout and outfits
that revolve around weekly themes like ``Still Single?'' and
``Summer Lovin','' StyleSpeak offers sturdy opinions without
sounding like a know-it-all. It provides context and a catchy
description for each article of clothing. And most important, it
assigns a specific theme to almost any item you might want to buy,
whether it's a bathing suit or shoes. Want to look ``sporty'' at
the beach? StyleSpeak says: ``Sporty girls love that surfer-chick
style. Just add a pair of cute beaded flip-flops, rubproof sun
block and a colorful tote to throw it all in.'' If you're a guy who
wants to look ``urban'' at a social event? ``You can't go wrong
with this stylish three-button suit from Brooks Brothers. Add a
subtle, soft gray shirt with a bold DKNY tie.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sorts of self-assured judgments were almost enough to make
me believe, momentarily, that I was chatting with a trusted friend.
Perhaps I should buy the camisole outfit?
</P>
<P>
   Then a small, inner voice piped up. It asked, ``Peacock blue?''
This is a color, after all, that makes my complexion look sallow.
And couldn't a toe ring cut off circulation?
</P>
<P>
   Troubled, I phoned Linda Price, a marketing professor at the
University of Nebraska who has studied how and why shoppers seek
guidance in deciding what to buy. ``Things like StyleSpeak are an
important break from the past because they are more personal and
more customized than if you were flipping through Cosmopolitan
magazine to see what they recommend in makeup,'' Price said.
``What's at the heart of this Internet stuff is this question: What
kind of relationship do we have with a company, like StyleSpeak,
and is it the same kind of relationship we would have with a
person, like a friend, who is giving us advice?''
</P>
<P>
   If I had gotten advice from my mother or a friend, Price pointed
out, I would have known ``that person is working for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But StyleSpeak is working for StyleSpeak,'' she said. ``It's
not interested in helping you. It's interested in getting you to
buy things.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Beisel said, StyleSpeak earns money by taking a
percentage of the sales it generates by referring people to its
several dozen merchant partners, which include such online
retailers as Gap, Lands' End, Spiegel and Shoebuy.com.
</P>
<P>
   If StyleSpeak really understood me, it would have nudged me
toward outfits that fit in with the themes in my existing wardrobe.
``Urban'' and ``sporty'' are too generic. For social events, for
instance, I favor a look called ``too young to have children.''
Waiting impatiently to be seated in a crowded restaurant, I like my
clothes to say ``possible celebrity.'' And on days when I have to
attend school events, my daughters like me to dress in a style I
can describe only as ``cute mom with a ponytail.''
</P>
<P>
   Helpfully, I phoned StyleSpeak's merchandising manager, Anya
Kyong, to suggest those themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can picture `cute mom in a ponytail' in some Gap capris,
something like that,'' she agreed. ``That would be our classic
look.''
</P>
<P>
   We were getting along pretty well, and I was starting to really
trust Kyong. In fact, after I heard that she is the person
responsible for handpicking the newsletter's recommendations and
that she favors ``real-life dressing, like wearing the cute flower
dress with the flip-flops you picked up on sale at the drugstore,''
I started to think that her advice would be helpful to me.
</P>
<P>
   But when I confided that what I was really looking for this
summer was a youthful theme _ ``you know, an outfit that screams
`Card me, please!''' _ she paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' she said. ``You're probably a little older than I am.
I'm just one year out of school. Maybe what you want would be the
`daring' look.''
</P>
<P>
   I hung up the phone and logged off. No peacock blue camisole for
me.

BOTHA OUT TO PROVE LEWIS'S CHIN MADE OF GLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Francois Botha is about to enter the glassware
business. Lennox Lewis thinks that's fitting.
</P>
<P>
   For the record _ not that it's likely to matter _ the man who
will challenge the undisputed heavyweight champion Saturday night
before beginning to sell champagne glasses that light up when you
turn the stem doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   For Botha, this is his third foray into heavyweight championship
boxing and his first into the glassware business, a venture he got
involved in through a Paris company that liked his idea and now has
him ready to hawk his wares on QVC as well as at his three Las
Vegas restaurants and at several casinos. Lewis is of the opinion
the latter business is the better long-term venture for his
opponent, a 15-1 underdog who will wander into London Arena with
few people besides himself believing he will fare any better
against Lewis than he did in his other big fights _ stoppage
defeats at the hands of Michael Moorer and Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Botha was briefly the International Boxing
Federation heavyweight champion in 1995, a title he won from Axel
Schulz and then lost to a lab test that said he had been using
steroids at the time. But since then he has had two major fights
and was stopped in both. As boxing resumes go, that's one that
resembles Swiss cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Since Lewis (36-1-1, 28 KO's) stopped Shannon Briggs in five
rounds a year before Botha fought him to a draw and has not lost
since he was upset by Oliver McCall in 1994, he is confident no
glassware salesman can offer up much for him to fear. The gamblers
feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   But the 31-year-old Botha has always fought bravely in his
defeats and made clear Wednesday he will be throwing more than
stemware at Lewis Saturday, a fact he says could make a difference
because Lewis has shown signs that while his body may be made of
steel his chin is of china.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be intimidated,'' said Botha (42-1-1, 24 KO's).
``Everyone saw that. Mike Tyson saw that'' _ after Botha easily won
the first four rounds of their 1999 fight before walking into a
knockout punch because of cockiness more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think I came here as an easy fight but this is a great
opportunity for me. This is a chance of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unless Botha's chin turns out to have the same consistency
as his stemware, and frankly there is no reason to believe that
because although he has a penchant for losing his big fights, he
does not tend to go quickly into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, considering his resume, go it seems he eventually
must. Go into that good night without the IBF, World Boxing
Council, and International Boxing Organization belts that Lewis
will carry into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why barely half of the 12,000 tickets available for
Lewis's first fight in his hometown in six years have been sold and
it may explain why Lewis disdainfully made Botha wait for more than
an hour Wednesday before finally showing up at a press conference
at a place called the Isle of Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   From where Botha stood it was the Isle of Underdogs and he well
understood that, even while insisting he had not bought into the
role he has been brought here to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not angry,'' Botha said of his situation and the public's
perception of it. ``Even against Mike they said I was a sacrificial
lamb and look what happened? My foolishness is what put me down
against Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they think this is an easy fight and that's what I want
them to think. Boxing has already opened up a lot of doors for me.
Now I have to use this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The champion believes if Botha does get some use out of this
fight, it will be to sell a few extra glasses back in the States,
but in the mind of an entrepreneur like Botha, there is another
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll pick up three belts on Saturday night,'' Botha
said. ``I know I'll do that. Boxing has opened a lot of doors for
me. I have to make use of this. I am a symbol of the American
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha, the owner of three Chinese restaurants and a passel of
real estate in Las Vegas as well as the champagne glass business,
is certainly all of that after having left a life of poverty in
South Africa to become a million-dollar heavyweight punching bag
for several world champions.
</P>
<P>
   So whether his chin cracks like his glassware might if Lennox
Lewis dropped a bomb on it, that part of Frans Botha's resume will
remain intact because even if he fails to win the WBC, IBF, and IBA
titles, there's always QVC to fall back on.

 &HT;    Santiago, Anderson question marks as Falcons report to camp
today
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - As National Football League training camps go, today
will be boring for the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Players report to Furman University in Greenville, S.C., but
they won't suit up until Friday. The lone practice that day will be
at 3 p.m., after morning meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The only topics of importance today will be decisions on whether
tight end O.J. Santiago and running back Jamal Anderson are
sufficiently recovered from injuries to participate Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has tendinitis in the surgically repaired right knee
that kept him out of 14 games last season. Santiago has been
limited since surgery four months ago to repair a torn chest
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a 5 p.m. softball game pits coaches and staff
members against the media.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches won in 1997 and '99, but then the team went 7-9 and
5-11. After the media won in 1998, the Falcons went 14-2 and ended
up in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Superstitions aside, the hope is for a better start than last
year, when lightning forced everybody from the field the first day.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, former defensive end Chuck Smith badly sprained a
toe to begin a staggering string of injuries that carried through
camp and to the end of a 5-11 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be able to practice without worrying so much about
injuries,'' said Reeves, who begins his 20th season as a head
coach. ``I've liked our attitude in the offseason, but I thought
our attitude was good last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Terance Mathis is eager to put 1999 behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If training camp goes smooth, the season usually goes
smoother, and we had a rocky training camp last year,'' he said.
``There's a lot of enthusiasm around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Practices Saturday are at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. All sessions are
open to the public and free. For details, call 864-294-2550 or go
to the Internet at www.furman.edu.

SUDDEN FAME LEAVES NICKELODEON STAR GRATEFUL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lindsay Felton is an upbeat teen-ager who talks quickly and
easily about her acting career and her plans for college and
beyond, speaking in sentences of a dozen independent clauses strung
together and sprinkling the conversation with girlish laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Caitlin Seegar, the sullen, streetwise girl she
plays on Nickelodeon's landmark drama series, ``Caitlin's Way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it to you?'' Caitlin probably would snarl at a
reporter's questions. ``And tell that guy to get his camera out of
my face!''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a difference between the 15-year-old actress and her role.
Since she broke into series television at age 8 as Ed Asner's
granddaughter and Haley Joel Osment's sister on the sitcom
``Thunder Alley,'' Felton has been told by directors and
photographers, ``Smile, Lindsay!'' or more often, ``Great smile,
Lindsay!''
</P>
<P>
   Now she's playing a troubled teen-ager, an orphan from the
foster care system of Philadelphia who, after one too many brushes
with the law, was ordered by a judge to choose between juvenile
hall and moving to Montana to live on a ranch with her mother's
long-lost cousin, Dori Lowe, and her family. She chose Montana,
seeing it as just barely the lesser of two evils.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin is given to scowling and often confrontational, the kind
of kid who feels she probably isn't entitled to real happiness and,
if she senses it approaching, treats it with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Felton, who lives in Burbank, says she's put a bit of herself
into the Caitlin character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come out sometimes more than others, but I think there is
more than people realize, because I have to invest a lot to play
the character,'' Felton said. ``In some ways I'd like to be a
little bit more like Caitlin, and in some ways I would like Caitlin
to be a little more like me. We're both kind of rebellious, but she
just takes it to the extreme, whereas I am a little bit more mellow
about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   An illustration: Beside Lindsay's bedroom doorway is a small
piece of paper posted at eye level that reads, ``Do one thing every
day that scares you.'' Lindsay probably finds inspiration in it but
does not always comply. Caitlin, on the other hand, doesn't need
!ital!that kind of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   The job, if not the role, has Lindsay leading a double life
these days. From December through early June, she lives in Burbank
with her parents, two cats and a squawky bird, working on
home-schooling assignments and spending her free time in movie
theaters, in front of a computer or hanging with a close circle of
friends, most of them students at John Burroughs High School. She
swoons over the boy bands Hanson and the Moffatts, both of whom are
enshrined in her room amid a few stuffed animals, collectible
Barbies and books ranging from the gory thriller ``Hannibal'' to a
two-volume set of Shakespeare's plays.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by mid-June, she's off with her mother, Deborah Felton,
for a six- month stint in rugged, remote Alberta, Canada, where all
of the next season's 26 episodes are being shot. There she works
odd hours around the fickle weather to complete a half-hour episode
in four days' time, crams in three hours of schooling each weekday
with a tutor and, for amusement, passes time with her co-stars and
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't hear her complain about the lifestyle, not much
anyway. It's tiring and stressful, she admits, juggling the job and
schoolwork and being away from her Burbank friends for such a long
time. ``But the good definitely, definitely outweighs the bad, and
if it didn't, I wouldn't be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Felton very nearly missed out on this role of her lifetime _ not
because she was the wrong type, nor because she was one of hundreds
of girls trying out for it.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Tom Lynch, who also has made ``The Journey of
Allen Strange,'' ``The Secret World of Alex Mack'' and ``100 Deeds
for Eddie McDowd'' for Nickelodeon, says the lead character in this
pet project of his was meant to be a boy. The role still was
considered a male part just three days before the pilot was to
begin filming in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsay came in to read for the Griffen part,'' Lynch said,
referring to Dori and Jim Lowe's teen-ager, created as a girl but
ultimately cast with Santa Clarita resident Jeremy Foley. ``And I
said, `Give her the male lead (script), and she read it and she
nailed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said even with his proven track record with the top-rated
cable network, selling Nickelodeon on a series for 8- to
14-year-olds centered on a dark anti-hero was tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I wanted to do the first teen drama,'' Lynch said.
``And they said, 'Tommy, Tommy, do that funny stuff you do.' And I
said, 'It's important to me to do this show. I'm just coming to you
guys first.' So they said, 'Write the script,' and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said there was a lot of discussion with Nickelodeon's
executives on keeping the show true to his concept yet suitable to
Nick's family- friendly mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue always was how dramatic we can make it, how far can
we take it without alienating the Nickelodeon audience,'' Lynch
said. ``And we were both willing to challenge the audience and push
it further. But there are things we won't do. For instance, Caitlin
will never have sex, because your 6-year-old daughter may be
watching and I can't handle that responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, father of five kids ages 12-19, and the other ``Caitlin's
Way'' writers so far have succeeded in keeping the teen-agers'
dialogue and situations credible without straying into territory
that raises parents' eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nickelodeon's done a good job of making a rebel that
anyone literally can watch and parents don't have to restrict their
child from watching,'' Felton said. ``(Language is) one thing that
Nickelodeon totally draws the line on. We couldn't say 'snot' in
one of the episodes. They really definitely are very clean in what
they write.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon's gamble with teen drama and Lynch's execution of it
have paid off. ``Caitlin's Way'' attracted 6.5 million viewers for
its premiere episode last March, a record for any Nickelodeon
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining new episodes from the first season air beginning
July 23. Lynch says he has ``Caitlin's Way'' mapped out for 100
episodes or four full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months after the premiere, the series has raised
Lindsay's profile a bit, to the point where she occasionally gets
recognized in public, if not exactly mobbed. It could be a good
springboard toward her aspirations of studying at Yale or New York
University's Tisch film school, scoring a role or two in good
independent films, and ultimately hitting a Broadway stage.
</P>
<P>
   Her acting coach, Andrew Magarian of The Shop in North
Hollywood, said, ``She's a good actress, and it's within who she
is. I like her potential a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, reflecting on the happy, well-adjusted girl he found to
play the brooding one he created, sounds like a beaming father.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a major star,'' he said. ``It sounds like a cliche
in the business, but she can really hold the camera. I don't mind
writing a three- page scene for her because I know she can handle
it.'' &QL;

A PLAYFUL DEBUT AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SANDRA BARRERA 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was during the duet ``La ci darem la mano,'' a selection from
Mozart's opera ``Don Giovanni,'' that bass Samuel Ramey and mezzo
soprano Frederica von Stade stole the show at the Los Angeles
Philharmonic's opening night at the Hollywood Bowl on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the part of Giovanni, a ladies man who in the opera
tries to seduce the bride-to-be of another man, Ramey wrapped his
arms around von Stade and together they ran off stage, hand in
hand. The audience's applause of the surprising move seemed
endless.
</P>
<P>
   Performances by the L.A. Philharmonic tend to let loose this
way, and Tuesday was no exception. There were moments when the
performers waxed playful and moments when they were just plain
silly. In the song ``I Bought Me a Cat'' from Copland's ``Old
American Songs,'' von Stade did her best Donald Duck ``quack.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't all fun and games. Ramey's version of ``Old
Man River'' was breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   The concert opened with the L.A. Philharmonic, under the
direction of Leonard Slatkin, performing Berlioz's ``Roman Carnival
Overture.''
</P>
<P>
   Also featured in the program were works by Offenbach (``Ah! que
j'aime les militaires'' and ``Dites-lui qu'on l'a remarque'' from
``The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein''), Boito Verdi (``Ecco il
mondo'' from ``Mesfistofele'' and ``Uldino! Uldino! ... Mentre
gonfiarsi l'anima'' from ``Attila''), Copland (``An Outdoor
Overture'' and selections from ``Old American Songs'') Kern and
Hammerstein (selections from ``Show Boat'') and Rodgers and
Hammerstein (``Some Enchanted Evening'' from ``South Pacific'' and
``People Will Say We're in Love'' from ``Oklahoma!'').
</P>
<P>
   Slatkin got a few laughs, too, when during Gershwin's
``Promenade (Walking the Dog)'' from the movie ``Shall We Dance,''
he took five from his directing duties. Leaning against his
conductor's banister, he crossed his arms and watched as the
musicians did their thing.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. Philharmonic returns tonight for a concert that
features 17- year-old cellist Han-Na Chang. &UR;  &QL;

COMPANIES MOVING TO SECURE PHONE RIGHTS IN EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Three wireless communications companies on Wednesday
moved aggressively to secure a presence in Europe, one of the
world's most promising markets for the next generation of mobile
communications.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., the sprawling Hong Kong conglomerate
controlled by billionaire Li Ka-Shing, is teaming with NTT DoCoMo,
Japan's largest wireless phone company and a leader in providing
Internet services over mobile phones, and Royal KPN, a Dutch mobile
phone operator, to buy up rights to offer next generation mobile
communication services in Britain, Germany, France and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is another triumph for Li, who has displayed a knack
for exploiting opportunities in the telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
   He has already parlayed one British wireless venture, Orange,
into yet another fortune when he sold it to the German
telecommunications conglomerate Mannesmann for stock and then
watched the value of those shares skyrocket after Mannesmann was
acquired by Vodafone of Britain, the world's largest wireless
company, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's deal was a big step toward recouping his recent,
much criticized $6.7 billion investment in a license to supply
next-generation infrastructure and services to Britain. With
DoCoMo's and KPN's 2.1 billion pound, or $3.2 billion, investment
in the company that holds that license, Li will recover almost half
of the original investment _ but relinquish only a 35 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison 3G Holdings Ltd., the company that holds the license,
clearly aims to be Europe's leading provider of third-generation
mobile communications services.
</P>
<P>
   The license it holds is the most extensive of the five licenses
granted by the British government to sell third-generation wireless
communications in Britain, one of the most lucrative markets in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And supported by the extensive financial resources of Hutchison
and the technical expertise of DoCoMo, Hutchison 3G will be a
formidable bidder for the licenses scheduled to be auctioned in
Germany in July and later in France and Belgium. Various executives
said on Wednesday that Hutchison 3G might also bid in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is one more sign that savvy telecommunications
companies are trying to exert some control over the prices of
licenses by banding together, which effectively reduces the number
of potential bidders for any one license.
</P>
<P>
   The British government's auction of five licenses last spring
attracted 13 bidders and raised $34 billion, which was considered a
staggering sum. Contrast that with the current auction of five
licenses in the Netherlands, which has lured only six potential
buyers whose bids to date total about $397 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison withdrew from the Dutch auction last week, as did a
British cable company, which said it would rather lease
infrastructure from others.
</P>
<P>
   Governments are starting to fight back by limiting the number of
licenses they will sell and establishing minimum prices, but the
industry is clearly working hard to ensure that owning
next-generation licenses makes economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   DoCoMo will pay (PS)1.2 billion, or $1.8 billion at current
exchange rates, for a 20 percent stake in Hutchison 3G. DoCoMo
already owns a 19 percent stake in Hutchison's Hong Kong mobile
business.
</P>
<P>
   Royal KPN, in which DoCoMo has a 15 percent stake, will pay
(PS)900 million, or $1.4 billion, for a 15 percent stake. KPN is
one of the top bidders in the Dutch auction, offering 208.5 million
Euros so far.
</P>
<P>
   Telesystems International Wireless Inc., a Canadian mobile phone
operator that teamed up with Hutchison to buy the British license,
is left with an option to buy up to 6.5 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the downward pressure on license prices, the costs of
developing mobile phone systems that allow users fast access to the
Internet and the ability to download video 40 times faster than
today will be high. Hutchison 3G will serve as a springboard for
the three companies to aggressively pursue opportunities in Europe
while sharing the costs of of an expensive expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison 3G's new ownership structure clearly leaves Hutchison
as the dominant partner. It will control the majority of seats on
Hutchison 3G's board of directors and retain a 65 percent stake.

A DIGITAL MUSICIAN TURNS A FEW NOTES INTO WEB POETRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By LUCY DEAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not uncommon for me to create, literally, a half-second of
sound,'' said Lem Jay Ignacio, a digital musician who scores
original music and audio effects for the Web. ``It's exciting to
think of sound not as a melody or phrase but as tiny frozen and
unfrozen specks of sonic sparkle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio, who lives in Santa Monica, Calif., is one of the new
group of musical composers who are bringing their talents to the
Web, turning from more traditional formats like radio and
television to online magazines, interactive games and Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   He has created sound for RSUB, which produces and distributes
online entertainment content; Movieline.com; Gravitygames.com and
the site for Teen magazine. He is also developing sound for the new
Web site for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio's striped polyester thrift-store slacks, 1970s
high-fashion sunglasses and vintage Santa Monica Track T-shirt
reflect his sound aesthetic: retro, pop and humorous.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in San Jose, Calif., well before real estate prices
skyrocketed because of the dot-com economy. He began playing
classical piano at age 6 and was soon composing short musical
pieces. When he discovered synthesizers as a teen-ager, he put
Chopin behind him and began manipulating sounds electronically,
later earning his bachelor's and master's degrees in music
composition at the University of Southern California. He became a
musical director for numerous Los Angeles theaters while also
composing music for videos, commercials and cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   For his first Internet project, Klik-a-Days for the online
magazine Word in New York, Ignacio was asked to compose two-second
sound loops for more than 200 animated mini-tableaus, one for each
weekday of the year. As he started scoring audio accompaniment to
the tiny scenes _ a floating woman, a frog, a truck on a windy road
_ he realized that the Web required a new way of thinking about
music and sound. ``It's about being creative within two to five
notes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the sound on the Web is like, hey, the dorky
programmer is in a band, why doesn't he put some music on our Web
page.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Bowe, Word's editor in chief and the executive producer
of ``Sissy Fight 2000,'' an online multiplayer game, said, ``Lem
Jay is a poet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Klik-a-Days are like haikus,'' Bowe said. ``They're not about
analyzing or saying anything, they just evoke one moment in all its
complex subtlety. I'm in awe at the detail, mood and intelligence
that he can communicate in just seconds. The animation could be
saying, `This is happening,' but will give you a little signal that
not all is as it seems through music.''
</P>
<P>
   As he began to score more complicated interactive games and
sites, Ignacio had to reconceive composition once again,
envisioning audio components in a nonlinear way, as a kind of
architectural space through which visitors proceed from room to
room in arbitrary sequences.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Zimmerman, a game designer who collaborated with Ignacio on
``Sissy Fight,'' said: ``Sound on the Internet has to be modular,
like a set of Legos. Audio elements combine and recombine in
different ways depending on how you play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio works in a wood-paneled studio, a 1950s addition to his
house, which he shares with his wife, Tania Fischer. His Macintosh
computer is surrounded by a yellow children's xylophone, a 1960s
drum set and vintage synthesizers. To achieve his audio effects,
Ignacio uses several sources _ his voice (``The old `Rocky and
Bullwinkle' cartoons used voices for all their sound effects, even
the crash of a plane,'' he noted), garage-sale Casio keyboards and
vinyl records, which create thin, low-fidelity musical textures,
mouse-overs and click sounds.
</P>
<P>
   He then uses digital technology to play and zoom in, cut up and
manipulate those sounds. The results are tested on high-quality
studio monitors as well as laptop speakers; if the music does not
pass muster on either system, he may make a change, like adding
treble or altering the volume.
</P>
<P>
   Marina Zurkow, founder of the O-Matic Corp. and the creator and
director of Braingirl, a Web animated series on RSUB, said the
essence of Ignacio's style is ``sophisticated slapstick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's excellent musicality and a broad musical range, but
there's a humor and lightness, too,'' Zurkow said.
</P>
<P>
   But audio is becoming increasingly sophisticated as modem speed
and bandwidth increase and as companies rely more and more on the
Internet to reach a youth market, sell their product and articulate
a brand identity. Thomas Dolby's company, Beatnik, whose tag line
is ``sonifying your digital world,'' is capitalizing on this
growing zeal to incorporate sound into Web sites, creating audio
platforms and licensing audio content for users to import to their
sites.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier generation of sound composers for games, who scored
music and effects for console games and CD-ROMs in the 1980s and
1990s, have paved the way for artists like Ignacio, said Michael
Sweet, creative director of Blister Media, a company in Silicon
Alley in New York that develops audio for interactive media as well
as television, radio and film.
</P>
<P>
   But a cohesive group of Internet sound designers is only
beginning to emerge. ``They're a small community, though they're
growing all the time,'' Sweet said. ``A couple dozen of us do it,
but we don't always know who our competition is, because a lot of
independent people are working out of their basements. You don't
hear about them until you see a fantastic Web site and ask who did
the sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio creates sharp, distinctive sounds, from the shrill meow
of a cat on a new all-terrain-board game to the malevolent cackle
of a boy hurling snowballs on Terror Lift (both on
Gravitygames.com). But for a six-second background loop, like the
recess racket on the Sissy Fight playgrounds or the arrangement for
the Match game show on the Teen magazine site, ``there can't be
many accents or punctuation, because then the loop becomes
apparent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sound has to be watered down, but watered down
stylistically. It has to be more subtle because of the repetitive
nature of the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Since users return to their favorite sites and click the same
icons over and over, Ignacio is building random audio effects into
his new projects, including the Museum of Contemporary Art site, a
basketball game for Slam magazine's site and broadband sites for
Kick Media and Teen magazine. Visitors will hear different sound
sequences each time they visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound is like confetti,'' he said. ``The user shouldn't know
where it will fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio's most forward-thinking interactive project is Star, on
the Word site. Animated red stars multiply and resonate with a
drumbeat or a soft, tinkley tone when the cursor moves across the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Site sound can become like poetry or a new minimalism,''
Ignacio said. ``Some people think repetition is boring, others
think it's natural and eternal, like a heartbeat or running water.
But the very simplicity of Star belies the effort behind it. It
took 50 tries, a whole day, to get one little second of sound.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as more traditional sites go, sound has yet to make
itself heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of information Web sites are still stuck in a
magazine style of delivering content,'' Sweet said, ``where you
download and read a page, as opposed to having a rich audiovisual
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of a ``sonified'' Internet, however, is sensory
overload.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of noise in our culture,'' Zurkow said.
``Sometimes sound is fantastic and you want to add it, but
sometimes it's dissonant and offensive. For electronic texts and
e-commerce, I don't want to hear dings, bells, whistles. The idea
of ubiquitous sound is frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsia Carson, the creative director of Flat Media, a company in
TriBeCa that designed the Urban Outfitters site and is developing
the site for WNYC radio, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a killjoy when it comes to sound on the Web,'' Carson
said. ``Because people multitask online, they want to listen to
MP3s or CDs of their own preference. When sound is attached to a
game or other interactive module it's fine, but when it's applied
willy-nilly it interrupts usability.''

GORE SAYS HE'S MORE THAN JUST TALK ON RACIAL ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ A fired-up Al Gore preached to the converted
Wednesday, bringing a gathering of cheering African-American voters
to their feet numerous times as he pledged to fight racial
profiling, back affirmative action and improve educational and job
opportunities for black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk doesn't cost much. Taking a stand when it matters
requires courage,'' the vice president told the delegates to the
annual convention of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People. ``I don't want to work with those who make
excuses for the way things are, instead of striving for the way
they're supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm response was in marked contrast to the reception Gore's
opponent, Texas Governor George W. Bush, got when he addressed the
NAACP convention on Monday. While Bush was greeted with polite
applause, delegates here complained the presumptive Republican
presidential nominee was heavy on generalities and light on
specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush didn't even shake our hands. He just got on and got
off,'' said Erma Madden, an NAACP representative from Allegheny,
Pa. ``He was just talking about what was wrong. He didn't say
anything about what he was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore never mentioned his opponent by name, but it was clear to
the crowd that the likely Democratic nominee was talking about Bush
when he criticized unnamed politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a member of the NAACP. It's good to be home,'' Gore said,
drawing sustained applause. ``I have come here not just in an
election year, but every year. I have walked with you. I have stood
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign dismissed Gore's claims of accomplishments for
African-Americans, saying the Clinton-Gore administration had not
done enough to improve educational performance for minority
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore should explain why his administration broke its
promise to close the achievement gap,'' said Bush spokesman Ari
Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore promised to fight for a higher minimum wage and to expand
``empowerment zones'' meant to bring prosperity to financially
lagging communities. He talked about addressing the AIDS crisis in
Africa _ a continent, he noted, he has visited more often than
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president denounced those who oppose affirmative action
and hate crimes legislation and those who refused to take a stand
in the controversy over whether South Carolina should fly the
Confederate flag over its capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happened to see some of your convention on Monday,''
Gore said, drawing a chuckle from the crowd. ``You know from your
history that talk is cheap. It's deeds that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just asking you to read my lips,'' Gore said, echoing
the phrase used by Bush's father, former President George Bush.
``I'm asking you to read my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls consistently show Gore well ahead of Bush in
support among African-Americans. The challenge Gore faces is to get
African-American voters to turn out at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any presidential candidate, he needs to have a large,
energized black turnout,'' said Earl Black, a Southern politics
expert at Rice University. ``And by Election Day, I have no doubt
he will.''
</P>
<P>
   But while there is ``no question'' that Gore will command some
90 percent of the African-American vote, Black believes, ``the
question is whether it will be 90 percent of a small vote, or 90
percent of a large vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore still does not have the appeal for African-Americans that
President Clinton has, and some of Gore's support among black
voters stems from the popularity of the president, several NAACP
members said privately Wednesday. Clinton is to scheduled to
address the convention Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore is winning over more African-Americans on his own, some
members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton does it the best I've seen, and I'm 65 years
old,'' said Lonnie Strickland, a Detroit member. But Gore ``can
still do the same thing Clinton is doing, and better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is likely to lose most of the deep South to Bush,
regardless of the black vote, Black predicted. African-American
voter turnout will be much more critical to Gore in Northern and
Midwestern states like Illinois and Michigan, where the contests
are likely to be closer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's true strategy may not be to win over black voters, but to
woo white moderates who want to believe the Republican Party is
more open to African-Americans and other minorities, suggested
Kweisi Mfume, president of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   ``To them (centrist voters), the message was, `See? I'm like
you,''' Mfume said. ``It was a tactical move.''
</P>
<P>
   NAACP leadership and members insisted Wednesday they were open
to hearing what Bush had to say, although Gore was clearly the
favored son in this week's rhetorical face-off.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush spoke on Monday, ``it was obvious to everyone in the
crowd that he was uncomfortable,'' said Christina McCarthy, of
Hempstead, New York. ``And we made a conscious effort to make him
feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the NAACP is officially non-partisan, the leadership's
preference for Gore was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Bush, Mfume said, ``Instead of hitting a home run,
he hit a single. But the bases were loaded for the vice president.
Al Gore is pretty much a family member.''

</P>
<P>
   LOST-FANS _ Major League Baseball takes center stage here
Tuesday with the annual All-Star game with all the glitz and
glamour you might expect. But all that can't hide the fact that the
sport is loing a generation of young fans, who have been pushed
away from the sport by high prices, late night starts and the greed
of the owners. The owners seem oblivious to the fact that the kids
who aren't watching now probably won't be watching 20 years from
now. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   ALLSTAR _ An essay. At a time when many say major league
baseball is dying because of the length of games, players switching
teams and leagues, night World Series games that eliminate the need
for radios in classrooms in October _ we explain why the All-Star
Game is prosaic, cerebral, attractive. Why it is still as American
as Chevrolet and apple pie and why on All-Star night, it all comes
together. Why it's still America's pastime. Why it was started in
1933, why it survived WWII, and why it's the best All-Star game of
all the pro sports. (Stinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 50-60''

SHEET MUSIC ON CD AND ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By LISA GUERNSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Theodore Presser Co. started publishing sheet music in 1783.
This week it will start to publish sheet music in a different form,
as .pdf files on CD-ROM disks.
</P>
<P>
   The company has teamed up with a CD-Rom company called CD Sheet
Music to put thousands of pages of classical scores in digital
form. The first 15 CD-Roms _ which include the complete piano solos
of Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Mozart, Schumann and many others _
are showing up in music stores this week.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 2002, the company plans to sell a series of 110
disks. Most of the disks will sell for about $15 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are talking about is something akin to the world's
greatest music library,'' said Tom Broido, president of Theodore
Presser. ``We're giving people the opportunity to have it in their
own home.''
</P>
<P>
   Each CD-Rom includes Adobe Acrobat software that enables people
to view the sheet music on their computer screens and print it out
on 8{ by 11 paper without reformatting. It also enables searching
and browsing by a composer's name or a score's title. The software
can be used on either Windows or Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sheet music is offered online by other companies. Sheet Music
Online (www.sheetmusic1.com) and Music-Scores.com
(www.music-scores.com) offer sheet music that can be viewed on Web
pages and printed at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   But searching through the archives on free music sites can
sometimes be cumbersome and finding rare works is unlikely. Those
are two problems that the Theodore Presser Co. hopes to rectify
with its CD-Roms, which use a simple interface that enables users
to click on titles in a table of contents and immediately view the
music in printable form.
</P>
<P>
   Broido said that the company was also intent on making its disks
as inexpensive as possible, which is why they include nothing but
black-and-white sheet music. They do not include any sound files or
interactive graphics.
</P>
<P>
   They do, however, enable users to print as many sheets as they
want. Broido said he expected that piano teachers, for example,
might buy the CDs and print sheet music for students to sample. As
long as people are not reselling the printouts or making a business
out of their use, Broido said, they are free to use them as they
would like.
</P>
<P>
   The music is all in the public domain, and Broido said that he
was not concerned that people would bootleg the CDs because buying
a disk is probably less of a burden for most users than figuring
out how to burn a new copy. ``The price of the product is its
greatest protection,'' Broido said.
</P>
<P>
   The disks might also be seen as protection against overstuffed
piano benches, since each package includes many volumes of scores.
The CD-Rom titled ``Beethoven: The Complete Works of Solo Piano,''
for example, includes more than 1,500 pages of music. The disk
featuring the complete keyboard sonatas of Haydn and Scarlatti
includes more than 2,500 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest one-disk collection is ``The Ultimate
Collection of Piano Studies and Exercise,'' which features staples
of piano practice like mind-numbing finger exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is every pianist's worst nightmare,'' said Dwight
Munroe, the advertising manager. ``It is over 3,000 pages.''

COMPUTERS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: ADDING PROGRAM ICONS TO WINDOWS 98
TASKBAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is it possible to add icons to the Windows 98 taskbar for
programs that I frequently use?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, icons can be added in just a few steps for frequently
used programs or files to the Quick Launch toolbar in the taskbar.
On many Windows systems, you will already see some icons, like the
one for Internet Explorer. Right-click on an empty area of the
Quick Launch toolbar, and make sure that Quick Launch is checked on
the pop-up menu.
</P>
<P>
   Locate the program or file that you would like to place in the
Quick Launch toolbar. You can either go through My Computer or the
Windows Explorer to find your desired items; program files will
have an .exe extension.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once you have found the item, drag the file onto the Quick
Launch toolbar and let go when you see a small vertical black bar
flash in the toolbar. A shortcut to the original file will be
created in the taskbar, and a small icon should appear. (Remember,
a shortcut is not a copy but rather, a pointer. It can be moved or
deleted without harming the original.)
</P>
<P>
   To delete programs or files from the Quick Launch toolbar,
right-click on the unwanted icon, select Delete and click on OK in
the alert box that asks if you want to move the shortcut to the
Recycle Bin.
</P>
<P>
   If you would like to clean your desktop of clutter, you can drag
the shortcuts onto the Quick Launch toolbar and then delete them
from the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   If you would prefer to open files from desktop icons instead of
tiny taskbar icons but do not have existing shortcut files, it is
simple to create them. Locate the original program or file,
right-click on the icon and select Create Shortcut. You can then
drag the shortcut file to wherever you would like.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My version of the Netscape browser for Macintosh does not
display pictures on Web pages unless I click on the Images button
on the toolbar. Is there a way to fix this so the pictures
automatically show up?
</P>
<P>
   A. For those who prefer to surf for text and not wait for images
to download, most browsers provide an option to block the pictures
and graphics. You can check Netscape's Preferences to see if this
no-images option is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   To do this in the latest version of Netscape for the Macintosh
and Windows, go to Edit in the menu bar and select Preferences.
When the Preferences box pops up, click on the advanced category in
the left side of the box and make sure the ``Automatically load
images'' option is checked.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I change my Windows password?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you would like to change your existing Windows password,
go to the Start menu and select Settings and then Control Panel.
Double-click on the Passwords icon, click on Change Windows
Password and then click on OK. You will be asked to type in your
old password first, and then to type in the new one you wish to
use. You will need to type the new password a second time to
confirm it, and then click on OK.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When talking about the Internet, what is meant by the term
``backbone?''
</P>
<P>
   A. Much like the nervous-system signals that are transmitted
along the spinal cord, the backbone of a network is the pipeline
that handles most of the major traffic for computers connected to
it. The backbone is often the longest physical part of the network
and usually contains cable capable of delivering data at the
fastest speeds. Several communications companies, like UUNet,
Sprint, MCI and GTE, own the biggest networks that help make up the
Internet backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller networks connect to the backbone at various points,
giving users the ability to communicate. And just as an injury to
your back can slow you down, a problem with part of the Internet
backbone can make your connection sluggish or even put it out of
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Circuits invites questions about computer-based technology, by
e-mail to Q&AMP;A(at)nytimes.com or mail to Questions, Circuits, The
New York Times, 229 West 43rd St., New York, N.Y. 10036-3959. This
column will answer questions of general interest, but letters
cannot be answered individually.

   ``He got beat by a girl last year,'' said Mac Davis, general
manager of Y-96 radio station, sponsor of the 2000 Redneck Games.
</P>
<P>
   The contest warmed the crowd up for the armpit serenade. Blake
Nimmons, 12, of Soperton, Ga., furiously pumped his arm to squeeze
out a crowd-pleasing rendition of ``Dixie.''

   Still dripping from a cooling plunge in the Oconee River, rising

   The 5th Annual Red Neck Games started early Saturday at Buckeye
Park in East Dublin with a six-mile homemade raft race down the
Oconee and ended with fireworks in the evening. Rick Hunter rode
his motorcycle five hours from DeLand, Fla., to be there. ``I'm
looking for a woman bobbing for pig's feet. I've never seen a woman
with a pig's foot in her mouth except my mother and she was eating

   Thousands braved the Middle Georgia heat to go for beer can
trophies in events such as the hubcap hurl, the Dumpster dive and
bug zapper spitball.
</P>
<P>
   Randy ``L-bow'' Tidwell, wearing a T-shirt with his picture on
it and ``Genuine Redneck'' printed across the top, officially
opened the games. Tidwell, known as Middle Georgia's ``best known
redneck,'' began the festivities by lighting a beer can torch.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day festivalgoers were entertained by live music
by various local groups, including The Southern Touch Band, arts
and crafts, barbecue, watermelon and boiled peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   The games began in 1996 as a counterpoint to the Olympics held
in Atlanta, drawing a crowd of 3,000. This year more than 8,000
people were expected at the park on the banks of the Oconee.

WEB SERVICES OFFER SOLUTIONS TO BOOKMARK OVERLOAD 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIA LAWLOR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Debbie Tegarden's bookmark file, with 600 or so Web sites, is
like a house with overflowing closets. She would like to get rid of
the clutter, but the thought of parting with even one item makes
her cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Tegarden's collection, amassed over four years, is eclectic.
There are sites about opera, manatees, jug bands, woodchucks, Honda
repairs, elephants, philosophers, authors and the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten out of control,'' said Tegarden, an editor at
Princeton University Press.
</P>
<P>
   To get help, enthusiastic bookmark fans like Tegarden can turn
to a number of free, relatively new online services that promise to
manage bookmark overload. (Most services find that their users have
50 to 100 bookmarks apiece, though some have thousands).
</P>
<P>
   Some bookmark management sites will take a list of Web pages
(the entries are called bookmarks in the Netscape browser and
favorites in Internet Explorer) and automatically categorize them.
Others give their users things like color coding to make it easier
for users to do their own organizing. All will upload bookmarks
from a browser, let the user get access to them from any computer
and share them with others. Users can search the collection of
bookmarks submitted by other members to the site; doing that is
often a more refined way of conducting a search than perusing the
entire Web. If several members of a family use the same computer,
establishing an account for each member can eliminate the need to
search through a long list of links.
</P>
<P>
   To sign onto a site, you simply fill out a form with a member
name and password, then click the appropriate button allowing the
site to copy the list of links on your browser. On most bookmark
sites, no one will be able to view your links unless you
specifically request it, but policies vary.
</P>
<P>
   The following are the four largest bookmark management sites:
</P>
<P>
   CLICKMARKS.COM: www.clickmarks.com
</P>
<P>
   Clickmarks started in February 1999 and says it is the oldest of
the management sites. Clickmarks cites its automatic categorization
feature as one of its highlights, even though a site spokesman,
Rizwan Tufail, said the technology was not perfect. ``We
continuously screen our process for mistakes, but mistakes will
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The site will also keep track of your log-in names and passwords
and log you into any of your Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Clickmarks has more than 2 million links in its library of
members' bookmarks. It provides services for about 100,000
individuals, and it has 110,000 users through ivillage.com and
women.com, which are partner Web sites. You can easily move links
from one folder to another by dragging and dropping, and you can
get access to your bookmarks with a Web-enabled cell phone or other
wireless device.
</P>
<P>
   BLINK.COM: www.blink.com
</P>
<P>
   This site has quickly gained a following because of its numerous
features. But it does not categorize links, leaving that task to
the individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with automatic categorization is that it's not
really doable,'' said Blink's chief executive, David Siegel. ``It's
a personal decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Denton, a consultant in Cincinnati who helps companies
and individuals organize their offices, agreed. ``In general, it's
more effective for people to categorize their own information the
way they might use it,'' Denton said.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of Blink is that descriptive phrases can be added
to identify each link, while a browser like Internet Explorer
allows only the site's title. Links can be be displayed in
different fonts and colors. Bookmarks can be sorted alphabetically
and by how often they are used and when they were used last. Blink
also allows the user to drag and drop links from one folder to
another and to search the full text of Web pages in its database,
not just the titles. It will display related sites. (The site has a
database of 10 million links).
</P>
<P>
   It also has a Grab Link feature that allows users to go to a Web
page, get a list of every link on the page and pick which ones to
add to their account. Members also get accounts that allow them to
share their bookmarks easily with one another and with people who
are not registered with Blink.
</P>
<P>
   Users can get access to Blink with cell phones and other
wireless devices. A ``lite'' version without graphics can be viewed
on handheld devices like the Palm.
</P>
<P>
   BACKFLIP.COM: www.backflip.com
</P>
<P>
   This site, started by two former Netscape employees, is simple
to use. Backflip says it was the first site to offer full-text
searches for a member's own Web pages, which means that words can
be searched for not only in Web page titles but also in the body of
the pages.
</P>
<P>
   Backflip also categorizes bookmarks automatically, although the
end result is not always perfect. Tegarden, for instance, tried
letting Backflip organize her list and found the Web page of the
book publisher St. Martin's Press filed under sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Backflip also sorts your list of links alphabetically and by the
latest Web pages you have added. It will also show you the 10 pages
you use most often. There is no drag-and-drop feature, so you need
to click on Edit and choose a new folder to move a link.
</P>
<P>
   Backflip allows access to its links from cell phones and other
wireless devices, and it offers its services to 250 partner Web
sites, including TheStreet.com and Salon.com. If a group of users
is sharing a list of links, each one is notified every time a new
page is added. A new feature called My Daily Routine lets you put
together a string of sites you tend to visit every day. You can
flip quickly through those Web pages, much as you might channel
surf on a television. Backflip also provides a list of sites
related to your top 10 favorites.
</P>
<P>
   HOTLINKS.COM: www.hotlinks.com
</P>
<P>
   This site is the largest, with 450,000 members. Unlike most of
its competitors, HotLinks' links are public by default, so if you
upload your links to this site and want to keep them private, you
must specifically ask to do that. But the whole point of the site
is for members to be able to peek at one another's links.
</P>
<P>
   HotLinks, with a database of 8 million links chosen by its
members, calls itself ``the world's first people-powered
directory'' because its database is generated by its users, not by
editors.
</P>
<P>
   The site allows members to categorize their own listings of Web
pages. Research conducted by HotLinks found that software to
categorize site names automatically worked only 30 percent of the
time, said Melissa Lloyd, HotLinks' vice president for marketing.
``We won't add automatic categorization until it's 95 percent
accurate,'' Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   The site allows users to sort their links alphabetically and to
drag and drop links. It also shows links related to whatever Web
page the user is viewing. By mid-August, HotLinks says, people will
be able to use cell phones and other wireless devices to navigate
the site.

RUSSIANS HAILED FOR PROTON LAUNCH DESPITE FINANCIAL HURDLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia was praised by its foreign partners Wednesday for
overcoming economic adversity to launch the long-delayed crew
module for the U.S.-led international space station, but its
officials hinted that future contributions to the project still
were in peril.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-foot module, designed by the Russians to furnish living
quarters for the station's first resident astronauts, made its
first orbits of the Earth on Wednesday after a flawless liftoff
from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's mission control said the new module's many electronic
and mechanical components had responded to commands. More tests and
at least eight major maneuvers will be necessary to set up the
automated docking July 25 with the two station components already
launched. A NASA shuttle crew mated those two pieces in December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   After the module is connected, the outpost will be ready for its
first resident crew of astronauts and cosmonauts in late October.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-nation alliance that includes the space agencies of Europe,
Japan, Canada and Brazil as well as the United States and Russia is
counting on the linkup to allow a succession of 15 station assembly
and supply missions in the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The backlog of missions was caused by a 27-month delay in the
fabrication of the crew module, also known as Zvezda, Russian for
``star.'' The delay was caused by economic and political turmoil in
Russia following the breakup of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Russian module's seamless trip to orbit aboard
a Proton rocket was reason for top-level participants to both
rejoice and look ahead with new skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore termed the launch an ``important
milestone'' in the station partnership he helped to formulate with
the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are a resilient, tough, tough people,'' said NASA
administrator Dan Goldin, who has had to fend off critics for his
enthusiastic endorsement of the 1993 Clinton administration
decision to assign the Russians a prominent role in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've come through economic crisis after economic crisis,
political crisis after political crisis, tackled technical problem
after technical problem and never gave up,'' said Goldin. ``I like
showing the skeptics they are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long hard journey for them,'' said Frank
Longhurst, space station program manager for the European Space
Agency, which represents 11 of the project's international
partners. ``They are to be admired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, however, seemed reluctant to speculate about what
the milestone will mean for their role as a major contributor to
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great problems with the funding and paying for
construction of space vehicles, and in the coming months we will
have to resolve these issues,'' said Yuri Grigoriev, the deputy
chief designer for RSC Energia, the most powerful of the Russian
Aviation and Space Agency's aerospace contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the program of the Russian segment of the international
space station should be reconsidered. We should revise our plans
and make adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the one-of-a-kind habitat module, the Russians
have promised to provide a half-dozen Progress cargo and Soyuz crew
transport capsule launches annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Progress missions are needed to supply fuel and some of the
propulsion that will be required to keep the expanding space
station at a safe altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Until NASA completes its own delayed development of an American
lifeboat for the station, the orbital outpost will require a Soyuz
launch every six months. Functioning as temporary lifeboats while
they are docked to the station, the Soyuz capsules could whisk a
small resident crew to Earth if a meteor penetrated the walls of
the orbital outpost, fire erupted or one of the occupants suffered
from a life-threatening illness.
</P>
<P>
   Those demands will leave Russia with few resources to expand its
own segment of the new station, as the better-financed Americans,
Europeans and Japanese plan to do.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the Russians' financial plight in space, a Pizza
Hut insignia graced the side of the crew module's towering, white
Proton launcher. Though terms of the unusual advertisement were not
disclosed, the Wall Street Journal placed it at about $1 million
when the deal was struck last fall.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Russians will have no difficulty launching a
Soyuz and up to three of the Progress capsules, Grigoriev said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted trouble next year, though, if Russia attempts eight
station launches, including spring delivery of a spherical
compartment that would serve as a connecting point for future
Russian research modules.
</P>
<P>
   Grigoriev pointed out that work has stopped on a towering
complex of power-generating solar arrays because of a lack of
funds. Slated for a 2002 liftoff, the so-called Russian science
power platform is now an unlikely addition.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the space station will continue well into 2006.
The orbital complex will stretch to the size of two football fields
placed side-by-side and house seven people.

NASDAQ HAS BIGGEST GAIN IN FIVE WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Internet and other computer-related stocks surged on
Wednesday, propelling the Nasdaq market to its biggest gain in more
than five weeks and back into positive territory for the year, a
perch it has not held since mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index rose 143.17 points, or 3.62 percent,
to 4,099.59 _ the best finish since April 10, the beginning of a
disastrous week when the index fell 25.3 percent over five
consecutive days. Analysts and strategists attributed the sharp
rise to fading concern about higher interest rates and a
better-than-expected earnings report from Yahoo, an Internet
bellwether, issued after exchanges closed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo helped set the stage,'' said Andrew Brooks, chief trader
at T. Rowe Price Associates, as revived strength in high technology
shoved cyclical stocks, which briefly rallied earlier in the week,
into the background once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average posted its fourth consecutive
gain, rising 56.57 points, or 0.53 percent, to 10,783.76. J.P.
Morgan, up 4 5/8, to 122 9/16, accounted for more than half the
advance. Brokerage stocks, benefiting from the announced takeover
of PaineWebber by Switzerland's UBS, joined high technology as the
session's best-performing group. PaineWebber soared 16 15/16 to 66
7/8.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 12.04 points, or
0.81 percent, to 1,492.92, lifting its gain so far this year to
1.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real concern is earnings, not interest rates,'' said
Charles J. Pradilla, strategist at SG Cowen Securities. ``And
there's a growing conviction that you're looking either at the last
or the penultimate tightening'' by the Federal Reserve Board.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Micro Circuits, up 11 11/16, to 125 7/16, reported after
the close that revenue more than doubled and profits, after
allowing for merger costs, beat expectations. Bestfoods, to be
acquired by Unilever, matched Wall Street profit estimates.
Motorola said after the markets closed on Wednesday that its
earnings met expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo clearly led the market and convinced people that the
fundamentals of Internet stocks, which have been acting sickly
lately, remain vibrant,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment
officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Having erased the steep losses of the spring, the Nasdaq is now
ahead for the year, by a scant 0.74 percent, after an 85.6 percent
leap in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has also become far less volatile, with the average
intraday trading range over the latest 30 sessions moving below 100
points on Wednesday for the first time since Jan. 20, said Fane
Lozman, a researcher in Chicago; the average range peaked at 226.69
on April 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow narrowed its loss so far this year to 6.2 percent. After
J.P. Morgan, the biggest positive contributors were Intel and IBM,
each up more than 2 points. Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Exxon Mobil, Merck
and Wal-Mart each lost a point or more.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks were weak as the Senate considered adding
prescription benefits for Medicare recipients, with investors
worried about possible price controls that could more than offset
the benefit of greater sales.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks, however, joined technology and brokerage issues
as prominent winners.

U.N. OFFICIAL SEEN RETREATING FROM PLAN TO CURB NEWS MEDIA IN
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Under pressure from local Albanian
journalists and international news media watch-dogs, the United
Nations administration is likely to abandon plans for a formal code
of conduct for the news media in Kosovo, a senior U.N. official
says.
</P>
<P>
   But a law that provides for the fining, suspension or closing of
print or broadcast media will remain on the books, the official
said. The regulation, signed by the U.N. chief here, Bernard
Kouchner, is intended to prevent the publication or broadcasting of
personal details about people who might become targets of Albanian
or Serbian vigilantes.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration of the U.N. authorities is evident as
inter-ethnic attacks continue, especially on the Serbian minority
in Kosovo, while a system of international judges to deal with such
crimes is just beginning to function.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner issued the regulation after an Albanian-language
newspaper, Dita, published an article on April 27 accusing two
Serbs, Petar Topoljski and his father, of being paramilitaries.
Petar Topoljski, 25, still lived in Kosovo and worked as a
translator for the United Nations; the paper published his address
and photograph. Three weeks later he was found murdered, stabbed
with a wire wound around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   His death seemed an example of the press feeding the cycle of
vengeance against Serbs, with no recourse to the police or the
courts. While there could be no direct connection drawn between the
Dita article and the murder, Kouchner decided to act, judging that
news media self-regulation was not working.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner, whose word is law here, shut down Dita for eight days.
</P>
<P>
   More moderate Albanian newspapers, like Koha Ditore, criticized
the suspension of Dita as an arbitrary act of personal power.
Dita's publisher, Behlul Beqaj, justified publication of the
information by saying that the system of justice in Kosovo was not
working, and that there had been no punishment for people accused
of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the suspension was over, Beqaj republished the
article. Kouchner then issued his regulation on June 17 covering
broadcast and print media, naming a temporary news media
commissioner with the power to impose sanctions, including a
warning; the requirement to publish a reply, correction or apology;
a fine of up to 100,000 German marks (about $50,000); seizure of
equipment or printed material, and suspension or closing down of
the entire operation.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals are subject to a board appointed by Kouchner.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner, a former U.S. diplomat, Douglas Davidson, was
also given the power to, ``in special circumstances,'' issue
``temporary codes of conduct'' for journalists after consultation _
codes that Kouchner could decide to turn into law.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson defended the codes as common in European countries and
necessary to deter the use of ``hate speech.'' But it is the effort
to draw up those codes _ after long and frustrating meetings with
local editors who oppose them as a new, undemocratic order _ that
the United Nations is now likely to abandon.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation itself caused a furor. It was condemned by the
World Press Freedom Committee and other international news media
watch-dogs, and Beqaj tested it on June 26, publishing the names of
two Serbs from the town of Kosovo Polje accused of attacking ethnic
Albanians. One of those Serbs is in close contact with the
municipality and the United Nations. This time, Dita went to the
police first, but did not heed U.N. requests to delay publication.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson then issued a warning to Dita and called for
clarification, saying the paper appeared to have violated the
regulation on publishing personal details that ``would pose a
serious threat to the life, safety or security of any such person
through vigilante violence or otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Davidson said: ``Publishing names can put
people's lives at risk. It is also violating a fundamental
principle of Western journalism that someone is innocent until
proven guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving one letter from Dita, Davidson is seeking
further clarification. He may then decide to impose another
sanction.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, on July 5, Dita published the names, prewar
addresses and photographs of 15 more Serbs it accused of committing
crimes against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Beqaj is unrepentant. In a meeting with Davidson and other
editors to discuss a temporary code of conduct, he said that Dita
``is accused of involvement with the death of one man.'' But who is
to blame ``for the other 498'' or so murders in Kosovo since NATO
forces took over the province, he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, Kouchner and other U.N. officials say they must have
some way to stop hate speech and the incitement to murder
individuals on the basis of uncorroborated accusations printed or
broadcast by the news media. ``This is not yet a normal place,''
Davidson said to the editors. ``The international community must
have some control and if it wants to lower the level of hatred and
tension here, not make it worse, then one thing you must look at is
the media.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baton Haxhiu, the editor of Koha Ditore, said that Albanian
news executives are able to police themselves. ``All this just
shows that the internationals are becoming Balkanized, trying to
put restrictions on the freedom of the press,'' he said. ``This is
a bad precedent, and it will be used against us by some political
party in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   What Kosovo needs instead is a functioning police and court
system to provide justice, Haxhiu said, and it is the job of the
United Nations, not the local news media, to produce one.

 &HT;    A fine feathered fix for Georgia couple
 &HT;    By Andrea Jones
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Found: One stray emu. A little scuffed up after a long
walk, since the birds don't fly. Likes dog food, bottled water.
Seems to answer to ``Gertrude'' _ Gertie for short. Needs good
home, preferably one with other emu pals to play with.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers, Ga., resident Gordon Hart has been looking for the
rightful owners of one of the blue-necked birds since July 3, when
it wandered through his yard and into a nearby pen.
</P>
<P>
   But local experts say it's possible no one's pining for their
flightless friend. When the bottom dropped out of the emu breeding
market a few years back, some financially strapped bird ranchers
started turning the animals out like stray cats.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Cecelia Hart aren't sure whether that's what happened
to the emu they've dubbed Gertrude, but they say it's been slow
going to find a permanent home for the six-foot creature.
</P>
<P>
   Local emu farmers say breeding pairs, which sold for nearly
$20,000 10 years ago, are now worth only about $100.
</P>
<P>
   Noah's Ark, a home for neglected animals in Henry County, has
collected a gaggle of the birds _ 63 at last count. Staffer Kathy
Padia said disenchanted farmers drop them off. Shelter operators
said they'd be willing to take Gertie in if someone will offer to
transport her.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest registered emu farmer, Jackie Paul of Conyers, said
the bird isn't hers. But she said it could have come from an
unregistered breeder somewhere nearby.
</P>
<P>
   With emus out of favor and the Harts nearly out of hospitality,
the couple are hoping for a quick solution to their emu enigma.
``It's been a riot having her,'' Cecelia Hart said as she watered
the gangly animal Wednesday afternoon. ``But Gertie's got to go
soon.''

   POWELL (Undated) - The fight to drain Lake Powell goes on,
getting ever more bizarre. Keep-the-Lake folks hired a PR firm and
an adversizing company to do a campaign. The result? Billboards
were graffitied, allegations of illegal activities leveled.
Meanwhile, the Drain-the-Lake folks have started fighting a
guerilla campaign, spreading critical e-mail around the Internet
and encouraging people to call the toll-free pro-lake number to
drain the pro-lake people's funds. In the background, the two
groups that want to drain the lake are fighting about who's better,
and an ice-cream store in Moab dedicated to draining the lake
opens, serving up such specialities as Music Temple Almond Fudge,
Fern Canyon Mint Chocolate Chip, and Abbey's Rockey Road. The same
environmental groups that are asking for Lake Powell to be drained
will ask for the Green River' s Flaming Gorge dam to be breached,
too. It's as much a mess as melted ice cream. By JUDD SLIVKA. Story

   &QL;   &QL;  &UR; The Case Where the Rich Get Less &QL;   &QL;  &UR; Pennsylvanians are rated
less wealthy. &QL;   &UR; By Laura J. Winter &QL;  &QC;  C. 2000 States News Service &QL;  &QC; 
WASHINGTON (July 12) - Pennsylvania is going to get back more for
its dollars from Washington, than it gives, so says a tax
foundation report. If it is a trend, this might not be good news,
according to economists.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published by the Tax Foundation, for every
Pennsylvanian dollar surrendered to the Internal Revenue Service
last year, $1.05 in services, infrastructure and direct payments
was returned to Keystone State residents. In fact compared to
Connecticut, the biggest loser in this spending-to-tax ratio - a
return of 65 cents for every dollar - Pennsylvania is not losing_.
Or is it?
</P>
<P>
   The IRS is expecting this year to raise $951.6 billion, or 49.7
percent, of the $1.914 trillion expected in tax collections from
personal income tax. The authors of the foundation report based
their findings on Census Bureau data.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the federal government is estimated to
collect this year from each citizen an average of $6,981, 5.9
percent more than the 1999 average of $6,589. Individual
Pennsylvanians are expected to open their pocketbooks for $6,932
this year, just 4.7 percent more than the $6,616-burden of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really interesting that Pennsylvania's tax burden has
not grown because of the booming economy,'' said Scott Moody, a
foundation economist and author of the report. ``It could be some
sort of indication that they are growing at a lesser rate than most
states.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that traditionally Pennsylvania's tax burden has hovered
above the national average, until now.
</P>
<P>
   While the report is expecting Pennsylvania to pay less than the
average in federal taxes, the latest numbers available for 1999 put
the state's average income of $26,797 slightly above the national
average of $26,416. Projections on what individual Pennsylvanians
will make this year were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Some wealthy states - like Connecticut, New Jersey and New
Hampshire - will give much more than they will take in, the report
said. Others - like New Mexico, Montana and West Virginia - will
pay a whole lot less than they will get back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the way that the system is designed there is a
whole lot of wealth redistribution,'' Moody said. ``Higher income
states will be paying more into the system. The Northeast will be
paying more than the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's individual federal tax burden for this year is
expected to be $11,604. It ranks last in the amount of dollars it
receives back. West Virginia, which has the smallest tax burden at
$4,416, will get $1.72 for every dollar its residents send to
Washington, authors said in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is ranked 29 in the spending-to-tax ratio for 1999,
up in the money-receiving line from a decade ago when it came in at
35.
</P>
<P>
   Of the states getting a good deal from Uncle Sam, New Mexico
gets loads of federal money because it houses federal facilities,
like Los Alamos National Laboratory. While its $19,936 median
income, ranked 49th in the nation in 1999, it gets the highest
return for the dollar at $1.97. In contrast, most of the states
losing money in Washington simply have high concentrations of
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two families in two different states that have the same
incomes will have the same federal taxes,'' said William Gale, an
economist at the Brookings Institution. ``There are some sale taxes
but the main difference there is income.''

FOR THESE CONCERTGOERS, IT'S SPLENDID IN THE GRASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's a cool Friday night at Smirnoff Music Centre, and
rocker Steve Miller is minutes away from performing. Fans in the
reserved seats calmly wait, making idle chatter, laughing. The
section isn't crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Behind them, in the music amphitheater's lawn area, it's a very
different story. The lawn section is utterly jammed; people are
sprawled on blankets and towels and rented lawn chairs, hiding
every last blade of grass.
</P>
<P>
   When the lights go down and the Dallas-based Miller takes the
stage, pot smoke begins to drift, sending clouds of gray across the
green. Pockets of college kids dance. Couples kiss and grope.
Teen-agers run through the grass, leaping over people staring at
the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Near the north tip of the lawn, a man starts to do something you
certainly would not see in the reserved section of the Smirnoff,
which, until this month, was known as Starplex: He pulls five toys
shaped like bowling pins out of a bag and begins juggling them.
People around him laugh, egging him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world out here,'' says the juggler,
22-year-old Jason Christensen of Dallas. ``You can come out here
and relax, smoke a little weed, listen to music, do whatever you
want. Out here, you're free.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every concert at Smirnoff attracts a crowd like this one:
concertgoers who aren't there to see the show so much as to be part
of a unique social group. They prefer to be on the lawn, where they
can almost create their own world, outside the rules of daily life.
Security is present, of course, but there are so many people that
lawn-goers know they're unlikely to be hassled by authority
figures, at least not for anything that's not obviously dangerous
to others. They can hang with friends, relax, get high, socialize,
make out, drink and, as Christensen puts it, be free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel trapped in a seat,'' he says, juggling the pins. ``The
lawn is like a universe of its own, a free universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawn-goers exist almost as a subculture, a members-only club as
exclusive as any Prohibition-era speakeasy and as open as a public
library. All you need to get in is a ticket with the words
``general admission'' stamped on it, but you need much more for
acceptance. Each Smirnoff show draws its own distinct and typically
separate group _ young and old, straight and stoned, drinkers and
thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Acts like Steve Miller and Jimmy Buffett draw a thirtysomething
audience that seeks to put day jobs and grown-up stresses behind
for an evening. On the lawn, the green of margaritas can cloak the
green of the grass. Despite the rowdiness and alcohol, these are
usually rather tame affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Alternative rock bands also draw white suburbanites, but they're
younger and even rowdier. Removed from the Big Brother constraints
of school and home, the teen-agers roam the lawn like wolf packs,
showing off the latest in Old Navy and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch wear,
looking for someone to ``hook up'' with and trying to adults to buy
them a $7 beer. Mosh pits and impromptu make-out sessions are the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   Country shows attract a Wranglers, boots and cowboy-hat
contingent that often turns the lawn into a dance floor; dancing in
the aisles is forbidden in the reserved section.
</P>
<P>
   Jam bands such as Phish and Widespread Panic bring out the
stoners, those who lie out on the lawn, perhaps because they're so
out of it they can't move.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the metal shows, Smirnoff security's worst
nightmare. Bonfires, fistfights, drunks, people passed out and in
various stages of undress _ all business as usual when Ozzfest or
any other big metal show roars through Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a whole different scene on the lawn,'' says
Fred Downey, the security coordinator for D&AMP;L, the Dallas-based
security firm that staffs Smirnoff. ``Once you think you've seen it
all, something out there happens that makes you think otherwise.
Heck, we once had a baby born out there.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a warm day in April, the lawn at Starplex (as it was known
then) is a sea of sunburned flesh. The sky is slightly overcast,
but the sun slices through the clouds enough during the day to cook
the skin of unprotected lawn-goers, a mostly cheery, young, white
crowd gathered for Edgefest 2000, a daylong alternative rock
festival.
</P>
<P>
   Around 7 p.m., attendance peaks at about 20,000; half of those
have settled on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mixed bunch: Twentysomething guys and girls with tattoos,
colored hair, body piercings and little clothing mingle with
teen-agers spiffed up in Gap T-shirts, Old Navy Passenger shorts
and $100 Doc Marten sandals.
</P>
<P>
   But they all have one thing in common: They're all looking at
the same thing _ and it's not the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's attention is directed at a pack of about 100 people
who have gathered around something on the lawn, creating a circle
that expands every time someone else steps up to vie for a look.
Security is called.
</P>
<P>
   The commotion is a fight that has broken out between two
twentysomething guys.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Melton doesn't even bat an eye. MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS: bat an eye. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing,'' says the 22-year-old Richardson fast-food
employee. The last time he was at Starplex, he saw three guys
beating up a man who they thought was making advances toward one of
their girlfriends.''It's a mess up here, but I love it. There's
never a dull moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Not today, at least. Starplex's lawn is a continuous, often
entertaining blur of suburban teen life. Despite the occasional
shoving match and the rare fight, everyone seems to be getting
along.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about being here is the people-watching,'' says
Amber Baggett, 17, of Garland. ``You see some wild stuff up here.
It's kind of like a rave. Everyone's worried about getting caught,
but they do stuff anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Baggett is with her 14-year-old sister, Stacy. Together, they
sit on the lawn for nearly the entire concert, largely oblivious to
the chaos around them _ the people who step over them, occasionally
dripping nacho cheese or beer, the guys who size them up and maybe
even ask for their phone numbers, the people behind them screaming
at the bands or at one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not that different from going to the mall,'' Amber
says. ``People act like idiots there, too, you know. You go to the
mall for the same reason you go to concerts, to get away from
parents and school and just escape from everything. But up there
(in the reserved section), they're stricter on what you can do. No
one really cares out here, unless you're, like, beating someone
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, 19-year-old Ben Vardeman of Grand Prairie and four of
his buddies are relaxing in the grass, smoking cigarettes, watching
a never-ending stream of girls wearing shorts and halter tops. Some
of the young women glance at the boys; others try not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why am I on the lawn? Dude, to hook up,'' Vardeman says.
``This is where all the girls are, man.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, teen girls whose braces glimmer in the Texas sun are
in no short supply. Most travel in packs or with male escorts. A
subtle sense of danger lingers in the air for the more aware young
women, perhaps the result of recent assaults at other outdoor
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here is cool and nice,'' says Nicki Foster, 15, of
Plano. ``But I'm not gonna walk around the lawn by myself. I mean,
it's the lawn.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starplex opened in July 1988 with a concert by pop singer Rod
Stewart. Over the course of the following decade, the venue went
from hosting pop and classical concerts to what it does today:
everything, from country to hard rock. The lawn has also evolved.
It was supposed to be simply a cheaper place to watch live
performances. No one expected it to become a self-contained world,
where the concert on the distant stage is simply pleasing
background music, a soundtrack to the lawn-goers' activities.
</P>
<P>
   D&AMP;L's Fred Dunway has been there since the day it opened. He has
broken up fights, carried out those who have passed out, been
attacked by intoxicated or drugged-up fans and been caught in the
middle of crowds rushing the stage; he has many horror stories to
share.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of those horror stories is slowly dwindling, he
says. Bands and the venue are cracking down on what fans can bring
into Smirnoff, which he says should trim the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like blankets. At some shows, you can bring them in. Some,
like Nine Inch Nails, you can't,'' he says. ``And that's because
the kids used to burn them. We used to have so many bonfires on the
lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunway says that security presence is constant at Smirnoff, no
matter the show. And police officers are always present, though
it's D&AMP;L security that usually patrols the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Big metal shows like Ozzfest, he says, are the hardest to
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metal shows can be a nightmare,'' he says. ``Lots of fights on
the lawn, lots of arrests for P.I. (public intoxication), lots of
people smoking things that they shouldn't be smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans caught doing drugs are usually taken to the main security
office, where police officers decide their fates. ``They're usually
arrested and hauled off,'' he says. ``But we can't catch
everyone.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not every lawn audience at Starplex/Smirnoff is party- and
hormone-driven. Teen acts such as the Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys
and the annual KISS Party concerts attract crowds heavily made up
of families.
</P>
<P>
   At KISS Party 2000, In June, Frisbees and beach balls drifted
across the lawn, taking the place of cigarette smoke. The sound of
laughter _ as well as the occasional parental ``Get over here!'' _
filled the air.
</P>
<P>
   For this group, the lawn represents the past, a time when they
were the ones out partying, exchanging phone numbers, listening to
music and trying to sneak gulps of beer while the security guard's
head was turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go to concerts all the time when I was a kid,'' says
Dana Mejia, a 41-year-old Dallas mother of three who ducks when a
toy football buzzes her way. ``We'd sit in the general admission or
outdoor section, drinking or whatever. It was a world of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those assembled today stopped going to concerts years
ago, when mortgage and car payments took the place of beer and
T-shirt money, and their babies took the place of their friends,
but they still embrace the lawn's ethos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone out here has families. We're a little older. We have
to get up in the morning and take our kids to school and go to
work,'' Mejia says. ``But I guess that means we're also all in a
world of our own.'' &QL;

 &HT;    French diplomat upbeat about conditions in his country
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - As they do every July, the world's best bicyclists are
wending their way through the verdant French countryside in the
Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, it seems that not only the cyclists but all of
France is on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it reflects that the French have more confidence in
themselves,'' says Jean-Paul Monchau, his nation's Atlanta-based
consul general and trade commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some recent developments:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On July 1, France took over the rotating presidency of the
European Union _ a high profile role as the 15-member confederation
prepares to absorb new member nations and moves ahead with
development of its unified currency.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Vivendi, a French water utility, is transforming itself into a
telecommunications and entertainment giant and has just negotiated
one of the largest media deals ever in agreeing to acquire Canada's
Seagram Co. Ltd. with its Hollywood-based Universal Studios. &QR;  At
home, polls show consumer confidence is at record highs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And the French are even having a banner year in sports. Not
only did French citizen Mary Pierce thrill Paris by winning tennis'
French Open , but the French national soccer squad started this
month by becoming the first team to hold both the European and
World championships simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   All of this gives the French special reason to celebrate as
their biggest national holiday, Bastille Day, approaches Friday.
Monchau will be leading the charge at a reception at his Buckhead
home and at a smaller gathering in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the French diplomat noted in an interview this week,
challenges also loom for his country. Here are excerpts edited from
a transcript of the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you account for France's recent successes?
</P>
<P>
   A: I remember I arrived here in June '97, and what struck me at
that time was the difference in the mentalities between the French
and Americans. In France, we were struggling to respect the
criteria of the Euro (Europe's unified currency) and we were making
sacrifices and the mood of the people was not good. When I arrived
in the States, I was struck by the fact that here people were sure
that tomorrow will be a brighter day and they were very confident
in themselves. What is happening now in France, I think, is what
happened a few years ago in the States. People are more and more
confident, and in fact we have good reasons in our economy. And
maybe the most important thing for the French people is that
unemployment is going down.
</P>
<P>
   Q: France is assuming the European presidency for an important
six months.
</P>
<P>
   A: It is true that we take the presidency at a very important
time because in Europe we are in the process of opening the door to
other members. We are 15 members, and we are in the process of
opening the door to maybe five and then 10 and then 12 other
members. ... So the French presidency comes at that time when we
have to modify the rules in order for the European Union to be able
to work well in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are France's priorities for the E.U.?
</P>
<P>
   A: The first one is economic growth and employment. That means
to reconcile economic growth with reinforcement of the European
social model. This is very important for us. And we wish to adopt
at the end of the presidency _ that is in December _ in Nice, the
city in the south of France, what we call a European social agenda.
What does it mean? It means that we want to assure ... economic and
social justice for all the people in Europe. We are much concerned
by the exclusion of some people who are still now left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the scenario for enlargement?
</P>
<P>
   A: All together you have 12 or 13 countries, which already have
said we are candidates. ... It means that the European Union is an
idea and a body that works, that gives benefits to its members.
Take the example of Spain or Portugal or Greece. They have
benefited a lot by being a member of the Union. And other countries
now knock at the door and say we want to be part of this. And for
us Europeans, if you look where we are coming from _ I mean, after
the Second World War _ all of us have benefited from the European
Union. So I believe that our interest, as members already, is to
welcome these new members when they are able to join this club. ...
Of course, they have to make some sacrifices to join. ... If you
read the different treaties ... you see that the economy is not the
only objective of the European Union. These countries must also
respewe know that the U.S. is a light for many people for
democracy, for freedom, and, in the meantime, there is still the
death penalty here. ... We believe it is a question of human
dignity and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some trade issues also have cropped up between the E.U. and
the U.S., but in general how would you characterize the
relationship?
</P>
<P>
   A: The partnership is very, very strong. You know, if you add
the GNPs of the two unions you will see that it is something like
60 percent of the world GNP, so of course the exchanges are so
important. Cooperation is so important. You cannot exclude to have
conflicts, to have problems. But fortunately we have a very, very
strong dialogue.

MOURNERS INSIST SLAYING OF GAY BLACK MAN WAS A BIAS CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRMONT, W.Va. _ At the edge of the crowd of mourners, a claque
of Bible-quoting protesters began sounding off behind a police
cordon, proclaiming that the victim of a grisly fatal beating last
week, a young gay black man, had been dispatched to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuality is an enormous sin _ Read Leviticus 21:8,''
proclaimed one of the less vulgar signs bobbing at the fringe of
the street scene.
</P>
<P>
   David Stricker, a husky, 48-year-old local resident who is gay,
knew what he had to do. He strapped on an oversized pair of
theater-prop wings and used them to most politely block the
protesters' view of an otherwise peaceful evening memorial on
Tuesday in this town about 20 miles south of Morgantown. ``They say
they're coming in the name of God, but they're coming in the name
of hatred,'' he quietly explained above the protesters' din.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker played the protective angel, an anti-heckler role being
seen increasingly at gay rights gatherings. He helped reduce the
small band of homophobic visitors to a minor nuisance on an
extraordinary night for this rural county seat in which hundreds of
gays and lesbians, blacks and whites, stood together in the streets
and demanded justice on behalf of Arthur Warren Jr., whose brutally
beaten body was found last week on a back road near Paw Paw Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, 26, was openly gay and his mourners, while conceding the
difficulty of plumbing the precise nature of human hatred and
homicide, demanded a full investigation and disputed official
insistence that neither racism nor homophobia was a motive in the
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Warren was taken for a hit-and-run victim. But then a
conscience-stricken 16-year-old boy, who has not been charged in
the crime, went to the authorities. Two unidentified 17-year-old
white teen-agers were soon arrested and charged with the killing in
which they allegedly first beat and kicked Warren to death and then
drove a car repeatedly over his body in an attempt to mask the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   The battered corpse in an open coffin drew sobs and shrieks on
Saturday as local mourners demanded more information. Many were
incredulous when police investigators flatly insisted that hatred
of gays and blacks was not a motive in the slaying. Friends said
Warren was a gentle person and a church volunteer who had a summer
park job and other occasional employment. The friends said he
occasionally told of incidents of harassment stemming from both
racial and sexual bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication of a hate crime,'' Sheriff Ron Watkins
of Marion County said in a radio interview when asked about the
reported confessions of the defendants. ``There was no indication
anyone hated a particular group, especially gays,'' Watkins said.
He did not elaborate, saying the two teen-agers were subject to
closed juvenile proceedings until the court decides within the next
month whether they should be tried as adults.
</P>
<P>
   As human rights activists congregated from around the country,
members of the Tuesday night memorial crowd insisted that hatred
had to be at the heart of the slaying, whether it was racism,
homophobia or a combination of both. In any case, they heard
speakers complain that there were shortcomings in existing
hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's hate-crime statute, like federal law, covers
race but not sexual orientation. A bill to remedy this passed the
state Senate but died in the House of Delegates earlier this year.
In Washington, a proposal pending in the Senate would include
sexual orientation under the hate-crime law and enable federal
prosecutors to step in when local authorities do not act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dying from the inside out in this country because of
hatred,'' said Stricker, a social worker, his mache wings stretched
upward as he stood outside the county courthouse during the
memorial. ``We want this to be treated as a hate crime,'' he said.
He argued, like many in the crowd of 400, that a clear law against
bias crimes would not be redundant in this first-degree murder case
and would be an object lesson against hateful practices that can
and do turn deadly.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker, David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and
lesbian watchdog group, drew cheers as he told the crowd, ``There
is no doubt in our minds that hate was a factor in this crime _
hate based on sexual orientation and hate based on race.''
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd, members referred to their own experiences in
speculating about the hatred they insisted had to be at the heart
of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason he was killed was because he was black,'' said
Lydia Robinson, a black woman who was born here and visits every
summer from Dearborn Heights, Mich. ``Being gay didn't help him
either, but if he had been white I don't think it would have gone
this far. Over the last 20 years I've seen a supremacy attitude
develop toward local blacks around here.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted as juveniles, the two accused teen-agers could be
freed by age 21. If convicted as adults, they would face life in
prison. In the face of such extreme alternatives, plus the dearth
of information, the throng lighted candles, sang hymns and pledged
unity as they demanded that authorities not stint in prosecuting
the case against the victim, known to friends as ``J.R.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest minority in our community are the bigots,''
insisted Rick Ravenscroft, a white man and friend of the victim,
who told of long-standing ties between some black and white
families. Looking over at the protest signs about hell, Ravenscroft
declared, ``J.R. Warren is my friend and where J.R. is right now is
with love, and the rest of us are just who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   In Grant Town, an old coal-mine hamlet near where Warren lived,
the Rev. Nelson Staples, his pastor at Mt. Beulah Baptist Church,
said ``J.R. was a gentle soul'' who confided in him some casual
instances of harassment that he was able to weather.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the church has been firebombed, smeared with
racist epithets and shot at by night-riders, Staples said,
describing the incidents as ``this spirit of evil that occasionally
arises'' among some in the community. He described this is a quiet
condition of local life for the black minority. ``There's this
constant reminder that you are being studied or watched for the
opportunity to do something very, very wicked and evil,'' the
pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   But the killing of Warren is the worst possible reminder of the
longstanding need for reconciliation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.R. had a great sense of humor but he must have lived a very
anguished life trying to find a place to fit in,'' Staples said, in
wondering whether the sudden burst of attention on Grant Town would
disappear just as suddenly as the crowd did after the memorial.
``One thing about J.R., he was always forgiving,'' the pastor
added. ``He was always forgiving.''

A GUIDE TO THE MUTANTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't know your ``X-Men'' from your ``X-Files''? Don't feel bad.
None of the actors involved in the big-screen adaptation of the
popular Marvel comic book series had a clue about their film's
hand-drawn source material, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm spending much time at the neighborhood comic
books store,'' sniffs Ian McKellen, who plays the movie's evil
ringleader.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely you aren't either. A brief explanation, then: The
X-men (and women) are mutant human beings who possess extraordinary
abilities _ telepathy, physical strength, agility and the like.
Many consider the X-men freaks, including U.S. Senator Robert Kelly
(Bruce Davison), who leads a McCarthy-type witch hunt to ``expose
the dangers'' of mutants.
</P>
<P>
   Mutant leader Professor X (Patrick Stewart) still believes
mutants and ``normal'' humans can get along. His nemesis, Magneto
(McKellen), thinks otherwise, and wants to crush the humans before
they suppress the mutants.
</P>
<P>
   Use the following scorecard to help keep the heroes and villains
properly sorted.
</P>
<P>
   MUTANTS WHO LIKE HUMANS
</P>
<P>
   Mutant: Professor X
</P>
<P>
   Actor: Patrick Stewart
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: Wheelchair-bound mutant scientist who tutors
``gifted'' students to use their superhuman powers for the good of
mankind. A powerful telepath himself, Professor X clashes
philosophically with old friend Magneto over whether mutants and
humans can ever co-exist.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself: ``My career has been littered with kings,
captains, emperors, party bosses, trade union leaders, presidents,
generals; you name it, I've worn the uniform. What's truly ironic
is that I am the least authoritarian figure you're ever likely to
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutant: Wolverine
</P>
<P>
   Actor: Hugh Jackman
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: Fan favorite, a lupine loner who possesses
superhuman senses of sight, smell and hearing, as well as the
ability to heal himself. His skeleton is unbreakable; his claws can
slash through steel.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself: ``Hard-core fans are wondering how some Aussie
with a musical theater background can play Wolverine. Two words:
Cold showers. We filmed in Toronto in the middle of winter, so a
cold shower at 5:30 in the morning will make you very, very angry.
Any time I thought about it during the day, it put me in character.
It's like eating a lemon.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutant: Storm
</P>
<P>
   Actor: Halle Berry
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: Comes from a line of African witch-priestesses who
can control the weather. Al Roker's dream date.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself: ``Storm is connected to the earth, so it's
natural that she's the earth mother of the team. But while she's
sensitive and all, she still kicks a little butt. I liked that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutant: Cyclops
</P>
<P>
   Actor: James Marsden
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: The squarest of the X-men, but that's not why he
wears the glasses. Cyclops' eyes release a laser beam that can cut
through practically anything.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself: ``The audience never sees Cyclops' eyes, which
makes conveying emotion a little difficult. I did a lot of eyebrow
work.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutant: Jean Grey
</P>
<P>
   Actor: Famke Janssen
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: A telepath to rival Professor X, Jean Grey can also
make the earth move _ as well as any other object, large or small _
with her mind. She also has caught the eye of both Wolverine and
Cyclops, probably as much for the way she looks in leather as for
her superhuman talents.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself: ``I'm no mind reader, but I'd love to have the
talent. Then I could tell when somebody in Hollywood is bull----ing
me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutant Rogue
</P>
<P>
   Actor: Anna Paquin
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: Alienated teen is a storehouse of talents and
memories, which she absorbs from anyone she touches. This makes it
hard for her to live a normal adolescent life, much less kiss a
date on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself: ``There's no way I could turn down a chance to
be in a movie with Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. Plus, coming
from a comic book makes the character research pretty easy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MUTANTS WHO WANT TO CRUSH HUMANS
</P>
<P>
   Mutant: Magneto
</P>
<P>
   Actor: Ian McKellen
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: Auschwitz internment as a youngster colors his view
of humanity. Believes the only good human is a dead human and
carries out his credo in attempt to establish mutant rule over
earth. As name implies, he has both a magnetic personality and
power over people.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself: ``Being a gay man, I could relate to the
story's themes of intolerance. Society, by its laws and attitudes,
often makes me feel like I'm a mutant.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutant: Sabretooth
</P>
<P>
   Actor: Tyler Mane
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: Wolverine's hated enemy, which makes this the
series' Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader relationship, since the 7-foot-2
Sabretooth might be Wolverine's father. Like Wolverine, he has
extraordinary sight, smell and strength, abilities he uses to
satisfy his rage against mankind.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself: ``Having been a wrestler made the stunts a
little easier, although I had to adapt my body-slam style into more
of a slasher thing. But this character was a piece of cake. I
played wrestling villains that would make Sabretooth look like
Lassie.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutant: Mystique
</P>
<P>
   Actor: Rebecca Romijn-Stamos
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: Superhuman chameleon can transform herself into
anything or anyone. But because she's played by Sports Illustrated
swimsuit cover girl Romijn-Stamos, Mystique usually goes for the
skin-tight blue leather ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself ``I'm just used to having six people hovering
over me for a photo shoot, so these 10-hour make-up days were just
more of the same. You just go to this Zen place of mindlessness
where you turn off your brain.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutant: Toad
</P>
<P>
   Actor: Ray Park
</P>
<P>
   X-planation: Toad jumps when Magneto speaks, and his 12-foot
projectile tongue comes in handy for more than licking stamps.
</P>
<P>
   X-press yourself: ``Once I had green skin and green hair and
warts on my face and I was driving home from the set. I was
starving and stopped at Subway, and the guy felt a little pity for
me and gave me extra helpings on my sandwich.'' &QL;

SPORT OF OTTOMAN CAVALRYMEN FINDS RENEWED POPULARITY IN TODAY'S
TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Foreign Journal) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Clouds of dust enveloped the riders who
galloped across a field, wooden spears in hand, on a recent Sunday
afternoon in this former capital of the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   When one rider came close enough to a competitor, he would hurl
his spear, hoping to score six points by hitting him. Forcing an
opponent's horse to veer off course counts for three points. A
rider who falls from his horse loses three points and the respect
of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   This lightning-fast sport, played only in Turkey, is a throwback
to the days when Ottoman cavalrymen were among the world's most
fearsome warriors. After a long period of decline, it is enjoying a
rebirth of popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Cirit, as the sport is called, is most popular in eastern
Turkey, where traditions of horsemanship are still strong. But four
years ago its promoters won official recognition as a sport
federation like any other, and the Istanbul competition was part of
an effort to introduce it to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   The federation has codified the rules of cirit (pronounced
jir-IT), recognized 34 seven-man teams and begun looking for
sponsors. It also supports a formal training course for aspiring
players at the University of Erzincan, an eastern city where the
sport has been popular for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the riders here today,'' said Alper Yazoglu, the
federation's director. ``Some have gray hair, but there are also
plenty who are 16 or 17 years old. People are realizing that we
need to hold on to the cirit tradition. It's part of our culture,
part of what it means to be a Turk.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirit is exciting even to outsiders who do not appreciate its
subtleties. The horses are magnificent creatures of Arabian stock,
agile as polo ponies and able to accelerate to great speed in a few
strides.
</P>
<P>
   Play begins with teams lined up at opposing ends of the
140-yard-long field. Each competitor performs a series of passes,
seeking to throw his spear or disorient his opponent's horse in a
blurry encounter that flashes by in a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from my father, and he learned from his father,''
said Sami Gunel, who at 49 is one of the oldest certified
competitors. ``When I was growing up it was something people did in
villages. You'd see kids playing on their own, out in the fields.
Nowadays people seem more interested in cars then horses, but when
I see a big crowd like this, I think maybe we'll be able to save
this sport after all.''
</P>
<P>
   People are thought to have begun riding horses 4,500 years ago
on the steppes of Central Asia, and the first to do so were
probably ancestors of today's Turks. So were the first mounted
archers, who took to the field in the 8th century B.C. on the vast
plains north of the Caspian and Black Seas.
</P>
<P>
   Turkic tribesmen spent much of their lives on horseback.
Children were put on sheep's backs before they could walk so they
could learn the feel of riding. Adults ate, drank, conducted
business, held meetings and even slept on horseback. The ancient
Chinese called them ``horse barbarians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Turkic peoples in Central Asia still play games on
horseback. The most accomplished among them may be the Kyrgyz, who
have one game in which teams of horsemen fight to throw a goat's
carcass into an opposing goal and another in which women on
horseback gallop away from pursuing men who try to steal high-speed
kisses.
</P>
<P>
   Cirit _ the name means javelin _ was devised about 500 years ago
as a form of training and exercise for cavalrymen of the Ottoman
Empire. The field on which the recent Istanbul competition was
staged is said to have been used for the same purpose centuries
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although many Ottoman soldiers came from Christian backgrounds,
all of the spahi, or cavalrymen, were Muslim Turks. They were
considered almost helpless when on foot but invincible when
mounted. To gallop at full speed, turn backward and shoot a deadly
arrow at a distant foe was only one of their many skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give him his horse,'' wrote one historian, ``hand him his bow,
din in his ears his commander's roar _ `Come on, my wolves!' _ and
you had, if not the first centaur to bear arms since the days of
myth, then a man at any rate hard to tell apart from his horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ottoman army marched off to war almost every spring, and to
keep their skills sharp during the winter, the spahis developed
games to be played on horseback. One involved hurling a lance
through a ring while galloping. Another required the rider to fire
an arrow at a suspended brass ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cirit evolved from these games. It faded in the 20th century as
new forms of warfare replaced archery and new machines weakened the
tie between rural people and their horses. But today, young men
from eastern Turkey are again embracing it.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters hope that competitions in Istanbul and other western
cities will make cirit a national sport. Once they achieve that,
they want to take it abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the Istanbul crowd were migrants whose families
had moved from Erzincan, Erzurum, Bayburt and other cities that are
traditional cirit centers. But there were also some who had no
connection to the sport or the region that had nurtured it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my second cirit match, and this time I brought my
daughter,'' said Zafer Oguzcanoglu, a shopkeeper who has lived all
his life in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrilling thing to see, and it's getting more popular
all the time,'' he said. ``The next step is to get matches on TV.
Then the riders will become big stars, and we'll send them all over
the world to show people what a great sport this is.''

A CRAVING IS A CRAVING

<P>
   It creeps up on you, ringing the tiniest of bells in your ear. A
suggestion becomes an itch, then a full-fledged
give-it-to-me-or-else demand: ``I really must have a Milky Way
bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of us _ or at least, those of us without the will
power to resist _ will go directly to the nearest vending machine,
buy the Milky Way bar and satisfy the urge commonly known as a food
craving. Others have been conditioned to figure out a way to
satisfy the craving with a less-caloric substitute, such as a piece
of fruit. Still others can simply ignore the ``must have
chocolate'' feeling and not eat anything.
</P>
<P>
   Few of us have stopped to ponder from whence that food craving
originates. And scientists aren't sure, but many suspect the
impulse for a specific food (or type of food) is spurred by the
brain. Unfortunately for research purposes, cravings are common yet
unpredictable and fleeting enough that scientists can't easily
study them.
</P>
<P>
   The people who seem to have cravings most frequently _ pregnant
women or women during a certain point of their menstrual cycle _
don't make ideal test subjects. Their cravings _ pickles and ice
cream, anyone? _ are linked to hormonal fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   It's even difficult to come up with a definition since there's a
fine line between a strong preference and an actual craving, says
Dr. Paul Rozin, professor of Psychology at the University of
Pennsylvania. If you feel like eating an egg salad sandwich for
lunch this afternoon, you may simply be experiencing a preference.
Very common. If nothing but an egg salad sandwich will do day after
day, lunch after lunch, that's a craving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most wouldn't consider it a craving if it isn't cyclical,
recurrent and pressing,'' says Rozin, ``like if you're willing to
go out in the rain for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate is the most commonly craved food, followed not so
closely by pizza, salty foods (like potato chips and french fries),
sweets, bread, protein and fatty foods. Caffeine, grouped as a
beverage, not a drug, is a heavily craved item that _ unlike foods
_ can produce withdrawal symptoms. While you might add ``-oholic''
to your favorite food in conversation, nutritionists say you cannot
be addicted to food the way you may be nicotine and alcohol.
However, some believe craving feelings are part of the addiction
complex that includes tolerance, withdrawal symptoms and loss of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gets withdrawal from not eating pizza,'' says Dr. David
Heber, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition and author
of ``The Resolution Diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber and UCLA researchers are about to begin a nationwide study
to determine whether an experimental drug called Ecopipan can help
individuals curb food cravings and thereby lose weight. The theory
behind the study is that certain foods stimulate a transmitter in
the brain called the dopamine receptor, which produces feelings of
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasure-stimulating foods _ often referred to as red light or
trigger foods _ are often unhealthy. But we want them anyway,
sometimes because we associate them with fond memories or because
we use them as a way to reward ourselves. Had a bad day? Hey, you
got through it. Reward yourself with a piece of pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of cravings have some emotional origin,'' says
Dr. Barbara Rolls, professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State
University. ``It's a comfort food kind of thing. You're eating just
because you want to treat yourself, and you don't need science to
tell you what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   When we eliminate foods we enjoy from our diet, some scientists
say the craving is the body's way of protesting that food's
absence. Most successful weight-loss plans will have dieters cut
back on unhealthy foods rather than cut them out completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I taught a class in gestational diabetes where, before the
class, one of the women went out and ate half a watermelon because
she knew in the class we would tell her she couldn't have it,''
said Patty Carbone, a registered dietitian in the health education
division of Kaiser Permanente in Woodland Hills. ``Patients will go
and have half a gallon of ice cream. It's like one last fling.''
</P>
<P>
   But will a pre-diet binge eliminate the craving? Unlikely, says
Karen Miller-Kovach, chief scientist for Weight Watchers
International.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you set yourself up in terms of creating an environment of
deprivation, then you'll have feelings of deprivation and you'll
want what you're being deprived of,'' says Miller-Kovach. ``If
you're trying to lose weight and you tell yourself you can't eat
pizza, you're setting yourself up for failure.''
</P>
<P>
   But even those who believe a food craving is a chemical rather
than a psychological urge say discipline and behavior modification
can be just as effective as medication. Bottom line: While
everybody should be careful about their diet, food cravings haven't
proved dangerous. (unless, say, you find yourself obliging a
doughnut craving five times a day.)
</P>
<P>
   The exception is a peculiar condition called pica, which can
also be associated with pregnant women. People with this condition
crave non-food items like clay, dirt or ice. Some scientists
believe this is the body's way of signaling an iron deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Addictions are very much the subject of ongoing research and
grant funding. Even pica gets its own research niche within
university medical schools. But nutritionists say hard data on the
simple food craving will probably remain elusive until a link
between cravings and weight loss can be more firmly established.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body is so complex, it's like looking for a needle in a
haystack,'' says Dr. Jeffrey Hampl, a dietitian and spokesman for
the American Dietetic Association. ``From a research point of view,
it's difficult to obtain subjects (to study cravings). Medical
research has bigger eggs to fry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger eggs. Gosh, a Spanish omelet would sure hit the spot
right now. Wonder if that diner down the street is still serving
breakfast ... &QL;

   &QL; 
This architect's sketch offers a sneak peek of ``The Bungalow,'' a
2,500- square-foot set created by the Art Directors Guild and
sponsored by House Beautiful magazine. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Art Directors Guild, the trade group representing TV and film
production designers and set decorators, is giving the public a
chance to walk around on an actual set.
</P>
<P>
   The craftsmen and women, working with House Beautiful magazine,
have constructed a '20s era Hollywood bungalow inside the Green
Building of the Pacific Design Center, and are opening it to the
public today through Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The house is furnished with the latest high-end fixtures,
furnishings and wall and floor coverings from vendors such as Bruce
Hardwood Flooring, Grohe, KitchenAid, Restoration Hardware and
Williams-Sonoma, but the creators say it will not appear to be just
another model.
</P>
<P>
   William Creber, one of the project's production designers, said,
``What we are creating is not a perfect model home, but something
that looks both lived in and part of a real working movie set.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the exhibit includes a foreground miniature with a
special- effects camera and monitor set up to give the illusion of
a second floor even though two bedrooms and the master bath are
situated on the ground floor. The house display includes working
film cameras and stage lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The bungalow is set to be featured in a pictorial in the
November issue of House Beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Admission is free and the exhibit is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Monday through Friday. Parking is $3 at the Pacific Design Center,
8687 Melrose Ave., in West Hollywood. For more information, call
the Art Directors Guild at (818) 762-9995. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Giant lizards take Hollywood &QL; 
Hollywood always has aimed for the latest, greatest visual effects
it could muster, but nothing says ``made in Japan'' quite like
Godzilla movies.
</P>
<P>
   American Cinematheque is encouraging giant lizards and other
destructive mutants to take over Hollywood Boulevard with its
Japanese Science Fiction and Monster Weekend, coinciding with the
annual G-Fest convention for Godzilla and Japanese monster fans.
</P>
<P>
   The film series opens at 7 p.m. today with the screening of a
new 35mm print (maybe that will help) of the original 1954
``Godzilla,'' being shown in its original form with English
subtitles and almost 20 minutes of footage not released in the
United States. Later the film will be discussed by visual effects
director Sadamasa Arikawa and the actor in the Godzilla suit, Haruo
Nakajima.
</P>
<P>
   The film series, running through Sunday, also includes ``Son of
Godzilla'' (1967) and the U.S. premieres of ``Rebirth of Mothra 3''
(1998) and ``Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey'' (2000).
</P>
<P>
   All screenings are at the Egyptian Theatre, 6712 Hollywood Blvd.
For information about the film series, call (323) 466-3456 or go to
www.egyptiantheatre.com on the Web. For more information about the
G-Fest at the nearby Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, call (614) 470-0108
or see www.g-fan.com on the Web. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Thank heaven &QL; 
The Alex Film Society in Glendale will present a new print of the
award-winning MGM musical ``Gigi'' on at 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lerner-and-Loewe musical starring Maurice Chevalier and
Leslie Caron claimed nine 1958 Oscars, including best picture and
best director for Vincente Minnelli. Its best-known songs include
``Thank Heaven for Little Girls'' and ``I Remember It Well.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $8.50 for the evening show, $7 for the matinee and
$6 for members of the Alex Film Society and are available at the
box office or through TeleCharge, (800) 233-3123. The Alex Theatre
is at 216 N. Brand Blvd. For additional information, call (818)
754-8250. &QL;

GEER MAKES `HAROLD AND MAUDE' WORTH WATCHING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/12 stars 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Internet sites are to be believed, fans of the 1971 film
``Harold and Maude'' are of the firm opinion that screenwriter
Colin Higgins and director Hal Ashby put the ``cult'' in culture.
It's these fans who will cling to the images of Ruth Gordon zipping
cheerfully off in a car stolen from a priest or flinging birdseed
out the window of her railway boxcar dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the devoutest Harold-ian will likely be startled at
the deftness with which Ellen Geer puts her stamp on the role of
Maude. Kooky, wise and ultimately quite sad, Geer's Maude is
without question the best reason to see the staged revival of
``Harold and Maude'' at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in
Topanga.
</P>
<P>
   Would that director Heidi Helen Davis could bring the rest of
the production to Geer's level on a more consistent basis.
``Harold'' is a longish evening that careens from the blackest of
black humor to near slapstick, ultimately to warm and fuzzy
sentiments of life affirmation. In its twisted little way, the
movie gradually revealed a light at the end of its gloom. The play
takes that light and practically blinds us with it.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem unfair to compare the two versions, but, amazingly,
the same author is responsible for both. Perhaps realizing that
this tale would be a harder sell to theatergoers than to the cinema
set, Higgins smoothed out ``Harold and Maude's'' jagged edges in
the play, and his story suffers for it. Instead of a couple
eccentrics trying to carve out their space during some rather
turbulent times, the Theatricum's ``Harold and Maude'' bears an
uncomfortable similarity to the exploits of Auntie Mame. Not only
does Maude steal cars, we're now expected to believe that an
80-year-old woman, working alone, successfully heists seals from
the zoo. C'mon!
</P>
<P>
   The basic story is unchanged. To the great consternation of his
upper crust mum, young Harold Chasen (played by Aaron Angello)
spends his days either devising wildly inventive suicide attempts
or attending funerals. At one such event, he encounters Maude, a
free spirited near-octogenarian who doesn't simply dance to her own
orchestra, she conducts it and plays all the instruments. Irony
abounds: as Maude stares down her own mortality, she teaches the
morbidly-obsessed Harold what it means to live. He thinks he's
found his soul mate; now if only the poor kid could do something
about these computer dating service encounters his mother (Susan
Angelo) keeps arranging ...
</P>
<P>
   Angello's Harold is nicely low key, a quietly dark young man,
better at reflecting and reacting. He doesn't hint at the pain the
character might be masking, but he doesn't really need to. Hidden
pain and dark secrets is Maude's turf.
</P>
<P>
   There are few local stages more bucolic than the outdoor,
tree-decked Theatricum, and none probably better suited for a
fresh-out-of-the-'60s tale like ``Harold and Maude.'' Set designer
Thomas A. Brown neatly divides the stage between the more stately
Chasen Manor and Maude's split-level Bohemian digs (complete with
paintings, sculpture and gong.) And at this theater, when a scene
is set in a tree, it is bloody well going to take place in a tree.
</P>
<P>
   The space doesn't, however, lend itself particularly well to the
gross out special effects that are Harold's forte. A couple of the
set-ups seem to take forever to push into gear. Others are simply
forced: do we really need two off-stage gun shots before Harold
emerges to chop off his hand in front of a date?
</P>
<P>
   Tight, this production isn't, and you can easily spot places
where Davis's cast seems to be straining against the dramatic dead
weight of Higgins's script. A sub-plot involving Maude and a
persecuting cop quickly gets tiresome, as do the numerous exchanges
between Mrs. Chasen (played to near mental pitch by Angelo) and
Harold's psychiatrist. Similarly, a visit between Maude and Mrs.
Chasen is nothing but an occasion for cheap laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the evening has more than a few comic gems as well.
All three of Harold's dates get big laughs, the largest coming from
Willow Geer-Alsop as a hammy actress who gets a little too involved
in one of Harold's ... er ... scenes. (Geer-Alsop shares the role
with Abby Craden).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's Geer. Handling an important Austrian accent,
and looking younger than Maude says she is (also appropriate), Geer
dances, sings, listens and counsels _ all with the dignity that
this wonderfully unique character is charged to uphold. That
dignity will forever be Ruth Gordon's legacy. Now it's Geer's as
well. &QL;

WILL AUDIENCES TAKE `X-MEN' SERIOUSLY?

<P>
   The big question looming over today's release of the $75 million
``X-Men'' is whether or not audiences will go for the serious
notions director Bryan Singer (``The Usual Suspects,'' ``Apt
Pupil'') threads through the movie's outlandish superhero action.
Can discourses on tolerance, responsibility and identity play to a
public that's been overcamped in recent years by the purely
escapist antics of the comic book-derived characters The Mask, Men
in Black and Batman?
</P>
<P>
   Funnily enough, the same question came up nearly 40 years ago,
when Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee created the then-revolutionary
concept of introspective superheroes with super problems: The
Fantastic Four, The Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man and, toward the end
of that medium-changing creative burst, the original X-Men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd always wanted to do intelligent comic books, but my
publisher wouldn't let me,'' explains the forever-young Lee, who
began writing comics in the late 1930s and is still creating
costumed characters on his popular new Internet site, stanlee.net.
``He felt that comic books were for very young kids: `Don't give
'em words of more than two syllables; keep the plots simple.' By
1961, I'd had it up to here and was ready to quit. But then he
asked me to create a superhero team, and my wife suggested that I
write the new book the way I wanted to. The worst that could happen
was he'd fire me, which didn't matter at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fantastic Four became an immediate hit due in large part to
its psychologically tormented characters and their soap operatic
relationships. Two years later, X-Men enhanced that basic concept
with a layer of reference to the civil rights movement that was
sweeping the nation. The heroes _ Cyclops, Jean Grey (a k a Marvel
Girl) and several others who were replaced over the decades _ were
mutants, born with special powers that made them outcasts feared
and hated by normal homo sapiens. They were organized by the
wheelchair-bound telepath Professor Xavier to harness their powers
for the good of ungrateful mankind . . . a task complicated by the
fact that Xavier's former friend and fellow mutants rights
advocate, Magneto, had a countergroup of disgruntled superfolks
bent on conquering the world.
</P>
<P>
   In Singer's film version, the basic conflict between Professor
X's good guys and Magneto's evil Mutant Brotherhood drives the
plot. But the prejudice subplot is prominently emphasized, with a
reactionary senator trying to curtail mutants rights and two X
initiates, Hugh Jackman's angry drifter Wolverine and Anna Paquin's
confused teenage Rogue, encountering substantial fear and loathing
from people who just don't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took making this film every bit as seriously as I take
making any film,'' notes Singer who, though initially unfamiliar
with the X-Men mythos, studied it with characteristic intensity.
``Whether it's based on a comic book or a classic or a piece of
history, a story and its characters should be taken very seriously.
That's the only way you can do its themes and ideas justice. You
don't want to trivialize or mock them, or exclude them altogether
in exchange for fancy effects and fighting stuff, which, of course,
you also need.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the trick. Singer says balancing the film's
contemplative and adrenal elements was an intuitive exercise, but
one that required being as true as possible to the comic's spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as everything serves the story and nothing eclipses
it, then it's all good, it's all exciting and that's how one keeps
a balance,'' says Singer, who worked on the movie's script with a
good half-dozen writers. ``There needs to be conflict and, with all
the powers, there's spectacle. The action serves the characters and
the characters serve the action, and it all, hopefully, serves the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   While there's certainly irony in the notion that big-budget
action movies have grown so degraded that it's a trick to keep them
true to more intelligent comic books, Lee admits it was just as
tough when he was trying to sell magazines at 12 cents a pop back
in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more realism you can inject into a fantasy story, the
better it is,'' Lee explains. ``I always tried to get into the
psyche of the characters that I wrote, but there was only so much
that you could do of that in a comic book. I would come up with a
concept for a story, make sure it had a compelling villain and a
struggle that would interest the reader. Then I had to have another
angle _ the B plot _ which was the hero's personal problem. Then I
had to make sure there'd be excuses for enough action. Finally,
having done all that, I'd throw in the soul-searching parts of it
while everything else was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The genre, obviously, has its conventions. And X-Men has
specific expectations. Among the most discussed aspects of Singer's
movie on X-fan Web sites was the decision to replace the heroes'
trademark, colorful costumes with basic black leather duds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I needed was to find a happy medium, a style that was
sexy but at the same time durable and practical,'' Singer explains.
``If we had gone into the variety of colors and everything, I think
you would have found that everybody looked, on-screen, like
cheerleaders or Power Rangers. The elegance would be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee concurs (for the record, the original X-Men, as conceived by
Lee and artist Jack Kirby, wore uniforms that were matched for
drabness only by the Fantastic Four's. It was later X incarnations
by other writers and artists that went in for Spandex overkill).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bryan absolutely did the right thing,'' Lee's convinced.
``These characters would have looked silly prancing around in color
costumes. You can get away with that in a comic book, but a movie
has to look real.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee's not including the ultra-stylized Batman films which, like
the Superman series of a decade or so earlier, were based on a
franchise owned by DC Comics, Marvel's arch-competitor of more than
six decades.
</P>
<P>
   DC has long had better luck at bringing its characters to the
big screen. Some of that is undoubtedly due to the fact the
publisher is owned by the same company as Warner Bros., the studio
which has produced most DC- derived films, while freestanding
Marvel has always had to shop movie rights to outside entities.
</P>
<P>
   But could the fact that Marvel's heroes are generally more
complex also have worked against their success in the
lowest-common-denominator action movie arena? ``X-Men's'' fate will
provide something of an answer, but the man who complicated comics
forevermore has a much simpler view of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the first `Batman' was an interesting movie, crazy, but
well done,'' Lee admits. ``I think every movie stands on its own,
whether it was taken from a comic book or not. It just depends on
how well you do the picture.'' &QL;

ON THE BUS WITH UNCLE KRACKER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Uncle Kracker put some miles on his music. He recorded his debut
album in the back of a bus.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't your average Greyhound, though. Known to family and
friends as Matt Shafer, Uncle Kracker is the guy behind the
turntables in Kid Rock's Twisted Brown Trucker band.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Double Wide'' (Lava/Atlantic) was cut in a makeshift
studio set up in Kid Rock's tour bus during cross-country treks
with Limp Bizkit and Metallica.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only way we could do it,'' Shafer said. ``The
engineer made it so easy. He assembled this whole thing so we could
work on the bus and in hotel rooms. It was one big distraction,
that's for sure: between shows and rehearsals and photo shoots and
interviews ... not to mention the stuff that goes on in the bus.
But it kept me sober because I knew there was work that had to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't only about work, of course. This is Kid Rock _ the guy
whose manic stage show includes strippers, a pint-size sidekick
named Joe C. and other assorted oddities.
</P>
<P>
   The laid-back yin to Kid's thunderously metallic yang, Shafer
serves up rock `n' roll that blends a bit of soul, country,
Southern blues-rock and hip-hop, topped off with the Michigan-bred
DJ's loose-limbed story-telling raps.
</P>
<P>
   Kid Rock and Uncle Kracker appear Saturday at the Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum as part of the Summer Sanitarium Tour with
Metallica, Korn, Powerman 500 and System of a Down.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the members of Metallica, who put the stadium tour
together, are among Kid's biggest fans. Kirk Hammett, the band's
lead guitarist, said it was an easy decision when choosing acts to
take on the road this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted someone who could really get the crowd going, who
everyone knew,'' Hammett said. ``Kid Rock puts on an amazing show.
You can't help but have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   As you'd expect from two longtime friends _ Kid Rock and Shafer
have been pals since 1987 _ they share similar tastes. ``Double
Wide'' features 11 tracks co-written by Kid and Kracker, including
the stomper ``What 'Chu Lookin' At?'' used in ``M:I-2,'' and ``Yeah
Yeah Yeah,'' which ended up in the new Jackie Chan flick ``Shanghai
Noon.''
</P>
<P>
   Shafer was 13 when he hooked up with Bob Ritchie, the kid who
would be Kid, at a Michigan nightspot where Rock was spinning in an
all-ages DJ competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and my brother were competing against each other,'' Shafer,
25, recalled. ``They became friends after that, but then me and him
became best friends. I pretty much sat around for 10 years as
friends more than anything else. I was one of his biggest fans. And
I'm still one of his biggest fans.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kid Rock issued his debut album in 1991, he invited Shafer
to join his band as DJ. The only problem: The new DJ had no idea
how to work the turntables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know how to scratch records or anything,'' Shafer
said. ``But I pretty much learned by playing shows. I never set up
in my bedroom and practiced _ my parents would freak if I turned it
up. We did shows, and it was do-or-die.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Shafer learned his trade, serving as musical
foil to Kid on each project, including the mega-platinum ``Devil
Without a Cause'' album.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to do my own thing and being with Kid Rock
is a great outlet,'' Shafer said. ``Y'know, two heads are better
than one. We write together, we play together. But we've always had
a plan, to branch out and keep it all in the family. After 'Devil'
happened, it was the right time for me to do my own record.''
</P>
<P>
   Shafer has been performing some of his solo tracks as part of
the Kid Rock show but plans to take it on the road himself later
this year using the Twisted Brown Trucker group.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get burned out on the road,'' he admits. ``It fools you
because you come off tour and go home for five days and think,
`This is nice.' Five days later, you can't wait to get back out
there. It's weird. This whole thing has been like a fantasy anyway.
</P>
<P>

BOGGED DOWN BY A MUTATED SCRIPT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
In ``X-Men,'' superpowered mutants are divided against each other
over how to deal with the mere humans who fear and hate them. One
group hopes that by using their gifts to aid and protect mankind,
they'll eventually gain the narrow-minded species' acceptance. The
other group reckons they're the wave of the future, and it's either
conquer the evolutionary throwbacks or be killed by them.
</P>
<P>
   Mutants are not the only ones working at cross purposes in this
big- screen adaptation of the popular Marvel comic book series. The
film itself waffles uncomfortably between attempts to explore
serious themes in the context of a jaunty superhero romp and, well,
just being a mindless superhero romp. The film has other problems
(as well as definite virtues), but the key trouble here is that the
narrative's conflicting impulses keep canceling each other out. The
disappointing result resembles the classic definition of
interesting failure, writ mutationally large.
</P>
<P>
   Director Bryan Singer, whose smaller, previous features include
the exquisitely serpentine ``The Usual Suspects'' and the deft but
underappreciated Stephen King adaptation ``Apt Pupil,'' may work in
pop movie idioms, but he's a serious, even resonant, storyteller.
He's always trying to get at deep truths _ How does evil work? Is
identity a fixed thing, or are we perpetually in the process of
changing into someone else? How is power controlled? _ and the
X-Men mythos, more than most comics sagas, is a good theoretical
stage for exploring them.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever ``X-Men'' starts addressing such issues, an action
sequence intrudes. And rather than dramatizing the story's themes,
as in the best thoughtful sci-fi thrillers like ``Matrix'' and the
``Terminator'' films, the big stunts and effects bits have a
half-hearted, derivative feel, like Singer felt obligated to
include them.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the X characters _ or, at least, the ones we're with
long enough to know here _ mesh nicely with the filmmaker's
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the good guys, Professor Xavier (``Star Trek's''
Patrick Stewart) can control others' minds. The short-fused,
possibly immortal Wolverine (Australian newcomer Hugh Jackman), the
series' signature hero, can't remember past a traumatic incident
somewhere in his indefinite past. Troubled teen Rogue (``The
Piano's'' Anna Paquin) absorbs the life force, memories and powers
of anyone she touches. And bad girl Mystique (the model Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos, who is basically playing Michelle Pfeiffer's
Catwoman swathed in midnight blue petroleum byproduct instead of
stitched leather) can morph into a perfect facsimile of whomever
she wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all this identity flexing an obvious allegory about
prejudice, and you've got more than your typical, Spandex-clad
adventuring (indeed, Singer has jettisoned the comic books'
colorful costumes for a more subdued, though doubtless
``Matrix''-inspired, black leather wardrobe). But this is also
where the movie immediately jumps the twin tracks of
appropriateness and balance, from which it never quite readjusts to
the rails.
</P>
<P>
   Things commence at a concentration camp in 1944. As Nazi
soldiers separate a young boy from his doomed parents, metal gates
and barbed wire twist uncannily, if futilely. That child will grow
up to become Magneto (Ian McKellen, having a good time), whose
early trauma has convinced him that a human-run mutant Holocaust is
just around the corner _ and must be prevented by any means
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, connecting the historical horror so directly to
escapist fantasy is in questionable taste at best. Storywise, it
sets a tone of reaching too far beyond what the material's pulp
metaphors can effectively grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The contemporary bigotry resembles more than anything the
current debate over gay rights. A demagogic senator (Bruce Davison)
wants to register mutants _ ``more dangerous than the guns you want
to control,'' he lobbies a wavering colleague _ before they harm or
otherwise influence our precious children.
</P>
<P>
   Little does the hysterical politician suspect what unimaginable
fate Magneto has in store for him _ not to mention a bunch of world
leaders and, collaterally, the entire population of New York (the
film's climactic battle between good and bad mutants takes place,
rather too symbolically, at the Statue of Liberty).
</P>
<P>
   While still-kinda-buddies Professor X and Magneto wait for their
underlings to fight each other to the death, the main drama is over
the souls of relative newbies Wolverine and Rogue. Not permitted
much in the way of personalities, the other X-Men _ Storm (Halle
Berry), who controls weather; Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), a
telekinetic psychic; and Cyclops (James Marsden), whose eyes emit
death rays and, if they could, dirty looks at the animalistically
attractive Wolverine, a rival for Jean's affections _ try to
convince the conflicted recruits that humans aren't all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger argument against siding with Magneto's dark
brotherhood, of course, is that it would mean having to hang out
with oilslick girl and a guy whose tongue is 15 feet long
(appropriately called Toad, he's played by Ray Park, who was Darth
Maul in the last ``Star Wars'' movie).

   The New York Times News Service is planning full coverage _
text, graphics and photos _ of the Republican National Convention
in Philadelphia from July 31 to Aug. 3 and the Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles from Aug. 14 to Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   A biographical series on Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President
Al Gore, written by New York Times political writers, has been
filed during the last two months, and the stories are available for
retransmission; the slugs are: BUSH-BIO, BUSH-BIO-II, BUSH-BIO-III
and BUSH-PARENTS; GORE-BIO, GORE-BIO-COLLEGE and GORE-MILITARY;
abridged versions and photos are available. For repeats, call
212-556-1927.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of the political scene by New York Times reporters,
columnists and photographers will continue up to the opening of the
convention. For the first two days of the convention, the Times
editors plan three to four pages of stories, which will then expand
to five or six daily pages. The News Service will list these
stories on a daily convention budget (BC-GOP-BUDGET-NYT,
BC-DEM-BUDGET-NYT), which will include all Times stories and will
also spotlight stories from Times partner and regional newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for coverage include: a daily convention overview
(GOP-RDP-NYT), an analysis (GOP-ASSESS-NYT) and a scene or color
story (tentatively, GOP-SCENE-NYT or GOP-DIARY-NYT). The Times
editors are considering a schedule that includes profiles of
candidates and families, politicians and delegates; analyses of
issues, platforms and historical background; and sidebars on
business, economics and media, as well as polls and surveys. Times
columnists will attend the conventions and will also be writing on
political developments and issues.
</P>
<P>
   All convention stories will be filed in the ``p'' category and
will carry a convention designation in the slug; e.g.,
BC-GOP-BUSH-NYT or BC-DEM-GORE-NYT. All stories are for use by New
York Times News Service clients. Look for updated and more detailed
advisories closer to the opening of the convention.

 &HT;    MEDIA IGNORED, THEN OVERSIMPLIFIED, BLACK CHURCH ARSONS (a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: Moving in ``A'' and ``K'' categories) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By Sharon Bramlett-Solomon (a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the national crisis over the burning of Black churches
has abated
</P>
<P>
   and the attention of the media is no longer focused on it, the
retreat of this
</P>
<P>
   news story from the spotlight may be a blessing. For the truth
is, an analysis
</P>
<P>
   of the nationwide phenomenon shows that newspapers did a
disturbingly poor job
</P>
<P>
   of explaining the church-burning ``conspiracy,'' reporting it
opaquely and
</P>
<P>
   strewing the issue with highly volatile implications,
particularly when it
</P>
<P>
   came to race.
</P>
<P>
   In short, news coverage of the idea of a conspiracy was unclear,
undefined,
</P>
<P>
   unenlightening, and it may have helped to escalate racial
tension.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the story shows how easy it was for the
conspiracy idea to
</P>
<P>
   be picked up by the press. From January 1995 to December 1997,
at least 142
</P>
<P>
   largely Southern Black churches were set on fire by arsonists.
Federal law
</P>
<P>
   enforcement officials and the U.S. national media began to focus
on these
</P>
<P>
   arson-caused fires in the spring 1996, after their swelling
numbers became too
</P>
<P>
   difficult (and too regional) to ignore. Pressure on federal
officials to
</P>
<P>
   investigate the church burnings came from community leaders,
politicians and
</P>
<P>
   ministers, both Black and White, across the country. The
torching of almost 40
</P>
<P>
   Black churches in 11 Southern states over this 18-month period
signaled a
</P>
<P>
   crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The series of Black church burnings in the south has special
historical
</P>
<P>
   resonance. Many Americans saw the fires not only as racially
driven, but also
</P>
<P>
   as a stark reminder of America's dark era of racial strife in
the 1950s and
</P>
<P>
   1960s, when church burnings were a major form of White terrorism
against Black
</P>
<P>
   Americans. During the civil rights movement, scores of Black
churches that
</P>
<P>
   were rallying points for civil rights demonstrations were bombed
or set on
</P>
<P>
   fire. Black Americans tended to see church burnings as a symbol
and reminder
</P>
<P>
   of racist America as well as a sign of deteriorating race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights,
</P>
<P>
   labeled the Black church fires ``a wake-up call'' for Americans
to deal with
</P>
<P>
   the nation's race-relations issue. Berry reported that federal
investigations
</P>
<P>
   revealed 70 percent of the Southern Black church fires were
racially
</P>
<P>
   motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to growing outrage over the church fires, President
Clinton in
</P>
<P>
   June 1996 created the National Church Arson Task Force,
including 200 members
</P>
<P>
   from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI and
the U.S. Justice
</P>
<P>
   Department. It was the largest federal task force in history. A
major question
</P>
<P>
   federal officials explored was whether the Black church arsons
were set by
</P>
<P>
   racists, conspirators, copycats or others.
</P>
<P>
   Deval Patrick, U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights,
who headed
</P>
<P>
   the church task force, said investigations revealed that race
was only one of
</P>
<P>
   several causes. He said some fires had been set by church
members trying
</P>
<P>
   fraudulently to collect insurance money, others by burglars and
some by
</P>
<P>
   pyromaniacs. In a handful of cases, he said, the arsonists
involved were in
</P>
<P>
   hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said investigation over a 15-month period found nothing
to show
</P>
<P>
   there was a national conspiracy targeting Black churches. Arsons
at White
</P>
<P>
   churches, he said, approached the number at Black churches, with
both taking
</P>
<P>
   place at record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patrick said although no organized conspiracy was
found, ``an
</P>
<P>
   intense climate of racism behind the church fires'' did exist.
Profiles of
</P>
<P>
   those arrested, Patrick said, revealed they were generally
White, male and
</P>
<P>
   young, low-income, poorly educated, frequently drunk or high on
drugs, rarely
</P>
<P>
   affiliated with hate groups, but often deeply driven by racism.
In other
</P>
<P>
   words, although conspiracy theories were largely debunked by the
task force,
</P>
<P>
   racist motives were not.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent figures increased national press coverage. Clinton
drew media
</P>
<P>
   attention with a speech given at the site of a burned church in
June 1996 in
</P>
<P>
   Greelyville, S.C. He vowed that the church burnings would not be
tolerated and
</P>
<P>
   would be intensely investigated by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   An unprecedented victory
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, with increased national press attention,
stiffer
</P>
<P>
   punishments and a louder public outcry, the arson-caused fires
at Black
</P>
<P>
   churches began to decline after about 15 months of National
Church Arsons Task
</P>
<P>
   Force investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented victory for burned Black churches, a South
Carolina
</P>
<P>
   jury of nine Blacks and three Whites in July 1998 ordered the
Klu Klux Klan to
</P>
<P>
   pay $12.6 million to Macedonia Baptist Church. The jury deemed
the Klan's
</P>
<P>
   rhetoric of hate had motivated four Klansmen to set the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several journalists questioned the media coverage's
accuracy and
</P>
<P>
   fairness, charging the press with initial indifference to the
burnings,
</P>
<P>
   simplistic treatment of a complex story, stereotyping the
arsonists as largely
</P>
<P>
   White racists, and escalating public hysteria by hyping the
story as a return
</P>
<P>
   to the tactics of the segregation era.
</P>
<P>
   Despite critics, at least one press defender addressed the
topic. American
</P>
<P>
   Journalism Review writer Joe Holley noted that over a
seven-month period,
</P>
<P>
   journalists prudently ``connected the dots'' in the fires. They
tended to take
</P>
<P>
   place at Southern Black churches in isolated or rural areas with
most of the
</P>
<P>
   arsonists being White. ``It's an example of how the media can be
distracted,
</P>
<P>
   even misled for a while, but given time, are able to right
themselves, regain
</P>
<P>
   their balance, and tease out the complex truth,'' Holley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Birmingham Post Herald reporter Ted Bryant
criticized
</P>
<P>
   the press for moving from ``indifference'' to ``hysteria'' and
charged that
</P>
<P>
   reporters inaccurately promoted stereotypes of the arsonists as
White
</P>
<P>
   hate-mongers. Michael Kelly, New Yorker magazine writer, also
noted coverage
</P>
<P>
   problems. He said that at first, reporters paid little attention
to the fires
</P>
<P>
   but later went overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case of overreaction that seems to have been inspired in
roughly
</P>
<P>
   equal measure by genuine concern, guilt and self-interests, they
leaped on the
</P>
<P>
   bandwagon with near-hysteria as misplaced as their previous
indifference,''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly wrote. Detroit Free Press religion writer David Crumm also
took the
</P>
<P>
   press to task, charging that reporters ignored motives other
than racism and
</P>
<P>
   ``often relied heavily on stereotypes supporting the idea that a
pack of
</P>
<P>
   church-burning racists could be on the loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of these critics addressed the fact that one of the
most
</P>
<P>
   confusing aspects of the reporting was the focus on whether they
were part of
</P>
<P>
   a national conspiracy. Although federal investigators say they
found no
</P>
<P>
   national conspiracy at work (such as KKK or militia groups),
coverage of the
</P>
<P>
   issue was confounding rather than informative. This writer's
research study of
</P>
<P>
   newspaper editorials from the Nexis Lexis database and
Editorials on File
</P>
<P>
   showed that only a third of the 109 editorials published on the
burnings
</P>
<P>
   addressed the conspiracy issue and that what was written was
poorly explained
</P>
<P>
   and highly ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Making an unclear point
</P>
<P>
   For example, a St. Louis Post Dispatch June 12, 1996, editorial
stated that
</P>
<P>
   church fire investigations ``turned up no interstate
conspiracy'' even though
</P>
<P>
   ``several fires have been linked to people with KKK ties.'' But
the editorial
</P>
<P>
   writer's point about the conspiracy issue was unclear. Because
the KKK has
</P>
<P>
   members in chapters across the nation, why would KKK or Aryan
Nation member
</P>
<P>
   involvement not constitute a local (if not a national)
conspiracy? This
</P>
<P>
   unanswered question should have been addressed to help readers
put facts into
</P>
<P>
   perspective.
</P>
<P>
   In a more radical perspective, Noah Chandler of the Center for
Democratic
</P>
<P>
   Renewal in Atlanta, a civil rights watchdog group, called media
focus on the
</P>
<P>
   conspiracy question ``racist conspiracy itself.'' Other
conspiracy labels also
</P>
<P>
   were noted in the press, including what the Houston Chronicle
called a
</P>
<P>
   ``conspiracy of silence'' and the Bergen Record called
``conspiracy of
</P>
<P>
   hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the press conspiracy discussion was short on clarity
and showed
</P>
<P>
   that, though well-intentioned, American journalists were unable
to deal with
</P>
<P>
   racial motivations that lie deep in the culture; so deep, in
fact, that they
</P>
<P>
   can be expressed spontaneously, without coordination and over an
extended
</P>
<P>
   period of time. Such coverage shows journalists have difficulty
handling
</P>
<P>
   subtle events and reporting on complex social events without
jumping to sudden
</P>
<P>
   conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Although current reports from the Church Arson Task Force reveal
the Black
</P>
<P>
   church fires have greatly declined, Assistant Attorney General
Patrick says
</P>
<P>
   investigations of the arson cases and vigorous pursuit of the
arsonists
</P>
<P>
   continue. But it may be blissful that national news headlines on
the fires
</P>
<P>
   have ceased. For although press perspectives on the rates,
arrests and
</P>
<P>
   deep-seated and complex racial motivations behind the arsons are
warranted,
</P>
<P>
   what is not are poorly explained ideas and speculation of a
national
</P>
<P>
   conspiracy targeting Black churches that may help to incite the
very racism it
</P>
<P>
   seeks to expose.

 &HT;    CHILDREN'S BOOKS HOLD REAL ANSWERS(a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED
THIS. Moving in the ``E'' and ``L'' categories) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By RICHARD NILSEN(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We all have our embarrassing little secrets. Mine is that I read
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   I started when I was a small boy, raiding our tiny elementary
school library for such kinder classics as Roy Chapman Andrew's
(beginitalic)All About Dinosaurs, (enditalic)and have continued to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   It was never the fictional or fairy tale books I latched onto
but the histories, biographies, science and natural history books.
Herbert S. Zim was my god.
</P>
<P>
   The books were filled with the answers to the questions I had
when I was in third grade. Why do some whales have teeth and others
baleen? How does an airplane stay in the air? Why is an egg shaped
that way?
</P>
<P>
   I still have questions, and books still provide answers. Or when
they don't give me answers, they show me the path to find my own
answer.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes jumping straight into a serious adult tome is
confusing. The experts who write them know much more than I do. And
they don't care about my ignorance. As a result, they can write
well beyond my poor ability to understand them on first go-round.
They are either written with the assumption that you already have
the rudiments, or they are polemical and assume you know the
disputed territory, or they are specialist books filled with a new
vocabulary you haven't learned yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's where children's books come in.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you the simplified, coherent version that
the adult books won't deign to provide.
</P>
<P>
   I am aware that the version the children's book gives is often
distorted, grotesquely simplified and sometimes just plain wrong.
But that doesn't matter: They provide a start, a map to the subject
at hand and give you an orientation that can later be fleshed out,
made more subtle and transcended. But you have to begin somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to realize that knowledge is not merely a
collection of facts. We are bombarded with facts daily, and it
hasn't made any of us smarter. It just means we have more to
forget. And we do.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is a set of interrelationships between facts. The
interrelationship has a shape and coherence that cannot be
constructed from the facts alone.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded over and over about Einstein and facts. ``If I
need a fact, I can look it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand information by two different metaphors. I
choose what I call the ``tree of knowledge.'' It has roots and
branches and creates a unified, simple idea. There may be many
leaves on the tree, but if you keep the shape of the tree in mind,
the leaves - the facts - will turn out to be just where they need
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The other metaphor - the one we come across daily in TV
newscasts, magazine articles and written driving exams - is what I
call ``fact confetti.'' This is the blizzard of unconnected data
that piles up across our road. Get me a snowplow.
</P>
<P>
   If you think of history as a bunch of dates and names - 1588,
1492, June 6, A.D.79 - it's no wonder you have trouble remembering
it. But if you know the great flow, the big picture, all the
details make sense where they come.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than merely dates associated with the Spanish
Armada, the expulsion of Jews from Spain, D-Day or the destruction
of Pompeii, they are part of the inevitable flow of history.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a systemic view of anatomy, no bone will be
unconnected to its neighbor. If you know the division between
bivalves and univalves, the shells you find at the beach have an
instant home - a kind of mailbox in your brain - where they belong
and fit comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   I often have found that if I have forgotten a fact, I can
re-create it accurately by knowing its context. It is better to
know how the French Revolution fits into the change from the Age of
Enlightenment to the Age of Romanticism. If you feel the larger
flow, then you remember that the French Revolution (beginitalic)has
(enditalic)to come after the American one.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, once you have created enough of these ``trees of
knowledge'' on a large number of subjects, then you start seeing
the forest instead of the trees, and it becomes easier and easier
to fit a new shrub into the even larger system. All with almost
none of the pain of trying to learn facts by rote.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you a sense of the flow and very few
facts. If later you discover that the tree of knowledge you gained
from the kid's book is flawed, you can trim it or replant it, but
it has served its purpose. It has got you in the door.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you never get beyond a children's book, well, you still
know more than most people.

<P>
   Have you ever gone to a Web site to find a specific piece of
information and found yourself falling through a series of pages
while clicking around helplessly, trying to find what you want? Do
you feel as if you have opened the door to the basement of your new
house only to find that the architect forgot to design the
staircase that leads to the lower level?
</P>
<P>
   A good architect won't forget your staircase, and a good
information architect _ a job that is becoming increasingly more
important as the world moves to the Web _ will make sure that
visitors to a site will be able to find their way around easily as
well. Although some in the new-media industry have lumped the job
with that of a Web site's graphic designer, the role of an
information architect in the creation of a site is actually much
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``With apologies to `Shoeless Joe,' the maxim `If you build it,
they will come' simply does not apply to the Web,'' said Colin
Furness, a senior information architect at Iguana Studios, a Web
design company in New York that has designed sites for the Zagat
restaurant guides and the American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. ``And many storefronts have not figured this
out yet. Poor usability that alienates users _ especially mom and
pop _ is cheap and easy, which is perhaps why it is so plentiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The information architect's job, Furness says, is to organize
the structure and content of all the material on a Web site, as
well as figure out how users can effectively navigate through the
site to find the one or two things they might be looking for _ say,
for instance, a pair of khaki pants on a large clothing retailer's
site. Once this blueprint has been laid out, the Web site's graphic
designer will concentrate on the visual look of the site. Or, to
put it back into building terms, the information architect decides
where the window will go, and the designer decides what the window
will look like.
</P>
<P>
   The look and feel of a Web page itself, including, for example,
where the site puts its search box for users to quickly seek out
specific words on the site, still lack uniform standards, Furness
said. He noted that while some Web page conventions, like colored,
underlined hyperlinks to other Web sites, are quickly understood by
most new users, other inconsistencies in design and layout may make
the Web hard to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules for navigation, information classification and
hierarchy and widgets such as drop-down menus _ and there are
actually rules _ have not been consistently applied,'' Furness
said, ``so no standards have emerged, and this has hindered users'
abilities to learn and master cyberspace.'' He likened it to the
early days of automobiles, when dashboards varied so widely that
drivers had to learn a new set of controls before they could
operate a car.
</P>
<P>
   Information architecture may also be aimed at a specific
audience. Older users, said Furness, who may have less familiarity
with computers as well as the Web, are likely to respond
differently to an e-commerce site that features loud, snazzy
animations and graphics than someone who is more used to the visual
style of the online world. In his work, Furness has noticed that
newer users tend to feel more comfortable ``when clickable links
are larger, when there is less information density per page, when
colors are softer, and things are explained in more detail using
suitable language and symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web itself is barely a decade old, and standards are bound
to emerge as it evolves. Once the technology is in place, it is
just a matter of adapting it to suit the needs of people, instead
of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has been slow to realize that the Web is nothing
more than a very big information system that can benefit from the
same attention to human factors,'' Furness said.

THIS. Moving in the ``E'' and ``L'' categories)

 &HT;    By RICHARD NILSEN(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   We all have our embarrassing little secrets. Mine is that I read
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   I started when I was a small boy, raiding our tiny elementary
school library for such kinder classics as Roy Chapman Andrew's
(beginitalic)All About Dinosaurs, (enditalic)and have continued to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   It was never the fictional or fairy tale books I latched onto
but the histories, biographies, science and natural history books.
Herbert S. Zim was my god.
</P>
<P>
   The books were filled with the answers to the questions I had
when I was in third grade. Why do some whales have teeth and others
baleen? How does an airplane stay in the air? Why is an egg shaped
that way?
</P>
<P>
   I still have questions, and books still provide answers. Or when
they don't give me answers, they show me the path to find my own
answer.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes jumping straight into a serious adult tome is
confusing. The experts who write them know much more than I do. And
they don't care about my ignorance. As a result, they can write
well beyond my poor ability to understand them on first go-round.
They are either written with the assumption that you already have
the rudiments, or they are polemical and assume you know the
disputed territory, or they are specialist books filled with a new
vocabulary you haven't learned yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's where children's books come in.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you the simplified, coherent version that
the adult books won't deign to provide.
</P>
<P>
   I am aware that the version the children's book gives is often
distorted, grotesquely simplified and sometimes just plain wrong.
But that doesn't matter: They provide a start, a map to the subject
at hand and give you an orientation that can later be fleshed out,
made more subtle and transcended. But you have to begin somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to realize that knowledge is not merely a
collection of facts. We are bombarded with facts daily, and it
hasn't made any of us smarter. It just means we have more to
forget. And we do.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is a set of interrelationships between facts. The
interrelationship has a shape and coherence that cannot be
constructed from the facts alone.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded over and over about Einstein and facts. ``If I
need a fact, I can look it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand information by two different metaphors. I
choose what I call the ``tree of knowledge.'' It has roots and
branches and creates a unified, simple idea. There may be many
leaves on the tree, but if you keep the shape of the tree in mind,
the leaves - the facts - will turn out to be just where they need
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The other metaphor - the one we come across daily in TV
newscasts, magazine articles and written driving exams - is what I
call ``fact confetti.'' This is the blizzard of unconnected data
that piles up across our road. Get me a snowplow.
</P>
<P>
   If you think of history as a bunch of dates and names - 1588,
1492, June 6, A.D.79 - it's no wonder you have trouble remembering
it. But if you know the great flow, the big picture, all the
details make sense where they come.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than merely dates associated with the Spanish
Armada, the expulsion of Jews from Spain, D-Day or the destruction
of Pompeii, they are part of the inevitable flow of history.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a systemic view of anatomy, no bone will be
unconnected to its neighbor. If you know the division between
bivalves and univalves, the shells you find at the beach have an
instant home - a kind of mailbox in your brain - where they belong
and fit comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   I often have found that if I have forgotten a fact, I can
re-create it accurately by knowing its context. It is better to
know how the French Revolution fits into the change from the Age of
Enlightenment to the Age of Romanticism. If you feel the larger
flow, then you remember that the French Revolution (beginitalic)has
(enditalic)to come after the American one.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, once you have created enough of these ``trees of
knowledge'' on a large number of subjects, then you start seeing
the forest instead of the trees, and it becomes easier and easier
to fit a new shrub into the even larger system. All with almost
none of the pain of trying to learn facts by rote.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you a sense of the flow and very few
facts. If later you discover that the tree of knowledge you gained
from the kid's book is flawed, you can trim it or replant it, but
it has served its purpose. It has got you in the door.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you never get beyond a children's book, well, you still
know more than most people.

   KOSOVO-MEDIA (Pristina, Kosovo) _ The publication by an Albanian
newspaper of the name and photograph of a Serb accused by the daily

passionate debate about press freedom. Afterwards, U.N. officials
shut down the Albanian-language newspaper, Dita, for eight days.
When Dita reappeared, it promptly reprinted the offending article.

hurl his spear, hoping to score six points by hitting him. Forcing
an opponent's horse to veer off course counts for three points. A
rider who falls from his horse loses three points and the respect
of the crowd. This lightning-fast sport, called cirit and
pronounced jir-IT, is played only in Turkey. It is a throwback to
the days when Ottoman cavalrymen were among the world's most

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new book:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim the Boy''
</P>
<P>
   ByTony Earley
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to describe a book like this, a small gem that
appears without fanfare and quietly puts other novels to shame.
It's the story of 10-year-old Jim Glass, whose father died a week
before he was born and who has been raised by his mother and her
three unmarried brothers, known collectively to Jim as ``the
uncles.'' They are a makeshift but solid family, working their
North Carolina farm during the years of the Great Depression. The
action, like the book cover, is deceptively simple, involving a new
suitor for Jim's mother, a new friend for Jim at school and a trip
with one of his uncles that opens Jim's eyes to the world beyond
the small town of Aliceville. Earley, who writes beautifully and
yet with studied restraint, creates a tangible world with these
characters and conveys the deep and lasting importance of small
events in a boy's life. As always, the simplest stories are the
most difficult to tell - and this one is a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain City''
</P>
<P>
   By Gregory Martin
</P>
<P>
   (North Point, $21)
</P>
<P>
   Mountain City, Nev., is a mile long, limit to limit. Its
business district consists of seven buildings, including a gas
station and a bar. There are no stoplights or stop signs. Only 33
people live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come and go,'' writes Martin, ``but when I'm there, that
makes 34.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's family has run the general store in Mountain City since
1958, but their ties to the place go back to their Basque
ancestors, who settled there during the 1800s. Through the drastic
population swings of the boom and bust mining towns, they have hung
on, taking jobs that kept them in the landscape they had come to
love. But life in Mountain City is fading fast. Martin writes this
meticulous memoir as if he hopes to preserve some affectionate but
unsentimental sense of his family and their home before they are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he says, ``home is the place I can't keep from
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, by the end of the book Mountain City's population
is only 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Rant, Therefore I Am''
</P>
<P>
   By Dennis Miller
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some venom? Actually, that word is inadequate
to describe the rancorous, sump-sucking (Miller's term) disdain the
author feels for just about anybody or anything at any given time.
Among his targets: people who watch daytime talk shows (''I swear,
you can still see the jelly on their foreheads where the
electroshock terminals were attached''), the war on drugs (''If we
had any actual commitment, you'd be able to look at a map and see a
smoking hole where Colombia once was'') and the film ``Elizabeth''
(It's about ``some chick who's kind of nice-looking, then she
becomes Queen of England and gets all ugly and bald''). Whatever
will he say about football? These rants are from Miller's TV show,
and judging from sales of his previous collections, you'd think
they're very funny. We think what's hilarious in a monologue falls
flat on a page. Of course. that's just our opinion. We could be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gig''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by John Bowe, Marisa Bowe and Sabin Streeter
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Here are selections from the Working column featured in the Web
magazine ``Word,'' which for several years has sent interviewers
across the country to listen to people talk about their jobs.
Included here are a corporate headhunter, a crime-scene cleaner, a
financial adviser, a bus driver, a McDonald's worker, a buffalo
rancher, a diet center owner, a porn star, a professional
snowboarder, an actress, an FBI agent, a palm reader, a plastic
surgeon, a waitress and many others. A UPS driver admits that he
gives lousy service to customers who don't tip well at Christmas, a
gun store owner says he is ``basically unemployable - I have a
problem with authority figures,'' and a paparazzo describes the day
actor Alec Baldwin punched him and broke his nose for trying to
shoot video of Baldwin bringing home his newborn daughter. The
interviewees, many of whom are remarkably candid, are identified by
their real names.

AFTER CENTURIES OF TENSIONS, JAPANESE AND KOREANS GET ALONG
BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FUKUOKA, Japan _ As he waited to board a flight back to his
native South Korea, Kim Tae-won still couldn't believe the
reception his 40-person theater troupe had received all week from
standing-room-only audiences in this provincial capital in southern
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   After years of hearing stories about Japan tinged in mistrust
and disdain, Kim, whose troupe was performing a historical play
about a Mongol invasion of Japan via Korea, pronounced what
amounted to a burying of the hatchet between two of Asia's most
closely related, yet persistently contentious, neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the old feelings of hatred toward Japan like we
used to anymore,'' he said. ``And I guess our stay here shows that
the Japanese have finally learned to respect us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The burgeoning detente between South Korea and Japan can be seen
in many ways, from the World Cup tournament they have agreed to
co-host in 2002, to the increasingly frequent trips back and forth
between leaders of the two countries, to the pending invitation of
the Japanese emperor to Seoul, which given Japan's bitterly
resented imperial rule of Korea early this century, would have been
unthinkable even just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's visit took place during Korea Week in Fukuoka, where
Korean master potters displayed their works and lectured Japanese
audiences about ceramics, brought to Japan from Korea centuries
ago. And Korean flower arrangers showed off their innovations in an
art largely inspired by ancient Japanese traditions.
</P>
<P>
   But the best reflection of the spreading warmth between the
countries is the way travel between them _ not just by business
people and officials, but by housewives, students and ordinary
tourists _ has exploded in the last few years, making Korea the
preferred destination of Japanese last year, replacing the longtime
favorite, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The booming travel between the countries comes at a time of
historic shifts in relationships throughout the region. Japan and
South Korea are enjoying a rare flourish of warmth in what have
long been lucrative, but hitherto frosty economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, starting with a historic summit
meeting of their leaders in June, North and South Korea have been
making major progress toward ending the state of war between them.
</P>
<P>
   The thaw between North and South Korea, meanwhile, has
encouraged Pyongyang to moderate its often shrill rhetoric against
Tokyo, and even begin hinting at a reconciliation with Japan, which
North Korea usually depicts as the source of evil and corruption in
northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The softer tone may reflect a recognition that capital from
Japan _ which has the world's second largest economy _ will be
indispensible for the reconstruction of a North Korea on the verge
of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to find a sea boundary in Asia whose history
has been more tumultuous, or indeed of deeper impact than the Korea
Strait, a 100-mile-wide stretch of ocean separating Fukuoka from
Pusan, in southern South Korea. Although the subject remains
shrouded in mystery and taboo here, Japan's imperial family is
believed by many historians to have arrived from across these seas
some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Mongols, who ruled Korea, invaded twice and were defeated
the second time only by a typhoon, the original kamikaze, or holy
wind, that wrecked their armada of 3,500 ships in 1281.
</P>
<P>
   Three centuries later, feudal Japan launched two invasions of
its own, involving 150,000 or so troops each time, but was undone
by help from Chinese allies and Korea's invention of the world's
first armored sea craft, the Turtle Ship.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the invasions are nothing more aggressive than
weekend shopping expeditions by housewives and culinary raids for
spicy Korean kimchi or delicate Japanese specialties, or school
trips, amusement park visits and health spa ``cures'' now taking
place at a rate of more than 2 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   And because of its proximity to the Korean peninsula, Fukuoka,
once the favored jumping off point for conquerors, has become the
leading springboard for travelers between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Where diplomacy has often come up short in the past, growing
contacts like these between Korea and Japan seem to be changing the
ways _ often deeply stereotyped _ the two peoples think about each
other. Japanese people return from Korea and discover a country
that is far more orderly and developed than they had been led to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard a lot about Korea before I went, but my
impressions of the place were much better than the image I used to
have,'' said Kyoko Fukuda, a Japanese beautician whose flight from
Seoul, where she went to attend a conference, had just landed. ``We
have always heard that the living standard is very low there, but
in fact the difference was not so terribly great.''
</P>
<P>
   Koreans, meanwhile, are noting a greater willingness among
Japanese people to acknowledge them as peers rather than subjects,
and vitally, to the Koreans' deep sense of national pride, to
acknowledge that Japanese culture has borrowed heavily from its
western neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, South Korea in June lifted restrictions on imports
of Japanese films and most television programming. The measure
follows a more timid relaxation of controls on ``cultural imports''
from Japan that began in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese were deeply influenced by Korea,'' said Lee
Kang-hyo, a Korean ceramics artists who lectured recently in
Fukuoka, where Korean masterpieces were on display at a municipal
exhibition hall, along with historical correspondence from
Hideoshi, the Japanese shogun who twice invaded the country. ``But
you have to come to Japan to see the best of our classical
tradition preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That fact has much to do, Lee hastened to had, with Japan's
35-year colonization of Korea, which ended in 1945, and its
previous conquest of the country, when Korean masterpieces were
carted off to Japan in large quantities. But another explanation he
said he was surprised to learn during his first visit to Fukuoka,
last month, , was the deep sense of prestige that still attaches to
the classical Korean style in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese academics, meanwhile, say that they have begun to work
closely together with their Korean counterparts to piece together
the shared history of the two peoples, overcoming a legacy of
mutual contempt. ``It is safe to say that Japan had a feeling of
superiority over Korea,'' said Koji Saeki, a professor of history
at Kyushu University, in Fukuoka. ``But the exchanges between
Japanese and Korean scholars are very active now, and they are
strengthening all the time.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the area of the painful history that has long divided
the two peoples that the rapprochement between the two countries
has traveled the most distance.
</P>
<P>
   Only in fits and starts has the Japanese government has shown a
willingness to address the question of Japanese imperial rule over
the Korean peninsula, apologizing officially to the Korean
government, but devoting relatively little attention in officially
sanctioned textbooks to Japanese brutality, like the use of Korean
women as sex slaves for the imperial army.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Japanese politicians, meanwhile, periodically continue
to make provocative statements about Koreans in Japan, blaming them
for crime, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Individual Japanese who have traveled to Korea say, however,
that their experience of the country has brought them to reflect
deeply about their own country's expansionist past, and often
express a kind of remorse whose sincerity rings far truer than any
official declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Korean tour guides play a subtle but important role,
deliberately bringing Japanese visitors to sites that commemorate
the sacking of their country and attempted destruction of their
culture by several generations of Japanese invaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned almost nothing about this in school,'' said Makiko
Nakatsukuma, a 27-year-old housewife, who had just traveled with
her best friend to Pusan by high-speed ferry for a weekend of
shopping. ``In Korea it was explained to us how Japan had forced
Koreans to learn our language, and to abandon their names in favor
of Japanese names. Many Koreans were brought to Japan by force,
too, and had to work as virtual slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time I was there, I just felt like apologizing to
the Korean people. It is very hard to explain, but even though I am
from the post-war generations, I felt so bad about all of this. You
want to say you are sorry, but who do you say it to?''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new book:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim the Boy''
</P>
<P>
   ByTony Earley
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to describe a book like this, a small gem that
appears without fanfare and quietly puts other novels to shame.
It's the story of 10-year-old Jim Glass, whose father died a week
before he was born and who has been raised by his mother and her
three unmarried brothers, known collectively to Jim as ``the
uncles.'' They are a makeshift but solid family, working their
North Carolina farm during the years of the Great Depression. The
action, like the book cover, is deceptively simple, involving a new
suitor for Jim's mother, a new friend for Jim at school and a trip
with one of his uncles that opens Jim's eyes to the world beyond
the small town of Aliceville. Earley, who writes beautifully and
yet with studied restraint, creates a tangible world with these
characters and conveys the deep and lasting importance of small
events in a boy's life. As always, the simplest stories are the
most difficult to tell - and this one is a triumph.

<P>
   ``Mountain City''
</P>
<P>
   By Gregory Martin
</P>
<P>
   (North Point, $21)
</P>
<P>
   Mountain City, Nev., is a mile long, limit to limit. Its
business district consists of seven buildings, including a gas
station and a bar. There are no stoplights or stop signs. Only 33
people live there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come and go,'' writes Martin, ``but when I'm there, that
makes 34.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's family has run the general store in Mountain City since
1958, but their ties to the place go back to their Basque
ancestors, who settled there during the 1800s. Through the drastic
population swings of the boom and bust mining towns, they have hung
on, taking jobs that kept them in the landscape they had come to
love. But life in Mountain City is fading fast. Martin writes this
meticulous memoir as if he hopes to preserve some affectionate but
unsentimental sense of his family and their home before they are
gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' he says, ``home is the place I can't keep from
disappearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, by the end of the book Mountain City's population
is only 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Rant, Therefore I Am''
</P>
<P>
   By Dennis Miller
</P>
<P>
   (Doubleday, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   Are you ready for some venom? Actually, that word is inadequate
to describe the rancorous, sump-sucking (Miller's term) disdain the
author feels for just about anybody or anything at any given time.
Among his targets: people who watch daytime talk shows (''I swear,
you can still see the jelly on their foreheads where the
electroshock terminals were attached''), the war on drugs (''If we
had any actual commitment, you'd be able to look at a map and see a
smoking hole where Colombia once was'') and the film ``Elizabeth''
(It's about ``some chick who's kind of nice-looking, then she
becomes Queen of England and gets all ugly and bald''). Whatever
will he say about football? These rants are from Miller's TV show,
and judging from sales of his previous collections, you'd think
they're very funny. We think what's hilarious in a monologue falls
flat on a page. Of course. that's just our opinion. We could be
wrong.

   ``Gig''
</P>
<P>
   Edited by John Bowe, Marisa Bowe and Sabin Streeter
</P>
<P>
   (Crown, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Here are selections from the Working column featured in the Web
magazine ``Word,'' which for several years has sent interviewers
across the country to listen to people talk about their jobs.
Included here are a corporate headhunter, a crime-scene cleaner, a
financial adviser, a bus driver, a McDonald's worker, a buffalo
rancher, a diet center owner, a porn star, a professional
snowboarder, an actress, an FBI agent, a palm reader, a plastic
surgeon, a waitress and many others. A UPS driver admits that he
gives lousy service to customers who don't tip well at Christmas, a
gun store owner says he is ``basically unemployable - I have a
problem with authority figures,'' and a paparazzo describes the day
actor Alec Baldwin punched him and broke his nose for trying to
shoot video of Baldwin bringing home his newborn daughter. The
interviewees, many of whom are remarkably candid, are identified by
their real names.

<HEADLINE>
WILDFLOWER FESTIVAL MAY BE GETTING TOO POPULAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT CRESTED BUTTE, Colo. _ Ever so slowly, the secret is
getting out.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, the fields and mountain slopes here explode
into color, with more than 1,000 varieties of wildflowers poking
through the grasslands in a dazzling crazy-quilt of brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   Residents always knew about the wildflowers, but not many others
did until it occurred to a group of local leaders nearly 20 years
ago that the flowers might be an ideal way to show off a town known
almost exclusively as a ski resort. So they began the Crested Butte
Wildflower Festival as a summer weekend of wildflower hikes led by
experts who knew a harebell from a fringed gentian and a sneezeweed
from a little sunflower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then,'' said Nan Buxton, a visitor from Oklahoma City who
has attended the festival almost every year, ``you could just come
down and sign up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now look: The festival has grown so big and popular that
participants call weeks in advance to reserve space for nearly 150
hikes, workshops and evening programs that have turned the festival
into a week-long event. In addition to nature walks, activities
include classes on nature photography, medicinal plants, edible
plants, organic gardens, insects, butterflies and ecosystems. Some
fill up so quickly that people are turned away.
</P>
<P>
   And that is beginning to worry festival organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike the region itself _ Mount Crested Butte and the
larger town 3 miles below, Crested Butte _ the wildflower festival
has reached a critical point, forcing organizers to confront
questions of how to manage growth while preserving the reasons for
which the festival became so popular. In its early years, about 100
people attended. By the end of this year's events on Sunday,
organizers say 2,500 will have participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began with a handful of people, and we ended up getting
bigger every year,'' said Dana Bradley Spencer, a wildlife
biologist who is the festival's board president. ``If we get too
big, we can't really offer the quality and specialness of teaching
people about the flowers. Visitors want a quaintness, stylized to
fit their enjoyment of flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, groups of a dozen or so seem manageable. Leading a
2-and-a-half-hour hike on Tuesday, Alison Gannett, a botanist from
the University of Vermont, had plenty of time to spot more than two
dozen varieties of wildflowers, discuss their characteristics,
answer questions and keep group members from trampling too many
other flowers to see the ones she was pointing out.
</P>
<P>
   With a group that size, Gannett never had to raise her voice
when explaining that yarrow, a purple flower, is a natural
antibiotic, or that according to folklore, sheep that eat false
skunk cabbage, a pale green plant, give birth to offspring with
only one eye _ ``sheep cyclops,'' she said. In a larger group, some
might have missed that.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Spencer said organizers would have to review this year's
festival to decide how much, if at all, it could grow next year,
the owners of the ski resort are also contemplating how to expand
without overwhelming a region that visitors have always appreciated
for its charm and community spirit.
</P>
<P>
   As a ski area, Crested Butte cannot match the size or glitz of
the larger ski resorts in Colorado, like Aspen, Vail and
Breckenridge. Former President Jimmy Carter visits here annually,
and James MacArthur, the actor who played Danno on ``Hawaii
Five-0,'' lives here. But that is about it for the town's famous
connections.
</P>
<P>
   What Crested Butte does have in common with nearly every other
Colorado ski resort is a recent downward economic trend. Warm
winters and a lack of snow have cut sharply into the number of
skier-visits, which is defined as one skier skiing per day. Over
the last two winters, the number at Crested Butte has fallen by 24
percent, compared with the statewide average decline of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Callaway family, which owns the ski resort, has known for
years it has to change to remain competitive. It helps that the
wildflower festival and dozens of other cultural events are drawing
more people into the area in summer. But the ultimate health of a
ski resort depends upon skiing facilities, amenities and ease of
access to the slopes. Expanding them has become no less perplexing
to the Callaway family than the same issue on a smaller scale is to
the wildflower organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you put in a new lift or a new hotel, it echoes
down the valley,'' Edward C. Callaway, the resort's president and
chief executive, said Wednesday, explaining why the family has
taken a slow approach to growth that preserves open space, rather
than adopt an aggressive strategy that could choke the region with
traffic, overwhelm the supply of housing and drive out ranchers
whose families have worked land in the valley for generations.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the resort needs a second mountain for
skiing, and it has one nearby, Snodgrass Mountain. By adding
intermediate ski runs to Snodgrass to complement the beginner and
expert runs that Crested Butte Mountain has in abundance, the
resort would become more attractive to more families.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Callaway said, that will wait. Instead, the owners
are planning to spur growth at a more modest rate, with new
amenities on the existing slopes and a new town center that will
include retail space, a town hall and a recreation center. Beyond
that, there are plans for expanding public transportation and
building housing that would be affordable for people who work in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   Then, maybe then, Callaway said, when the family is convinced
that adverse impacts on the region would be minimal, Snodgrass
might be developed. There is no rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to grow but we want to grow smart, by putting in
development where it exists, not where it doesn't exist,'' Callaway
said. ``We've drawn a line in the flowers, and we never want to go
over it.''

 &HT;    MEDIA IGNORED, THEN OVERSIMPLIFIED, BLACK CHURCH ARSONS (a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: Moving in ``A'' and ``K'' categories) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By Sharon Bramlett-Solomon (a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 Special for The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the national crisis over the burning of Black churches
has abated
</P>
<P>
   and the attention of the media is no longer focused on it, the
retreat of this
</P>
<P>
   news story from the spotlight may be a blessing. For the truth
is, an analysis
</P>
<P>
   of the nationwide phenomenon shows that newspapers did a
disturbingly poor job
</P>
<P>
   of explaining the church-burning ``conspiracy,'' reporting it
opaquely and
</P>
<P>
   strewing the issue with highly volatile implications,
particularly when it
</P>
<P>
   came to race.
</P>
<P>
   In short, news coverage of the idea of a conspiracy was unclear,
undefined,
</P>
<P>
   unenlightening, and it may have helped to escalate racial
tension.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of the story shows how easy it was for the
conspiracy idea to
</P>
<P>
   be picked up by the press. From January 1995 to December 1997,
at least 142
</P>
<P>
   largely Southern Black churches were set on fire by arsonists.
Federal law
</P>
<P>
   enforcement officials and the U.S. national media began to focus
on these
</P>
<P>
   arson-caused fires in the spring 1996, after their swelling
numbers became too
</P>
<P>
   difficult (and too regional) to ignore. Pressure on federal
officials to
</P>
<P>
   investigate the church burnings came from community leaders,
politicians and
</P>
<P>
   ministers, both Black and White, across the country. The
torching of almost 40
</P>
<P>
   Black churches in 11 Southern states over this 18-month period
signaled a
</P>
<P>
   crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The series of Black church burnings in the south has special
historical
</P>
<P>
   resonance. Many Americans saw the fires not only as racially
driven, but also
</P>
<P>
   as a stark reminder of America's dark era of racial strife in
the 1950s and
</P>
<P>
   1960s, when church burnings were a major form of White terrorism
against Black
</P>
<P>
   Americans. During the civil rights movement, scores of Black
churches that
</P>
<P>
   were rallying points for civil rights demonstrations were bombed
or set on
</P>
<P>
   fire. Black Americans tended to see church burnings as a symbol
and reminder
</P>
<P>
   of racist America as well as a sign of deteriorating race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil
Rights,
</P>
<P>
   labeled the Black church fires ``a wake-up call'' for Americans
to deal with
</P>
<P>
   the nation's race-relations issue. Berry reported that federal
investigations
</P>
<P>
   revealed 70 percent of the Southern Black church fires were
racially
</P>
<P>
   motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to growing outrage over the church fires, President
Clinton in
</P>
<P>
   June 1996 created the National Church Arson Task Force,
including 200 members
</P>
<P>
   from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI and
the U.S. Justice
</P>
<P>
   Department. It was the largest federal task force in history. A
major question
</P>
<P>
   federal officials explored was whether the Black church arsons
were set by
</P>
<P>
   racists, conspirators, copycats or others.
</P>
<P>
   Deval Patrick, U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights,
who headed
</P>
<P>
   the church task force, said investigations revealed that race
was only one of
</P>
<P>
   several causes. He said some fires had been set by church
members trying
</P>
<P>
   fraudulently to collect insurance money, others by burglars and
some by
</P>
<P>
   pyromaniacs. In a handful of cases, he said, the arsonists
involved were in
</P>
<P>
   hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick said investigation over a 15-month period found nothing
to show
</P>
<P>
   there was a national conspiracy targeting Black churches. Arsons
at White
</P>
<P>
   churches, he said, approached the number at Black churches, with
both taking
</P>
<P>
   place at record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patrick said although no organized conspiracy was
found, ``an
</P>
<P>
   intense climate of racism behind the church fires'' did exist.
Profiles of
</P>
<P>
   those arrested, Patrick said, revealed they were generally
White, male and
</P>
<P>
   young, low-income, poorly educated, frequently drunk or high on
drugs, rarely
</P>
<P>
   affiliated with hate groups, but often deeply driven by racism.
In other
</P>
<P>
   words, although conspiracy theories were largely debunked by the
task force,
</P>
<P>
   racist motives were not.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent figures increased national press coverage. Clinton
drew media
</P>
<P>
   attention with a speech given at the site of a burned church in
June 1996 in
</P>
<P>
   Greelyville, S.C. He vowed that the church burnings would not be
tolerated and
</P>
<P>
   would be intensely investigated by federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   An unprecedented victory
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, with increased national press attention,
stiffer
</P>
<P>
   punishments and a louder public outcry, the arson-caused fires
at Black
</P>
<P>
   churches began to decline after about 15 months of National
Church Arsons Task
</P>
<P>
   Force investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented victory for burned Black churches, a South
Carolina
</P>
<P>
   jury of nine Blacks and three Whites in July 1998 ordered the
Klu Klux Klan to
</P>
<P>
   pay $12.6 million to Macedonia Baptist Church. The jury deemed
the Klan's
</P>
<P>
   rhetoric of hate had motivated four Klansmen to set the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several journalists questioned the media coverage's
accuracy and
</P>
<P>
   fairness, charging the press with initial indifference to the
burnings,
</P>
<P>
   simplistic treatment of a complex story, stereotyping the
arsonists as largely
</P>
<P>
   White racists, and escalating public hysteria by hyping the
story as a return
</P>
<P>
   to the tactics of the segregation era.
</P>
<P>
   Despite critics, at least one press defender addressed the
topic. American
</P>
<P>
   Journalism Review writer Joe Holley noted that over a
seven-month period,
</P>
<P>
   journalists prudently ``connected the dots'' in the fires. They
tended to take
</P>
<P>
   place at Southern Black churches in isolated or rural areas with
most of the
</P>
<P>
   arsonists being White. ``It's an example of how the media can be
distracted,
</P>
<P>
   even misled for a while, but given time, are able to right
themselves, regain
</P>
<P>
   their balance, and tease out the complex truth,'' Holley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Birmingham Post Herald reporter Ted Bryant
criticized
</P>
<P>
   the press for moving from ``indifference'' to ``hysteria'' and
charged that
</P>
<P>
   reporters inaccurately promoted stereotypes of the arsonists as
White
</P>
<P>
   hate-mongers. Michael Kelly, New Yorker magazine writer, also
noted coverage
</P>
<P>
   problems. He said that at first, reporters paid little attention
to the fires
</P>
<P>
   but later went overboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a case of overreaction that seems to have been inspired in
roughly
</P>
<P>
   equal measure by genuine concern, guilt and self-interests, they
leaped on the
</P>
<P>
   bandwagon with near-hysteria as misplaced as their previous
indifference,''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly wrote. Detroit Free Press religion writer David Crumm also
took the
</P>
<P>
   press to task, charging that reporters ignored motives other
than racism and
</P>
<P>
   ``often relied heavily on stereotypes supporting the idea that a
pack of
</P>
<P>
   church-burning racists could be on the loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, none of these critics addressed the fact that one of the
most
</P>
<P>
   confusing aspects of the reporting was the focus on whether they
were part of
</P>
<P>
   a national conspiracy. Although federal investigators say they
found no
</P>
<P>
   national conspiracy at work (such as KKK or militia groups),
coverage of the
</P>
<P>
   issue was confounding rather than informative. This writer's
research study of
</P>
<P>
   newspaper editorials from the Nexis Lexis database and
Editorials on File
</P>
<P>
   showed that only a third of the 109 editorials published on the
burnings
</P>
<P>
   addressed the conspiracy issue and that what was written was
poorly explained
</P>
<P>
   and highly ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   Making an unclear point
</P>
<P>
   For example, a St. Louis Post Dispatch June 12, 1996, editorial
stated that
</P>
<P>
   church fire investigations ``turned up no interstate
conspiracy'' even though
</P>
<P>
   ``several fires have been linked to people with KKK ties.'' But
the editorial
</P>
<P>
   writer's point about the conspiracy issue was unclear. Because
the KKK has
</P>
<P>
   members in chapters across the nation, why would KKK or Aryan
Nation member
</P>
<P>
   involvement not constitute a local (if not a national)
conspiracy? This
</P>
<P>
   unanswered question should have been addressed to help readers
put facts into
</P>
<P>
   perspective.
</P>
<P>
   In a more radical perspective, Noah Chandler of the Center for
Democratic
</P>
<P>
   Renewal in Atlanta, a civil rights watchdog group, called media
focus on the

RUSSIA'S HUGE HURDLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia's successful launch Wednesday of its service module for
the International Space Station is important for more reasons than
the accomplishment itself. It cements the spirit of cooperation
among the United States, Russia, and other participating countries
that is essential to completing assembly of the station over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of intricate work remains to be done before the
module docks with the already-orbiting node assembly on July 25 _ a
delicate task depending entirely on automated systems. Should that
fail, the Russians have a three-member crew ready to launch in
early August to finish the job.
</P>
<P>
   The technical elements of Russia's effort are rivaled by the
political and economic obstacles that had to be overcome. Russia's
space program had been severely constrained by loss of the priority
treatment it received during the Soviet era, including a sharp loss
of funding. American assistance has been important in overcoming
those problems but, even with that, Russia fell two years behind in
sending the service module into orbit _ a delay that backed up the
entire program and threatened to undermine congressional support
for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Russian space program management group, there was
also a lingering affection for the 15-year-old Mir space station.
Its prolonged use _ the last crew left earlier this year _
deflected attention and energy from the International Space Station
effort, to the annoyance of NASA officials and other space leaders.
The big step now taken, with the first full-time crew (two Russians
and an American) slated for the end of the year, increases the
likelihood that the space station will become the dominant focus of
the Russian program.
</P>
<P>
   Operation of the station will open the way to long-term
scientific and technical investigations promising many benefits. It
could also deepen cooperative efforts among formerly competing
programs, Russian and American, and thus serve as a model for other
fields _ commercial and industrial.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's step into space, though a bit tardy, deserves to be
seen in the United States as important progress toward further
gains.

 &HT;    Hawks' rookie Johnson, mom trying to adjust to life in NBABy
Maiya Hayes
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - It's not easy being a young man with big NBA dreams.
But try being his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Powell said she saw her son DerMarr Johnson only twice
during his senior year in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson spent his 1998-99 school year at Maine Central
Institute, while Powell continued to live in their hometown of
Riverdale, Md., more than 600 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later and Powell still can't see her 20-year-old son
that often. Johnson, the Hawks' top-draft pick, is still working
hard on his NBA dreams.
</P>
<P>
   This week, he has endured three draining days of practice during
the team's camp for rookies and free agents. Today, Johnson and the
other players in the Hawks' camp play the Indiana Pacers' team at
Life University in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said she is proud of her son and thinks he can handle
living in Atlanta on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has a beautiful personality,'' she said. ``He's
quiet, he's sensible, he's giving. He's just D.J.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he has been disappointed with his performance so
far in practice. Adjusting to the NBA level has been tough for the
6-foot-9, 200-pound guard. He has been hampered by foot blisters
since Monday and has yet to reach his comfort level.
</P>
<P>
   But Powell also has had a tough time adjusting to the distance
between her and her middle child. ``It does hurt as a mother to see
him go so far away,'' said Powell, who calls her son every day.
</P>
<P>
   It took a lot of persuading on Johnson's part to get his
mother's permission, but she eventually agreed to let him spend his
senior year in Maine. Playing there turned out to be a great
experience for Johnson, who averaged 26.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and
3.9 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson then took his skills to the University of Cincinnati,
which allowed his mother to attend more of his games. Johnson chose
Cincinnati because he thought that Bearcats' coach Bob Huggins
would help prepare him for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been preparing for the league since I was a sophomore,''
Johnson said. ``Back when I was coming out of high school, the
skills were there, but I needed coaching under coach Huggins to get
some toughness, to get stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In his freshman year at Cincinnati, Johnson averaged 12.6 points
and 3. 8 rebounds per game. He made 37 percent of his 3-pointers
and shot almost 48 percent from the field. He was named Conference
USA freshman of the year and was third-team all-conference.
</P>
<P>
   But after one year at Cincinnati, Johnson decided that it was
time to rise to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so athletic that in college he just beat people off his
athleticism,'' Hawks guard Dion Glover said. ``On this level, he's
got to realize that everybody's athletic. But I think DerMarr is
going to be a great player on this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover, who left Georgia Tech early, said the college
experiences Johnson will miss don't outweigh the chance he's been
given to play in the NBA. Hawks coach Lon Kruger said he has been
impressed by Johnson's ball-handling abilities, his athleticism and
his shooting range. With a little time and a lot of effort, Johnson
can succeed in the league, Kruger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all relates to investing time and effort every day,'' the
coach said. ``Realizing that it's a process. It's not going to
happen this week. It's a combination of working extremely hard and
being patient and just staying after it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he will work hard and plans to show the team how
grateful he is to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that this team needed scorer and a shooter,'' he said.
``And I still think I can provide that for them once I get more
comfortable.''

TOXIC WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest twist in the US government's wrongheaded effort to
wage its war on US drug abuse in Colombia _ at the expense of detox
and rehab units here _ is a plan to sic a deadly fungus on the coca
plants and poppies that are the raw material for cocaine and
heroin. This would be on top of the $1.3 billion for antidrug
helicopters and training that Congress just agreed to provide to
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The basic flaw in this strategy is that, regardless of what is
done on hillsides in South America, drugs will flow into the United
States from some corner of the globe as long as there is a strong
market for them here. A more promising approach would focus on the
prevention and treatment of drug addiction in this country. The
$1.3 billion that Washington is shipping south, which is almost
twice the annual budget of the research-oriented National Institute
of Drug Abuse, would cover a year's treatment and rehabilitation
costs for 1.7 million substance abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are so concerned about the impact that the
coca fungus, Fusarium oxysporum, might have on an area's ecosystem
that they blocked testing of a similar fungus on marijuana fields
in Florida. Colombia has its own doubts. Its environmental
minister, Juan Mayr, has insisted that tests of the fungus would
have to be conducted outside his country, so worried is he about
the agent's ``grave risks to the environment and human health.''
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times report on this plan last week, scientists
also raised questions about the effectiveness of the herbicide
strategy. They point to the difficulty of getting a fungus like
this to have a major impact on a crop and to the likelihood that
the coca growers would counter with a fungicide or switch to a coca
variety that is fungus resistant. Inevitably, Fusarium oxysporum
will invite comparison with the far more toxic Agent Orange
herbicides used in Vietnam by US leaders pursuing another
scorched-earth solution.
</P>
<P>
   The abuse of drugs, from alcohol to Ecstasy to heroin, is a
terrible problem in this country. But it is a problem that
families, schools, churches, and treatment programs are much more
capable of addressing than Black Hawk and Huey helicopters _ or
fungi.

AIDS DOCTORS DEMAND S. AFRICA PROVIDE ANTI-HIV DRUGS TO PREGNANT
WOMEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: Friday in 7th graf refers to July 7.) 
 
By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ For the fourth straight day, researchers
in South Africa on Wednesday demanded the government immediately
begin providing drugs to HIV-positive pregnant women to prevent
thousands of new infections in babies every year.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been the overriding, controversial theme of this
week's contentious 13th International AIDS Conference. New data
reported at the meeting underscored the promise of the prevention
strategy, as well as obstacles to providing it, and fueled
conviction that the country's president must implement a national
program for distributing the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most practical and feasible option for the majority
of women in the world today,'' said Dr. Chewe Luo, in her address
to the delegates Wednesday morning. She said the current rate of
1,800 HIV-infected children born each day worldwide ``is
unacceptable, knowing we have an intervention to reduce this
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Without preventive treatment, there is a 25 percent to 30
percent chance that a woman with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS,
will infect her newborn, either during pregnancy, delivery or
through breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   A three-part AZT drug regimen can decrease the rate of perinatal
transmission by approximately two-thirds. But the regimen costs
$800 to $1,000, putting it out of reach for poor nations. Two years
ago, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta found that a shorter _ and cheaper _ course of AZT was
also effective, reducing the rate of transmission by 50 percent at
a cost of about $80.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a simpler and even less expensive regimen _ a single
dose of nevirapine for both mother and baby _ was shown to cut the
baby's risk of infection by 47 percent. This anti-AIDS drug, which
can be stored at room temperature and costs just $4 per
mother-child pair, holds tantalizing possibilities for countries
such as South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the German drug manufacturer Boehringer Ingelheim
announced that it is offering nevirapine free to developing
nations. So far, the South African government has not accepted the
offer. Pretoria's hesitation has fed a furor that began late last
year when President Thabo Mbeki voiced an interest in the ideas of
scientists who deny that HIV is the cause of AIDS. He has also
alarmed doctors by calling AZT a toxic drug, refusing to provide it
to pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   This week, findings from an ongoing study in Soweto, South
Africa, involving 1,212 mothers taking AZT or nevirapine, showed
that both regimens are similar and safe.
</P>
<P>
   Questions, however, have been raised in a Ugandan study about a
small percentage of mothers becoming resistant to treatment with
nevirapine and the drug not working in subsequent pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   The South African Department of Health released a statement
Wednesday that it is encouraged by the benefits nevirapine seems to
offer, particularly because of the relative ease of administering
the drug. But officials noted ``more work is needed to confirm
safety and efficacy. That is particularly so in regard to the
development of resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The department repeated its intention to meet soon after the
conference to review the data and the implications for public
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the three-part AZT regimen has reduced the
rate of mother-to-child transmission of the AIDS virus to less than
2 percent in cities such as Houston. More healthy HIV-positive
couples are taking combination drug therapy and are conceiving and
delivering HIV-negative children.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the world, mostly in poor countries, half a million
babies are born with HIV each year. In South Africa, where millions
face death because AIDS treatment isn't available, many believe
preventing maternal transmission represents the best hope to slow
the disease's progress. A study published last month in The Lancet
suggested that if all pregnant women in South Africa took a short
course of antiretroviral medication during labor, as many as
110,000 infant HIV infections could be prevented over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Soweto study's lead author, Dr. James McIntyre, said he is
hopeful that Mbeki will give the green light to a national
nevirapine program. ``The health department can't move until they
have that data,'' McIntyre said. ``We have to make sure they have
the information they need.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre is director of the perinatal and HIV research unit at
Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, one of the largest in the southern
hemisphere. The hospital tests 8,000 women for HIV annually;
one-fourth of them are positive.
</P>
<P>
   His team is now moving into a large-scale pilot project with the
government's blessing. The program aims to enroll 6,000 women in
Soweto, and 4,000 more in other provinces over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   A huge hurdle remains even if the drug becomes widely available:
HIV transmission by breast-feeding. Of all babies infected by their
mothers, one-third acquire the virus through breast-feeding.
Despite the risk, breast-feeding in Africa is an economic,
religious and cultural necessity for many women. In some areas,
women who formula feed are stigmatized as having HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Even when formula is acceptable, lack of clean water to mix it
with can lead to fatal diarrhea for babies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the dangers posed by formula-feeding, scientists have
hoped that the drugs used to prevent maternal transmission might
have a lasting protective effect, allowing babies to nurse but not
entirely reversing the gains from anti-HIV drugs.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ George W. Bush campaign strategists are
convinced their guy is right on the issues, but, in a message
pushed Wednesday at a meeting of GOP leaders in Austin, they
believe that image and feel will put him in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush team is crafting a campaign reflecting months of polls
showing Democrat Al Gore running ahead of Bush issue by issue, but
Bush leading on the all-important leadership question.
</P>
<P>
   Don Evans, the campaign's general chairman, wasted no time in
hitting that note in his introduction of Bush at the Wednesday
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message I've heard all across America this last 14 or 15
months is, `We are ready for new leadership. We are ready for a
leader of total integrity,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has spent the past few months offering positions and
policies on a wide variety of issues, also talked about an
electorate looking for something less tangible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can feel it when I go to your states. I can see it in
people's eyes. I feel it on the rope lines,'' he said. ``People of
this country want something different and this campaign is going to
give it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it's working, and ``I feel great about our chances in
every state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a hard, close campaign. The good news is
I'm leading some of the polls. The bad news is the election isn't
tomorrow,'' he said. ``So we've got a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's event was organized by Victory 2000, an arm of the
Republican National Committee. Bush offered the opening remarks
before the GOP leaders went behind closed doors for an afternoon of
briefings from campaign officials. The day ended with an evening
reception at the Hyatt's 16th-floor ``Presidential Suite.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, Bush met for an hour at the Governor's Mansion
with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who said the two
men share ``comparable views'' on foreign policy topics.
</P>
<P>
   Both men declined to comment on the ongoing Middle East peace
talks orchestrated by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important time and it's important for Republicans
to wish the administration well,'' said Bush. ``There would be
nothing better than a lasting peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Between sessions at the political gathering at the Hyatt
Regency, strategist Karl Rove said the campaign is ready to
capitalize on the Bush image as a ``a strong leader and somebody
who is straightforward, somebody who is plain spoken, somebody who
is approachable and likeable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And Gore comes across as somebody who, as the governor said,
reinvents himself every week. And after awhile that sort of wears
on people,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush frequently works to portray Gore as a standard-issue
politician who will ``say anything to get elected.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of reinventing government, Vice President Gore
continues to reinvent himself right in the middle of a campaign,''
Bush said Wednesday, branding Gore as ``more of the same . . . The
same old sequel to a tired period of time, four more years of a
president at war with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove said the campaign plans to showcase the differences with
events tailored to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned,'' said Rove, hinting at ``open, free formats where
people get a chance to get a real sense of who he is in sort of an
unscripted environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove, tuned into the feel of campaign events, said a Tuesday
appearance in Detroit highlighted Bush's strengths. The policy du
jour was a $2.3 billion, five-year plan to improve child welfare
services and adoption procedures.
</P>
<P>
   But a day later, Rove said the high point of the event was feel,
not substance. He recalled how Darryl McGee, a 19-year-old former
client of the foster care facility that hosted the event, talked
about how Bush helped him feel calm enough to discuss very personal
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most compelling thing that came out of the adoption thing
was not so much what the governor said, but the kid who said, `I'm
really nervous, but the governor sort of helped me feel like I
could talk about it,''' said Rove.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to confidence in their candidate's leadership
quotient, Bush aides are buoyed by polls showing him making
progress on issues long controlled by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are anywhere from a dozen to two dozen or better points
ahead of where a Republican should be on some of these traditional
issues like health care, education and Social Security,'' said
Rove. ``On some of them we have not only closed the gap but we also
have moved ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas businessman Fred Meyer, chairman of Victory 2000, said
Bush reminds him of Ronald Reagan, another Republican who rode
perceived leadership skills _ not a set of stands on issues _ to
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George W. has got the right position on the issues
that are important to the voters, big time,'' said Meyer. ``But
most important of all is leadership.''

RENO ASSURES FAMILY THAT YOUTH'S HANGING IS BEING INVESTIGATED 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Attorney General Janet Reno and other top Justice
Department officials assured the Rev. Jesse Jackson at a 90-minute
meeting in Washington on Wednesday that the department was actively
investigating the hanging of a black youth in his front yard in
Kokomo, Miss., a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy concluded that the death of the youth, Raynard
Johnson, 17, was suicide. But his family and Jackson say they are
convinced that he was lynched because of his relationships with
white girls.
</P>
<P>
   State, local and federal officials, under persistent pressure
from Jackson, have been investigating the June 16 death despite the
preliminary finding of suicide by a state medical examiner. The
autopsy found no cuts, scratches, bruises, wounds or other signs
that Johnson had either been hanged by assailants or killed first
and then strung up from the pecan tree where his body was found.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brad Pigott, the U.S. Attorney in Jackson, Miss., said
Wednesday that investigators have interviewed more than 40 people.
``We're determined to keep interviewing people in an attempt to get
to the bottom of the true facts of the hanging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pigott would not comment on the direction of the investigation.
But Lisa S. Mader, the director of communications for Gov. Ronnie
Musgrove of Mississippi, said Wednesday that the state's public
safety commissioner, David Huggins, had briefed the governor
recently that ``all indications are still pointing to a suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder
characterized Wednesday's session with Jackson and Johnson's mother
and brother as ``an informative meeting about a very tragic
incident.'' He said he explained that the FBI and other agencies
were ``actively investigating'' the death.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said it was ``a step in the right direction'' that the
Justice Department ``has kept an open mind regarding the cause of
Raynard Johnson's death.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson and the Johnson family have raised questions about
the hanging, they have yet to release any evidence that it was a
homicide. But that has not kept Jackson from describing the hanging
as a lynching and from comparing it repeatedly to the murder of
Emmett Till, a black teen-ager who was brutally killed in
Mississippi in 1955, apparently after whistling at a white woman.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has relied heavily on the haunting nature of
Mississippi's past in support of his assumption that Johnson was
killed. ``In the state of Mississippi, there has been a
perpetuation of lynching,'' Jackson said in a statement released
Wednesday by his civil rights group, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition.
``Mississippi has looked the other way and allowed some of its
citizens to carry out an extermination plan for African-American
males.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has tried to draw attention to the case in the last
three weeks through news conferences, faxed statements and
conference calls with reporters. He has visited the scene of the
hanging three times and has staged meetings in Jackson with
Musgrove and with black lawmakers. Last weekend, he led a two-day
march in the area and brought along Emmett Till's mother, Mamie
Till-Mobley, to help make his point.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and the Johnsons say they are convinced that Raynard did
not commit suicide because, they say, he was a carefree, optimistic
young man who did well in school, made friends easily, recently
purchased a computer and was planning to attend college. Family
members have said they do not believe that the brown, braided belt
used in the hanging was his.
</P>
<P>
   They also have raised questions about mysterious cars and
barking dogs in the neighborhood on the two nights before the
hanging.

 &HT;    Motorola reports solid sales and earnings growth
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Motorola Inc. delivered solid sales and earnings
growth Wednesday, reporting record sales of $9.26 billion, up 22
percent, and record earnings before special items.
</P>
<P>
   The Schaumburg, Ill.-based communications equipment company
reported stronger sales across a broad range of products including
networking equipment, Internet access devices and semiconductors.
Excluding special reserves for restructuring, Motorola reported
earnings of $515 million, or 23 cents a share, from ongoing
operations, before adjustments, up 91 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   After reserves were taken, net earnings were considerably less
-- $204 million, or 9 cents a share, but analysts said the
company's performance was in line with their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall it looked pretty good,'' said analyst Greg Teets with
A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis, ``but I didn't see anything that
was really outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's results were released after the close of the market,
in which its stock closed up $2.69 a share to close at $36.25 a
share in New York Stock Exchange trading. Internet and
computer-related stocks helped the Nasdaq composite index gain
143.17 points, or 3.62 percent, to close at 4,099.59 -- its best
finish since April 10. Analysts said there is fading concern about
higher interest rates and better-than-expected earnings from Yahoo
Inc., an Internet bellwether.
</P>
<P>
   At Motorola, chief executive Christopher Galvin said his company
continues its recovery from a deep business slump in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our eighth consecutive quarter of delivering on our
promises to achieve a significant turnaround, improved
profitability and a strategic refocusing of Motorola around
wireless, broadband access and the Internet,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Austin-based semiconductor business, showed
continued improvement as it recovers from a severe slump in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Chip sales totaled $2 billion in the quarter, up 27 percent from
a year ago, and new orders rose 31 percent to $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits rose to $166 million compared with $24 million
a year ago. Sales were up significantly in semiconductors for the
networking, computing, wireless, imaging and entertainment, and
transportation markets.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola employs about 10,000 workers in Austin who design,
manufacture and sell many of the company's most advanced chips.
</P>
<P>
   In other product areas, Motorola reported sales of wireless
phones rose 20 percent to $3.3 billion and operating profits were
$132 million, up from $125 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of networking equipment grew 23 percent to $2.0 billion
and operating profits were $256 million, up 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband communications equipment sales totaled $768 million
and operating profits totaled $215 million.

WEB FIRM HAS PLAN TO BUILD COLLEGE SAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A Massachusetts dot-com Wednesday unveiled plans to
turn Americans' lust for spending into a productive pastime.
</P>
<P>
   UPromise Inc., backed by some big names and even bigger money,
aims to create a network of companies that give rebates in the form
of college savings plan contributions. President Jeff Bussgang said
the system would be in place this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding money for college is one of the biggest problems
families face these days,'' Bussgang said. ``Our goal is to help
solve that problem, taking advantage of the fact that companies are
desperate for programs that will create customer loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   UPromise is like a frequent-flier program, with a scholastic
twist. People who sign up and then buy products from participating
companies can have up to 5 percent of their purchases invested in
the tax-free college fund of their favorite prospective student.
</P>
<P>
   A family with a typical income and spending pattern could expect
to save $50,000 over 15 years in the plan, Bussgang said. That
would cover more than half of the expected tab for four years of
tuition, room and board at a public university, starting in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Families could save even more if they convince friends and
relatives to join UPromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' said Joseph Hurley, a certified
public accountant in Pittsford, N.Y., and author of ``The Best Way
to Save for College.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody is prepared to jump on the UPromise bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Davis, senior associate editor at Kiplinger's Personal
Finance Magazine and author of ``Financing College,'' said she's
skeptical the program will make much of a difference for most
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're already in one of these savings plans, I suppose it
couldn't hurt to join,'' Davis said of UPromise. ``But it strikes
me that it would be awfully foolish to base all of your college
plans on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bussgang said UPromise isn't designed to replace other forms of
college savings, but to supplement them _ to the tune of $50
billion in additional projected savings in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   At least a handful of high-profile venture capitalists are
convinced. Greylock Management of Boston and General Atlantic
Partners of New York were among the firms that pledged $34 million
in first-round
</P>
<P>
   financing for UPromise.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schulman, chief executive of Priceline.com, is on the board.
Outside advisors include Kim Clark, dean of the Harvard Business
School; George Fisher, chairman of Eastman Kodak; Nick Nicholas
Jr., former chief executive of Time Warner; and, John Whitehead,
former chairman of both Goldman Sachs and the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a phenomenal group of people,'' Bussgang said.
</P>
<P>
   UPromise founder and chief executive Michael Bronner is
responsible for bringing most of those people on board. At his
previous company, Boston-based Digitas Inc., Bronner headed
direct-marketing campaigns for AT&AMP;T and American Express, among
others, and built a name for himself as a marketing whiz.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner, who had a family emergency and wasn't available for
comment Wednesday, sold half of his stake in Digitas for $123
million. He still owns shares of stock worth another $131 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bussgang would not disclose the names of potential corporate
partners Wednesday, but said UPromise would do so ``closer to the
launch date this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say, though, that companies in the network will have to
agree to donate a portion of customers' payments to a UPromise
scholarship fund for low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   Both he and Bronner have promised to donate half of their
personal stakes in the company to the fund, as have the venture
capital investors.

COMMENTARY: FREEZE-OUT AT POLICE PLAZA 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here's the thing you need to know about Sandra Marsh,
who is 57 years old and a lawyer: She did nothing wrong. Absolutely
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Howard Safir and his boys ruthlessly destroyed her
career and forced her out of the Police Department, where she had
spent 13 years doing work that was valuable and that she loved.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh was the deputy commissioner responsible for handling
complaints of employment harassment when she left the department in
1998. She had served with distinction under five police
commissioners. She was the department's highest-ranking black
official, and the only black deputy commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Former Police Commissioner William Bratton, in a telephone
conversation Wednesday, said: ``I thought a lot of her and the
staff she had there. She had an extraordinarily difficult
assignment, and my experience with her was excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh's problems started with a particularly bitter sexual
harassment case that erupted in Staten Island in 1997. There were
complaints that female police officers had been harassed, that they
had been punished for filing complaints, and that retaliatory
action had been taken against other officers who offered support
for the original complainants.
</P>
<P>
   The case was investigated by Marsh and her staff. She said in
her report that she had been unable to substantiate the sexual
harassment claims. But she also found that the case had been
improperly handled, and that top officials in the department had
indeed engaged in retaliation, and had tried to impede her
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report specifically criticized Assistant Chief Eugene
Devlin, the Staten Island police commander, and his second in
command, Deputy Chief Phil Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh's career was not doomed at that point. She was on shaky
ground, but her boss, Safir, gave her an opportunity to recover.
All she had to do was revise her findings. In short, take the heat
off the chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Devlin and Phil Erickson were big shots in the
department, fair-haired boys with powerful connections and thus
big-time clout. They didn't outrank Marsh, who reported directly to
Safir, but they might as well have. Their toes were not to be
stepped on.
</P>
<P>
   Safir ordered the case reinvestigated, and it was made clear
that a different result was desired.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh did reinvestigate the case. But the only way she could
have saved herself was to betray herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went back and honestly re-evaluated the case,'' said her
lawyer, Richard Emery. ``And she came up with the same results. And
then they crushed her.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh and her top aide, a police captain, had to give an oral
report of the results of the second investigation. In an interview
this week, Marsh said, ``We mistakenly thought that once they saw
the evidence, and once they understood how we reached this
decision, that they would understand and all of this would go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   She was so wrong. Safir, furious, stopped meeting with her and
stopped talking to her. He ordered the investigation done yet
again, but not by Marsh. That investigation dutifully cleared Chief
Devlin and Chief Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh's top aide was transferred to a post in Queens, working
nights. A new aide was imposed on Marsh, and he began running _ and
even remodeling _ her office.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh's career was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was still the deputy commissioner,'' she said, ``but I
wasn't being consulted about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She left the department in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Her case was taken up by Emery, an old friend who founded the
law firm Emery Cuti Brinckerhoff &AMP; Abady as a vehicle to _ among
other things _ curb the abuse of governmental power. This case, so
clearly outrageous, was a natural.
</P>
<P>
   They sued. And they won.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago the city agreed to pay Marsh $1 million to settle
the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The money will not resurrect her ruined career in the Police
Department, or undo the hurt, the sadness or the emotional
devastation that resulted from the cruel and unconscionable way she
was treated.
</P>
<P>
   But the white flag of a settlement was a signal, in some sense,
that what happened to Sandra Marsh was indefensible. That it was
wrong.

EXPERT WARNS OF OVERESTIMATING VALUE OF GENOME RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Promises of a medical revolution in which common diseases will
be predicted _ and even prevented _ through gene tests are largely
``geno-hype,'' contends a Johns Hopkins University expert, arguing
that scientists have oversold the likely health value of decoding
the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   As for biotech companies investing millions in search of genetic
differences linked to major diseases, ``I think they are barking up
the wrong tree,'' said Dr. Neil A. Holtzman, a pediatrician and
medical policy specialist, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzman, lead author of an opinion piece in the current issue
of the New England Journal of Medicine, said he was reacting to
grandiose claims made by scientists and officials involved in
sequencing, or identifying, the human genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. publicly-funded project and Celera Genomics Inc. last
month announced they had identified and catalogued most of the set
of human genes. In addition to learning how genes work in the body,
many scientists said the genome decoding would bring about a
``revolution in medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The new genetics will not revolutionize the way in which
common diseases are identified or prevented,'' said Holtzman in the
article, co-authored by Theresa M. Marteau, a psychologist at
King's College in London. Holtzman chaired a task force on genetic
testing for the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   But other scientists were quick to say they thought Holtzman has
missed the major point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Holtzman means there are many overly simplistic notions
about how genetics will be implemented in medicine, he's right,''
said Eric Lander, director of MIT-Whitehead Institute genome
sequencing center in Cambridge. ``But if he thinks that
understanding the genetic basis of disease wont' revolutionize
medicine, he's simply wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors directed most of their criticism not at what would
be learned from the human genome, but at the idea that predictive
testing will be feasible and widely used. They said scientists have
spent years looking for genes that strongly influence whether or
not a person would get such illnesses as schizophrenia, manic
depression and asthma, but with little success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people will have little interest in learning their
genotype (individual pattern of genetic variations),'' especially
if the gene tests don't have great predictive power and there
aren't effective methods of preventing the diseases, said the
authors.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be possible to find variations between peoples' DNA
that match their susceptibility to diseases, Holtzman says the
links generally won't be strong enough to be useful in predicting
diseases caused by many gene and environmental factors as well. Or,
if there is a strong effect _ like the BRCA1 and 2 genes causing a
markedly increased risk of breast cancer _ such genes are likely to
be found only in a small percentage of individuals with the
disease. Only one-quarter of one percent of women carry those
genes, said Holtzman.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzman said another hoped-for outcome of the genome project _
finding genetic variations in inviduals' DNE that predicts whether
they will react well or badly to certain drugs _ is potentially
achievable.
</P>
<P>
   But he termed ``not very realistic'' often-cited scenarios in
which infants in the future could have their entire set of genes
tested to determine what diseases they would be susceptible _ and
even at what age they would die.
</P>
<P>
   Yet prominent scientists, as well as startup biotech company
officials, have conjured such visions in the euphoria over the
near-completion of decoding the human genome, said Holtzman and
Marteau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the head of the Wellcome Trust (a London health
philanthropy) saying this was the greatest thing since the
invention of the wheel,'' said Marteau in an telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Dr. Francis Collins, head of the publicly
funded genome project, has said that reading out all the genetic
scripts in our cells will ``change the way medicine is practiced''
and ``could bring new treatments for every single disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene scientists and biotech firm officials agreed that the
genome project has been hyped _ and they blamed the media as well
as scientists and government officials _ but they said Holtzman's
arguments were flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rothberg, chairman and CEO of CuraGen Corp. of New
Haven, Conn., said that even if genome information doesn't lead to
powerful predictive tests, it is already making it possible to
develop better drugs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, discovering the underlying genetic problem
in children with a rare form of high cholesterol has led to
cholesterol-lowering drugs like Lipitor that are helpful to
millions of people with more-common (but less severe) cholesterol
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Gutmacher, senior clinical advisor to Collins, the genome
project director, agreed with Holtzman about ``geno-hype,'' but
added, ``it's a very tough thing to try to remove the hyperbole
while still including the real wonder and the awesome power'' of
sequencing the genome.

KILLEEN SURFACES AT N.Y. MARKETING FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Web maven Stephen Killeen was in the news he was
talking layoffs. Now he's telling a new dot-com story.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief of stock chat site RagingBull.com has been
named president at Marketing Services Group Inc., a New York
marketing company that, like his last employer, counts CMGI Inc. as
a big investor.
</P>
<P>
   At Marketing Services, 13-year-old publicly traded company,
Killeen will oversee acquisitions and the Internet side of the
business. The company counts among its clients Walt Disney Co.,
Citigroup, and most Broadway theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Said Marketing Services chief Jeremy Barbera, ``I'm a firm
believer that old-world marketing and new-world marketing are the
same thing. They just use different mediums.''
</P>
<P>
   Killeen, 38, always seems to land on his feet. He made his name
at the online trading company that's now DLJ Direct and then helped
Fidelity Investments get serious about online stock trading. It was
a stunner when he left the mutual fund giant two years ago, as the
dot-com craze was heating up and day trading became a national
hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Killeen and his colleagues sold Raging Bull to
AltaVista for an undisclosed sum. Killeen was offered a big job at
AltaVista but declined, because his family didn't want to move to
California. So he took his options and stayed on for six months to
help with the transition.
</P>
<P>
   Then came April's market crash, when lots of Web companies got
more cost-conscious, including AltaVista and other CMGI companies.
In May, Killeen had to fire 50 people and scrap a fledgling news
operation he was trying to launch at Raging Bull.
</P>
<P>
   Killeen rejects any notion that the business is troubled,
however. ``Raging Bull is doing very well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under his watch, monthly unique page visits to the Raging Bull
site jumped to 350 million from 4 million and membership eclipsed
500,000. He said the company, which makes money on advertising and
partnerships, was profitable in March and April. Alan Alper, an
analyst with Gomez Advisors, said that as stock chat sites go,
Raging Bull is seen among the success stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the right name. They came out at the right time,''
Alper said. Raging Bull also brings half a million users to
AltaVista, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   As for Killeen's new gig, he's not exactly dealing in a hot
stock. Marketing Services' shares have plummeted 73 percent this
year, based in part on losses in its Internet unit, and now trade
below $5.

 &HT;    IMPROPERLY LICENSED DRIVERS INVOLVED IN MANY FATAL ACCIDENTS
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Up to one in five fatal car accidents involves an
improperly licensed driver, according to a study issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that 20
percent of all fatal car accidents involved drivers whose license
was invalid or nonexistent, or whose license status was unknown.
Many of the drivers of unknown status are believed to lack valid
licenses, foundation officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1993 to 1997, more than 42,000 people have been killed by
drivers who were suspended, unlicensed or unknown,'' said David
Willis, president of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was performed for the foundation by Dr. Lindsay
Griffin of the Texas Transportation Institute, examined five years
of car accident data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's
fatality analysis reporting system and identified each driver's
license status at the time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers studied 278,078 drivers involved in 183,749
fatal crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Of these drivers, 3.7 percent were unlicensed, 7.4 had an
license that had been suspended, revoked or was otherwise invalid,
and 2.7 were of unknown license status. These drivers were involved
in 20 percent of the fatal crashes over the five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only were these people driving with suspended licenses,
but 28 percent of these people had their licenses suspended or
revoked three or more times in the three years prior to their
crashes,'' Griffin said. ``These are not just ordinary people who
forgot to renew their licenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin cited a University of Michigan study that found that 30
to 70 percent of drivers who had their license suspended or revoked
continued to drive afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a revolving door,'' Griffin said. ``In the study,
drivers with invalid licenses were far more likely to have been
convicted of drunk driving, been involved in a hit and run, or have
had multiple suspensions prior to their crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of driver operating with invalid licenses varied
widely from state to state. Maine had the lowest incidence of
drivers with invalid licenses who were involved in fatal crashes,
6.9 percent, while New Mexico had the highest, 23.9 percent, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   Willis suggested several policies that would help prevent
drivers with suspended or revoked licenses from driving their cars.
</P>
<P>
   He said one approach is vehicle immobilization or impoundment
for drivers who have their licenses suspended. Another promising
solution is an electronic ``smart-card'' driver's license without
which a car cannot be started, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the introduction of this study will alert people to
the huge scope of this problem, and start the ball rolling on a
solution,'' Willis said. ``Suspended and unlicensed drivers are a
menace to society, and they need to be prevented from driving.''

RESENDDING TO CORRECT SURNAME 
SUDDEN FAME LEAVES NICKELODEON STAR GRATEFUL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lindsay Felton is an upbeat teen-ager who talks quickly and
easily about her acting career and her plans for college and
beyond, speaking in sentences of a dozen independent clauses strung
together and sprinkling the conversation with girlish laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Caitlin Seegar, the sullen, streetwise girl she
plays on Nickelodeon's landmark drama series, ``Caitlin's Way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it to you?'' Caitlin probably would snarl at a
reporter's questions. ``And tell that guy to get his camera out of
my face!''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a difference between the 15-year-old actress and her role.
Since she broke into series television at age 8 as Ed Asner's
granddaughter and Haley Joel Osment's sister on the sitcom
``Thunder Alley,'' Felton has been told by directors and
photographers, ``Smile, Lindsay!'' or more often, ``Great smile,
Lindsay!''
</P>
<P>
   Now she's playing a troubled teen-ager, an orphan from the
foster care system of Philadelphia who, after one too many brushes
with the law, was ordered by a judge to choose between juvenile
hall and moving to Montana to live on a ranch with her mother's
long-lost cousin, Dori Lowe, and her family. She chose Montana,
seeing it as just barely the lesser of two evils.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin is given to scowling and often confrontational, the kind
of kid who feels she probably isn't entitled to real happiness and,
if she senses it approaching, treats it with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Felton, who lives in Burbank, says she's put a bit of herself
into the Caitlin character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come out sometimes more than others, but I think there is
more than people realize, because I have to invest a lot to play
the character,'' Felton said. ``In some ways I'd like to be a
little bit more like Caitlin, and in some ways I would like Caitlin
to be a little more like me. We're both kind of rebellious, but she
just takes it to the extreme, whereas I am a little bit more mellow
about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   An illustration: Beside Lindsay's bedroom doorway is a small
piece of paper posted at eye level that reads, ``Do one thing every
day that scares you.'' Lindsay probably finds inspiration in it but
does not always comply. Caitlin, on the other hand, doesn't need
!ital!that kind of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   The job, if not the role, has Lindsay leading a double life
these days. From December through early June, she lives in Burbank
with her parents, two cats and a squawky bird, working on
home-schooling assignments and spending her free time in movie
theaters, in front of a computer or hanging with a close circle of
friends, most of them students at John Burroughs High School. She
swoons over the boy bands Hanson and the Moffatts, both of whom are
enshrined in her room amid a few stuffed animals, collectible
Barbies and books ranging from the gory thriller ``Hannibal'' to a
two-volume set of Shakespeare's plays.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by mid-June, she's off with her mother, Deborah Felton,
for a six- month stint in rugged, remote Alberta, Canada, where all
of the next season's 26 episodes are being shot. There she works
odd hours around the fickle weather to complete a half-hour episode
in four days' time, crams in three hours of schooling each weekday
with a tutor and, for amusement, passes time with her co-stars and
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't hear her complain about the lifestyle, not much
anyway. It's tiring and stressful, she admits, juggling the job and
schoolwork and being away from her Burbank friends for such a long
time. ``But the good definitely, definitely outweighs the bad, and
if it didn't, I wouldn't be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Felton very nearly missed out on this role of her lifetime _ not
because she was the wrong type, nor because she was one of hundreds
of girls trying out for it.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Tom Lynch, who also has made ``The Journey of
Allen Strange,'' ``The Secret World of Alex Mack'' and ``100 Deeds
for Eddie McDowd'' for Nickelodeon, says the lead character in this
pet project of his was meant to be a boy. The role still was
considered a male part just three days before the pilot was to
begin filming in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsay came in to read for the Griffen part,'' Lynch said,
referring to Dori and Jim Lowe's teen-ager, created as a girl but
ultimately cast with Santa Clarita resident Jeremy Foley. ``And I
said, `Give her the male lead (script), and she read it and she
nailed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said even with his proven track record with the top-rated
cable network, selling Nickelodeon on a series for 8- to
14-year-olds centered on a dark anti-hero was tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I wanted to do the first teen drama,'' Lynch said.
``And they said, 'Tommy, Tommy, do that funny stuff you do.' And I
said, 'It's important to me to do this show. I'm just coming to you
guys first.' So they said, 'Write the script,' and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said there was a lot of discussion with Nickelodeon's
executives on keeping the show true to his concept yet suitable to
Nick's family- friendly mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue always was how dramatic we can make it, how far can
we take it without alienating the Nickelodeon audience,'' Lynch
said. ``And we were both willing to challenge the audience and push
it further. But there are things we won't do. For instance, Caitlin
will never have sex, because your 6-year-old daughter may be
watching and I can't handle that responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, father of five kids ages 12-19, and the other ``Caitlin's
Way'' writers so far have succeeded in keeping the teen-agers'
dialogue and situations credible without straying into territory
that raises parents' eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nickelodeon's done a good job of making a rebel that
anyone literally can watch and parents don't have to restrict their
child from watching,'' Felton said. ``(Language is) one thing that
Nickelodeon totally draws the line on. We couldn't say 'snot' in
one of the episodes. They really definitely are very clean in what
they write.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon's gamble with teen drama and Lynch's execution of it
have paid off. ``Caitlin's Way'' attracted 6.5 million viewers for
its premiere episode last March, a record for any Nickelodeon
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining new episodes from the first season air beginning
July 23. Lynch says he has ``Caitlin's Way'' mapped out for 100
episodes or four full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months after the premiere, the series has raised
Lindsay's profile a bit, to the point where she occasionally gets
recognized in public, if not exactly mobbed. It could be a good
springboard toward her aspirations of studying at Yale or New York
University's Tisch film school, scoring a role or two in good
independent films, and ultimately hitting a Broadway stage.
</P>
<P>
   Her acting coach, Andrew Magarian of The Shop in North
Hollywood, said, ``She's a good actress, and it's within who she
is. I like her potential a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, reflecting on the happy, well-adjusted girl he found to
play the brooding one he created, sounds like a beaming father.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a major star,'' he said. ``It sounds like a cliche
in the business, but she can really hold the camera. I don't mind
writing a three- page scene for her because I know she can handle
it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    AirTran shows 51 percent increase in profits despite rise in
fuel costs
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - AirTran Airways' second-quarter profit rose 51 percent
from a year earlier despite an even sharper rise in fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran, Atlanta's second-largest carrier, posted a $22.6
million profit, or 33 cents a share, vs. a prior-year profit of $15
million, or 22 cents a share. The result surpassed analysts'
forecasts of 29 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Chairman Joseph Leonard noted the quarterly profit was
the sixth in a row for AirTran, which had previously struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to see steady growth in both the business and
leisure markets,'' Leonard said. He said both ridership and
revenue-per-passenger are increasing. AirTran ridership jumped 13
percent in the quarter on a 5 percent rise in seat capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue was $160.8 million, up from $140 million from the second
quarter last year. Unit costs rose almost 4 percent, but the
increase was due to a 72 percent jump in the price of fuel, Leonard
said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran plans to boost seat capacity 12 percent in the second
half of this year and 15 percent next year. It will do so mainly by
slowing the retirement of older DC-9s while taking delivery of new
Boeing 717s that are slightly larger.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the capacity growth will go to additional flights on
existing routes, but an undisclosed destination will be added this
fall, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Leonard conceded that the
strong second-quarter financial results were offset by service
problems associated with a restructured schedule at the carrier's
Atlanta hub.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran a very good airline up through April, and then with the
new schedule we really fell off the cliff,'' he said. ``It took us
about six weeks to figure out how to run the thing. But in July
we've run the best airline since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTran recently replaced its top customer service executive and
added curbside check-in service to reduce logjams at ticket
counters.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier faces an April 2001 deadline to restructure about
$234 million in debt _ the top financial challenge facing the
company. President Robert Fornaro told analysts the carrier is ``in
active discussions with several lenders.''
</P>
<P>
   He also disclosed that AirTran is switching to the Amex stock
exchange because it did not meet Nasdaq financial requirements at
the end of last year. The airline unsuccessfully sought a waiver.
AirTran stock will trade on the Amex starting Friday, under the
symbol AAI.

AILING RITE AID SELLS PHARMACY UNIT FOR $1 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The troubled Rite Aid Corp. announced the sale of its PCS
pharmacy benefit subsidiary Wednesday for about one-third less than
the company paid for it only two years ago. The move came a day
after Rite Aid disclosed that its profits for 1998 and 1999 had
been overstated by more than $1 billion and that it had lost $1.1
billion in the fiscal year ended Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid, the drugstore chain that grew rapidly through
acquisitions under Martin Grass, its former chief executive,
acknowledged that it had overstated profits in numerous ways. It
said it was cooperating with investigations by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   PCS was sold to Advance Paradigm Inc., a competitor, for $1
billion: $675 million in cash, $200 million in a note and $125
million in stock, which will give Rite Aid a 14 percent stake in
the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sale of PCS was viewed in a positive light, Wall
Street was surprised by the magnitude of the earnings restatement.
Shares of Rite Aid fell 62.5 cents, to $6, in New York Stock
Exchange trading Wednesday. Advance Paradigm fell $1.50, to
$21.0625, in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Miller, a former Kroger Co. executive who was brought
in as Rite Aid's chief executive in late December, was upbeat in an
interview Wednesday. ``We're going to work this out,'' he said.
``We're going to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller, whose hiring caused Rite Aid shares to leap 41
percent, to $11.625, in one day, said he had no idea then just how
bad the situation was. Had he known, he said, ``I would not be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am here,'' he went on. ``I'm absolutely committed and am
sure we can make this a viable company.''
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid remains saddled with large debts taken on during an
expansion binge in which the company bought six chains of
pharmacies with a total of 1,409 stores while opening 376 new and
727 relocated stores. The restated financial results make it clear
that the company was never as profitable as it said it was, and
some on Wall Street remain dubious. Rite Aid shares peaked at
$51.125 early last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has managed to reorganize its debts so that none
come due until August 2002, and Miller said that if the company was
able to do as well as it expects to do in the next two years,
``this company is very refinanceable.''
</P>
<P>
   But he shied away from predicting when it would return to
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   The company said same-store sales, which exclude sales from new
or closed stores, were rising sharply. The company has cut prices
on many items to try to overcome its reputation for high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid's restatement of earnings began last year, after the
company's auditors at KPMG voiced complaints and later resigned,
saying they had no faith in the management. Grass was later forced
out, as was the chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   That led to an investigation by auditors at Arthur Andersen,
which produced the revised numbers, which in turn were audited by
Deloitte &AMP; Touche. They concluded that profits for Rite Aid's
fiscal year 1998 were overstated by $492 million and should have
shown a net loss of $186 million. For fiscal year 1999, the
overstatement was $566 million, producing a net loss of $422
million.
</P>
<P>
   The report of fiscal 2000 results, for the year ended Feb. 26,
was the company's first report for that period. It showed a loss of
$1.14 billion. For the quarter ended May 27, the company reported a
loss of $238 million, or 92 cents a share, compared with a restated
net loss of $44 million, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year
earlier..
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid had also planned to restate results for the 1997 fiscal
year but concluded that that would be too much trouble. But it did
restate its balance sheet in a way that indicated that the profits
it reported in 1997 and earlier had been overstated by $554
million.
</P>
<P>
   The company said earnings in 1998 and 1999 were overstated
because of a wide variety of factors, among them understatements of
operating expenses, like payroll, and overstatements of incentives
provided by companies whose products were sold by Rite Aid. Miller
declined to say whether he thought fraud was involved, saying he
would leave that to the government investigations under way.

MEXICAN PARTY, OUSTED FROM POWER, TRIES TO QUELL INFIGHTING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After 10 days of chaotic infighting, the elder
statesmen of the recently defeated governing party agreed on a
formula aimed at maintaining internal discipline as its long
monopoly over Mexican power and wealth draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party, whose traditions were
based on submission to the whims of Mexico's successive presidents,
seemed suddenly to spin out of control last week after Mexicans
voted the party from power for the first time since its 1929
founding.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, the party's defeated presidential
candidate, went into seclusion, the party's top leader, Dulce Maria
Sauri, resigned her post, several hardliners shattered a taboo by
harshly criticizing President Ernesto Zedillo, and at least three
rival factions lunged for control.
</P>
<P>
   But late on Tuesday, leaders of the party, known as the PRI,
announced measures to restore some order, signaling that the
internal coup attempts had failed, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-hour meeting with Zedillo at the presidential
compound, the PRI's 21 state governors announced that they had
persuaded Sauri to remain in her post for a few months while the
party decides how to pick her replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Sauri's dozen top party aides, all of them appointed by
Labastida, were allowed to resign, however, and in their place, the
governors announced the creation of an advisory committee, composed
of the party's 15 or so living ex-presidents. The committee will
help mediate a discussion over how to nurse the PRI back to health
after its stunning defeat at the hands of Vicente Fox, the
president-elect who will take office on Dec. 1
</P>
<P>
   ``Several factions tried to seize control, and they all
failed,'' said Jose Antonio Crespo, a political scientist who
authored a 1999 book analyzing scenarios for the PRI's future.
``The governors have bought some time. Now the urgent task is to
decide on a way to pick a new leader with the legitimacy to guide
the party as it seeks new foundations.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some factions have suggested that the PRI's National Political
Council, a group whose current members were picked by Zedillo,
should select the party's new leader. Some are proposing to elect
the leader this fall in what would be the party's first national
convention since 1996. Others are calling for the new leader's
selection in nationwide, grassroots balloting, in which hundreds of
thousands of party members would be eligible to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The governors' meeting with Zedillo seemed to bring a temporary
truce to the infighting. Among the factions appearing to contend
for power was one allied with Interior Minister Diodoro and one led
by Roberto Madrazo Pintado, the governor of Tabasco state who came
in second to Labastida in the party's primary election last year.
</P>
<P>
   Party graybeards appear to have succeeded in imposing some
order, partly because of a dawning sense of the extraordinary
challenges ahead _ local elections are scheduled in three states
before the end of the year, the PRI must choose legislative leaders
for the new Congress that begins work on Sept. 1, and the party
must decide what posture to adopt toward the incoming president,
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders are urging that the PRI should do everything
possible to hobble Fox, whose center-right party will control
neither the Chamber of Deputies nor the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to head the kind of government that delights an
opposition _ with limited powers _ extremely limited,'' Manuel
Bartlett, the former governor of Puebla, said last week. ``And we
PRI members have the power to impose those limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett has been among the most outspoken critics of Zedillo,
blaming him for Labastida's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Zedillo has lost the capacity to lead,'' Bartlett
told PRI leaders at party headquarters the day after the July 2
vote. ``He should not lead our party for even one minute more!''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's comments stunned Mexico, since PRI leaders have
rarely criticized a sitting president. But in recent days Bartlett
has appeared to be a faction of one, and several of his colleagues
have spoken out in Zedillo's defense. For his part, the president
has urged cooperation with Fox's government, in the pursuit of
Mexican prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   That was the line Labastida adopted Tuesday night, when he
appeared in a television interview for the first time since the
balloting. Reflecting with considerable dignity on the lessons of
his defeat, Labastida wished Fox success. ``If his government does
well, our country will do well,'' he said.

 &HT;    Workshops aim to change racist attitudes
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter how good their hearts or how open their
minds, white people in this country can't help but be racist, says
veteran civil rights leader Rev. C.T. Vivian.
</P>
<P>
   Since the pilgrims arrived, they've been told black isn't
beautiful. It's what mothers told their children, preachers told
their flocks and schools told their students.
</P>
<P>
   That's the history of racism Vivian has taught in nationwide
workshops for The People's Institute for Survival and Beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the institute celebrates its 20th anniversary by opening
a community training school at its New Orleans headquarters. The
school's more intense classes will teach activists how race favors
whites in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50,000 people already have attended institute workshops.
Vivian and others encourage social change by demonstrating, he
says, how white privilege has become as deeply rooted as a Southern
oak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're black in America,'' Vivian said, ``you'll never know
what you might have been, what you might have done for yourself,
for your family, for your children, for your community or for your
nation. You will never know because of what you've been denied.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades after the 1963 ``Bloody Sunday'' civil
rights march in Selma, Ala., Vivian carried the idea of teaching
activists what fuels racism.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate battles of the 1960s put the idea on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any time,'' said Vivian, an adviser to Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. ``Who could be involved in that when we were on the
front line itself?''
</P>
<P>
   Vivian helped launch the institute in his Atlanta living room.
At the time, he was a board member for two groups that championed
civil rights. Their leaders approached Vivian with the idea of
teaching the history of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Under the institute's guidance, Greensboro, N.C., Duluth, Minn.,
Flint, Mich., and Seattle have started citywide anti-racism
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the institute has trained nearly 2,000 employees
from the city's lead social service agency. They learn how to serve
everyone in a vast melting pot, stirred daily by the influx of
Pacific immigrants and refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism can deny access by poor people,'' said Sili Savusa, a
city employee who monitors social service grants awarded to
Seattle's public schools. ``The thing that was so powerful was that
it talked about being accountable to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hosts one of the institute's regional organizing
committees, which teach introductory anti-racism workshops.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Nibs Stroupe, 53, pastor of the Oakhurst Presbyterian
Church in Decatur, has taken the workshop.
</P>
<P>
   A white native of rural Arkansas, Stroupe learned racism from
``the best person'' he knew _ his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was just like generations of people in the Deep South
raised before and after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taught that white folks are supreme, and they're
taught that by people who are loved and trusted, so it's hard to
divorce yourself from those notions,'' Stroupe said. ``We were
taught that whites were on top and that blacks were a little bit
human _ but not human like us.''
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain, Stroupe said, why supporters of the
Confederate battle flag _ an emblem blacks say is a symbol of
oppression _ passionately confront those who deride the banner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about their mamas and their daddies,'' he said.
South Carolina just lowered the flag from its Statehouse dome. In
Georgia, black legislators are working to remove the same Rebel
insignia from the state flag in the upcoming session of the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   For Stroupe, the institute's workshops were eye-opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed me that racism was a social construct and was not
fixed in biology,'' said Stroupe, 53. ``If it's not fixed in
biology, then it's not something unnatural'' to set aside ingrained
racism.
</P>
<P>
   During the colonization of America, European church leaders
viewed dark-skinned people as savages, said David Billings, one of
the Institute's chief trainers in New Orleans. Churches idealized
white Christians while they degraded ``heathens'' from far off dark
continents.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18th century, teachers later recognized as
anthropologists, began classifying the world's people by color,
Billings said. Again, they taught white was good, black was bad.
The color line stands today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academicians would lay the foundation,'' said Billings, a
white minister for the United Methodist Church. ``Those who
constructed society would use this thesis, this world view, to say
why it's OK'' to hold down people of color.
</P>
<P>
   Later, racism was codified by government and today permeates
institutions. For instance, he says, Congress authorized a
preference for whites in previous Census counts, when Indians were
ignored and blacks counted only as three-fifths of a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism in this country is about a power arrangement, a
systematic arrangement that institutionalizes preferences for those
of us who are called white,'' said David Billings, one of the
institute's chief trainers in New Orleans. ``Whites benefit from
the arrangement and blacks fight against it. What we try to do is
demystify all that.''

 &HT;    Black pilots group brings 30 teenagers to aviation camp at Delta
Air Lines
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thirty Atlanta teenagers with an interest in aviation
will be on cloud nine next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Black Airline Pilots is hosting its third
Atlanta Aviation Career Education Camp. For the first time, this
year's camp is sponsored by Delta Air Lines and will be conducted
primarily at the carrier's headquarters near Hartsfield
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong camp, also conducted in other U.S. cities, is for
students ages 14 to 18 selected by OBAP. They must meet grade point
average requirements and submit essays about their aviation
interest.
</P>
<P>
   OBAP said the Delta sponsorship in Atlanta enables the group to
offer a more intensive camp with special events. The camp is free
to participants.
</P>
<P>
   The camp includes instruction in aviation history, aerodynamics,
meteorology and navigation, plus flight simulator sessions. This
year's Atlanta camp also includes an orientation flight on a Delta
757 to Washington, where the students will tour the National Air &AMP;
Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   They will also have a chance during the week to talk to members
of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, a group of black fighter pilots
formed in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Mac Armstrong, executive vice president-operations at Delta,
said the airline views the camp as a worthy cause but also has a
practical motivation for the sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistics tell us that the need for aviation professionals,
especially pilots and maintenance technicians, will remain robust
for the next five to 10 years,'' he said. ``So supporting this
initiative makes good business sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The camps are one way OBAP seeks to boost the tiny percentage of
black pilots at U.S. airlines. A Delta spokeswoman said all
minorities account for about 3 percent of the carrier's 9,100
pilots.

IT'S NO FLUKE RANGERS ARE LAST IN AL WEST
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a relative newcomer to the ranks of major-league-baseball
owner, Tom Hicks is experiencing, for the first time, the dark side
of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Turn out the lights, Tom. The season is over. Your $70
million-plus investment might make a good mushroom patch. Those
things do grow well in the cellar, right?
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hicks has been remarkably supportive of the
engineers responsible for this train wreck, Mr. Doug Melvin and Mr.
Johnny Oates. Ask not if all this is their fault. It happened on
their watch. Therefore, the blame falls accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, says Hicks, will be fired after this season. OK, that's
more than fair. Nobody should be fired after back-to-back
divisional titles, which were followed by the current plunge off
the deep end.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, management lip service is being provided about the
Rangers doing a bounce back starting tonight, finishing strong in
the season's second half and making the playoffs for a third
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   As long as it's only lip service, and nothing else, then that's
OK, too. But as general manager, Melvin knows better than to
attempt to salvage something that is not working. Compared to a
year ago at the All-Star break, the Rangers are just as bad
defensively, just as bad fundamentally, worse in run production,
about the same with a below-average pitching rotation, and in a
total reversal, the bullpen has spit the bit.
</P>
<P>
   Considering everything, it is rather remarkable that a 42-43
record is that ``good.'' A variety of warts were hidden last season
by stellar bullpen work and a club that could outscore many
shortcomings. The bullpen alone is the difference between being
nine games over .500 at the break last season, and one game under
this time. Maybe, however, it's all a blessing. A new urgency is
now prevalent for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Melvin needs to save his own butt, and Oates'.
Another season of this, and Hicks won't be benevolent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting tonight in Arizona, the Rangers open an 11-game road
trip against four clubs, all of them on the plus side of .500.
Nothing has been seen thus far to suggest the Rangers will return
to Arlington any better off than 8 1/2 games out of first place in
the American League West. If this trip doesn't go well, Melvin will
certainly be very public in setting up the July 31 trading deadline
deals that he hopes will benefit the 2001 cause.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland ... Loaiza ... Segui ... Oliver ... Pudge. All right,
I'm just kidding on that last name. But who does go, and for what
in return? As Melvin ponders all this, he also must confront some
drastically changing priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this season, the Rangers' major obsession was how to
deal with Yankee-phobia. Getting by the Yankees in the first round
of the playoffs has consumed almost every off-season thought for
four consecutive years. But no more.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Melvin must first game plan for a suddenly potent
division. The rest of the AL West has not only caught up with the
Rangers, but passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   Poll his peers in both leagues, and I'd say Melvin would rank in
the top five of GMs most respected by other GMs. That expertise,
combined with Hicks' money entering the equation two years ago,
gave the Rangers a hammerlock on the rest of the division.
</P>
<P>
   But when Pat Gillick took over as GM at Seattle, Melvin had an
equal to work against. Billy Beane at Oakland can now be considered
right there with Melvin and Gillick. Beane has done wonders with a
chump-change payroll. And while the Angels were long considered a
team of underachieving malcontents, new GM Bill Stoneman and new
manager Mike Scioscia are changing that image.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident the Rangers dropped to the cellar in the
division. The Rangers were simply the AL West's worst team in the
first half. And for the immediate future, those other three clubs
figure to get nothing but better, particularly with the youth in
Oakland and the deep and young pitching rotation in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If timing is everything, the clock blew up on Melvin last
winter. Outside of Kenny Rogers, he didn't make one roster change
that helped the Rangers this season. Losing Aaron Sele to Seattle
was a double disaster. Not retaining Todd Zeile was a hindsight
mistake. The Juan Gonzalez package is thus far empty.
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of us saw it coming, but the AL West quickly moved
forward as the Rangers backed up.
</P>
<P>
   Dig in, Doug. You've got plenty of catching up to do, and that
doesn't mean this season. nn

ECONOMIC SCENE: IN DEFENSE OF VISUAL POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)  (Virginia Postrel is editor at large of Reason magazine and author
of ``The Future and Its Enemies: The Growing Conflict Over
Creativity, Enterprise and Progress.'') 
 By VIRGINIA POSTREL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All around the country, conflicts are brewing over aesthetics.
Instead of tolerating sights they don't like _ from tacky porch
furniture to innovative architecture _ more and more Americans are
demanding a world free of ``visual pollution.'' Appearance is
getting the sort of regulatory scrutiny once reserved for public
health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   In Portland, Ore., you can no longer build a home whose front is
less than 15 percent windows and doors or whose garage takes up
more than half the facade. The goal, a local official suggested in
response to critics, is to ``put a stop to the ugly and stupid
houses that we see going up.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City is trying to revise its land use code for the
first time since 1961. The proposed Uniform Bulk Program would
establish a design review committee and use height limits to
preserve the skyline. The new rules don't claim to be healthful or
to preserve historic buildings. They're all about looks.
``Everything proposed by the Uniform Bulk Program is entirely a
matter of taste,'' wrote Herbert Muschamp, the architecture critic
for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Suburbanites now take offense at their neighbors' paint colors,
their window frames, even their backyard swing sets. And just about
everywhere, residents are fighting new cell phone towers, which can
block views or just look ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The push to expand the definition of ``pollution'' to include
aesthetic offenses forces us to re-examine why and how we regulate
the spillovers that economists call externalities. Should we really
ban, tax or otherwise deter any action that has unpleasant effects
on other people? After all, just about everything people do in
society has spillover effects, many of them unwanted.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Coase of the University of Chicago addressed these
questions in 1960, in ``The Problem of Social Cost,'' an article
that helped win him the 1991 Nobel Prize in economics. But the most
relevant parts of that paper are the least noted.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is most famous for what was later called the Coase
Theorem.
</P>
<P>
   This is the idea that if making deals in the marketplace costs
nothing, it won't matter how the law assigns liability. If a
factory has the right to operate even if it pollutes, then people
who don't want to breathe stinky air can pay the owner not to
pollute. If, on the other hand, the neighbors have the right not to
suffer pollution, the factory can pay them to waive that right. In
either case, a deal will be made at the level that makes everyone
as happy as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But as Coase would be the first to point out, we don't live in a
world where deals are free. Gathering information, rounding up all
the affected parties, negotiating contracts, monitoring pollution
levels and so on are all costly. These transaction costs can make
such happy deals difficult, though certainly not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, the way rights are assigned _ to polluters or
to their neighbors _ does matter. That makes it important to assign
them correctly.
</P>
<P>
   What principles should we use to get the best result?
</P>
<P>
   Coase's first insight is that pollution is not a simple matter
of physical invasion or evildoing. It is a byproduct of valuable
actions. Preventing those actions would also be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question that has to be decided,'' he writes, ``is
should A be allowed to harm B or should B be allowed to harm A? The
problem is to avoid the more serious harm.''
</P>
<P>
   So if a Portland resident builds a house with a big garage door
facing the street, people who find that facade unfriendly are
harmed. But if the city prohibits that design, making two-car
garages impossible to build on many lots, homeowners who want
garages are harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The question, from a Coasean perspective, is: Which is the
greater harm, and how should we avoid it? It's wrong to declare
that invading someone's eyesight is by definition the action that
should be prevented. We have to consider both sides, and we should
find the least costly way to prevent the harm.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Coase suggests, that a factory spews smoke that causes
$100 in damage. Traditional economics might suggest that the
government put a $100 tax on the factory to compensate for the
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   That gives the company an incentive to eliminate the pollution
by, for instance, installing a $90 device. This sort of analysis is
what a lot of economists still teach their students.
</P>
<P>
   But, Coase says, the $90 device may not be the only, or the
cheapest, way to avoid $100 in damage. Again, you have to consider
both sides. Suppose the neighbors could avoid the pollution for
just $40, either by moving or by installing some other technology.
That would be an even better approach because it would keep the
overall harms to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be hard to find real-life examples like this for
air pollution, they are extremely common for aesthetic conflict. If
you don't like your neighbors' backyard swing set or the mural on
the side of a local building, you can generally avoid looking at it
_ a cheap solution. And since we tend to become used to our
surroundings over time, it becomes easier and easier to ignore
visual offenses. Sometimes we even come to enjoy sights we once
found annoying.
</P>
<P>
   So if we consider not just the offense but the value of the
activity that gives rise to it, more often than not we find that
the least costly way to deal with aesthetic conflicts is to put up
with occasional ugliness.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason homeowners have generally had the freedom to
decorate their houses to their own taste _ a large benefit to them,
at a small cost to neighbors who disagree. And it is why federal
law prohibits communities from completely banning cell phone
towers.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance looks even better when we factor in something ``The
Problem of Social Cost'' did not consider: the value of innovation
and learning.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing taste means blocking experimentation. So architects in
Portland can't find as many new ways to fit efficient houses on
small lots. And Muschamp worries that New York's Uniform Bulk
Program would zone out architectural creativity in favor of safe
``hackery.'' If we call visual offenses ``pollution'' and demand
that they be banned, we aren't considering all the costs.

STUDY CITES POSSIBLE HIV RISK FOR WOMEN USING WIDELY SOLD
SPERMICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ga., N.Y., Calif., British Columbia)   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Women at high risk of contracting the
AIDS virus should not use the widely sold spermicide nonoxynol-9
because it may increase the risk of contracting HIV rather than
protecting against it, the United Nations warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of evidence from a number of studies shows that
nonoxynol-9 is either ineffective or, if used with high frequency,
can be harmful as an anti-HIV agent, said Dr. Joseph Perriens, who
oversaw the trial for Unaids, a U.N. agency, at a news conference
here Wednesday. ``If you use nonoxynol-9, you are either wasting
your money or possibly wasting your life,'' Perriens said at the
13th international AIDS conference here. Nonoxynol-9 is marketed in
the United States and around the world as a contraceptive, and the
chemical is also included as a lubricant in many male condoms.
Women using nonoxynol-9 solely as a contraceptive should not worry
about the findings because normal usage generally will not cause
the ulcers that are believed to increase risk of HIV transmission,
an official with the Food and Drug Administration in the United
States said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if it's used appropriately, it really shouldn't pose a
risk,'' said Dr. Debra Birnkrant, deputy director of the division
of anti-viral drug products at the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   For people at high risk of contracting HIV, ``Condoms with or
without nonoxynol-9 should be used,'' said Dr. Ann Duerr, chief of
the HIV section in the division of reproductive health at the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study's
implications for the small amounts of nonoxynol-9 on lubricated
condoms are unclear, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unaids had hoped that its study, which was conducted in three
African countries and Thailand, would put nonoxynol-9 on the fast
track for approval as the first effective microbicide women could
apply to the vagina before intercourse to kill HIV. A microbicide
is any substance that kills germs, and it can be formulated as a
cream, gel, film or suppository.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the preliminary findings reported Wednesday represent a
setback for efforts to develop a weapon that women in Africa
desperately need to protect themselves from HIV. Many women in
Africa and elsewhere are forced to have unprotected sex with their
husbands who are infected. In some African countries, more than 20
percent of the adult population and 30 percent of pregnant women
are HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were more bad news at a meeting characterized by a
number of disappointments and few advances. In contrast to the
euphoria at the 1996 meeting in Vancouver, where scientists spoke
about the possibility of curing AIDS, here they have said that such
hopes are unfounded until new and improved weapons are found.
Instead, they say, they must find new ways to use what they have at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   And every day, conference participants were badgered with
depressing figures. They heard how South Africa, with 20 percent of
its adult population infected, also had the most people living with
HIV _ 4.2 million _ in the world. HIV rates exceed 10 percent in 16
countries in the southern region of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Unaids, the World Health Organization and a number of groups
representing advocates for a vaginal microbicide for HIV rushed to
say that despite the setback they were committed to finding an
effective microbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study was a lost battle'' in that effort, Perriens said.
``We have a war ahead of us and we think this war can be won.''
</P>
<P>
   Unaids, the World Health Organization and representatives of
groups seeking a vaginal microbicide said they would redouble their
efforts to find one but said governments and industry had to spend
more to do so.
</P>
<P>
   At least 36 other compounds are now at the pre-clinical testing
stage, while 20 are ready for early safety trials in human
volunteers. Three additional compounds are being considered for
large-scale trials.
</P>
<P>
   Unaids decided to try to use nonoxynol-9 as a microbicide
because the spermicide was inexpensive, showed activity in
laboratory tests against HIV, and could prevent infection from the
simian immune deficiency virus among macaques.
</P>
<P>
   The Unaids study involved AdvantageS, a nonoxynol-9 product that
the Miami-based Columbia Laboratories markets in the United States
and China. AdvantageS was developed and marketed as a
contraceptive, not as a way to prevent infections. Columbia helped
pay for the Unaids study, which was conducted in Benin, Ivory
Coast, South Africa and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The 999 participants were prostitutes who were offered free
condoms, counseling, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and
treatment throughout the study. All women were encouraged to use
AdvantageS and a condom each time they had sex. They had sex with
an average of four partners each day, and the range was from 1 to
20 partners. The participants said that nearly 90 percent of the
acts were protected by condoms.
</P>
<P>
   The participants agreed to be randomly assigned to use either
AdvantageS or Replens, a vaginal moisturizer without nonoxynol-9.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, 59 women in the AdvantageS group became infected
with HIV compared with 41 in the Replens group, a difference that
was significant by statistical tests.
</P>
<P>
   There were more genital ulcers in the AdvantageS group than in
the Replens group, said Dr. Lut Van Damme, the study's scientific
coordinator from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp. Van
Damme said that the finding made her team suspect that the ulcers
made it easier for HIV to infect.
</P>
<P>
   Nonoxynol's tendency to cause ulcers is ``a known risk if used
to excess,'' said Birnkrant. Using it according to directions
should not cause the ulcers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Howard L. Levine, a Columbia vice president, said his
company was keeping the FDA informed of the findings. He urged
caution in interpreting the findings until the final analysis is
completed in a few months. The study provided the worst-case for
AdvantageS because many of the prostitutes in the study had more
sexual acts a day than in Columbia's tests of the product, Levine
said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings have led scientists at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention to stop a study they had planned to conduct
in Los Angeles and Miami among women at high risk for HIV.

GOP PUSHES MARRIAGE-PENALTY BILL THROUGH HOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Knowing that a presidential veto looms, the
Republican-controlled House nevertheless passed legislation
Wednesday that would provide $182 billion over 10 years in tax
relief to dual-income couples hit by the so-called ``marriage
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, who largely opposed the legislation, accused
Republicans of being more interested in creating a presidential
campaign issue than in improving U.S. tax policy. But GOP sponsors
of the tax-repeal measure hailed its passage as a victory for the
institution of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican majority is so bent on making political
statements,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who led the
unsuccessful Democratic opposition to the measure. He predicted
that the GOP-led Senate will pass the legislation quickly, making
the proposal a rallying point at the Republican national
convention, which begins July 31 in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they want to say in Philadelphia is that they passed the
bill and the president vetoed it,'' said Rangel, the chief Democrat
on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, dismissed the charge that his
party was playing politics, noting that 48 Democrats joined 221
Republicans in voting for passage.
</P>
<P>
   No Republicans opposed the legislation, which would repeal
tax-code provisions that force 25 million dual-income married
couples to pay more in federal income taxes than they would if they
were single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to take money from the pockets of wage-earning
Americans just because they're married,'' said Archer, who chairs
the ways and means panel and sponsored the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The 269-159 vote marked the second time the House has approved
the legislation to repeal the marriage penalty. After the first
vote in February, the Senate's Democratic minority conducted a
successful filibuster, refusing to allow senators to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the House GOP avoided that possibility by passing the
measure as part of budget-reconciliation legislation, which is not
subject to Senate filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to vote on the legislation this month and
send it to President Clinton's desk before the GOP convention. In
addition, senators this week are expected to pass and send to
Clinton legislation that would repeal the federal estate tax over
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the two measures to the Democratic president before the
convention could make the proposed tax breaks major issues at the
event, where Republicans are expected to nominate Texas Gov. George
W. Bush as their presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has threatened to veto the Republican-backed repeal of
the marriage penalty unless it also contains the $250 billion in
Medicare prescription drug coverage he seeks for seniors during the
next 10 years. The president also has said he would veto the
proposed estate-tax repeal, saying the GOP measure would largely
benefit only the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to stop the vote on the marriage-penalty
repeal, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., failed to
persuade Republicans to attach Clinton's prescription drug proposal
to their legislation, saying that such a step would garner the
president's signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's work together,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During the spirited House debate on the proposed Marriage Tax
Penalty Relief Act, Democrats roundly accused the GOP of playing
pre-convention politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to go to Philadelphia (and) say, `Look at what the
Democrats won't let us do,'' said Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Added Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.: ``Philadelphia is what's on
their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were just as vocal in charging the Democrats
with ignoring the legitimate financial concerns of married couples
stung by the higher tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington needs to stop penalizing the cornerstone of
American society,'' said Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Texas. ``Mr.
President, the time has come to sign this legislation and, for
once, to put American families first.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mac Collins, R-Ga., added that Democrats view marriage as
``an excuse to raise more revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed measure would increase the standard deduction
for married couples to twice the deduction allowed for singles. For
tax year 2000 that would mean rasing the standard deduction from
$7,350 to $8,800, an increase of nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats pointed out that more than half of the tax breaks in
the GOP bill would go to families that don't suffer from the
marriage penalty. Families living on one income already enjoy a tax
break and would receive an additional tax cut under the proposal,
the Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rangel, the Democrats supported a smaller, 10-year, $95
billion plan. But the House rejected that proposal 228-198.

Despite struggles, Yankees primed for second half
<TEXT>
<P>
   By RICHARD JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Just when the New York Yankees seemed on the verge of coming
undone, they got Roger Clemens and Orlando Hernandez back from
injuries, acquired David Justice from the Cleveland Indians and got
a surprisingly decent performance from Dwight Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   And after their first losing month in three years and a brief
stay in third place, they won seven of their final nine games
before the All-Star break and will begin the symbolic second half
of the season tonight atop the American League East standings.
</P>
<P>
   If all of that weren't enough, they also ended a long search for
a starting pitcher Wednesday by acquiring steady lefthander Denny
Neagle from the Cincinnati Reds for four prospects. Neagle has had
a tremendous first half and entered the All-Star break with three
straight victories and an 8-2 record. He has pitched at least seven
innings in seven of his last nine starts and will team with
Clemens, Hernandez and Andy Pettitte to give the Yankees arguably
the American League's best starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   So meet the new boss _ same as the old boss. That the Yankees
are only percentage points ahead of the Toronto Blue Jays and have
looked extremely vulnerable during the first 3{ months of the
season may not matter. Because they know how to win and because
their clubhouse is the industry standard for professionalism and
work ethic, the Yankees were already the team every other was going
to be watching over these final 2{ months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because of what they've done in the past, you have to
respect them,'' Chicago White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko said.
``No one is going to overlook them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the White Sox have won more games and the Seattle
Mariners have looked like a better all-around team, the Yankees
still have Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter, they still have the
most reliable closer on earth in Mariano Rivera, and they still
have a manager who remains the unflappable calm in a storm
constantly swirling with tabloid headlines and combustible owner
George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they haven't had serious problems. Yet because of those
problems, it's an even greater tribute to their resilience that
they're in first place.
</P>
<P>
   Until Justice arrived, the Yankees had gotten little offense out
of their left fielders. Their third baseman, 1998 World Series MVP
Scott Brosius, is hitting .251. First baseman Tino Martinez (.261,
eight home runs) seems a shadow of the player he was. And there has
been a revolving door of designated hitters since Darryl
Strawberry's drug-related suspension and Chili Davis' retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the pitching, which has been the best in the game
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees knew they were dealing with a house of cards when
they based their hopes on Hernandez and a pair of 37-year-old
starters _ Clemens and David Cone. Cone has been sent to the
bullpen after winning one of 16 starts. He hasn't lost much
velocity, but some of his command _ that is, the ability to change
speeds and arm angles and to work every corner of the strike zone _
is gone.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clemens (6-6, 4.33 ERA), he had two of his best
performances of the season upon leaving the disabled list 11 days
ago. Before that, he turned in just seven quality starts (six-plus
innings, three earned runs or fewer) in 14 turns. Even with the
acquisition of Neagle, a lot of the Yankees' hopes will depend on
Clemens staying healthy and pitching well.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else seems to be falling into place. Hernandez (8-6,
4.22) appears healthy, and Pettitte (9-5, 4.38) has had a solid
first half. The bullpen remains spectacularly reliable, and Rivera
is as close to a sure thing as the game has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put some wins together and not be surprised to win
three or four in a row,'' manager Joe Torre said. ``We have to get
on a roll and get that confidence going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were tested at times last season as well. They
didn't take over first place for good until June 22, and the Red
Sox were within three games as late as Sept. 21. But New York held
on and then sailed through the postseason by winning 11 of 12.
Having gotten well before the break, they have a chance to take
command of the American League East while opening up the second
half with 21 straight games against losing teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's our time to step up,'' Pettitte said. ``Starting
pitching's been the strength of this team for the last three, four
years, and we're the guys they count on.''
</P>
<P>
   This time it has been different. Even as the Yankees toyed with
the idea of trading for Sammy Sosa or Juan Gonzalez and worked on
the deal that brought Neagle, Torre has made more moves than in his
previous four years combined.
</P>
<P>
   He sent Cone, one of the most respected Yankees, to the bullpen.
He dropped Martinez in the batting order. He used Chuck Knoblauch
as a designated hitter when his throwing problems at second base
worsened. And he spent most of the season searching for pitching,
even using guys named Jake Westbrook and Ben Ford in important
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk about our position-by-position guys,'' Torre said,
``but if we can't throw a starter out there every day to give us a
chance to win, it negates all that other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays may not stay in the race unless they acquire
another starting pitcher. But for now, they've ridden David Wells
(15-2, 3.44 ERA) and Carlos Delgado (80 RBIs) into first place.
Wells leads the majors in victories, and only Mark McGwire has more
home runs than Delgado's 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are a patchwork of reclamation projects and young
players. If Pedro Martinez (9-3, 1.44 ERA), who has been on the
disabled list, stays healthy down the stretch, Boston probably will
stay close even if it doesn't have enough to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the American League's other divisions, the White Sox have
a 10-game lead over injury-decimated Cleveland in the Central and
have given no indication of slowing down. They play with energy and
a youthful enthusiasm that has made them perhaps the most
entertaining team in the game.
</P>
<P>
   They've got thunder throughout their lineup. Frank Thomas (.333,
26 home runs, 75 RBIs) and Magglio Ordonez (.330, 21, 74) are
terrorizing pitchers, and Carlos Lee, who almost always has hit in
the bottom third, has 59 RBIs. The Chisox also are deep, allowing
manager Jerry Manuel to rest everyone. Keith Foulke (18 saves) is
the best closer you never heard of, and they are loaded with hard
throwers in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking for reasons the White Sox will not fold,
look at a starting rotation that leads the American League with 41
victories. James Baldwin and Cal Eldred, who had 14 wins combined
last season, have 21.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred, who once led the American League in innings pitched
before undergoing Tommy John surgery, is 10-2 with a power fastball
and a first-rate curve. Baldwin is 11-4, and Jim Parque and Mike
Sirotka have eight wins apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, Seattle has a three-game lead over Oakland and
perhaps the deepest rotation in the American League. The Mariners
have enough starters that general manager Pat Gillick may trade one
to acquire the lefthanded bat he desperately needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have their starting rotation intact for the first
time since mid-April. Freddy Garcia, a 17-game winner last year,
came off the DL on Saturday. Kazuhiro Sasaki, Jose Paniagua, Jose
Mesa and Arthur Rhodes are at the heart of an outstanding bullpen.
That bullpen is good enough that Lou Piniella is one of only two
managers who hasn't allowed a starter to throw 120 pitches in a
game this season (Montreal's Felipe Alou is the other). The
Mariners will have a nervous few days until shortstop Alex
Rodriguez and his aching right knee return to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   No team has better pitching at the front of the rotation than
Oakland. Tim Hudson (10-2) and Mark Mulder (5-4) are two of the top
young starters in the game, and 1999 No. 1 pick Barry Zito may be a
telephone call away from the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners and White Sox look good enough to win a World
Series, and a postseason matchup with the Yankees would make for
marvelous October theater.

ASIAN-AMERICAN MEDIA COMPANY BRANCHES OUT ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE LEVERE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A print media company specializing in the Asian-American market
is branching out online to broaden its audience and advertising
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held aMedia, publisher of the bimonthly aMagazine,
introduced a new Web site, aOnline.com, in June. The site is part
of aMedia's long-term strategy to develop a multimedia empire that
includes production and distribution of online video, film and
music.
</P>
<P>
   Like the magazine, aOnline.com caters to the English-speaking
Asian-American market, which research shows is younger, better
educated, and more affluent and technology-oriented than many other
ethnic groups in the United States. These qualities make
Asian-Americans desirable to marketers, even though they constitute
only 4 percent of the nation's total population.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by Forrester Research, based in Cambridge,
Mass., found that Asian-Americans ranked higher than white
Americans, African-Americans and Hispanic Americans in both income
and education: Asian-Americans had a median annual household income
of $65,000, and 60 percent of them were college educated. More than
three-fourths were technologically inclined, also the highest
rating of the four groups, while their median age was 36, the
youngest of the four groups.
</P>
<P>
   AMedia, which has published aMagazine for 11 years, opted to go
online because ``there were limitations inherent in the print
product,'' said Jeff Yang, founder and chief executive. ``To create
a mass medium for Asian-Americans, you have to go where they are.
Seventy percent of them, 7.5 million, are online.''
</P>
<P>
   Yang said aMagazine had a circulation of 180,000, with
advertising sales of $1.1 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to leverage the resources we have off-line, and
address the frailties of traditional media,'' he added. ``The
Internet allows interaction and feedback, flexibility and
customization for advertisers, and constant contact with our
readers.''
</P>
<P>
   AOnline contains original editorial content as well as articles
from aMagazine, various chat rooms for visitors of different ages,
and an electronic calendar. Online chats are also being held with
Asian-American celebrities like Deepak Chopra.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, aOnline is developing a network of other sites of
Asian-American student, civic, service and professional groups
that, like aOnline, will be sold to advertisers; the Asian-Pacific
American Medical Student Association, for example, is already part
of it. AMedia, which has Web design and development capabilities,
will help these groups build their sites, if needed, either at a
reduced price or free, depending on their finances.
</P>
<P>
   According to Yang, aMedia's next step will be to add streaming
audio and video to aOnline, thus creating a multimedia,
multichannel menu of options for marketers. He also eventually
plans to add an e-commerce component, to sell books, music, videos,
food and other items, and to expand overseas.
</P>
<P>
   So far, three advertisers are buying space on aOnline _ Verio, a
provider of Internet and Web site operating services; Ford Motor, a
longtime supporter of aMagazine; and the Army. The Army began
advertising in aMagazine last spring and is running banner ads on
aOnline to recruit for its active and reserve units.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Nicholls, a corporate advertising executive for Ford,
said her company was working with aMedia's magazine and Web site
because ``the Asian market is so diverse in and of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Asian-Americans are a fast-growing community, an affluent
community, and aMagazine does a good job of reaching them,'' she
said. ``I look at the Internet as added value.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford is spending $110,000 this year on advertising in both
aMagazine and aOnline, a slight increase over previous
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Ekaterina O. Walsh, an analyst with Forrester Research,
generally praised aMedia's online business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on the right track when it comes to targeting
Asian-Americans online, because they're significantly more likely
to be there,'' she said. ``Between Asian-Americans' significantly
higher income and the fact that they're much younger, they'll also
be an attractive target to advertisers. They're also more open to
novelty, which will make them a good launch pad to test new
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Len Fong, director of cross-cultural marketing for e21corp, a
Fremont, Calif., marketing communications firm, said that although
aMedia faced competition from older Asian-American sites like
Click2Asia.com, it has ``10 years of history behind it. They've got
good connections and know the Asian-American marketplace fairly
well. Their chances of success are pretty high.''
</P>
<P>
   For aOnline to make the most of its advertising potential, Walsh
said, it should create specialized Web sites on individual subjects
like music or finance, perhaps joining forces with financial
institutions like Charles Schwab or Fidelity, rather than develop
as a general-interest portal for Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of the broad-based portal is coming to an end,'' she
said. ``Forrester expects that only three will remain by 2004.
Niche sites hold the best chance of survival, and this trend
applies to ethnic sites, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Kang, president and chief executive of Kang &AMP; Lee
Advertising in New York, a unit of Young &AMP; Rubicam that specializes
in the Asian-American market, warned that aMedia faced tough
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do one thing really well in the general market, you can
do really well,'' said Yang, who is also president of the
Association of Asian-American Advertising Agencies. ``But in the
Asian market, you've got to do everything well. AMedia's got to be
eBay and Amazon.com and Priceline.com and CNBC in the aggregate to
provide enough income and revenue and be a stable business. There's
not much room to make mistakes.''

GOP BILLS TO CUT TAXES FACING VOTES IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress moved closer Wednesday to
passing their two main tax-cutting bills, with the House finishing
work on a previously passed tax reduction for married couples and
the Democrats and Republicans agreeing to a vote in the Senate this
week on a plan to repeal the federal estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 269-159, the House sent to the Senate a bill that
would cut taxes on married couples by $182 billion over the next 10
years. The bill passed the House by a similar margin in February,
but it was repackaged slightly by Republicans on Wednesday so that
it could be considered by the Senate under rules that would keep
Democrats from stalling the bill or loading it with amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Republican leader in the Senate, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, said he intended to bring to the floor on Friday a
version of the bill that would cut taxes on couples by $248 billion
over 10 years. The legislation is likely to win support from all 55
Republicans and perhaps a few Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has made it clear that President Clinton will
veto the tax cut for couples, saying that the Republican plan costs
too much, is skewed to upper income brackets and should be
considered only after Congress and the administration have agreed
on a plan to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have packaged the legislation as a repeal of the
marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that leads some
two-income couples to pay a higher tax bill than they would if they
had remained single. But the bill would provide a tax cut to nearly
all couples, including those who receive a marriage bonus _ that
is, they pay a lower tax bill as a couple than they would if they
had remained single.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also negotiated an agreement Wednesday with his Democratic
counterpart, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, to bring the proposed
estate tax repeal to a vote in the Senate. The agreement permits
Democrats to offer amendments that would allow them to make their
point that full repeal of the estate tax would primarily benefit a
few very wealthy people each year. The Democrats also contend that
there are ways of reducing the tax while leaving money to address
other pressing issues that affect far more voters, like health
care, child care and college costs.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment to the estate tax bill that is likely to get the
most attention will be offered by a Republican, Sen. Spencer
Abraham of Michigan. It will call for suspension of all or nearly
all of the 18.4 cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax for 150 days.
High gas prices have become a political issue this year, especially
in the Midwest, and Abraham is in a tight re-election race.

 &HT;    Report suggests tech training for minorities
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Because of the large pockets of female,
African-American and Spanish-speaking workers being bypassed by the
boom in technology job opportunities, the country faces critical
talent shortages that could weaken its economic power.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a crisis that could harm scientific progress and blunt
the nation's competitive edge in the world economy, the country
must do a better job in attracting, preparing and retaining
minorities in technology industries heading into the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   These were key elements in a report released today by a federal
commission that has been studying the problem over the last year
and is now sounding a national call to arms to improve science and
math teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based panel _ the Commission on the Advancement
of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology
Development _ was created by a bipartisan duo, Rep. Connie Morello
(R-Md.) and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation's economic prosperity is due, in large part, to the
significant growth in science, engineering and technology
industries,'' said Elaine Mendoza, commission chairman and
president of Conceptual MindWorks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these industries, which already face worker shortages,
continue to expand, we will lose our global competitive edge if we
do not expand the talent pool accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the commission's findings is that the demographics
(population projections) of the next 20 years show a growing
percentage of the young population pool being comprised of
African-Americans, Latins and others, as well as women.
</P>
<P>
   If these groups, which have so far largely failed to be drawn
into careers in science and technology, continue to lag in
participation, the nation's companies developing high-tech products
and services will be severely short-handed.
</P>
<P>
   In order to head off that prospect, the commission recommends
strong steps to focus better teaching on minorities, women and _
another underrepresented group _ disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically the commission called for the following:
</P>
<P>
   Higher standards of math and science teaching and curriculum,
which would boost the number of students in science and technology
from all sources.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing improved teaching on minorities and women, where
achievement has lagged.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying minorities and women in community colleges, and
cultivating them in greater numbers to move on to four-year
colleges in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Calling on states and federal agencies to focus student aid,
including larger Pell Grants to a maximum of $6,418, to support
minorities in science and technology education.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to improving science and math teaching, the
commission said it looks for specific ideas and strategies to be
contained in a report by another commission, the Glenn Commission,
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   On a more general level, the commission endorses a campaign to
get industry support for diversity programs, and also to wage media
campaigns to improve the attractiveness of science and technology
careers.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the commission said surveys of companies toward
the end of the millennium disclosed the industry leaders pointed to
shortages in skills as the main barrier to growth.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that chief executives conclude that ``unless
U.S. firms can create home-grown technicians by increasing adult
training opportunities and by expanding college graduates in
computer and engineering programs, (companies) will move their
operations abroad or import talent from overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, industries are clamoring this summer for quick
passage of congressional legislation to expand the supply of visas
to allow more overseas technology talent to work in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The commission clearly placed the burden of improving science
and math teaching on states and localities, a major point of
emphasis in Georgia under Gov. Roy Barnes.

LAWMAKERS WANT TO COMMEMORATE SLAVES WHO BUILT WHITE HOUSE AND
CAPITOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Mich., Ark., Ga., Ill.)   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two centuries after George Washington signed into
law a bill establishing a federal city on the Potomac, historians
and lawmakers are now learning that most of the laborers who
erected the White House and the Capitol were black slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made several months ago by a local television
reporter, Edward Hotaling, who unearthed Treasury Department pay
slips in the Capitol dating back 200 years. The pay slips showed
that from 1792 to 1800 _ the years the reporter focused on _ more
than 400 of the 600 workers who helped erect the White House and
the Capitol were black slaves whose wages were appropriated by
their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Now a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress, led by Rep.
J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., is calling for a task force to study the
documents and recommend how best to commemorate the black slaves,
who were never recognized or rewarded for their role. The memorial
would occupy a ``prominent'' place in the Capitol, Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who were these men who worked here?'' asked Rep. John Lewis,
D-Ga., a one-time civil rights leader. ``What happened to them?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Danny Davis, D-Ill., said it was important to honor the
slaves who helped erect two of the country's most visible symbols
of democracy, and not shy away from that fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slavery indeed was a shameful period in the history of this
nation but we have a responsibility not to run away from any aspect
of it,'' Davis said. ``It's incumbent upon us to uncover and reveal
what was actually taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling said he came across the records in March while he was
reporting a story on the 200th anniversary of the White House and
the Capitol. Each pay slip contained the name of the plantation
owner, the slave and the wages paid to the owner: $5 a month.
Hotaling said he focused on the years 1792 and 1800, and then ran
out of time.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the Capitol was not completed until the 1860s
and the White House was finished in 1800. Slavery was not outlawed
in Washington until 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Little else is known about the slave laborers, something Watts
said he hoped to rectify with the task force, which would include
several historians.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said he expected the resolution to sail through the House
and Senate in the next month, adding that he would like the task
force to make its recommendations by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the resolution is being sponsored by Sens.
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., and Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark. It will be
called, Watts said with a chuckle, the Abraham Lincoln resolution.

 &HT;    Gather round at ice cream social and watch your cares melt away
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's little that brings immediate relief from summer's
oppressive heat and humidity quicker than America's favorite
dessert: ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   July is National Ice Cream Month _ the perfect time to share the
joys of this frozen treat with friends and family by putting
together an informal ice cream social.
</P>
<P>
   With the emphasis on fun and ease, this gathering should be as
hassle-free as possible. That means don't worry about cranking your
own ice cream. Instead, stock up on a variety of favorite flavors
and don't forget toppings galore. Provide plenty of napkins and let
guests create their own frozen extravaganzas.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you decide on an intimate group or a large affair, use
your imagination when it comes to containers in which to serve all
that vanilla, chocolate and pistachio nut.

   THE SCOOP ON SCOOPS
</P>
<P>
   Whether you call them dippers or scoops, their mission is the
same: to transfer all that cool goodness to a bowl or cone.
</P>
<P>
   According to AntiqueWeek, the first ice cream scoop was patented
in 1876 by William Clewell of Reading, Pa. It was cone-shaped and
made of tin and steel. It used a key on the top of the cone to
release the ice cream and required both hands to operate.
</P>
<P>
   In 1895 the first swing lever round bowl dipper was made, and
today we still use one much like it.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for a scoop, make sure you handle them a bit and
see how they feel. Some are more comfortable than others.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid plastic scoops, because they aren't nearly as sturdy as
metal.
</P>
<P>
   To make perfect ice cream scoops every time, immerse the scoop
in water before each dip.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the most common ice cream scoops we found.

   MAKING IT YOURSELF
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember the nostalgic joys of homemade ice cream have
nearly limitless options in ice cream makers today. Prices range
from $40 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for an ice cream maker, decide whether you want a
manual or electric unit. Here are a few popular ice cream makers
that are easily found either through local retailers or Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  White Mountain Ice Cream Maker. This venerable name in ice
cream makers continues to stand for top-notch machines that produce
ultra-smooth ice cream and frozen yogurt in 20 minutes. The ice
cream maker has a bucket handcrafted of thick New England white
pine, plus non-corrodible cast-iron dashers and a three-gear drive.
It comes in electric and manual, 4- to 6-quart models. Prices range
from $150-$199. Available through Williams-Sonoma and through
www.appliances.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Donvier Ice Cream Maker. This little 1-quart ice cream maker
is so easy to use and yields high-quality frozen desserts in no
time flat without electricity, salt, ice or much effort on your
part. Just freeze the Chillfast cylinder, then place it in the
cylinder holder, add your ingredients, place the cover on top and
turn the crank every few minutes and in about 20 minutes you've got
ice cream, frozen yogurt or sorbet. $40-$50. Available through the
Web site www.cooking.com.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker. Homemade ice cream, frozen yogurt
and sorbet in as little as 20 minutes. This quick and powerful
machine features a transparent easy-lock lid, a wide ingredient
spout and easy cord storage. Holds up to 1.5-quarts of frozen
dessert. $59.99. Available at Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen desserts come in many forms, including ice cream, frozen
custard or French ice cream, sherbet, gelato, sorbet, water ice,
tofu-based frozen desserts, frozen novelties, frozen yogurt and
frozen pudding. Each of these has its own definition, and many are
standardized by federal regulations. Here's a basic primer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ice cream consists of a mixture of dairy ingredients such as
milk and nonfat milk and ingredients for sweetening and flavoring,
such as fruits, nuts and chocolate chips. Functional ingredients,
such as stabilizers and emulsifiers, are often included in the
product to promote proper texture. By federal law, ice cream must
contain at least 10 percent milkfat, before the addition of bulky
ingredients, and must weigh a minimum of 4.5 pounds to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frozen custard or French ice cream must also contain a minimum
of 10 percent milkfat, as well as at least 1.4 percent egg yolk
solids.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sherbets have a milkfat content between 1 percent and 2
percent and a slightly higher sweetener content than ice cream.
Sherbet weighs a minimum of 6 pounds to the gallon and is flavored
either with fruit or other characterizing ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gelato is characterized by an intense flavor and is served in
a semi-frozen state. Gelato contains sweeteners, milk, cream, egg
yolks and flavoring.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sorbet and water ices are similar to sherbets, but contain no
dairy ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frozen yogurt consists of a mixture of dairy ingredients such
as milk and nonfat milk which have been cultured, as well as
ingredients for sweetening and flavoring.

   Q: For a few years, I have been using Memories of Kobe
(Souvenirs de Kobe) made by President's Choice (PC) as a marinade
for steaks and chicken. Suddenly, it disappeared. Everyone I have
introduced Kobe to has fallen in love with its tangy flavor, which
will make even the most discriminating mouths water. I was able to
find it in Canada last summer because PC is made there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dan Gimbert, Dunwoody , Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your memory of this sauce serves you well. The Oriental-style
tamari garlic marinade is available in select sites in the States,
for example, Jewel food stores in the Chicago area, but it is not
available in Georgia; however, you can order it through President's
Choice International in Canada. Twelve bottles (each 350
milligrams) are about $32.50. Use a credit card for easy payment.
Information: 1-416-750-7203 or www.pcbaskets.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I bought Tarn-X, a liquid silver tarnish remover, at the old
Roses stores, and now I can't find it. The remover came in a black
and white 12-ounce plastic bottle. Is it available in metro
Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   _ Killian Smith, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We couldn't tarnish our reputation for finding hard-to-find
items and not find this one. You can buy Tarn-X (12-ounce bottle,
$5.29) at Walgreens, 5455 Lawrenceville Highway, Lilburn
(770-381-8582). Polish the family's sterling with this remover as
well as items in silver plate, platinum, copper and gold. However,
do not use on stainless steel, chrome, pewter, aluminum, brass,
lacquered surfaces, pearls or porous stones.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for the clear gel sunscreen PreSun SPF 30. I
used to buy it at Kroger but I can't find it there anymore.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dot Hale, Tucker, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another PreSun request: My dermatologist tells me to buy
PreSun Ultra Sunscreen for the most effective sun protection. It is
recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation and made by Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. But I'm having trouble finding it. Can you find out what
pharmacies might carry it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Brad Wolverton, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sunscreen request: At my daughter-in-law's request,
I am trying to find Bull Frog Sunblock for Kids. No one seems to
have it this year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Frame, Lilburn, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Kids of all ages need protection when going out in the sun.
We found both PreSun Ultra Sunscreen SPF 30 (4-ounce gel or cream
$8.99) and Bull Frog Sunblock for Kids (4-ounce gel, $9.99) at
Eckerd Drugs, 2325 Pleasant Hill Road, Duluth (770-497-4425).
PreSun contains Parsol 1789, which protects you from both UVA rays
responsible for wrinkling skin and UVB rays that cause sunburn. The
Bull Frog bottle has a neat green frog cap that will appeal to
youngsters, and the gel offers all-day UVA/UVB protection. The gel
smells like watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying to locate Ralston 100% Wheat Hot Cereal
since I moved back to Atlanta in early '99. Made by Ralston Foods,
a division of Ralcorp Holdings Inc. of St. Louis, the cereal comes
in a yellow and brown box. Any information would be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thomas F. Moran, Suwanee, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Reader Moran knows his product. Like many cereals, this one
can be difficult (impossible?) to find. However, you can order it
from the company at 1-800-725-7866 or www.hotralston.com. A case of
six 20-ounce boxes is $14.32. Ralston has been making its milled
wheat cereal since 1896. During the '30s and '40s, cowboy Tom Mix
was the radio spokesman, when the box boasted the familiar
red-and-white checkerboard trim. Today's cereal cooks in a flash or
is microwavable. You can also use the cereal to make cinnamon
crunch muffins. The recipe is on the box.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While on our honeymoon in Australia, my husband got hooked on
Tim Tam cookies, made by Arnott's, which is owned by Campbell Soup.
We have tried everywhere, including Harry's, to find them, with no
luck. Are they sold anywhere in the States?
</P>
<P>
   _ Daphne
</P>
<P>
   Freeman,
</P>
<P>
   Buford, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: At first we thought a trip to Australia was in order. Then we
did a bit of digging and found Tim Tams in our own back yard _
Marietta. You can order those Arnott's cookies (also called
biscuits) through the Australian Catalogue Co., 1165 Allgood Road,
Marietta (678-560-6384). A package of 11 cookies is $3.60. The
company's Web site is www.aussiecatalog.com.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these treats irresistible to chocoholics? Try two
chocolate biscuits filled with chocolate cream and coated with milk
chocolate. Tim Tams are also available with a caramel filling.

 &HT;    Agency pushes for ads in airplane interiors
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Airline passengers would see advertising messages when
they reach for the overhead bins if an idea touted by a specialty
ad firm takes off.
</P>
<P>
   Advent AirAds has Federal Aviation Administration approval to
market placards that would be stuck on overhead bins. It hopes
airlines will jump on the idea as a way of raising revenue from
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the firm, based near St. Louis, has signed up only
tiny Vanguard Airlines, which will have the placards in all 15 of
its planes by Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Atlanta's two biggest carriers, Delta and AirTran, buy
into the idea remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta has recently completed a tasteful refurbishment of all
the aircraft interiors,'' spokesman John Kennedy said. ``Delta
would probably not be interested in an ad scheme of this nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It clutters up the airplane,'' said Tad Hutcheson, AirTran
marketing director. ``We have new 717s, and we're not ready to
clutter up the interiors just yet. But if Vanguard were to make so
much money and lower their fares, we may have to revisit the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Advent has FAA approval to place ad placards on bins in Boeing
737s, the most widely flown airliner, and is seeking approval for
other models as well. FAA approval is required to ensure the ads
wouldn't distract from safety-related information.
</P>
<P>
   Advent founder Bill Apel, who rarely flies, said the idea came
to him during a trip a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was looking at the luggage bins, I thought, 'What a nice
place to put some logo if it's done in a classy way,' `` Apel said.
``It doesn't take a brain surgeon to think up this ad concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline passengers are a captive audience. Atlanta-based Delta,
for instance, boards more than 110 million passengers annually.
Advent figures big carriers could make more than $10 million
selling space on bins.
</P>
<P>
   Buses and subways have long sold billboard space, sometimes with
gaudy, obtrusive messages. But the airline industry has allowed
only more subtle marketing, such as the Sky Mall magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Advent Marketing Director Marck De Lautour said the ads would be
``tastefully done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not obtrusive,'' he said. ``The misconception is that
they're like hot pink flamingo ads.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one airline, now-defunct Western Pacific, sold space on
aircraft exteriors, turning some planes into flying billboards. One
plane was festooned with characters from the comedy show ``The
Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta has a deal with Turner Broadcasting to paint a 737 flown
by its Florida-based Delta Express unit in a ``Powerpuff Girls''
design based on the Cartoon Channel show. Kennedy said it is a
``one-plane'' promotion.

 &HT;    Report suggests tech training for minorities
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Because of the large pockets of female,
African-American and Spanish-speaking workers being bypassed by the
boom in technology job opportunities, the country faces critical
talent shortages that could weaken its economic power.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a crisis that could harm scientific progress and blunt
the nation's competitive edge in the world economy, the country
must do a better job in attracting, preparing and retaining
minorities in technology industries heading into the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   These were key elements in a report released today by a federal
commission that has been studying the problem over the last year
and is now sounding a national call to arms to improve science and
math teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based panel _ the Commission on the Advancement
of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology
Development _ was created by a bipartisan duo, Rep. Connie Morello
(R-Md.) and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation's economic prosperity is due, in large part, to the
significant growth in science, engineering and technology
industries,'' said Elaine Mendoza, commission chairman and
president of Conceptual MindWorks Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``As these industries, which already face worker shortages,
continue to expand, we will lose our global competitive edge if we
do not expand the talent pool accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the commission's findings is that the demographics
(population projections) of the next 20 years show a growing
percentage of the young population pool being comprised of
African-Americans, Latins and others, as well as women.
</P>
<P>
   If these groups, which have so far largely failed to be drawn
into careers in science and technology, continue to lag in
participation, the nation's companies developing high-tech products
and services will be severely short-handed.
</P>
<P>
   In order to head off that prospect, the commission recommends
strong steps to focus better teaching on minorities, women and _
another underrepresented group _ disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically the commission called for the following:
</P>
<P>
   Higher standards of math and science teaching and curriculum,
which would boost the number of students in science and technology
from all sources.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing improved teaching on minorities and women, where
achievement has lagged.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying minorities and women in community colleges, and
cultivating them in greater numbers to move on to four-year
colleges in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Calling on states and federal agencies to focus student aid,
including larger Pell Grants to a maximum of $6,418, to support
minorities in science and technology education.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to improving science and math teaching, the
commission said it looks for specific ideas and strategies to be
contained in a report by another commission, the Glenn Commission,
by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   On a more general level, the commission endorses a campaign to
get industry support for diversity programs, and also to wage media
campaigns to improve the attractiveness of science and technology
careers.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the commission said surveys of companies toward
the end of the millennium disclosed the industry leaders pointed to
shortages in skills as the main barrier to growth.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that chief executives conclude that ``unless
U.S. firms can create home-grown technicians by increasing adult
training opportunities and by expanding college graduates in
computer and engineering programs, (companies) will move their
operations abroad or import talent from overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, industries are clamoring this summer for quick
passage of congressional legislation to expand the supply of visas
to allow more overseas technology talent to work in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The commission clearly placed the burden of improving science
and math teaching on states and localities, a major point of
emphasis in Georgia under Gov. Roy Barnes.

 &HT;    AS SUMMIT CONTINUES, ISRAEL SCRAPS ARMS SALE TO CHINA
 &HT;    With SUMMIT-PERSONAL-0713.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Hoping to plough fertile ground for the seeds of
peace, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak gave his word to President
Clinton that Israel would suspend a planned sale to China of a
sophisticated airborne radar system.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension set the stage Wednesday for day two of the Camp
David peace summit Clinton is hosting between Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters at day's end
that the parties took up substantive talks on the issues at the
heart of a half-century of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been real engagement today,'' Lockhart said. ``It's
been a very busy day on that front.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a policy of not discussing the daily heave-ho of
the summit, Lockhart provided no further details on negotiations
centered on the question of Palestinian statehood, the future of
Jerusalem, borders, Jewish settlers, territory, security and the
fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   He said, though, that it's been slow going so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have known all along that this was going to be a
struggle,'' Lockhart said, ``and it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ accompanied here by his daughter Chelsea _ met with
Barak in the morning, spent much of the afternoon conferring with
senior U.S. aides, and took a long stroll through the wooded
presidential compound with Arafat Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The president planned to spend the night Wednesday at Camp
David, and then turn the two sides over to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to manage Thursday, while he travels to
Baltimore to address the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's announcement Wednesday that it would halt the sale of
sophisticated radar technology to mainland China was an indication
that the talks were headed in a positive direction, and that
Israel, at least was in a concessionary mode.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had repeatedly urged Barak to scrap the planned $250
million sale of the Israeli-built Phalcon airborne radar system,
out of concern that it could upset the strategic balance of power
between China and its regional neighbors, particularly the island
state of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   There was also bipartisan opposition to the sale in Congress.
Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., had proposed cutting U.S. military and
economic aid to Israel _ nearly $3 billion this year alone _ by the
value of the planned sale to China.
</P>
<P>
   After Barak's announcement, there's ``no need to do that,''
Callahan told reporters on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to the U.S.-built AWACS system, the Phalcon allows an
airborne command center to monitor air traffic over an area
covering several hundred square miles, essential to coordinating
the operations of warplanes in a combat situation.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has criticized the U.S. position as unwarranted
intervention in Chinese affairs.
</P>
<P>
   With some 80,000 troops based in South Korea and Japan, however,
and strategic interests across the region, the United States
regards the system as a potential threat to Pacific Rim stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it's in the region's interest to see that
technology introduced,'' said White House foreign policy spokesman
P.J. Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to inform Chinese President Jiang Zemin of the
suspension, Barak cited this week's peace talks, saying the
U.S.-sponsored summit involves Israel's ``vital interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who told Clinton of the decision on Tuesday night, said
he was not cancelling the sale altogether, but rather placing it on
indefinite hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel will continue to look for ways to implement the deal,
in understanding with the United States, if circumstances will
change,'' Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, told reporters
gathered in this town to cover the summit at Camp David five miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton had sought to have the sale scrubbed, Lockhart
said the administration welcomed the decision to suspend the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an important issue to us and a subject of
continuing discussion at a variety of levels of the government,''
Lockhart said. ``Israel has made a decision here, they took into
account our security concerns. We appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed, though, that U.S. objections to the sale are
permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our point of view,'' he said, ``those security concerns,
and our overall concern for that system in the region, will not
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports in the Israeli press that the United States
had offered Israel compensation for the loss of the sale, Lockhart
replied, ``I'm not aware of any such promise.''

 &HT;    GOOD NUTRITION, GOOD DEFENSE AGAINST AIDS, YOUNG SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By LISA MICHALS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Genetically engineered foods may be used as a
temporary defense against AIDS in Africa, a former Carter
administration official told a Senate panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of a cure, what can you do to keep people
healthy? We have found that nutrition is a secondary defense for
AIDS,'' said former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young, now chairman of
Goodworks International in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Young said while keeping people infected with HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS, healthy through good nutrition is not a panacea,
it could be used to help victims cope through support groups as
well as work to keep victims as strong as possible in their battle
against the ravaging disease.
</P>
<P>
   According the the UNICEF children's agency, every minute HIV
infects six people under the age of 24 and many young people in the
worst-hit countries do not know they are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual Progress of Nations report issued at the
International Aids Conference in Durban, South Africa on Wednesday,
UNICEF said girls and young women worldwide were 50-percent more
likely to contract HIV than young men. And in sub-Saharan Africa,
almost half of girls aged 15 to 19 did not know that a person who
looked healthy could still be carrying HIV and pass it to them
through sex.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to combat such diseases and malnutrition common to
Third world countries with the rapidly developing
genetically-modified food science stands of good chance of
receiving support from the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   For example, genetically-modified rice enhanced with Vitamin A
is the bold new hope for combating some 2 million child deaths per
year and reducing blindness, both caused by Vitamin A deficiencies
and which affects some 500,000 children annually.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology is also boasted to improve the quality and
quantity of crops, and could prove a powerful asset to developing
Third world country farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State David Sandalow urged the committee
to look past trade conflicts with Europe over genetically modified
crops, and see that developing countries are asking for guidance
and support using science to address the problems of hunger,
malnutrition, disease, and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fight against hunger and poverty, the weapon of
biotechnology must be part of our arsenal.'' Sandalow said.

SMALL MERCHANTS AND FARMERS UNAWARE OF DEMOCRATS' ESTATE TAX
PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa., Fla.)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small-business owners and farmers whose Washington lobbyists are
ardent supporters of a Republican-backed plan to repeal the estate
tax seem largely unaware that President Clinton _ who has vowed to
veto the Republican proposal _ has said he will sign legislation
that would exempt nearly all of them from the tax starting next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners and farmers would be allowed to leave $2 million
_ $4 million for a couple _ to their heirs without paying estate
taxes under the plan favored by the president and the Democratic
leadership in Congress. The Republican proposal, which passed the
House last month with some Democrats' support and is being debated
in the Senate this week, would be phased in slowly, with the tax
eliminated in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Republican plan say the tax is so complicated
that eliminating it is the only effective reform; they contend that
the nation's growing wealth means that more estates will steadily
fall under the tax if it remains law under the Democratic
proposal's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, had the Democratic plan been law in 1997, the last year
for which estate tax return data is available from the Internal
Revenue Service, the estates of fewer than 1,300 owners of closely
held businesses and 300 farmers would have owed the tax.
</P>
<P>
   According to the data, 95 percent of the roughly 6,000 farmers
who paid the estate tax that year would have been exempted under
the Democrats' plan, as would 88 percent of the roughly 10,000
small-business owners who paid the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Republican plan become law in 1997 and the estate tax
been repealed , more than half of the tax savings would have gone
to the slightly more than 400 individuals who died that year
leaving an estate worth more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent estate tax experts said Wednesday that the
Democrats were offering a much better deal to small-business owners
and farmers, because the relief is immediate and the estate tax
would be eliminated for nearly all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the Democrats are making the better offer _
and I'm a Republican saying that,'' said Sanford J. Schlesinger of
the Kaye Scholer law firm in New York. With routine estate
planning, he said, the $4 million exemption could effectively be
raised to as much as $10 million in wealth that could be passed
untaxed to heirs. Only 1,221 of the 2.3 million people who died in
1997 left a taxable estate of $10 million or more, IRS data show.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist who is a leading
estate tax adviser to Midwestern farmers, said only a handful of
working family farms have a net worth of $4 million. ``Above that,
with a very few exceptions, you are talking about the Ted Turners
who own huge ranches and are not working farmers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harl said he was surprised that farmers were not calling
lawmakers to demand that they take the president up on his promise
to sign the Democratic bill.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be that in leading the call for repeal of the
tax, two organizations representing merchants and farmers _ the
National Federation of Independent Business and the American Farm
Bureau Federation _ have done little to tell members about the
Democratic plan. Interviews this week with a half-dozen people whom
the two organizations offered as spokesmen on the estate tax showed
that only one of them had any awareness of the Democratic proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the business federation and the farm bureau said
that if full repeal fails, they might push for approval of the
Democratic plan. But both groups say outright repeal makes more
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is not over the Bill Gateses of the world,'' said
Jim Hirni, a Senate lobbyist for the business federation. ``But we
have to eliminate this tax, because it is too complicated to comply
with the rules. Instead of further complicating the system, the
best way is to eliminate the tax, period.''
</P>
<P>
   A farm bureau spokesman, Christopher Noun, said the Democrats'
plan appeared to grant benefits that would erode over time.
``Farmers are not cash-wealthy, they are asset-wealthy,'' he said.
``And those assets are only going to continue to gain value over
the years. So while some farmers may not be taxed now under the
other plan, currently, 10 or 15 years out they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the proposal to repeal the tax dies in the Senate or is
passed and then vetoed by the president, it will become a powerful
tool for both parties in the fall elections. The Republicans will
be able to paint themselves as tax cutters who would implement
their plans if they could just win the White House and more seats
in Congress. The Democrats could try to paint the Republicans as
the party that abandoned Main Street merchants and family farmers
to serve the interests of billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   A vote in the Senate could come as early as Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   At the grass roots, however, those who would benefit from any
reduction in the scope of the estate tax take a much more pragmatic
view of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason I took up this cause is I do not want to see
another small family business get into the situation we are in,''
said Mark Sincavage, a land developer in the Pocono Mountains of
Pennsylvania whose family expects to sell some raw land soon to pay
a $600,000 estate tax bill to the federal and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   The independent business federation cited Sincavage's situation
as an especially good example of problems the estate tax causes its
members who are asset-rich but but short on cash. Facing similar
circumstances is John Kearney, a Ford and Lincoln dealer in Ravena,
N.Y., who said he ``got slammed pretty hard'' when his father died
last year. Most of his father's $1.6 million estate was in land and
the car dealership, and Kearney said he dipped into savings for his
children's education to pay the estate tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sincavage nor Kearney said he was aware of the
Democrats' plan to roll back the tax.
</P>
<P>
   But Kearney said his interest was in reasonable tax relief so
that merchants and farmers can continue to nurture their
businesses, not in helping billionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``No part of me has any sympathy for people with more than $5
million,'' he said. ``Would I feel terrible if all they did was
raise the exemption to $4 million or $5 million? I would say from
my selfish standpoint that we have covered the small family farm
and small business and thus we achieved what we wanted to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would still be asking: Is it really a moral tax to begin
with? And that's a point you can argue a hundred different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Loop, 72, who owns a wholesale decorative-plant nursery in
Jacksonville, Fla., said he favored repeal, partly because estate
tax planning is fraught with uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexity of it keeps a lot of people from doing estate
planning because they don't understand it,'' Loop said. ``And they
don't like the fact that they have to give up ownership of property
while they are alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Harl, the Iowa State University estate tax expert, said he had
heard many horror stories about people having to sell farms to pay
estate taxes. But in 35 years of conducting estate tax seminars for
farmers, he added, ``I have pushed and pushed and hunted and
probed, and I have not been able to find a single case where estate
taxes caused the sale of a family farm. It's a myth.''

 &HT;    AS SUMMIT CONTINUES, ISRAEL SCRAPS ARMS SALE TO CHINA
 &HT;    With SUMMIT-PERSONAL-0713.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Hoping to plough fertile ground for the seeds of
peace, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak gave his word to President
Clinton that Israel would suspend a planned sale to China of a
sophisticated airborne radar system.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension set the stage Wednesday for day two of the Camp
David peace summit Clinton is hosting between Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters at day's end
that the parties took up substantive talks on the issues at the
heart of a half-century of Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been real engagement today,'' Lockhart said. ``It's
been a very busy day on that front.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a policy of not discussing the daily heave-ho of
the summit, Lockhart provided no further details on negotiations
centered on the question of Palestinian statehood, the future of
Jerusalem, borders, Jewish settlers, territory, security and the
fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   He said, though, that it's been slow going so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have known all along that this was going to be a
struggle,'' Lockhart said, ``and it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ accompanied here by his daughter Chelsea _ met with
Barak in the morning, spent much of the afternoon conferring with
senior U.S. aides, and took a long stroll through the wooded
presidential compound with Arafat Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The president planned to spend the night Wednesday at Camp
David, and then turn the two sides over to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to manage Thursday, while he travels to
Baltimore to address the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's announcement Wednesday that it would halt the sale of
sophisticated radar technology to mainland China was an indication
that the talks were headed in a positive direction, and that
Israel, at least was in a concessionary mode.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had repeatedly urged Barak to scrap the planned $250
million sale of the Israeli-built Phalcon airborne radar system,
out of concern that it could upset the strategic balance of power
between China and its regional neighbors, particularly the island
state of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   There was also bipartisan opposition to the sale in Congress.
Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., had proposed cutting U.S. military and
economic aid to Israel _ nearly $3 billion this year alone _ by the
value of the planned sale to China.
</P>
<P>
   After Barak's announcement, there's ``no need to do that,''
Callahan told reporters on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to the U.S.-built AWACS system, the Phalcon allows an
airborne command center to monitor air traffic over an area
covering several hundred square miles, essential to coordinating
the operations of warplanes in a combat situation.
</P>
<P>

intervention in Chinese affairs.

replied, ``I'm not aware of any such promise.''

 &HT;    4 officers depart Flooring America
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The upheaval at Flooring America continues.
</P>
<P>
   Four top officers, including the new chairman, have joined the
exodus from the troubled Kennesaw, Ga.-based retailer as the
company tries to reorganize under bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Flooring America said Wednesday that Chairman David Nichols had
resigned after six months on the job. Nichols also had taken the
additional responsibilities of chief executive when A.J. Nassar
left the company in May.
</P>
<P>
   The new CEO and president is Michael Worrall, a retail
restructuring specialist. Worrall recently led a reorganization of
Tampa-based Sports &AMP; Recreation, which formerly operated as
JumboSports.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Nichols nor Worrall could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Flooring America filed for Chapter 11 protection and
planned to cut two-thirds of its corporate staff of 300. The former
chairman said the company would close roughly 300 corporately owned
stores to focus on its franchises. Flooring America has about 725
franchise stores that operate under names such as CarpetMax and GCO
Carpet Outlet.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Wednesday that three other officers resigned,
including the new executive vice president of operations, Jim
Frede. Also gone is Sue Salg, who was just promoted to senior vice
president of planning as part of the company's reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The chief internal auditor, Leonard Thill, has also left. Thill,
a former accountant with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
was brought in last fall to tackle the company's accounting
problems. The SEC has been investigating Flooring America's
bookkeeping practices following its downward restatement of fiscal
1999 earnings. The company also said in May that it would restate
earnings for each of the first two quarters of this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings restatement and bankruptcy filing have spurred a
series of shareholder lawsuits seeking class action status.
Meanwhile, the company's common shares have been delisted by the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Flooring America also announced that F.G. ``Buck'' Rodgers had
resigned after five months on its board of directors.

   ATLANTA _ In exchange for a cash payment, the estate of the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. dropped its lawsuit Wednesday against
CBS News over the rights to King's 1963 masterwork, the ``I Have a
Dream'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would disclose the amount of the payment, which is
considered to be a tax-deductible contribution to the King Center
for Non-Violent Social Change, in Atlanta. As part of the
settlement, CBS will retain the right to use its film of the speech
and to license it to others, although the network agreed to provide
information on how outside parties could contact the estate
``regarding the estate's claimed intellectual property rights,''
according to a news release issued by both sides Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   CBS also agreed to provide film of King's speeches for the King
estate's own productions.
</P>
<P>
   King's heirs sued the network in 1996 after CBS began selling a
videotape that included excerpts of the civil rights leader's
best-known words, delivered on Aug. 28, 1963, at a civil rights
rally at the Lincoln Memorial. The excerpts were part of a
five-volume documentary, ``The 20th Century With Mike Wallace,''
that was selling for $99.95.
</P>
<P>
   The family, which has long been criticized by scholars for its
aggressive profit-making approach to King's legacy, argued that
outside corporations should not be allowed to exploit King's memory
without giving a share to the estate. ``It has to do with the
principle that if you make a dollar, I should make a dime,'' said
Dexter Scott King, King's son and president of the estate, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, a federal judge in Atlanta ruled against the
family, declaring that the speech was a news event in the public
domain. The judge, William C. O'Kelley, noted that the speech had
been televised live and that the text had earlier been distributed
to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, however, a federal appeals panel in Atlanta
overturned that decision and sent the case back to the lower court,
saying CBS had not proved that the speech was not a performance,
which is entitled to copyright protection, as opposed to a
``general publication,'' which is in the public domain. King
copyrighted the speech a month after he delivered it to prevent the
sale of unauthorized recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's settlement means there will not be a formal legal
resolution of these issues. Both CBS and the King Family were
circumspect about the settlement, refusing to discuss any aspect of
it beyond the press release, which said that both sides were
pleased with the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer who represented CBS
in the case, said the settlement preserved the network's original
contentions about the public nature of the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``From CBS's perspective, this has always been about the
principal that they have right to use footage they take of news
events,'' Abrams said. ``From their vantage point, that principal
remains inviolate, and is consistent with this resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the settlement grew out of a meeting held earlier this
year between Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, and
Dexter King and Coretta Scott King, King's widow.

DESPITE MOVE, UBS EXECUTIVE IS UNDER THE GUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With PAINEWEBBER-MARKETPLACE) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Marcel Ospel, the chief executive of UBS in
Zurich, built much of his career by buying American. But while his
$12 billion deal to acquire PaineWebber Inc. gives his huge Swiss
bank a big new position in the United States, Ospel is in many
respects a man under fire.
</P>
<P>
   UBS, formed through the merger in 1997 of Union Bank of
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., has spent much of the last two
years struggling to find its focus and balance. Its previous chief
executive, Mathis Cabiallavata, resigned after UBS amassed huge
losses lending money to the ill-fated U.S. hedge fund, Long Term
Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   Ospel, 50, the former head of Swiss Bank, took over with the
goals of sharply reducing the bank's exposure to risk and
refocusing on what seemed to be its essential strength as a Swiss
bank with global reach: managing money for wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   But Swiss banking is under siege from global competition, as are
banks across Europe. Much of that competition is from Wall Street
investment banks, which have moved aggressively into the role of
advisers to top European corporations. Much of the pressure also
comes from the simple fact that the United States is the biggest
and probably fastest-growing market for affluent financial
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Although UBS is one of the world's biggest banks, with roughly
$1 trillion in assets under management, its vaunted private banking
business slumped badly last year. On Wednesday, UBS disclosed that
profits in its private banking area dropped 18 percent in the
second quarter of this year compared with the first quarter. In a
terse preliminary release of its second-quarter earnings, UBS noted
that ``preliminary indications are that net new money and asset
growth remain disappointing.'' That news comes three months after
Ospel ousted the previous head of private banking and announced a
broad restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Ospel has also been under tremendous pressure, from investors as
well as from some executives within UBS, to sell its investment
banking business, Warburg Dillon Read. That did not happen, despite
a flood of public speculation, but UBS did scale back on its
trading activities in the United States and many Warburg executives
defected to other firms.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber is supposed to solve these and other problems. Using
PaineWebber's network of 8,500 brokers, Ospel hopes to reach a huge
market of wealthy Americans, shore up his wobbly private banking
business and sharply increase UBS's total assets under management.
</P>
<P>
   UBS is paying a high price for PaineWebber, 47 percent above its
stock price before the deal was announced. To keep valuable
executives from fleeing, UBS has already designated $875 million
for incentive payments. And it predicts that restructuring costs
will amount to about $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that PaineWebber will not do much to help
Warburg take on the likes of Goldman Sachs or Merrill Lynch in the
frenzied arena of advising on mergers and acquisitions and in
corporate finance. Though Warburg has a strong investment banking
business in Europe, it is a secondary player in the United States
and PaineWebber's primary strength is as a retail broker.
</P>
<P>
   But industry experts said UBS did not have many realistic
choices in the United States, and PaineWebber's strengths should
complement those of UBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a lot of sense strategically,'' said Madeleine
Hofmann, banking analyst at rival Credit Suisse First Boston in
Zurich. ``UBS Warburg has very good people in private banking and
investment banking, but in the U.S. they really did not have retail
distribution. The major point is to build the affluent client
segment abroad, outside Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more lukewarm. ``It is not the ideal acquisition,
but realistically it is a close to the ideal as you can get,'' said
Bryan Crossley, a banking analyst at ABN Amro. ``It doesn't really
get them to the top level, but to do that you would have had to
acquire somebody like Merrill Lynch, which is a different
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ospel has considerable experience with American acquisitions. At
the former Swiss Bank Corp., he played a central role in 1995 in
acquiring SG Warburg, then a dreary spin-off from Morgan Stanley,
and in 1997 he acquired Dillon Read, then a boutique corporate
advisory firm. Swiss Bank also acquired two small but valuable
firms in Chicago. One was a derivatives firm called O'Connor
Associates, which gave Swiss Bank a solid base in what turned out
to be a profitable area of trading. The second was Brinson Asset
Management, a thriving money management firm headed by Gary
Brinson.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say that Swiss Bank, smaller and scrappier
than the Union Bank of Switzerland, did a good job of melding the
firms together and letting non-Swiss executives continue to build
those businesses on their own.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, Warburg Dillon Read might have sold for as
much as $18 billion if UBS had decided to sell it last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of UBS's problems reflect the rocky integration of Swiss
Bank and Union Bank. Cabiallavata came from the bigger but stodgier
Union Bank, while Ospel came from Swiss Bank. Cabiallavata pushed
through a grueling cutback, closing redundant branches and pushing
out many executives.
</P>
<P>
   When Cabiallavata resigned, taking responsibility for the losses
incurred on making loans to Long Term Capital, the hedge fund in
Greenwich, Conn., that lost billions on a failed strategy for
hedging global securities, Ospel took over and the bank came
largely under the management of former Swiss Bank executives.
</P>
<P>
   UBS's performance improved considerably in 1999, as net income
doubled from 6.3 billion Swiss francs, or about $3.9 billion. Much
of that gain came from Warburg's investment banking business, which
boomed along with the general boom in financial markets. But
profits in private banking shrunk 39 percent and the bank's
asset-management business lost many big customers.

A BETTER WAY TO BUILD A MISSILE DEFENSE

 By RICHARD PERLE    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Far from lamenting last week's highly publicized
test failure, advocates of a defense against ballistic missiles
should rejoice. The move to deploy an ill-conceived system
supported by the Clinton administration has been stymied, and the
prospect of a far more effective defense is greatly increased.
</P>
<P>
   The system that failed catastrophically in Saturday's test
conformed to the main provisions of the 1972 ABM treaty between the
United States and late Soviet Union. That treaty, which became
defunct when the Soviet Union collapsed, expressly prohibits the
deployment of national missile defenses and allows only a tiny,
highly localized defense based on old, ground-based technology. So
it is hardly surprising that a system designed to fit within it,
like the one the Clinton administration is recommending, would turn
out to be inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The system's inadequacy is inherent in its technology and
architecture. It relies on a small number of interceptors that must
be maneuvered with astounding precision to collide with incoming
warheads at closing speeds of 15,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Since each enemy missile may carry many nuclear warheads, along
with a large number of decoys, the 100 interceptors could be easily
overwhelmed. And the interceptors will have only one shot: there is
no chance to fire a second time if an interceptor misses.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the entire system depends on a small
number of ground-based radars, including one located on Shemya
Island in Alaska. If that single radar were destroyed, the entire
system would become inoperable. Surely nations capable of building
long-range ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads could damage or
destroy a large, immobile radar on a frozen barren island.
</P>
<P>
   If this technology is so fragile, why build it when the
potential exists for a far more effective missile defense system?
Unfortunately, the Clinton administration's primary concern seems
to be the defense of the ABM Treaty. Military effectiveness has
been subordinated to a 30-year-old treaty that administration
officials have referred to as a ``cornerstone'' of stability.
</P>
<P>
   A more effective system, although inconsistent with the treaty,
would intercept hostile missiles early in their flight, just after
lift-off, during what is known as the ``boost phase.'' Television
viewers familiar with shuttle launches have seen the booster rocket
lift the shuttle into space, its plume of flame burning brightly as
it rises gracefully into space. Similar rockets can, and do,
deliver nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   During the boost phase, missiles move relatively slowly. They
are easy to pinpoint: the intense heat from their rocket motors is
readily detected by space-based sensors. If hostile rockets are
intercepted in the beginning, during the boost phase, as opposed to
the ``terminal'' phase of the administration's system, there are
neither decoys nor multiple warheads to contend with. A successful
intercept destroys all the warheads and all the decoys before they
can be separated from the rocket that carries them into space.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a properly configured missile defense system protects
widely. A missile destroyed in the boost phase will never reach its
intended target _ whether it is Washington or Paris or American
forces abroad.
</P>
<P>
   One approach to a national missile defense would be to deploy
interceptors on naval vessels, possibly on Aegis cruisers, which
could then be positioned as necessary. Such a sea-based system
might work with satellites to provide a technologically
sophisticated system with global reach and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of this system argue that it would encourage the
proliferation of nuclear weapons and lead to instability. The exact
opposite is far more likely. Imagine a sharp rise in tension
between India and Pakistan. Both countries have nuclear weapons and
both have ballistic missiles. Suppose the United States could
dispatch an Aegis cruiser to the region with instructions to
intercept any ballistic missile fired by either side. Such a
capability in American hands would be highly stabilizing, reducing
the likelihood of conflict, discouraging the use of offensive
missiles, reassuring both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations, like Iran, Iraq and North Korea, are actively
trying to acquire missiles capable of attacking the United States.
Given time and money, a single missile, or even several, is not
beyond their reach.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose that we were to construct a defense that could
intercept all the warheads and decoys carried by 100 or 200 enemy
missiles. A Saddam Hussein or a Kim Jung Il would need that number
to be confident he could land a missile on New York or Chicago or
an allied capital. In that case, even a determined adversary might
well throw up his hands and conclude that such a missile force is
beyond his reach.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to protect against a missile attack is to
discourage our adversaries from building the missiles in the first
place. There can be no more powerful disincentive than to have a
shield that guarantees their hugely expensive programs will fail.
It is that shield, based on our most advanced technology _ not an
outdated treaty _ that will protect us best.

<P>
   Retrospective apologies can be a kind of psychopolitics that
makes the apologizer feel good without doing anything concrete
about the enduring consequences of past injustices. But the recent
apologies by two Connecticut companies, Aetna and The Hartford
Courant, have a singular virtue: They remind us of the usually
glossed-over participation of the North in America's slave system.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, many college and even some high school textbooks make clear
that slavery was embedded in every aspect of American life _ not
just Southern life _ from the early colonial era to the Civil War.
But museums and popular histories rarely give this fact the
prominence it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna and The Courant were apologizing for profits their
companies derived from insuring and advertising slaves in the 19th
century. But the economic participation of the North in the slave
trade and the use of slave labor went much deeper, even after
Northern states no longer allowed slaveholding within their own
borders.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere did the connection go deeper than in New York. How many
New Yorkers today know that when the South seceded, Mayor Fernando
Wood proposed that New York declare itself a free city, so as to be
able to continue to profit from slavery, as it had from its
beginnings?
</P>
<P>
   Slaves built New York _ and the rest of the country _ from their
earliest arrival here at the beginning of the 1600s. In 1750,
slaves represented more than 10 percent of the city's population;
and in 1712 and 1741, New York was the site of slave conspiracies.
Accounts of the city's rise to commercial prominence in the 19th
century rightly point to the Erie Canal's role in opening access to
produce from the West, but they don't talk about the equal
importance to the city's prosperity of its control over the South's
cotton trade. Because of this connection, New York merchants and
bankers were consistently pro-slavery, pressing during the 1840s
and 1850s for one concession to the South after another in order to
maintain their lucrative access to cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the North, too, textile factories relied on
slave-grown cotton, shipping interests carried cotton to England,
and banks and merchants financed cotton production.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities in Europe have begun to make a public display of
their historical connection to slavery. In Liverpool, England's
biggest slave-trading port, local museums candidly depict the role
of slavery in the city's growth. Nantes, France, another city where
much wealth derived from the slave trade, recently had a similar
exhibition. New York should more candidly acknowledge that much of
its early prosperity rested on slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   I am not proposing that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani issue a
retrospective apology. Far more valuable would be long-term
projects to increase the city's historical self-consciousness. For
example, when New York's history is taught in public schools, the
city's intimate link with slavery should receive full attention.
The city should have a permanent exhibition _ perhaps even an
independent museum _ depicting the history of slavery and New
York's connection with it.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Civil War, the economic value of slave
property was $3 billion in 1860 currency, more than the combined
value of all the factories, railroads and banks in the United
States. Much of the North's economic prosperity derived from what
Abraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address, called ``the
bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil.'' Lincoln
was asking Americans to consider the obligations created by
slavery. The first of those obligations is to acknowledge the full
truth.

closed at $178 a share. My counselor, Sherrie, said it was the
biggest opening-day pop in the ENTIRE cabin!
</P>
<P>
   Say hi to the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Amy
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mom and Dad,
</P>
<P>
   Our money people are REALLY mean!!! They said we weren't turning
a profit and probably never would! Stephanie told them we were
delivering eyeballs, but they were like, eyeballs are a dime a
dozen. And we were like, SOR-RY!!!
</P>
<P>
   Got to go. We're trying to get some second-round financing from
the Philippines. Hi dog.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Amy
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mom and Dad,
</P>
<P>
   Our stock went down to 45 cents, and Stephanie and I had to go
into Chapter 11 and fire everyone in the cabin. It is SO UNFAIR!!!
Our money people wouldn't even let us TELL them about the awesome
Super Bowl ads we came up with!
</P>
<P>
   I hate, hate, HATE camp!!! I miss, miss, MISS Pumpkin!!! PLEASE
TAKE ME HOME!!!!
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: THE YANKEES' COSTLY ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees made a contingency trade for Juan
Gonzalez. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees tried to make a trade
for Sammy Sosa. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees traded for David
Justice. They needed a pitcher. The Yankees on Wednesday traded for
Denny Neagle. He is a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Yankees, they did not allow George
Steinbrenner's wide-eyed desire for a big-name big hitter to prompt
them to clean their shelves of minor league and other prospects.
Instead of sending them in a package to Detroit for Gonzalez or to
the Cubs for Sosa, they delivered some prospects to Cleveland for
Justice, a creditable run producer, and others to Cincinnati for
Neagle, the best starting pitcher available in the weeks leading up
to the July 31 non-waiver trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Neagle acquisition was costly in prospects, but it was and
will be costly economically, too. The Yankees' timing, in fact, is
impeccable. Bud Selig, the commissioner with the payroll disparity
problem, has summoned the owners to New York for a meeting
Thursday. There they will receive the report from a committee
assigned the task of figuring out how to solve baseball's economic
imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are Exhibit A of a team that spends money with no
concern for the ramifications their expenditures have for their
poorer relatives. Maybe that's the way it should be. The Yankees,
after all, are engaged in a free-market, free-enterprise pursuit.
Steinbrenner is out to win championships and make money. If
spending a few extra million here or there produces a pennant and
an invitation to the October dance, by all means spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Neagle and his $4.75 million salary, the
Yankees' payroll, which passed the unprecedented $100 million
milestone when Justice arrived, climbs still higher to about $107
million. But that's not the only economic element at work here.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four minor leaguers the Yankees gave the Reds are
Jackson Melian and Drew Henson. When Melian was a 16-year-old
Venezuelan in 1996, the Yankees gained his services by awarding him
a then-unprecedented $1.6 million signing bonus. When they drafted
Henson two years ago, they got him for a $2 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Henson was a top-notch high school quarterback who intended to
play football in college. The Yankees made it worth his while to
leave his options open and play baseball in the summer before
playing football in the fall. Had they retained Henson and he had
opted for the NFL, they would have eaten the $2 million and not
suffered indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees have now taken that $3.6 million investment in
Melian and Henson and used it to secure a pitcher who could put his
left arm in their pitching dike and stem the tide that threatens to
sweep them away from their October goal. And, of course, the
Yankees don't want Neagle to work for them only for the rest of the
season. With his free agency looming after the season, they will
want to sign him _ and he's eager to accommodate them _ to a
contract extension to keep him around. How would $9 million a year
sound?
</P>
<P>
   The numbers that follow the dollar signs add to a big, big
total. With the Yankees, it doesn't stop. The printing press in the
basement at Yankee Stadium keeps pouring out the cash. If the
secretaries and the executives think they have it tough having to
be at their desks on time and not leaving a minute early in case
the owner calls, what about those little old men running the money
machine. They're not allowed to leave. Owners and executives of
other teams don't bristle at the Yankees only because they spend
money. They find the playing surface uneven because the Yankees can
afford to make mistakes, and most of them can't.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the international arena, the Yankees have signed Melian,
Alfonso Soriano, Ricardo Aramboles, Hideki Irabu, Orlando
Hernandez, Wily Mo Pena and Adrian Hernandez. If one or two of
those remaining players and others fail to make it, the Yankees
will balance the lost bonus against profits, shrug it off and
pursue another unproven Latin or Asian kid.
</P>
<P>
   Most other teams feel they have to be more protective of their
bonus money. They have to reduce the hit-or-miss ratio to as tiny a
number as possible before committing a few million here or there.
Who else last year would have given Pena, then a 17-year-old
Dominican outfielder, $2.4 million to sign?
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner usually cringes when the Yankees make yet
another move involving money (they all do, don't they?). Maybe this
move, though, he will welcome, considering the timing. Maybe Selig
can use this one, letting it incense the other owners to the point
that it induces them to accept some radical form of revenue sharing
the blue ribbon task force might propose, Steinbrenner be damned.

ISRAEL SAYS IT WILL CANCEL SALE OF AIRBORNE RADAR SYSTEM TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MIDEAST-MEDIA) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Israel announced on Wednesday that it had
canceled its sale of a sophisticated $250 million airborne radar
system to China, a decision timed for the second day of the Camp
David summit and designed to improve the mood in Congress where
heated opposition to the deal threatened aid to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The move was carefully calibrated by Israeli officials so that
they would be better poised to receive increased American military
assistance if some kind of peace accord is reached between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel informed President Clinton
of the decision on Tuesday night during a session between the two
leaders at Camp David, a spokesman for Barak said here.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli statement said that the deal, which had been underway
for five years, was canceled ``with consideration of the need for a
continued intimate relationship with the United States,
Administration and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who said recently he had spoken more than once to Barak
about the administration's concern over Israel giving military help
to the Chinese, welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel has made a decision here, they took into account our
security concerns, we appreciate that,'' said Joe Lockhart, the
president's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation was unlikely to have any direct effect on the
workings of the summit, where talks continued in what was described
as an informal atmosphere of casual dress and informal gatherings
at mealtime between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators. But in an
attempt to not overdo the informality, Lockhart said that reaching
a positive outcome was still going to be a ``struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent his second day with Barak and the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, but was scheduled to take a break for a
speech on Thursday before the NAACP meeting in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli decision to cancel the Phalcon airborne radar system
had been brewing for weeks as pressure mounted from senior members
of Congress, including some considered sympathetic to Israel, who
publicly criticized it. The planned sale of military technology to
China was particularly irritating, they said, given the strong
military relationship between Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's assurances that it was not providing American
technology to the Chinese did not mollify the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the cancellation, the Israelis avoided what could
have been an embarrassing debate on the floor of the House of
Representatives on Wednesday, where the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., was
preparing to bring up an amendment holding back $250 million in
assistance to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said he was glad that ``for the sake of United States
national security interests and, in fact, in the national security
interests of all our allies, such as Israel'' that the sale had
been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan had already brought his proposal to hold back the $250
million in aid before the Appropriations Committee where it failed.
The amendment was not likely to pass in the House either, but each
airing of the legislation provoked negative remarks against Israel
at a time when the Barak government is seeking more assistance.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's objectives at Camp David is for Israel to come
away with an upgraded military relationship with the United States
as compensation for risks associated with compromises with the
Palestinians. If a full peace accord is reached at Camp David,
Israel expects to get a significant boost in its defense
capabilities from the United States, including radar to detect
missiles from Iran and Iraq. This year's $2.8 billion aid package
to Israel includes $1.98 billion for military assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the Israeli government had tried to modify the
sale with the Chinese to calm the growing storm in Congress. Israel
has earned billions of dollars in arms sales to China in recent
years, according to arms experts, and was reluctant to cut off the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter from Barak to the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin,
laying out the cancellation, the Israelis expressed the hope that
there might be room for future cooperation, an Israeli official
said on Wednesday. The letter was delivered on Monday in Beijing by
the director general of the Ministry of Defense, Amos Yaron.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon began to protest to the Israeli government late
last year after a subsidiary of Israel Aircraft Industries mounted
the radar system on a Russian-made cargo plane destined for the
Chinese air force. The subsidiary, known as Elta, designed the
system Phalcon for the Israeli air force. A Chinese-owned
Ilyushin-76 outfitted with the radar has been parked at Ben-Gurion
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration said it was most concerned because
the system significantly increased the capabilities of the Chinese
to conduct operations in and around the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Israeli argument that a closer relationship with the Chinese
military would allow Israel to dissuade Beijing from supplying
weaponry to Iran and Iran did not win many converts in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress on Wednesday, there was wide support for the
cancellation but still caution. ``This is not a note of victory,''
said Fred Downey, a legislative aide to Sen.r Joseph Lieberman,
D-Conn. ``It's the Israelis coming to the right decision so we can
discuss the upgraded security arrangement,'' that would come in the
wake of a successful summit.

U.S. TV SHOWS FAMILIARITY BETWEEN ISRAELI AND PALESTINIAN
OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICK, Md. _ To American television viewers, it was probably
unremarkable to see Avraham Burg, the Israeli Parliament speaker,
and Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator, bantering, teasing
each other and debating peace issues on CNN's Crossfire on Tuesday
night. That's what guests with opposing points of view do on such
shows: they furiously argue in a stagey way that makes it
absolutely clear that they are sparring intellectually, not
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me finish, Avrum!'' Ashrawi said, using her opponent's
nickname, as she light-heartedly chided Burg, who bowed his
yarmulke-covered head, apologized profusely and smilingly bit his
lip, in perfect debate-show mode.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Middle East, Israeli and Palestinian officials do not
do this.
</P>
<P>
   The issues, bone-deep and highly personal, do not lend
themselves and the forums do not exist. Palestinian officials do
not traipse onto Israeli television shows and play bang-bang,
kiss-kiss. They do not appear at all.
</P>
<P>
   Close bonds between Israeli and Palestinian officials have
developed since the first peace agreement was signed in 1993. But
these relationships transpire behind closed doors; official
Israeli-Palestinian camaraderie is rarely publicly spied.
</P>
<P>
   So it was an absolutely startling sight for Middle Easterners
and Middle East hands here to watch the exchange on Crossfire, and
a similar one between Ashrawi and Yuli Tamir, the Israeli
immigration minister, on PBS's ``The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' .
</P>
<P>
   In the course of covering the Camp David peace summit, American
television was unwittingly exposing a reality that ordinary
Israelis and Palestinians do not get to see: the real familiarity
that is the fruit of a seven-year conversation between elite strata
of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The shows somehow made the conflict seem so manageable, like it
was just a disagreement over, say, defense funding between American
politicians. It made it seem like it could, after all, be resolved
by talk, by human contact between people who do live right down the
road from each other. It made it seem easier than it really is, of
course, but it pointed up just what makes this peace summit at Camp
David different from previous negotiations: the Israelis and the
Palestinians, unlike the Israelis and the Syrians or the two sides
before 1993, now know each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you saw a transition from what goes on behind the scenes
to national television,'' said David Makovsky, a senior fellow at
the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ``On the one hand,
it's remarkable. On the other, it's not such a big leap. To me, it
illustrates the best hope for why a summit like this could succeed.
Because each side knows the other, and knows the parameters of the
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   A clear illustration of how far things have come in a decade is
the first attempt by the American news media to place Israelis and
Palestinians together on television. In the late 1980s, Ted Koppel,
the host of ABC's ``Nightline,'' went to Jerusalem and tried to
engineer a conversation between the two sides at the Jerusalem
Theater. He succeeded, but only after agreeing to erect a kind of
fence between them on the stage, so that as Ashrawi then insisted,
the occupier could be separated from the occupied and it would be
clear that the conversation was neither routine nor normal.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the fences have truly come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, to see myself and Hanan Ashrawi, at the same studio,''
Burg said, shaking his head. ``We've been in the crossfire at home,
literally speaking, a couple of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Press, the host, tried to understand. ``A Palestinian
Crossfire?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Burg said, ``It was ...'' Ashrawi finished his sentence,
``... real live.'' Burg continued, ``It was real live crossfire in
Ramallah. Both of us at her place.''
</P>
<P>
   Burg, who is a religious Jew and a dove, went on, effectively,
to recognize the Palestinian state. ``If it walks like a duck and
it talks like a duck and it sounds like a duck, it's a Palestinian
state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Ashrawi interjected: ``A lame duck.''
</P>
<P>
   A gregarious, ambitious Labor Party politician who got his start
as an anti-war activist following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon,
Burg said he was explicitly trying to ``create a kind of covenant''
with Ashrawi, ``us against the extremists of both sides, not to
enable them to veto the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   The show conveniently ended before Ashrawi, a seasoned media
personality who can speak cogently and passionately about the
Palestinian cause at the drop of a microphone, had a chance to join
or reject the covenant. Since she has been expressing a very
nuanced critique of the peace effort in her role as Palestinian
spokeswoman this week, it would probably not have been easy for her
to embrace Burg's enthusiasm as wholly as he would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   In her appearance with Tamir, a political philosopher and a
long-time peace advocate, Ashrawi talked with great familiarity.
``It was like a reunion of two girlfriends,'' said Gadi Baltiansky,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak's spokesman. But the two women diverged
strongly in their outlook, and their ideological differences served
to underscore how unusual was their social ease with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Ashrawi talked about breaking down the psychological legacy of
the occupation that still colors the Israeli-Palestinian
relationship. She talked about how Israelis are approaching the
peace table in what she sees as a patronizing fashion, describing
themselves as ready to grant the Palestinians a generous deal,
``take it or leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a problem with this kind of mentality and I'm sorry,
Yuli, I know you very well and I have tremendous respect for you as
a friend and a woman,'' Ashrawi said.
</P>
<P>
   Tamir, in turn, said, ``I am surprised that Hanan _ if I may
call you Hanan, because we are good friends _ talks about
unilateral attempts to sort of impose a solution. We are here in a
summit talking together. I mean, Prime Minister Barak and Yasser
Arafat are sitting together and trying to find the most suitable
compromise for all of us in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Their ideological differences served to underscore the
effortlessness of their rapport. The dynamic, so newly displayed on
American television far from home, suggested both how far Israelis
and Palestinians have come and how far they have to go.

RESENDING TO CORRECT ACTRESS' NAME 
SUDDEN FAME LEAVES NICKELODEON STAR GRATEFUL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lindsay Felton is an upbeat teen-ager who talks quickly and
easily about her acting career and her plans for college and
beyond, speaking in sentences of a dozen independent clauses strung
together and sprinkling the conversation with girlish laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Caitlin Seegar, the sullen, streetwise girl she
plays on Nickelodeon's landmark drama series, ``Caitlin's Way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it to you?'' Caitlin probably would snarl at a
reporter's questions. ``And tell that guy to get his camera out of
my face!''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a difference between the 15-year-old actress and her role.
Since she broke into series television at age 8 as Ed Asner's
granddaughter and Haley Joel Osment's sister on the sitcom
``Thunder Alley,'' Felton has been told by directors and
photographers, ``Smile, Lindsay!'' or more often, ``Great smile,
Lindsay!''
</P>
<P>
   Now she's playing a troubled teen-ager, an orphan from the
foster care system of Philadelphia who, after one too many brushes
with the law, was ordered by a judge to choose between juvenile
hall and moving to Montana to live on a ranch with her mother's
long-lost cousin, Dori Lowe, and her family. She chose Montana,
seeing it as just barely the lesser of two evils.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlin is given to scowling and often confrontational, the kind
of kid who feels she probably isn't entitled to real happiness and,
if she senses it approaching, treats it with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Felton, who lives in Burbank, says she's put a bit of herself
into the Caitlin character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come out sometimes more than others, but I think there is
more than people realize, because I have to invest a lot to play
the character,'' Felton said. ``In some ways I'd like to be a
little bit more like Caitlin, and in some ways I would like Caitlin
to be a little more like me. We're both kind of rebellious, but she
just takes it to the extreme, whereas I am a little bit more mellow
about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   An illustration: Beside Lindsay's bedroom doorway is a small
piece of paper posted at eye level that reads, ``Do one thing every
day that scares you.'' Lindsay probably finds inspiration in it but
does not always comply. Caitlin, on the other hand, doesn't need
!ital!that kind of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   The job, if not the role, has Lindsay leading a double life
these days. From December through early June, she lives in Burbank
with her parents, two cats and a squawky bird, working on
home-schooling assignments and spending her free time in movie
theaters, in front of a computer or hanging with a close circle of
friends, most of them students at John Burroughs High School. She
swoons over the boy bands Hanson and the Moffatts, both of whom are
enshrined in her room amid a few stuffed animals, collectible
Barbies and books ranging from the gory thriller ``Hannibal'' to a
two-volume set of Shakespeare's plays.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by mid-June, she's off with her mother, Deborah Felton,
for a six- month stint in rugged, remote Alberta, Canada, where all
of the next season's 26 episodes are being shot. There she works
odd hours around the fickle weather to complete a half-hour episode
in four days' time, crams in three hours of schooling each weekday
with a tutor and, for amusement, passes time with her co-stars and
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't hear her complain about the lifestyle, not much
anyway. It's tiring and stressful, she admits, juggling the job and
schoolwork and being away from her Burbank friends for such a long
time. ``But the good definitely, definitely outweighs the bad, and
if it didn't, I wouldn't be doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Felton very nearly missed out on this role of her lifetime _ not
because she was the wrong type, nor because she was one of hundreds
of girls trying out for it.
</P>
<P>
   Series creator Tom Lynch, who also has made ``The Journey of
Allen Strange,'' ``The Secret World of Alex Mack'' and ``100 Deeds
for Eddie McDowd'' for Nickelodeon, says the lead character in this
pet project of his was meant to be a boy. The role still was
considered a male part just three days before the pilot was to
begin filming in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsay came in to read for the Griffen part,'' Lynch said,
referring to Dori and Jim Lowe's teen-ager, created as a girl but
ultimately cast with Santa Clarita resident Jeremy Foley. ``And I
said, `Give her the male lead (script), and she read it and she
nailed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said even with his proven track record with the top-rated
cable network, selling Nickelodeon on a series for 8- to
14-year-olds centered on a dark anti-hero was tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I wanted to do the first teen drama,'' Lynch said.
``And they said, 'Tommy, Tommy, do that funny stuff you do.' And I
said, 'It's important to me to do this show. I'm just coming to you
guys first.' So they said, 'Write the script,' and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said there was a lot of discussion with Nickelodeon's
executives on keeping the show true to his concept yet suitable to
Nick's family- friendly mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue always was how dramatic we can make it, how far can
we take it without alienating the Nickelodeon audience,'' Lynch
said. ``And we were both willing to challenge the audience and push
it further. But there are things we won't do. For instance, Caitlin
will never have sex, because your 6-year-old daughter may be
watching and I can't handle that responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, father of five kids ages 12-19, and the other ``Caitlin's
Way'' writers so far have succeeded in keeping the teen-agers'
dialogue and situations credible without straying into territory
that raises parents' eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Nickelodeon's done a good job of making a rebel that
anyone literally can watch and parents don't have to restrict their
child from watching,'' Felton said. ``(Language is) one thing that
Nickelodeon totally draws the line on. We couldn't say 'snot' in
one of the episodes. They really definitely are very clean in what
they write.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon's gamble with teen drama and Lynch's execution of it
have paid off. ``Caitlin's Way'' attracted 6.5 million viewers for
its premiere episode last March, a record for any Nickelodeon
premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining new episodes from the first season air beginning
July 23. Lynch says he has ``Caitlin's Way'' mapped out for 100
episodes or four full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months after the premiere, the series has raised
Lindsay's profile a bit, to the point where she occasionally gets
recognized in public, if not exactly mobbed. It could be a good
springboard toward her aspirations of studying at Yale or New York
University's Tisch film school, scoring a role or two in good
independent films, and ultimately hitting a Broadway stage.
</P>
<P>
   Her acting coach, Andrew Magarian of The Shop in North
Hollywood, said, ``She's a good actress, and it's within who she
is. I like her potential a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, reflecting on the happy, well-adjusted girl he found to
play the brooding one he created, sounds like a beaming father.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just a major star,'' he said. ``It sounds like a cliche
in the business, but she can really hold the camera. I don't mind
writing a three- page scene for her because I know she can handle
it.'' &QL;

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC PLANT RESTRUCTURING TO IDLE 1900 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Scientific Corp., seeking to lower costs to keep pace
with competitors, will idle 1,900 employees across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Natick, Mass. maker of medical devices said the move, which
will close plants in Watertown, Mass., Plymouth, Minn., and
Redmond, Wash., will be offset by some new hiring. Boston
Scientific will add about 800 jobs at its two factories in Ireland
and another 100 at its production site in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the restructuring will result in the loss of 1,000
jobs, or about 7.7 percent of the company's work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get any pleasure from having to disrupt 1,900 people's
lives,'' said James Tobin, the Boston Scientific president and
chief executive. ``But I have to do this to preserve those (jobs)
that remain.''
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment low and the job market brisk, Tobin said he
thought the workers let go ``will find their next jobs pretty
easily in this environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Operating with two shifts and a small overnight crew in four
separate plants, Boston Scientific's Watertown work force makes
angioplasty products used by doctors to clear clogged arteries. The
company attracted a large international work force, many of them
unskilled and new arrivals. The majority worked with their hands to
assemble surgical devices such as balloon catheters, stents and
guidewires.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who joined the company in March 1999, said the
restructuring was being done to cut costs and make Boston
Scientific more competitive. He said the cost savings will be used
partly to expand the company's research and development.
</P>
<P>
   One site to be abandoned in Watertown _ once the Boston
Scientific headquarters _ will house a corporate research and
development center, Tobin said. The building will also be home to
the company's Medi-tech division, which develops vascular surgery
and radiology products. Both Medi-tech and the corporate research
center are now on the Natick campus, and 100 employees from these
operations will move to Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new hires in Ireland and Miami, the company
said it would contract out some components to low-cost
manufacturers around the world. That subcontracting will enable
Boston Scientific to pare 800 jobs. The company will eliminate the
other 200 jobs by reducing product overlap.
</P>
<P>
   One example of overlap is in guidewires _ hair-thin strands that
steer catheters and stents through blood vessels to treatment
locations. They are now made in Watertown, Plymouth and Redmond,
but in the future will be made only at the company's Miami plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan arises out of a thoughtful and thorough analysis of
the strategic needs of the company,'' said Peter Nicholas, Boston
Scientific co-founder and chairman. Nicholas recounted how the
company has made a series of acquisitions and boosted employment.
Now with plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, the company will employ
12,000 instead of 13,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring moves will cost the company $45 million in
one-time charges, shaving 10 cents a share off this year's
earnings, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The moves will result in after-tax savings of $70 million next
year, $145 million in 2002 and $180 million in 2003, according to
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas and Tobin said some these savings will be invested in
research and development to prepare for future growth. Boston
Scientific has been criticized for not boosting its research
spending, which has been around $200 million annually for the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here is that a lot of people will be cheered
by these moves, and it is clear that Tobin has to increase R&AMP;D
spending which is another part of his mandate for change,'' said
Daniel T. Lemaitre, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Global Securites.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said Boston Scientific's profit margins still
trail far behind its major competitors _ Medtronics Inc. of
Minneapolis and Guidant Inc. of Indianapolis _ particularly in the
high-margin market for surgical stents.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin acknowledged that Boston Scientific still will rely on
Medinol Ltd. of Tel Aviv, Israel, for its most sophisticated
medical stents. Buying and reselling those stents results in lower
profits than its rivals which build their own devices. That won't
change much with Wednesday's manufacturing restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tobin is doing a credible job at bringing in operational
expertise to Boston Scientific and addressing long-standing
problems of high inventories, inventory obsolescence and high scrap
rates,'' said Andrew Jay, director of medical technology analysis
at First Union Securities in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company whose founders (Nicholas and John Abele)
were good at identifying market opportunities, developing new
products and being savvy in acquiring premier medical device
franchises. But as they expanded, they lacked operational
expertise. And that's where Tobin comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also hope Boston Scientific shares _ once a leader
among New England area stocks _ will regain their luster.
Wednesday's announcement boosted the shares $2.1875 to $26 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

BUSH RETALIATES AGAINST CAMPAIGN SLAMS BY GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Breaking his usual stride of positive
campaigning, Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
responded Wednesday to goading from Al Gore by accusing the vice
president of declaring war on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of reinventing government, Vice President Gore
continues to reinvent himself,'' Bush told a national gathering of
Republican and Bush for President leaders in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just this week he decided to attack the Congress, even though
he himself is president of the Senate,'' Bush said. ``He offered
more of the same, the same old sequel to a tired period of time,
four more years of a president at war with Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said if elected president he will be a leader who unites
Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``America understands if you want to get something done, you
must elect a president who can unite, who is willing to work with
both Republicans and Democrats to get something done.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush rarely mentions Gore by name in his campaign speeches, and
his campaign has put together a national convention that will avoid
traditional attacks on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush strayed from the game plan during his speech as he
responded to an attack Gore had launched this week against the
``do-nothing-for-the-people Republican Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore focused on an issue especially sensitive to Bush _ patient
protections. Gore said Bush needed ``to show us whose side he is
on'' and urged him to call congressional leaders to break a
deadlock on a national patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   The governor didn't specifically address Gore's attack, but
patients' rights have been a tender subject with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   His 1998 Democratic gubernatorial campaign opponent ran
television commercials attacking Bush for his 1995 veto of a
patients' protection act supported by the Texas Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended himself by noting that his state insurance agency
had implemented many of the protections in the 1995 legislation and
that those rules were adopted as state law in 1997. The 1997 law
allowed individuals to choose doctors within their insurance plan
but did not require insurance companies to provide freedom of
choice for doctors outside of a plan's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in his autobiography, A Charge to Keep, Bush dedicated
an entire chapter to defending the 1995 veto. And in February of
this year he ran television commercials that said, ``While
Washington politicians deadlocked, I delivered a patients' bill of
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke to his campaign leadership Wednesday as part of his
preparation for the national GOP convention that begins July 31 in
Philadelphia. He also met with former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the Republican leaders they should not grow complacent
because of his lead in public opinion polls. He said Gore and
President Clinton will do whatever they can to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running against a tough campaigner. This is going to be a
hard, close campaign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is I'm leading some of the polls. The bad news
is the election isn't tomorrow.''

GORE WOWS NAACP WITH SPEECH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Saying ``talk is cheap, it is deeds that matter,''
Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore won resounding applause
from an NAACP audience when he said that unlike his Republican
rival, George W. Bush, he has long championed their causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not asking you to read my lips. I am asking you to read my
heart and watch my feet and watch the work of my hands when joined
with yours,`` Gore told leaders of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   The remark alluded to the famous ``read my lips _ no new taxes''
pledge that George W. Bush's father, former President Bush, made
and broke before he lost the White House to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president never mentioned the Bush name, but filled his
speech with comments the crowd clearly recognized as references to
the Texas governor, who addressed the prominent national black
organization Monday. The previous GOP presidential nominee, Bob
Dole, skipped the NAACP convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gore suggested that Bush's speech did not make up for past
slights to the black community, including his visit to Bob Jones
University, a conservative Christian institution that has had
racially divisive policies, and his failure to condemn the flying
of the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the vice president said, he has long supported
issues of importance to African-Americans, such as affirmative
action, empowerment zones, education and health care reform. He got
especially strong applause when he vowed to fight racial profiling
as a law enforcement tactic.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned black Cabinet members in the Clinton
administration, some of whom attended the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a member of the NAACP. It's good to be home,'' Gore said.
``I have come here not just in an election year, but year after
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP plans to spend $8 million on voter registration and
education before the November election, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While the organization is officially nonpartisan, Gore clearly
was the favorite of the vast majority attending the convention. His
38-minute speech, almost twice as long as Bush's, was greeted by
cheers and numerous standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was far more restrained in its reaction to Bush's
speech, where he acknowledged that the Republican Party had not
always been sensitive to blacks' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader Julian Bond said that while the group
treated Bush respectfully, in the case of Gore ``it was an old
friend coming back home.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Gore, NAACP board member William Lucy alluded to
Bush's speech saying, ``Al Gore, unlike a lot of other people, has
not just discovered the NAACP. He has not just discovered the
problems of poor people, African-American people and people of
color.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy noted that Clinton has nominated more than 50
African-Americans for federal judicial posts.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks have been among the Democrat party's most loyal
constituencies, a voting pattern that even Bush and his advisers
conceded is not likely to be altered by the Texas' governor's
appeals to black groups.
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, NAACP president, said Bush's address to the group
was more of a ``tactical decision'' designed to appeal to moderates
in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said Bush's vague speech, in which he avoided hot-button
issues such as the Confederate flag and affirmative action,
probably went over better with those swing voters than with blacks,
who were looking for more specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a chance to hit a home run and he hit a single,'' Mfume
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking with reporters at the Texas Governor's Mansion,
indicated he was pleased with his NAACP appearance _ and with
Gore's attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked from my heart at the NAACP. I was honored to be
there,'' Bush said. ``He's talking about me, and I'm talking about
me, and that's the way I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, often criticized as a lackluster and disjointed speaker,
appeared energized by the enthusiastic crowd, and gave one of his
most animated and passionate pitches of the campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming the governor, he repeatedly suggested Bush has
been insensitive to black concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When James Byrd was dragged to his death behind a pickup
truck, the governor of his home state ought to at least heed his
family's pleas for action,'' said Gore. Bush declined to support
hate crimes legislation despite a request from the family of Byrd,
who was killed by three white men.
</P>
<P>
   He also alluded to Bush's refusal to condemn the flying of the
Confederate battle flag over the South Carolina Capitol. During the
GOP primary last winter, Bush said the flag matter was a state
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true test is whether you are willing to take a stand when
the Confederate flag is flying over a state capitol and you see it
needs to come down but you are afraid to speak out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of members who heard both speeches suggested they
believe Gore did a better job of addressing their specific
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush made a very safe speech. He did not make any commitments.
It's like `I'm here just to show my face,''' said Shirley McGee of
St. Louis. ``Gore had a different connection with the people. His
connection was `I care about you.'''
</P>
<P>
   After the NAACP speech Gore visited a ``brownfield'' site, where
he complained that the Republican-controlled Congress was holding
up legislation designed to make it easier for governments to
convert abandoned industrial areas into economically viable
projects.

LOSING THE PRESENT WHILE WAITING FOR THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Originally skedded as INTERNET-PERFORMANCE)  
 By BARRY SINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are nights in the theater, the opera house, the symphony
hall that earn the designation legendary. We've all heard about
them, or perhaps, with luck, even caught a few. And that, of
course, is the point. Beyond their momentary transcendence,
legendary nights linger largely because of their evanescence. What
becomes a legend most is the very fact that you had to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Television and the recording industry have, to some degree,
successfully intruded upon this prerequisite. Audiences beyond
those originally in attendance can now share great performances
either caught on tape or broadcast live. Still, it's a hit or miss
proposition. Sometimes, the microphones and the cameras are
present. More often than not, they aren't. But what about the
Internet? Can the Webcam actually make every live performance a
widely shared, even permanently preserved, event?
</P>
<P>
   For three nights at Avery Fisher Hall in May, the New York
Philharmonic, led by the conductor Andrew Litton, presented a
concert rendering of Stephen Sondheim's Tony Award-winning Broadway
musical ``Sweeney Todd.'' Backing a mixed cast of Broadway and
opera performers, fronted by George Hearn (replacing the indisposed
opera idol Bryn Terfel in the title role) and Patti Lupone
(delivering perhaps the performance of her career), the
Philharmonic responded to Sondheim's music with unexpected passion
and empathy. The audiences in turn responded with unrestrained
delight, raucously echoing the refrain crowed by the show's meat
pie-gorging chorus: ``God, that's good!''
</P>
<P>
   These concerts seem to have taken everyone involved by surprise.
Not that the merits of Sondheim's ``Demon Barber of Fleet Street''
have ever been in doubt. Even stripped to its score and only
modestly staged, ``Sweeney Todd,'' in the hands of a symphony
orchestra, maintained enormous dramatic power. It also revealed,
however, a musical richness and formal sophistication previously
suspected but never before so emphatically confirmed. Inside Avery
Fisher Hall, the significance of the occasion was unmistakable; for
Sondheim, further acceptance on his own terms in the classical
music realm; for the Philharmonic, a category-shattering expansion
of its musical embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Here were performances just begging for wider dissemination.
And, in fact, the Philharmonic seems to have done just about
everything possible to see that the concerts would be recorded and
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it could not secure either a public television deal or a
commercial record contract for the occasion. Only at the
instigation of the orchestra members themselves (who also
voluntarily reduced their contractual recording fees) was an
11th-hour audio tape of the concerts made, in-house.
</P>
<P>
   How and why these performances nearly went unrecorded sheds
light on the priorities of today's broadcast and recording
industries, as rampant corporate consolidation reconfigures them
almost daily. In fact, though, it is the looming presence of a new
competitor, the World Wide Web, that shadows this particular
``Sweeney Todd.'' For, just weeks after these concerts, 66 American
symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies, including the
Philharmonic, announced an agreement with the American Federation
of Musicians that would soon enable them to offer events like
``Sweeney Todd'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement establishes compensation terms for musicians for
performances made available on the Web, either through what is
known as ``streaming audio'' _ live music that cannot be stored by
listeners _ or as recordings that can be downloaded for a fee.
Thus, performances like the Philharmonic's ``Sweeney Todd'' might
one day turn up on the orchestra's own Web site. Though not
``Sweeney Todd'' itself. As Paul Meecham, the general manager for
the Philharmonic, recently pointed out, ``It would be extremely
time consuming right now to download `Sweeney Todd.''' And so these
concerts are history.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the ``Sweeney Todd'' performances by the
Philharmonic was conceived in November 1997, says Welz Kaufman, the
orchestra's former artistic administrator, as a coda to the
Philharmonic's four-year American Classics program, a celebration
of the works of 20th-century composers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweeney Todd'' was an audacious choice for the Philharmonic.
Its musical director, Kurt Masur, while an admirer of Sondheim, had
never actually heard the show before. Nonetheless, boosted by
Terfel's commitment to appear in the title role, the notion soon
gained Masur's approval, despite internecine carping by
Philharmonic administrators who were opposed to what they saw as a
sellout of the orchestra to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Deutsche Grammophon, Terfel's record label,
evinced a strong interest in recording the event. Contract
proposals were drawn up in meetings with the label's executives,
including Chris Roberts, the current chairman of its corporate
parent, Universal Classics Group (which, in June, was swallowed up
by the French conglomerate Vivendi as part of its purchase of
Seagram). Casting decisions proceeded in consultation with the
record company. Discussions were also entered into with Jac Venza,
the director of cultural and arts programs for WNET, to televise
the production as part of the PBS series ``Great Performances'' at
some future date.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December 1999, Deutsche Grammophon suddenly pulled out.
Venza and PBS quickly followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point?

   ``Several changes impacted the potential marketing and related
commercial viability of the record,'' Deutsche Grammophon announced
in a prepared statement filled with bold pronouncements and curious
inconsistencies. ``The project did not become a vehicle for
Universal/DG artists, as had been suggested early on; other
Universal artists (Renee Fleming and Luciano Pavarotti) did not
materialize; no future life outside of the recording was planned,
such as possible additional performances in other markets; a PBS
broadcast didn't happen; a definitive recording of the `Sweeney
Todd' Broadway company already existed; and, ultimately, the N.Y.
Philharmonic could not come up with a budget acceptable to Deutsche
Grammophon.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Venza was more straightforward: ``It was just
too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, nearly 15 years ago, when another Sondheim masterwork,
``Follies,'' was performed by the Philharmonic at Avery Fisher
Hall, PBS broadcast the event and a major record label, RCA,
released an accompanying recording.
</P>
<P>
   So what has changed since 1985?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the classical record business has changed. Corporate
conglomeration, coupled with huge crossover successes like Andrea
Bocelli and the Three Tenors, have virtually squeezed out more
adventurous classical recording projects, leaving behind an
industry that has largely lost its nerve. As Kaufman noted: ``The
recording not happening can be chalked up to the general crisis in
the industry. Yes, Bryn Terfel did leave the project, due to
illness _ an ongoing back problem that finally required surgery.
D.G., though, bowed out well before Bryn did. It didn't have
anything to do with not having his marquee name; it had to do with
D.G.'s own financial constraints. And that's across the board with
record companies and classical music today. No one wants to spend
any money.''

</P>
<P>
   The world of public television has changed as well.
Increasingly, PBS is more focused on a generation of younger
viewers uninterested in either the Broadway of Sondheim or the
orchestral music of the Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed is old-fashioned greed and its power to
rule out compromise. In that sense, it must be pointed out that the
Philharmonic also played a role in derailing its own hopes for a
recording agreement, as Kaufman indirectly acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole `Follies' experience, which many people point to as
a precedent, really wasn't a precedent,'' he said. ``RCA came to us
that time and said, we need the orchestra for this first complete
recording of `Follies' that we want to do. This time it was the New
York Philharmonic saying, we have this American classics program.
Sondheim is an American classic. Let's do `Sweeney Todd.' The
genesis was entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, to read between the lines, could one further difference
between the two events have been the steeper financial demands made
by the Philharmonic as the initiator of the ``Sweeney Todd''
concert, rather than as the hired band, for ``Follies''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' conceded Kaufman, ``it could.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, fine commercial videos of earlier productions of
``Sweeney Todd'' already exist, as well as original cast
recordings. And the Philharmonic has announced it will be pressing
10,000 copies of a limited-edition ``Sweeney Todd'' recording,
mostly for its own subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what does it say about our contemporary cultural
supermarket that neither PBS nor Deutsche Grammophon saw enough
potential profit in the ``Sweeney Todd''-Philharmonic collaboration
to bank on it?
</P>
<P>
   What it seems to say is _ insofar as posterity and performances
like these are concerned _ the Internet is the future. For now,
though, ``Sweeney Todd'' in concert at the Philharmonic has been
allowed to slip away, eluding all but a relatively few firsthand
witnesses and Philharmonic subscribers. It is a sadly ironic
kickoff for a century already defined by the promised ability to
reproduce music seemingly on demand. Obviously, that promise,
unfettered by either technical or commercial constraints, still
remains to be realized. Meanwhile, in this unfortunate instance, of
such constraints are legends made.

<P>
   Drivers have been paying almost twice as much for gasoline at
Kenneth Cerny's service station as they did a few years ago, but
Cerny is a poorer man for it.
</P>
<P>
   His Cerny's Midway Market sells gas under the Citgo brand in
Mukwonago, Wis., where prices soared to more than $2 a gallon last
month after pipeline problems and new federal clean-fuel rules
crimped Midwest supplies. Customers have been furious. ``All they
understand is what they see at the gas pump,'' Cerny said.
</P>
<P>
   But the price he pays for his gasoline has risen faster than the
price he can charge customers and remain competitive, he said. For
many independent operators, who own most of the country's service
stations and convenience stores, rising gas prices have brought
little benefit, and in some regions they have actually made it
tougher to do business.
</P>
<P>
   But elsewhere along the chain that takes oil from the ground to
the filling station, higher prices have meant sharply higher
profits _ for producers and refiners. Major oil companies are
expected to post average earnings growth of 121 percent for the
three months that ended in June, compared with the corresponding
period last year, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Exploration and production companies are expected to report average
increases of 371 percent. Even refiners, who have suffered through
two years of very thin profits, are seeing profits double or
triple.
</P>
<P>
   With a host of politicians, including Vice President Al Gore,
demanding an investigation of ``price gouging,'' the Federal Trade
Commission has started an inquiry into possible industry collusion.
But industry analysts do not expect the commission's investigation
to turn up evidence of illegal behavior in the United States,
largely because the huge profits can be explained by market forces.
</P>
<P>
   So why are profits up so dramatically in the oil and gas
business?
</P>
<P>
   Collusion, of sorts, has clearly played a role. The primary
reason crude oil prices have risen sharply _ the biggest factor in
the leap in gasoline prices _ was the decision by OPEC ministers in
March 1999 to curtail oil production.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two production increases this year, and Saudi Arabia's
plan to raise output by another 500,000 barrels a day, oil hovers
at close to $30 a barrel, almost triple the low prices of early
last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the price they are being paid rising sharply but their
costs remaining much the same, oil-producing nations and companies
are doing far better.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the largest producers in the United States have
raised their profits by about 6 percent for every $1 increase in
crude oil prices, said Bruce Lanni, an industry analyst at CIBC
World Markets.
</P>
<P>
   An even more dramatic turnabout has come in the refining
business, the middle step between pumping oil from the ground and
pumping gas into car. Refiners take crude oil and ``crack'' it into
refined products, including gas, heating oil and jet fuel. This is
done by major integrated oil companies, such as Exxon Mobil of
Irving, Texas, as well as by independents, such as the Valero
Energy Corporation of San Antonio and the Tosco Corporation of
Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Before gas prices started their rise last year, drivers reaped
the benefits of both low crude prices and slim margins for
refiners. For refiners, though, it was a very painful period, as
overcapacity and stiff competition cut profits, making last year
the worst for the industry in more than a decade, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Refining ``is just a horrible business,'' said Paul Y. Cheng, an
analyst at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But this year has brought at least temporary relief, and that is
not simply because of higher oil prices. Refiners profit if the
price of gas and heating oil rises faster than the price of crude.
That is what happened this year, analysts say, as strong demand and
low inventories allowed refiners to sell their product on the spot
market at higher and higher prices, which were then passed on to
the marketing companies, distributors and wholesalers that deliver
gas to the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Refiners use the term ``crack spread'' to describe the gap
between what it costs them to buy crude oil and the price they get
for selling gas and other refined products. As 1999 came to a
close, spreads were thin, but a late blast of winter in the
Northeast caused demand for heating oil to soar, boosting prices
and margins.
</P>
<P>
   Spreads improved further during the spring, as it became clear
that domestic inventories were low even as demand for gas was
accelerating with the strong economy and the approach of the summer
driving season. And they widened even more in May and June as low
inventories, supply disruptions and the federally mandated
introduction of a new type of reformulated gas caused pump prices
to soar, especially in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before, ``you had low crude prices and an oversupply, which led
to cutthroat competition and a period of companies trying to
liquidate inventories into a market that was oversold,'' said
Arthur L. Smith, the chief executive of John S. Herold Inc., an
industry researcher. ``That has reversed, and now you have high
crude prices to pass through, and you can pass them through because
inventories are down.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Refining margins across the United States averaged $6.64 a
barrel in the second quarter, compared to $3.27 last year,
according to calculations by Lanni. In the Midwest, where a
pipeline break and a shortage of reformulated gas caused the worst
spike in retail prices, margins averaged $9.45 a barrel for the
period _ topping $17 at one point _ compared to $3.18 the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Spreads ``this year are better than they have ever been,'' said
William E. Greehey, Valero's chief executive. ``We entered the
season with low inventories, demand has been strong and distillate
inventories are still very low.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, he and other industry officials say that while
the recent drop in wholesale prices has caused gas spreads to
narrow, a potential shortage in heating oil should keep profits
strong during the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say that by October, the nation needs
inventories of heating oil and other distillates of at least 135
million barrels to ensure that prices are somewhat stable during
the winter. Inventories are now at 109 million barrels, and with
many refiners still focused on capturing the wide spreads from gas,
it is not certain that heating oil inventories will reach more
normal levels by the time cold weather arrives. And since the price
of natural gas has also risen sharply this year, that is expected
to add to demand for heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is so tight right now that any refinery that goes
down is going to cause a disruption,'' Greehey said, ``and if we
have any kind of winter, we're going to see people complaining
about fuel-oil prices like they were complaining about gas prices
in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The recent drop in wholesale gas prices has brought some relief
to service station and convenience store owners, but it may be a
while before they recover from the whipsawing they suffered in May
and June, when prices charged by refineries soared.
</P>
<P>
   In March and early April, many retailers and wholesalers enjoyed
widening margins as refinery prices fell. But that reversed
quickly, and their margins contracted severely across much of the
nation, especially in the Midwest and West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The average national wholesale price of regular gas leaped 37
cents, to $1.19 a gallon, between April 13 and June 22, according
to Oil Price Information Service, which tracks gas prices. Over the
same time, the average retail pump price rose just 15 cents, to
$1.65. Owners of service stations say that their business is too
competitive to enable them to pass all their price increases to
customers immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the way up, retail tends to lag, so in a fast rising market
a retailer can get really squeezed,'' said Kevin J. Lindemer, who
tracks refining at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. ``When the
market starts to fall, it depends on how aggressive the competition
is, you can recover a little bit of that margin, but that's not
always the case.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Service station and convenience store owners have had to contend
with other problems. For example, in regions where station owners
shy away from requiring drivers to prepay, the number of
``drive-offs'' has soared, according to industry associations, as
customers apparently feel more justified stealing gas. Bill
Douglas, who owns nine service stations and runs a gasoline
distribution company in Sherman, Texas, has been losing $1,000 per
month in drive-offs at his largest stations. In at least five
states, new laws have gone into effect this year requiring people
who repeatedly steal gas to lose their license.
</P>
<P>
   And service station owners are getting squeezed in other ways:
With gas prices so much higher, the value of a typical station's
inventory has soared, making it more costly to finance. Many gas
credit cards often charge three percent of the transaction amount
as a fee, so station owners are paying more in credit card fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that I meet thinks I'm getting rich. They say, `I
bet your really enjoying these high prices','' Douglas said. ``But
cashiers take the brunt of it. They get insulted regularly.''

 &HT;    Braves, Ashby bank on change
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They hope they're getting the All-Star, the
right-hander who won 31 games the previous two seasons, the pitcher
who twice locked them up during the 1998 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Atlanta Braves hope. The Philadelphia Phillies
assumed much of the same when they, too, traded for Andy Ashby
during the winter. It didn't happen the first 14 weeks of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby comes to the Braves after enduring the worst funk of his
career. He was hustled out of Philadelphia after feuding with fans
at Veterans Stadium and informing team management he had no
intention of remaining once his contract expired after September.
</P>
<P>
   He also conceded that the fans at the Vet might have been
tougher than he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough place to play,'' Ashby said last month. ``I'm
not going to deny that. It's a tough place to play, especially when
you're scuffling. . . . It's frustrating when you put everything on
the line and still get booed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby, a National League All-Star in 1998 and 1999, went from
May 7 to July 3 with just one victory. His fastball, his most
reliable tool, which bores in on right-handed hitters, had
abandoned him. He was making more money, $5.9 million, than anyone
on the Phillies' roster, including ace Curt Schilling, but he
wasn't effective.
</P>
<P>
   The situation boiled over June 28, with scouts representing six
teams at the Vet. Pulled after allowing six runs in six innings,
Ashby began trading blue language with fans who jeered him from
behind the dugout. The Phillies had been fielding offers all month
for Ashby. That moment settled the problem. He could not remain
with that team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad. That's not the type of person I am,'' he has said.
``I shouldn't have said anything. But I got caught up in the
moment. I said a few choice words, the way (they were) yelling at
me. . . . I'm trying to get right, and it's not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Braves like the same things the Phillies liked
when they traded away three pitchers _ Carlton Loewer, Steve
Montgomery and Adam Eaton _ on Nov. 10 to get him. Just last
season, Ashby led the Padres with four complete games and tied
Baltimore's Scott Erickson for most shutouts in the majors with
three.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby had just strung together the first three 200-inning
seasons of his career. He managed his pitch counts so that he
worked into the seventh inning 40 times in his last 64 starts in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are hoping a clean break from Philadelphia will allow
that pitcher to re-emerge. Ashby just won consecutive starts for
the first time this year, allowing three earned runs in his last 15
innings.

A GEM HITS THE SCREEN IN `CHUCK &AMP; BUCK'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 4 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' pulls off the neat trick of subverting three
different genres in one movie, and doing so with considerable
warmth, humor and originality. This is a buddy movie about two
friends in heavy denial, a man-child film featuring an infantile
character with dangerous ideas and a stalker thriller with a happy
ending. Quite simply, it's one of the best films of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Mike White, fresh from the television trenches of
``Freaks and Geeks'' and ``Dawson's Creek,'' has written a script
that's thoroughly unpredictable and completely unafraid to explore
the darker undertones of its story without sacrificing its
essentially sweet tone. ``Chuck &AMP; Buck'' also skewers Los Angeles
and the desperate nature of performers better than any movie in
recent memory. Wannabe actors will howl with recognition.
</P>
<P>
   They also might howl with indignation, since director Miguel
Arteta has cast the film mostly with non-actors. Start with White
himself, who memorably plays Buck, a childlike young man who
becomes obsessed with his boyhood best friend, Chuck (Chris Weitz).
In adulthood the two are complete opposites _ Chuck has a
successful career as a record executive, a beautiful fiancee and
all the trappings of instant wealth. Buck still lives at home with
his mother in his old room, which is a monument to suspended
adolescence with its neatly displayed Matchboxcars and toy
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   When Chuck's mother dies, he calls Buck and invites him to the
funeral. The two haven't seen each other for 16 years, and the
reunion is as awkward as one might expect. Buck doesn't help
matters much, though, when he invites Chuck into the bathroom and
brazenly grabs his crotch. Visit over.
</P>
<P>
   But Buck isn't finished. He comes to L.A. and begins to follow
Chuck everywhere he goes _ work, home, restaurants. When Chuck
understandably begins to ignore him, Buck writes a play, the
hilariously bad ``Hank &AMP; Frank,'' and rents the theater across from
Chuck's office to stage it for one night. Needless to say, Chuck's
fiancee, Carlyn (Beth Colt, one of the film's producers), begins to
wonder about Buck and whether Chuck might be hiding something from
her.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out he is. One of the most fascinating things about the
movie is how both Chuck and Buck simplify the history of their
relationship. For Buck, childhood was the best time in his life;
Chuck doesn't even want to remember it. The film takes both
characters to a middle ground, suggesting that it is possible to
reconcile some pretty complicated issues.
</P>
<P>
   It's that hopeful spirit that makes the movie a refreshing
departure from the kind of independent films that typically end in
bloodbaths. White's script also creates imperfect characters that
manage to be believable in their frailties, but not unsympathetic
because of them. It doesn't have the hollow, misanthropic tone that
characterizes, say, Alexander Payne's work.
</P>
<P>
   Arteta shot the movie on digital video, providing the perfect
level of intimacy for his cast to take some interesting chances. He
has elicited a great many surprising performances, beginning with
White himself, moving on to Weitz and his brother Paul (the duo
directed ``American Pie'' and wrote ``Antz'') and extending to the
great Lupe Ontiveros, who plays Beverly, the theater manager who
directs Buck's play.
</P>
<P>
   Ontiveros' character is worth the price of admission alone.
Beverly is a wise, talented woman who has existed in the background
for most of her life waiting for someone to notice her _ much like
the actress herself. Her performance is just one of the many
pleasures of the satisfying ``Chuck &AMP; Buck,'' a film that turns a
quirky stalker into an improbable hero for our times. &QL;

LONG NIGHTS AND LONGER DAYS FILLED WITH MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Every year, around the summer solstice,
this faded imperial city steps back into the limelight. On those
long white nights, when the sun dips out of sight for only a few
hours, crowds gather on the banks of the Neva River, even shabby
hotels fill up with tourists, and at the venerable Maryinsky
(formerly, for a time, Kirov) Theater, the seats at the Stars of
the White Nights festival are taken up by rich patrons from all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the only time Valery Gergiev, one of the world's
most sought-after conductors and the theater's artistic director,
brings glamour to this gritty city with a pretty face, where
czarist palaces share streets with Dickensian squalor, a city of
giant potholes and columned facades, of high culture and low wages.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Gergiev, then hitting his stride as director of
the Kirov Opera, organized this festival in its current form with
14 opera and concert performances stretched over two weeks. This
year, the festival was extended to a month, and featured 45 ballet,
opera and other musical events, with two gargantuan productions _
Prokofiev's ``War and Peace'' and Wagner's ``Rheingold'' _ serving
as operatic bookends, and guest appearances by international stars
like Placido Domingo, Christoph Eschenbach and Riccardo Muti.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, there were vague rumblings that maybe, just
maybe, a month was too much. Even with the boundless energy
injected by Gergiev, who was here only half of the time, it was
hard to keep up a festival atmosphere for so long. Given that both
the Kirov Ballet and the Kirov Opera (the companies use their
Soviet-era names on foreign tours) were due for a five-week
residency at Covent Garden, and the ballet decamped for London in
mid-June, literally in mid-festival, there was also the mundane
question of the limits of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much more difficult to stay alive for a month, working
24 hours a day, than it is for two weeks,'' said one loyal but
tired Maryinsky employee.
</P>
<P>
   It may be, some here say, that even Gergiev has his limits,
although few believe his latest, almost ritualistic pledge to slow
down. Some worry, too, that the company, having shored up its
reputation abroad with a series of triumphant tours, is beginning
to show weaknesses at home, by relying too much on young,
unseasoned singers, by not channeling enough creative energy into
the ballet, by simply overwhelming its musicians.
</P>
<P>
   But as backstage grumblings go, this is small stuff. Gergiev may
not be the easiest conductor to work with in rehearsal, but it is
hard to find anyone who denies him his talent as either a conductor
or a manager.
</P>
<P>
   And in St. Petersburg _ the city that Gergiev, an Ossetian from
the North Caucasus by birth, adopted as a student at the Leningrad
Conservatory _ people have grown used to living with a whirlwind in
their midst and have even stopped marveling at the Maryinsky's
stepped-up tempo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of relationship can you have with a hurricane?''
asked the well-known St. Petersburg music critic Leonid Gakkel.
``There can't be any talk of love or hate. He is simply a force to
be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the festival, after a performance of Prokofiev's
``Fiery Angel,'' Gergiev marched a group of friends _ Italian,
German, American and British _ across the street for a midnight
supper in the theater's new and elegant private restaurant, where
burlap curtains are held back by pairs of pink ballet shoes and the
walls are hung with opera props.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly enjoying playing the host, the maestro fussed over the
menu, chided the waiters, critiqued the decor for its deliberately
half-finished look (``something like SoHo, no?'') and tended to his
guests, toasting them with vodka and listening attentively as they
rambled on about personal reminiscences of past operas.
</P>
<P>
   But when he could, he returned to a favorite theme: His role as
a cultural marriage broker. ``The festival is about what the West
can bring to Russia and what Russia can bring to the West,'' he
said in his perfect English, applying his fork and knife to his
white fish in a caper sauce.
</P>
<P>
   It is Gergiev's credo that friendship should be a two-way
street. It is not enough, he says, for the Kirov Ballet and the
Kirov Opera to dash around the world on back-to-back tours. It is
not enough for Gergiev himself to make regular appearances at the
Metropolitan Opera in New York (where he is principal guest
conductor) or the Rotterdam Philharmonic (where he is principal
conductor), or to accept invitations at the great opera houses and
festivals of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the bargain is that the West must come here.
``If I go to La Scala and they don't come here, that is not
right,'' he said. ``That is not real friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told this to Volpe,'' he added, referring to the Met's
general manager, Joseph Volpe. ``I said, `If you and the
Metropolitan don't come to St. Petersburg, I won't understand.' It
sounded like a joke, but it wasn't. I believe in friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   By Gergiev's reckoning, Russia _ so long held in isolation under
Communism _ now desperately needs to reintegrate itself with the
West, while the West just as desperately needs to discover the full
richness of Russia's half-hidden musical heritage.
</P>
<P>
   In this, the Maryinsky has been a trailblazer, blasting out new
ground like a high-powered tank, adding seven or eight new
productions a year to its repertory. It has resuscitated a
languishing Mozart tradition and revived an old Russian love of
Wagner, whose operas _ except for ``Lohengrin,'' which was staged
at the Maryinsky in 1982 and revived in a new production at the
festival last year _ had been purposely neglected by the Soviet
Union's cultural commissars after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryinsky was the first Russian company to jettison the
Soviet habit of singing all operas in Russian. Now its singers get
special coaching in Italian and German, and are able to give
Russian audiences their first chance to hear lyrics as they were
originally written.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, the Maryinsky has moved far ahead of its old Moscow
rival, the Bolshoi Theater, and Gergiev does not hesitate to gloat.
``I think the Kirov is good news for the Bolshoi,'' he said
brightly. ``It shows them that it is not just the Met that can make
a success. There is also the Kirov, right next door, that can do
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gergiev has done more than anyone else, too, to retrieve
Russia's own operatic heritage, reviving forgotten Prokofiev
operas, like ``The Fiery Angel,'' which in 1991 took this city by
storm with a finale overwhelmed by half-naked bodies writhing in
religious ecstasy, just a few months after the final collapse of
Russia's puritanical Communist party. Last year, it staged
``Sem-yon Kotko,'' Prokofiev's most Soviet opera, which swept
Russia's top theatrical awards at the Golden Mask festival in
Moscow last spring.
</P>
<P>
   He has also revived old Russian classics. He brought home a
production of ``Boris Godunov'' that had been directed at Covent
Garden by the brilliant and doomed Russian filmmaker Andrei
Tarkovsky, breaking with a Soviet tradition that treated operas
like pieces of petrified wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, there was no thought given to rejuvenating the
repertoire or giving it any individual interpretation,'' said
Mikhail Bialik, a professor at the St. Petersburg State
Conservatory. ``Most important was finding the correct way to
present an opera, and once it was found, it was left alone.'' The
Kirov's production of Glinka's ``Ruslan and Ludmila,'' he added,
had not been touched for 90 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Gergiev's immediate predecessor, Yuri Temirkanov, made important
changes to the repertory, but when Gergiev took over in 1988 at the
startlingly young age of 35, he soon showed that he was ready to
take astonishing risks. ``He is not waiting for anything,'' Gakkel
said. ``He is not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Gergiev prides himself on having concentrated his energy on the
revival of the Maryinsky Theater. And typically, he has big plans
for the future: To expand the theater across the canal that runs
behind it, not to mention an even more ambitious scheme for a
performing-arts center to be built on New Holland, one of St.
Petersburg's many islands, now occupied by the Russian Navy.
</P>
<P>
   His relations to the city are a bit complicated; his theater is
federally subsidized and needs to look to the municipal
administration only for token support. (It gave the festival $4,000
this year.) The city's current governor, Vladimir Yakovlev, a
former highways supervisor, takes more pride in filling potholes
than in attending cultural events (although he was in the czar's
box at the Maryinsky for a performance of ``Rheingold'').
</P>
<P>
   Built by Peter the Great as Russia's window on the west, St.
Petersburg has long seen itself as more cultured, more civilized,
better mannered _ in a word, more European _ than its rival,
Moscow. The rivalry has political overtones. St. Petersburg lost
its status as capital during the Communist period, but now, with a
native son, President Vladimir Putin, installed in the Kremlin, it
is being given occasional flashbacks of its former self-importance.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, now, Putin has chosen St. Petersburg as the place to
greet foreign visitors. Last March, when Prime Minister Tony Blair
of Britain came calling, the two spent the evening at the
Maryinsky, in the czar's box, watching the premiere of ``War and
Peace.'' The opera, staged by Andrei Konchalovsky, a Russian film
director with a string of Hollywood credits, packs a bombastic
patriotic punch in its second half, as the stage fills with loyal
sons and daughters of Mother Russia, ready to defy Napoleon's
invading army.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, St. Petersburg is on a roll these days, with the
Maryinsky providing the strongest push and Russia's greatest
museum, the Hermitage, offering another powerful draw. ``Semyon
Kotko'' was the Maryinsky's latest critical success; ``War and
Peace'' got a more mixed reaction from Russian critics, although
the barbs were saved mostly for Konchalovsky's staging, which some
found to be half Russian, half Hollywood, and featuring the worst
of both.
</P>
<P>
   With Temirkanov now at the Philharmonic (dividing his time with
the Baltimore Symphony), the quality of musical performances in St.
Petersburg is considered to be as high as ever despite a decade of
financial hardships.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in most other respects _ economically, in particular _ St.
Petersburg still lags far behind Moscow, a fact that may be
overlooked by the well-heeled tourists. Taxi drivers here say they
consider themselves lucky if they pick up a Muscovite. ``Muscovites
are no different now from Japanese or Americans,'' one driver said.
``They all have a lot more money than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gergiev knows better than most what it takes to manage a giant
company in this kind of environment. ``Russia is not an easy
place,'' he said. ``You cannot be successful in Russia unless you
go to the limit of your ability. Here a lot of things are done on
adrenalin. Adrenalin doesn't replace budget or talent, but it is
important, because without it, people can get so hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2 a.m. a couple of nights later, as darkness finally began to
fall on the banks of the Neva, Gergiev was wrapping up his last
performance of the day.
</P>
<P>
   He had breakfasted with a visiting German orchestra, led his own
orchestra in ``Boris Godunov'' at noon, and at 7 p.m. conducted
Stravinsky and Mozart at the Large Philharmonic Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The final act took place here on the river, during a dinner
cruise with several dozen Japanese, Mexican and American music
lovers: Members of Friends of the Kirov and members of a more
select group, personal friends of Gergiev.
</P>
<P>
   As the boat floated by faded imperial palaces into an evening
sky exploding with color, Gergiev, out of his concert black, with a
sweater dapperly draped about his shoulders, toasted his friends at
the head table: Among them Alberto W. Vilar, a wealthy investment
manager and, since 1998, the Maryinsky's most generous individual
sponsor. The toasts were out of earshot of the other guests, but it
is safe to assume that Gergiev thanked his friends for their
support, because without them, the White Nights festival simply
could never happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The festival, it is a killer,'' Gergiev, 47, said later,
suddenly looking weary at the end of this, his second in a series
of such midnight cruises. ``But we want to be able to invite our
friends here, and we want them to love it. I never ask them for
money, never. But they want to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy for Gergiev to say, and practically impossible for
any other leading cultural figure in Russia today. It is what makes
him and his theater and his festival special, and it is one reason
he has become such a magnet for musicians, singers and ballet
dancers not only from across Russia or the former Soviet Union but
also from the West.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when cultural institutions around the former
Soviet Union were suddenly cast adrift, Gergiev went on an active
recruiting campaign, picking up the best singers from operas in
Kiev in Ukraine, Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan and other capitals of former
Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first moves back then was to increase the artistic
staff by 30 percent. The total work force now is a hefty 2,000. The
Maryinsky has two full-fledged orchestras, plus its own youth
orchestra and a host of new and old opera stars, which give it the
luxury _ and the glory _ of virtually nonstop world touring.
</P>
<P>
   One vehicle for the training of future Maryinsky stars is an
academy for young singers, directed by Larisa Gergieva, the
maestro's sister, which provides accomplished singers with a
secondary education that focuses on acting, language coaching and
``general culture,'' an attempt to broaden out the old Soviet
narrow-gauge star system.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of skimpy Russian budgets, foreign tours are what
keep the theater thriving, and its artists and musicians alive: On
state subsidies alone, their regular salaries would be a paltry
2,500 rubles, or about $80, a month. When abroad, the Maryinsky
artists earn fees approaching Western salary levels.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure quality, Gergiev says, the Kirov Ballet and the Kirov
Opera have to be global. To be global, he has to offer quality. To
have both quality and travel, he needs sponsors who will underwrite
the theater's big, bold productions like the gargantuan $3 million
``War and Peace,'' by far the theater's most lavish production to
date, and the long-awaited premiere of ``Das Rheingold.'' Gergiev's
third Wagner production, the ``Rheingold'' is, moreover, merely the
first installment of a ``Ring'' cycle, which he hopes to complete
by 2003, when St. Petersburg celebrates its 300th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   And he has found those supporters: Individuals like Vilar, who
has sponsored ``War and Peace'' as well as the Maryinsky's youth
orchestra and its academy for young singers; foreign corporations
like Philips (the general sponsor of Stars of the White Nights, and
the Kirov's exclusive record label, Siemens (the sponsor of the
Maryinsky Ballet's premiere this year of George Balanchine's
``Jewels'') and Daimler-Chrysler (the underwriter of the entire
Wagner ``Ring''); and a few Russian companies, including the local
brewery Baltica and the gas monopoly Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   For a theater that until a decade ago was entirely dependent on
the government for money, the Maryinsky's success at collecting
private sponsors is remarkable, not only by Russian but also by
European standards. And it is owed entirely to Gergiev himself,
whose near-demonic energy and magnetic charm are now legendary,
both here and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Gakkel, the critic, applies the ultimate test. ``There is one
very cruel way of weighing a person's value, which is to take him
out of the picture and see if it makes any difference,'' he said.
``In this case, it is very simple. If there were no Gergiev, the
Maryinsky Theater would not have survived.''

DECIDING LEFT IS BETTER THAN RIGHT, ARMSTRONG PICKS PATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Bruce Armstrong spoke to Cleveland coach
Chris Palmer Tuesday, but it was obvious that if he signed with the
Browns he would be their right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is a left tackle. A move to the right side would be
akin to a shortstop moving to first base. Some do it to extend
their careers, but for Armstrong, it was left tackle or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   So late Tuesday, Armstrong decided to sign a one-year contract
with the Patriots. And if he appears in 11 games, he'll have played
the most games in Patriots history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing for the Patriots was more meaningful to him than
anything else,'' said Armstrong's agent, Dr. John Geletka. ``This
shows you how much he wanted to play for the Patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line makes the Patriots look like prudent
businessmen. They cut Armstrong in February when he was scheduled
to earn $3.5 million, a $1 million bonus that was payable by March
1 and his $2.5 million salary. The Patriots elected to cut
Armstrong and absorb a $1.1 million salary cap hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots saved more money Wednesday by restructuring Vincent
Brisby's contract. The wide receiver, who will be starting his
eighth campaign with the Patriots, had his salary reduced from $1.5
million to $750,000 _ but with incentives that could bring it up to
$2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who played the final eight games with a torn left
anterior cruciate ligament, signed a $440,000 base salary with a
chance to earn about $1 million in playing time incentives. If he
should make the Pro Bowl, he will make another $750,000; if he
makes the Pro Bowl and leads the Patriots to a Super Bowl victory,
he could wind up with a contract of $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Bruce is looking at it is he's made about $8 million
the past two years (from his former deal with the Patriots) and
that this way he accepts this and he's able to stay a Patriot,''
said Geletka. ``Hopefully, there's a future there for him beyond
this year. If there isn't, that's something else we'll have to
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Having signed Armstrong, do the Patriots intend on giving him
his old job? After all, the team made other plans, having acquired
Grant Williams as a free agent from Seattle and toying with the
idea of Max Lane moving to that spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to do something like that, I don't think
Bruce would stand for that,'' said Geletka.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is expected to arrive in Foxborough Thursday to
undergo a physical.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots Wednesday began their four-day rookie camp. The big
camp begins Monday, with all players needing to report Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots announced the signings of lineman Greg
Robinson-Randall (fourth round), defensive tackle Jeff Marriott
(fifth round; three years, $896,000), defensive tackle David Nugent
(sixth round; three years, $862,000), and linebacker Casey Tisdale
(seventh round; three years, $849,000). Wide receiver Patrick Pass
(seventh round) had already been locked up.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Adriam Klemm (second round), running back J.R.
Redmond (third round), tight end Dave Stachelski (fifth round),
defensive back Antwan Harris (sixth round), and quarterback Tom
Brady (sixth round) are still not in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, Klemm, and Stachelski are all coming off surgeries.
Klemm will miss most of training camp with a lateral collateral
ligament tear in his right knee; Redmond, who is close to signing,
is returning from surgery to repair an inflammed tendon in his
groin; and Stachelski had minor knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Geletka said, in the end, the Patriots altered some of
Armstrong's incentives, but there was no dramatic difference in the
contract the Patriots offered more than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots offered a $440,000 base salary and increments of
$140,000 based on Armstrong playing 60 percent, 70 percent, 80
percent, and 90 percent of the offensive plays. If he accomplishes
that, he will earn $1 million, provided the team improves in one of
nine offensive categories (including wins, sacks allowed,
touchdowns, and the percentage of passes completed).
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots added $1.5 million in incentives related to the Pro
Bowl: $750,000 for making it, another $250,000 for making it and
the Patriots winning the Eastern Division, $250,000 more for making
it and the Patriots making the Super Bowl, and another $250,000 for
making it and the team winning the Super Bowl.

With jobs at stake, Astros' second half counts
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are trudging onto the back nine with a fizzle and a
whimper.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, doesn't every hack making the turn believe a
turnaround is just a 300-yard drive away?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly like golf,'' Astros skipper Larry Dierker said of
the post-All-Star-break breath of life. ``You can play so horribly
that by the time you get to No. 9, you almost don't care. But once
you get to the 10th tee, you think, `All right, I'll par this one
and then really start playing.'''
</P>
<P>
   This is presuming Dierker and the Astros haven't already torn up
the scorecard and thrown it in the drink. The Astros' front nine,
after all, was a steady progression of yips, pull-hooks, slices,
snowmen and snapped clubs.
</P>
<P>
   But today in Detroit the Astros approach what Dierker called
``our No. 10 tee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals have changed,'' he said. ``Sometime soon, I'd like
to sweep a series. I know that doesn't sound like much of a goal,
but if we want to start thinking about playing .500 ball, we have
to start somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the theme of the once-contending Astros. This team known
for shooting at the flags suddenly finds itself in a scramble. The
ultimate goal is finding players who can set a foundation for 2001
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Except for veterans Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell and to a degree
Moises Alou (although Alou continues to be mentioned in trade
rumors), the Astros' infield, outfield and pitching staff all will
be playing an entirely new game in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   It's a game of who will stay, who will go and about whom the
Astros still do not know.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Ken Caminiti is the most prominent veteran who
falls into the who-knows category.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti, 37, is on the disabled list after undergoing surgery
to repair a tendon on his right wrist and may well have to call it
a career at the end of this season. But Cammy's greatest qualities
always have been his toughness and a love for the game that never
seems to fade. Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   As for the who-will-stay part of the equation, no players have
done more to establish themselves than outfielder Lance Berkman and
catcher Mitch Meluskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more doubt that Berkman belongs in this league,''
Dierker said. ``Mitch is right there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Berkman's progression in the second half should have a
definite effect on Daryle Ward's Astros career and, to a lesser
degree, Roger Cedeno's and Alou's. With Richard Hidalgo also a
rising star in the outfield, the Astros' toughest decision figures
to be one regarding Alou, Ward and Cedeno _ and Ward for now looks
like the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   Alou has a no-trade clause in his contract, and Cedeno's speed
and defensive abilities offer more than Ward can provide. It's not
a stretch to believe Ward's future with the club hinges on how he
performs over the next 2{ months.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, it is Meluskey who has earned every-day status _ the
occasional defensive lapse notwithstanding. And though you wouldn't
have thought it last spring, Julio Lugo might be the 2001 regular
at shortstop, thanks to Tim Bogar's falling short of expectations
offensively and top prospect Adam Everett's still being at least
another year away.
</P>
<P>
   At third, Chris Truby will be in a make-or-break situation
similar to Ward's. Truby's defense has impressed, and he's hit for
average, but he needs much better power numbers.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, the second-half focus will fall squarely on the
shoulders of Octavio Dotel, Jose Lima and Wade Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, of course, simply needs to find the lost magic. Winning
his last game before the break was a good start. And Dotel has
Astros management practically giddy about the possibility of
teaming him with a healthy Billy Wagner in the bullpen next season
_ presuming Miller can establish himself as a big-league starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dotel can throw 95 or 96 mph three or four times a week,
then we would have a great situation,'' Dierker said. ``I see the
light at the end of the tunnel, and it really doesn't look that far
away to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the young guys now, it's kind of got me going again.
I inherited a team that finished second three straight years and
didn't do very much at all except watch, and we won three straight.
But now it's more intriguing, more of a challenge and stimulating.
It's also exasperating and frustrating, but this team is not that
far away.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of months, much has changed about this Astros team.
In more ways than one, it's making the turn.

STILL A SLY WIT, NOW MOSTLY FOR HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Repeating to correct reference to television show in 9th graf to
read: he mocked so devilishly on `TWTWTW.' Also correcting in 16th
graf, to read: a collection of songs contributed to the television
show and recorded live, etc.) 
(For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. _ His songs are the stuff of your fondest
adolescent imagination, subversive send-ups of the Boy Scouts,
religion, college cheerleading, pollution, plagiarism, prudishness.
They are twisted, erudite parodies of the perverse: a
necrophiliac's love song, a ``Masochism Tango,'' a nuclear military
march. Acid attacks on political expedience: ```Once the rockets
are up, who cares where they come down? That's not my department,'
says Wernher von Braun.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is a bit of a surprise on meeting Tom Lehrer, the
Harvard-trained mathematician-cum-musician whom the disc jockey
Barry Hansen has called ``the most brilliant song satirist ever
recorded,'' to learn that he seems a lot more like the gently
whimsical voice behind his children's songs for the television
series ``The Electric Company'' (about adverbs, spelling and
selfishness) than the sick-genius author of ``Poisoning Pigeons in
the Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, elfin, a bit stooped but slim and spry at 72, Lehrer is
nothing so much as sweet. Oh sure, he confesses to still composing
such questionable ditties as ``Bye-bye, Baby'' (about
``partial-birth'' abortion), though now strictly to appall himself.
He bemoans the decline of civility and grammar and the collapse of
the unifying liberal political consensus that made his songs of the
'50s and '60s seem daring and safely hilarious at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But he pines not at all for the performing career that made him
a sensation in nightclubs and concert halls (his last major paid
appearance was 33 years ago). He mourns not the muse that mostly
seemed to desert him after Vietnam and assassinations and Watergate
made it harder to be funny about serious things. Or, as he once put
it: ``Political satire became obsolete when Henry Kissinger was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should Lehrer be glum? He still spends the cold half of the
year in this beautiful college town at the edge of the Pacific,
teaching math for non-mathematicians (``math for heads,'' he called
it in the '70s) at the University of California at Santa Cruz,
where he has taught since 1972, after earlier stints at Harvard,
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wellesley College. He
still spends the warm half in Cambridge, Mass., where he first went
to Harvard as a precocious 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   And Rhino Records has just issued a lavish, three-disc boxed set
of his career oeuvre (R2 79831), including a handful of previously
unreleased recordings like ``I Got It From Agnes'' (you guessed
what ``it'' is) and ``Hanukah in Santa Monica,'' a hymn to Jewish
holidays that rhymes ``Shavuos'' with ``East St. Louis.'' (He
decided against a line that rhymed a body part with Passover).
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Lehrer says modestly of the enduring appeal of his
songs, which first saw the light in informal performances in
Cambridge, then on a 10-inch, self-released LP in 1953 and later in
the best-selling 1965 album ``That Was the Year That Was,'' and
have now been embraced by at least three generations of devoted
fans. ``When I made that first record, it was just to sell around
Harvard,'' he said. ``It never dawned on me that all these years
later, well, I wrote `Fight Fiercely, Harvard' in 1945 and the band
plays it at half-times now, 55 years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lehrer may stick to the blackboard and not the
microphone these days, but his gift for verbal distillation has not
deserted him. ``When I was in college, there were certain words you
couldn't say in front of a girl,'' he writes in liner notes for the
new collection. ``Now you can say them, but you can't say `girl.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer is not a recluse, though he resists all publicity unless
he has something to sell, refuses television interviews (because
he'd be asked to perform and then might be recognized in airports)
and acknowledges having encouraged rumors that he was dead, in the
vain hope of cutting down on his junk mail. Other rumors are
equally false, like the one attributing the end of his performing
career to a successful libel suit by von Braun, the German-born
rocket scientist whose ideological flexibility he mocked so
devilishly on ``TWTWTW.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Lehrer is a man who had his moment, enjoyed it, banked his
royalties and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel the need for anonymous affection,'' Lehrer said.
``If they buy my records, I love that. But I don't think I need
people in the dark applauding. It's nice to be reassured once in a
while, but a real performer has to do it over and over again. I
can't understand the Yul Brynner phenomenon, `The King and I' night
after night.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Lehrer added: ``I'm not interested in promoting myself,
or revealing to total strangers anything about me. That's not my
job. I read some of these things with people who will tell you all
about their abortions, and their affairs and their divorces and
their nervous breakdowns and their parents, and why are they doing
that? And I'm sure if you asked them how much money they made last
year, they'd tell you it's none of your business.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Lehrer, a lifelong bachelor, grew up in New
York, where his father manufactured ties and his mother took him to
musical theater, igniting a passion that has never wavered. He went
to camp with a pretty fair songwriter named Stephen Sondheim, whom
he calls ``the greatest lyricist the English language ever
produced'' but whom he wasn't especially close to at the time.
``I'm two years older, and when you're 10, you don't hang out with
8-year-olds,'' Lehrer explained.
</P>
<P>
   Lehrer was also good at math, not uncommon for musicians. Asked
why, he replied: ``I could make something up. I think it has to do
with abstraction. I think music is the most abstract of the arts;
it's not representational. There's something mathematically
satisfying about music; notes fit together and harmony and all
that. And mathematics has to do with abstractions and making
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   Formalities like a Ph.D. and tenure eluded him, but Lehrer had a
gift for pastiche, borrowing and echoing musical styles and sources
from Gilbert and Sullivan to Danny Kaye. Indeed, ``Lobachevksy,''
his paean to plagiarism featuring the name of a real, dead,
nonplagiarist Russian mathematician, is itself one big inside joke:
``A direct plagiarism,'' Lehrer said, of a Danny Kaye routine about
Stanislavsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Lehrer canon, only about 50 recorded songs, falls into three
basic clumps: his first two albums from the '50s, with black-comic
parodies of various song styles and genres; the overtly political
satire of ``That Was The Year That Was'' (a collection of songs
contributed to the television program and recorded live at the
Hungry i. nightclub in San Francisco), and everything else,
including ``Silent E,'' his tribute to the transformative powers of
orthography (``Who can turn a can into a cane?'').
</P>
<P>
   The early, risque songs were well ahead of their time. ``Be
Prepared,'' his goof on the Boy Scouts, for example, ends:
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for adventure of a new and different kind,
</P>
<P>
   And come across a Girl Scout who is similarly inclined,
</P>
<P>
   Don't be nervous, don't be flustered, don't be scared.
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared!''

   ``Time Regained'' does as smart a job as could be expected of
bringing Marcel Proust's allusive prose to the screen. It doesn't
entirely work as a movie, and those who are intimate with
``Remembrance of Things Past'' _ all 12 of you _ will probably find
some fault in casting, compression or correlation here.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Raoul Ruiz's French-language film intelligently
and imaginatively strives to approximate the style and feeling of
the book, which concluded the seven-part, semi-autobiographical
novel. Ruiz works in bits from earlier chapters and tries, often
but not always felicitously, to clarify the saga's numerous
characters and their complicated relationships.
</P>
<P>
   It can't all be done, of course, with complete satisfaction, a
difficulty that unfortunately becomes most apparent during the
film's extended, glacially paced climax. This is the point at which
the narrator and Proust stand-in (Marcello Mazzarella) finally sees
through the facades and pretensions of the social elites he's
devoted his ebbing life to joining and, thereby, affirms his
purpose in life. By then, viewers are way ahead of him, having long
ago grown fed up with the narcissistic twits despite how
intricately Proust has described them, and the sequence can't help
but overstay its welcome.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time leading up to that disappointing musicale,
however, Ruiz keeps the cinematically minded viewer intrigued with
a vast array of formal gambits that nicely approximate Proust's
ever-shifting narrative connections. Set elements move of their own
accord as the camera prowls through sumptuously decorated Paris
apartments. The ringing of a servant's bell initiates a riot of
clanging recollections, culminating at a long-ago, far-away church
tower. There is a magic lantern tableau, human statues,
superimpositions three layers deep, mismatched cuts and high-wire
lighting schemes, among many other, densely packed visual motifs.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, faces, costumes and locations seem to morph
indiscriminately. It's all fundamentally playful (although,
tonally, the film's attitude is persistently grave), certainly
showoffy and quite effective at evoking the Proustian basics: the
unruliness of memory, the chaos of emotion and the disillusionment
of maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Though the story jumps around time with unfettered promiscuity,
the primary setting is Paris during and for a few years on either
side of World War I. It would take, well, a volume to describe all
the key characters and incidents. We'll limit our discussion to the
big names.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Deneuve slips in and out of view, her self-possession
a suit of armor, as the aging, well-marrying courtesan Odette.
Emmanuelle Beart is sufficiently, sadly unreachable as Gilberte,
Odette's daughter and the former object of Marcel's infatuation.
John Malkovich is the very definition of effete as the withering
but voracious Baron Charlus, while Vincent Perez brings subversive
energy to the bisexual musician Morel, whom the Baron and many of
the other married men in the story just can't get over.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean avant gardist Ruiz has lived and worked in France since
the overthrow of the Allende government in the 1970s. He is highly
regarded in international art film circles and all but unknown to
the American public. He says of ``Time Regained'' that ``all my
films have been a way of preparing this one.'' There is indeed a
career's worth of aesthetic acuity, in service to the most daunting
of challenges, on display here. It's an impressive effort even if
all goals, perhaps inevitably, are not met. &QL;

BRADLEY ANNOUNCES HE WILL ENDORSE GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley made it official
Wednesday: He will use the ``e'' word when he appears with Vice
President Al Gore on Thursday in their first joint appearance since
Bradley quit the presidential race in March.
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of the remarks he plans to give in Wisconsin,
Bradley posted a message on his Web site Wednesday saying, for the
first time, that he would endorse Gore. And he called on his
supporters to unite behind the vice president's candidacy for the
good of the Democratic Party and the principles Bradley campaigned
on in the primaries, including universal health care, gun control
and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, I will introduce Vice President Gore at a rally
in Green Bay, Wis., and endorse his candidacy for the presidency,''
Bradley wrote in the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is a place of many voices, but we all
share the same values,'' he said. ``It's why we're Democrats. I
firmly believe that as the nominee of the Democratic Party, Al Gore
is the best choice for president, and I hope and expect that he
will be elected in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's words and body language will be closely scrutinized by
Democrats and political analysts on Thursday because of the bitter
nature of his primary contests with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When he quit the race after failing to win a single state,
Bradley was sharply critical of the vice president's slashing
campaign style, asserting that Gore had repeatedly distorted
Bradley's ideas and record. And though he said at that time that he
would support the vice president's candidacy, Bradley pointedly
refused to use the word ``endorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers have said he will be far more enthusiastic
about Gore in their joint appearance on Thursday. But there is
little evidence of that in his Web site message. Instead, Bradley
talks broadly and idealistically about the differences between the
Democratic and Republican parties, while barely mentioning the vice
president, other than to endorse him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats know that ultimately government can and must
sometimes do the big things that individuals cannot do, the
nonprofit sector doesn't have the resources to do and the private
sector will not do,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley ended the message with a remark that some Bradley fans
have interpreted as suggesting that he will seek to play a
prominent role in the party if Gore loses in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to the Democratic convention in Los Angeles next
month, and I ask you to join me, if you are able, to be a voice for
the principles that our campaign stood for,'' Bradley writes.
``These issues, and the principles that underlie them, will outlast
any one national campaign. They are what we stand for as the
Democratic Party.''

 &HT;    Auburn-Bowden feud continues to smolder
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Terry Bowden accepted a handsome financial settlement
to step down as Auburn's football coach in the middle of the 1998
season. Fans of the school hoped that the embarrassing episode
finally had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   A war of words between the two sides recently played out in the
Alabama media has the potential to embarrass further a university
that already has taken many public-relations hits.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest controversy, Auburn contends that Bowden forfeited
parts of his settlement agreement, including the mortgage payments
on his $1 million home for the next three years, when he signed a
contract as a college football television commentator with ABC.
</P>
<P>
   That contract, according to a letter sent to Auburn alumni by
athletics director David Housel, pays Bowden about $225,000 a year.
Housel goes on to say that Auburn's settlement agreement with
Bowden expressly stated that Bowden would relinquish parts of the
settlement if he took a job related to athletics.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Bowden and his attorneys angrily countered by
accusing Housel of misleading Auburn alumni and withholding key
information about the settlement. In a letter sent to media
outlets, Birmingham lawyer Nolan E. Awbrey pointed out that the
settlement was negotiated specifically to allow Bowden to do
part-time work as a television analyst. Thus, the term
``full-time'' employment was inserted to describe circumstances
that would violate the agreement. Bowden contends that he works
part time for ABC as a ``free-lance artist'' and that his total
work load consists of about ``30 days a year.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Awbrey accused Housel and the Auburn attorney of
attempting to ``try its case in the media and sway public opinion
without making a full and fair disclosure of the true facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, the issue now will be settled
by binding arbitration. Each side will pick a member of the
three-member panel and will have to agree on the third. It might be
August before the hearing is held.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for Bowden, who left Auburn on Oct. 23,
1998, after compiling a record of 47-17-1. If he loses, Bowden
either will be forced to move out of his home in Auburn or begin
making the $7,000 monthly payments on the mortgage. He also would
forfeit the use of two cars provided to him and his wife, Shyrl, by
the Auburn athletics association.
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of his attorneys, Bowden will not discuss the
matter. But according to published reports, he thinks Auburn's
attempt to oust him from the house has been orchestrated by Bobby
Lowder, a wealthy Montgomery banker considered to be the most
powerful member of the Auburn Board of Trustees. Bowden has gone
public with some criticisms of Lowder and former coach Pat Dye,
something expressly forbidden by his settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Lowder has had no comment on Bowden's claims. Dye, who resigned
after the 1992 season, will only say that Bowden ``has talked
enough for both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Housel was on vacation Wednesday and could not be reached for
comment. But his letter to alumni and a letter sent to media
outlets by Auburn's attorneys, denies that the school is trying to
kick Bowden out of his home. Housel said the disagreement has
existed for more than a year and began when Bowden first went to
work for ABC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Auburn University has attempted numerous times to resolve this
matter amicably and in a businesslike manner for more than a
year,'' Housel's letter says. ``Auburn has lived up to the
agreement, and we expect Coach Bowden to do the same.''

   Caring for Fuchsia
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just purchased my first fuchsia, an expensive, beautiful
all red one. How do I care for it? Should the ends be cut back
after the blooms at the bottom fall off? Can cuttings be taken in
the fall for the following year?
</P>
<P>
   A. Congratulations! Only 7,999 more and you'll have almost all
the varieties. Meanwhile, keep the plant in a warm, semishaded
place, out of the wind. While it's blooming, feed it every other
week with a half-strength solution of balanced fertilizer. Water
just enough so that the soil stays evenly moist.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchsias bloom from spring to fall, but always on new growth. As
each branch stops flowering, cut it back to a strong node (where
you see incipient branches forming at the base of both leaves). The
plant will put out fresh branches and, in a month, another round of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   If your fuchsia was in a greenhouse and is now outside, don't be
surprised if it needs cutting back quite soon. The rude shock of
fresh air often makes these coddled beauties drop some of their
flowers. It's disappointing but not a disaster; the plant will
recover as soon as it adjusts. Re-potting often has the same
effect, so don't re-pot unless the roots are so crowded no soil is
left.
</P>
<P>
   Fuchsia cuttings root easily in spring and fairly well in fall.
Choose strong growing tips about four inches long that have three
or four pairs of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Clip off the set of leaves nearest the cut and remove any flower
buds. Dip the ends of the cuttings in commercial rooting hormone
(available at garden centers) and insert them in a bed of moist
sand or vermiculite. Make sure the node where you removed the
leaves is buried.
</P>
<P>
   Keep the cuttings out of the sun. Water from the bottom so they
don't get jostled. Don't overwater; rot is the most common cause of
failure. The cuttings should make roots in six weeks to two months.
When they do, pot them up promptly.
</P>
<P>
   Raspberry Pests
</P>
<P>
   Q. We have had a large patch of black raspberries along the back
fence of our yard for years. Recently, I noticed that the
undersides of the leaves of many of the plants were infested with
tiny white insects, causing the afflicted plants to turn yellow.
They don't seem to attack the fruit, but they're difficult to wash
off when they are on the berries. How can we treat these, short of
ripping out the whole patch?
</P>
<P>
   A. The insects might be glacial whiteflies, white apple
leafhoppers or any of several kinds of aphid, assuming, of course,
that they're not some variety of scale.
</P>
<P>
   There are two possible solutions, each of which will eliminate a
multitude of bad actors. One is to spray with dormant oil in early
spring, before the canes leaf out. If your predators are
overwintering as eggs on the plants, this will probably smother
them into submission.
</P>
<P>
   The second solution is radical cleanup, especially important if
you have not been cutting out the fruiting canes each year after
they finished bearing. Bramble patches that grow untended for long
periods often ``suddenly'' fall prey to diseases or insect
infestations that have actually been building up for years.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, cut all canes to the ground. Rake up everything and
burn or bury it. While you're in housekeeping mode, get rid of
perennial weeds like dandelions. After hard frost, mulch around the
stubs of the plants with a 10-inch layer of straw, salt hay,
compost, composted manure or any combination of these.
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, thin each plant to the three or four strongest
canes. When they're about four feet tall, cut off the top eight
inches or so to force fruit-bearing side branches. Black
raspberries fruit on year-old wood, so next summer will be
berry-free, but in 2002, you should get a bug-free, bumper crop.

SCAFFOLDS: SAY, WHO BLOTTED OUT THE SKY? 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN LELAND    
c .2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the ribbon of scaffolding and razor coils went
up around his building on 101st Street and Broadway a few months
back, Paul Byard took it as a harmless inconvenience. As an
architect, he'd been responsible for his share of those steel and
plywood constructions over the years. The awning was an eyesore,
but a temporary one. Then, walking down Broadway on a recent night,
he approached yet another makeshift overhang, this one more
isolated, an ad hoc darkened alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was grungy, scary, not well lit,'' Byard, a partner in
Platt Byard Dovell, recalled. ``And it was richly inhabited by
people with social problems.'' He considered crossing the street
but soldiered through, more annoyed than genuinely threatened.
``It's a nuisance,'' he said of the structures casting a shadow
over an ever-greater part of the city grid. ``You have to walk in
the street to get around it. It cuts off diagonals. And it makes it
awkward to jaywalk.''
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming the signature profile for much of the city: not
the grand Deco kitsch of the Chrysler building or the telltale
green canvas of Starbucks creep, but the unlovely clump of plywood
and metal tubing known in the trade as the sidewalk shed or bridge.
The Department of Buildings, which regulates the structures, issued
1,806 permits for sheds in the first six months of 2000, up roughly
80 percent from the same period just five years ago. Obstructing
sightlines and walking paths, squeezing already congested
sidewalks, the sheds have become pedestrians' analog to squeegee
guys, a minor obstacle replicated onto every street corner, at
least when you're in a hurry. ``They're out of hand,'' said Vanessa
Gruen, director of special projects at the nonprofit Municipal Art
Society, referring not just to the sheds but to the giant
billboards screaming from many. ``I think they're terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sheds come and go in a few months; others, erected around
buildings caught up in litigation or other financial entanglements,
can linger for years, without any sign of repair work above.
</P>
<P>
   So where, you might ask, is the outrage? New Yorkers, especially
those who sit on co-op boards, can come to blows over carpet
samples. Yet they have been strangely accommodating on the scaffold
question, accepting the civic intrusion as a twist of providence,
like car alarms or private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``One gets used to it,'' said Michael Blackwood, a documentary
filmmaker who has for more than a year lived behind a dark steel
mesh while workers restore the facade of his landmark 58th Street
co-op. Blackwood described the disruption as necessary and minor.
``It's like being sick for a while,'' he added. ``You go through it
and then you get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for shed spread are mundane. Contractors like Sal
Impieri, branch manager of Safway Steel Products in Brooklyn,
credit the strong economy for a boom in construction and
renovation. At the same time, the city's infrastructure is showing
the effects of a century of erosion and stress, developing
unfortunate creaks and cracks that threaten the pedestrians below.
There is no telling how many streetwalkers or billable hours have
been saved by a timely shed. Impieri, who works the high end of the
market, estimates that his business has grown 30 to 40 percent in
each of the last two years, a rise he described as common in the
industry. By his lights, the aesthetic impact of all that
scaffolding is not to be underestimated. ``When you're in the
business,'' he said, ``everything looks beautiful, whether I do it
or someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason for all the sheds may be bureaucratic. In
1998, after a fatal accident involving a scaffold in Times Square,
the city passed a regulation known as Local Law 11, calling for
inspection of all facades over six stories. The deadline for
inspection was in March. Once up, sheds can linger, sometimes for
several years. Landlords run out of money for repairs; contractors
leave for more lucrative jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like dealing with contractors on my own house,''
said Gary Larson, executive vice president of the Scaffolding
Industry Association, a trade group. ``I'm ready to shoot them.''
Scaffolding contractors set up the sheds, then take them away when
all is finished: It is up to all the other parties to get the work
done. Though scaffold permits last only a year, landlords can renew
them by attesting that they have not done the repair work. As long
as the shed keeps the sidewalk safe, the city doesn't penalize
landlords for not finishing the work.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent stroll up the Avenue of the Americas toward Herald
Square, Neel Scott emerged from the shadow of one rusty overhang
like a swimmer coming up for air before diving under the next.
Scott is a campaign coordinator for Transportation Alternatives, an
advocacy group for pedestrians and bicyclists; strictly speaking,
this disarray is his metier. ``That's just what I'm talking
about,'' he said, trying to squeeze upstream against a rush-hour
tide heading down. The shed's support poles stood about 2{ feet
from the building and 1{ feet from the curb, trimming the sidewalk
by about four feet. Sidewalk vendors hawked cheap toys and gadgets
underneath; a man oblivious to the crush slept under a ragged
blanket in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   For Zoltan Lebovich, the building's superintendent, this scene
was a vision of progress. ``Everyone likes it, they hide from the
rain. Even the homeless,'' he said, adding that the shed would come
down in four to six months, once the building was repointed.
</P>
<P>
   David Barone, standing in the shadow before his empty shop, was
less enthusiastic about the obstruction and the community growing
beneath it. ``People are missing the store,'' he complained, his
awning obscured by the protective canopy. ``It hurts, but what are
you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, some architects contend, is prettier scaffolding.
Michael Graves drew mostly positive responses to the aluminum and
blue polyester sheath he erected around the Washington Monument,
since removed in time for the Fourth of July festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after a 16th-century etching by the Roman architect
Domenico Fontana, the construction was a cover-up Washington people
could get behind; groups in Minneapolis and Richmond, Va.,
campaigned to move it to their towns for permanent display. Both
projects fell through, but Graves sees the restoration as a
possible lead to a new, decorative age of scaffolding. ``Think of
the advertising opportunities, or the opportunities for younger
artists,'' he said, speaking from a hotel phone in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Graves considers New York's current scaffold glut
an emblem of dynamism, not an aesthetic blight. ``My worry isn't
about the scaffolding, but that what you see when it comes down is
a disappointment. You think maybe the scaffolding was better.''
</P>
<P>
   The British writer G.K. Chesterton proposed that ``there is
something strangely primary and poetic about this sight of the
scaffolding and main lines of a human building; it is a pity there
is no scaffolding round a human baby.'' A warming thought, perhaps.
But then, Chesterton never had to squeeze himself under a cramped
midtown awning at rush hour, or return home to find his apartment
swaddled in steel tubes and marquee-size ads for a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, he did not live in New York City at the start
of the 21st century, looking up for the stars and seeing instead
the corrugated sheet metal of yet another sidewalk shed. If he had,
he might have viewed scaffolding differently. Or he might have kept
his head down and commented on it not at all.

A DAY TO RELAX, AND THINK ABOUT THE MOUNTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARPENTRAS, France _ The Tour de France took a day off on
Wednesday and the riders relaxed, slept late, did a little
training, entertained friends and families. Whatever else the 160
men left in the race did, anybody who said he did not spend some
time thinking about the giant of Provence, Mont Ventoux, was lying.
</P>
<P>
   Mont Ventoux, on the schedule for Thursday, is a 21-kilometer
(13-mile) climb past the treeline into a desolation of strewn rock.
It can be obsessive to Tour riders. Many of them have suffered
there, and one of them _ Tom Simpson, who suffered heat
asphyxiation, complicated by amphetamine use _ died there in 1967.
Few have climbed the mountain with the joy they find in the
Pyrenees and the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ventoux is a god of Evil, to which sacrifices must be
made,'' wrote Roland Barthes, the French philosopher, pioneer of
semiotics, sometimes windbag and full-time bicycle racing fan. ``It
never forgives weakness and extracts an unfair tribute of
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, wearing the yellow jersey as the overall
leader, may never have deconstructed Barthes' half-century-old
essay about the Ventoux in the collection ``Mythologies,'' but he
agrees with the sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a weird place, a very weird place,'' he said in a
recent interview, recalling his climb there in a race last month.
``It's the hardest climb in the Tour, bar none.''
</P>
<P>
   Barthes again: ``Physically, the Ventoux is dreadful. Bald, it's
the spirit of Dry: its climate (it is much more an essence of
climate than a geographic place) makes it a damned terrain, a
testing place for heros, something like a higher hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Over to Armstrong: ``Nineteen hundred meters up there is
completely different from 1,900 any place else. There's no air,
there's no oxygen. There's no vegetation, there's no life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no life,'' he repeated. ``Rocks. Any other climb
there's vegetation, grass and trees. Not there on the Ventoux. It's
more like the moon than a mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the place spook Armstrong? It did not trouble Eros Poli, an
Italian rider who was notorious for his lack of climbing skills and
who won a Tour stage over the Ventoux in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a 25-minute lead at the bottom of the hill,'' Armstrong
said indignantly. ``If I had 25 minutes, I wouldn't let it spook me
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut to Poli, nearing age 37, retired three years from the sport
and is a driver now for Fiat's VIPs at the Tour: ``The Ventoux did
scare me, but those 25 minutes I had gave me enough time to climb
it. I felt much happier coming down the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest day of my life,'' Poli said. ``It was a
dream and I realized it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another winner on the Ventoux is Tyler Hamilton, an American
teammate of Armstrong's with the U.S. Postal Service team. Hamilton
won the Ventoux stage, in which Armstrong was fourth, last month in
the Dauphine Libere, their final preparatory race for the Tour.
Hamilton also finished first overall in that prestigious race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult climb,'' he said. ``You need to have a
lot of respect for it, a lot of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   He defined that quality: ``You need to ride within yourself,''
meaning the rider should not long violate such physical limits as
his anerobic threshold, as he sometimes must for other victories.
``Some climbs you can attack at the bottom and hold it all the way
to the top, but this is a climb that I think you need to ride
definitely within your limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last six kilometers are very difficult,'' Hamilton said.
``When I attacked there with about a kilometer to go, did the 100
percent effort, I was suffering.'' Barthes would understand and
probably approve.

THE CHAOS OUTSIDE VERMEER'S QUIET ROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ``The Letter,'' the painter Jan Vermeer looks
through a threshold from a darkened room. The two women he sees
make no attempt to seduce the eye. Their presence is as
matter-of-fact as the domestic moment we have found them in, as if
they had joined the pictures on the wall and checkered floor tiles
as parts of a larger still life.
</P>
<P>
   It is the light that Vermeer casts on them, moving from left to
right and from an unseen window, that so fascinates us. As the
light brings the outside world in, it finds a seated woman holding
a letter, presumably just delivered. Letters preoccupy the handful
of pictures that survive this enigmatic 17th-century Dutch painter;
they reappear nearly as often as musical instruments and serve as
powerful metaphors. Indeed, the powerful tranquillity of Vermeer's
interiors is made possible by this very different message bearer
from without: The sunlight that filters in from a source beyond our
view. It makes sense that the painter's subjects so often write
letters, read them or receive them.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Andriessen's opera, ``Writing to Vermeer,'' which opened
this year's Lincoln Center Festival at the New York State Theater
on Tuesday night, wonders, as we do, what goes on beyond the walls
of Vermeer's parlors and kitchens. Peter Greenaway has provided a
libretto in which the women of his household write to the painter,
now on a two-week trip to The Hague from his home in Delft. The
imaginary letters bring everyday news, but this is 1672, perhaps
Holland's most cataclysmic year.
</P>
<P>
   The tulip market has collapsed. French and English enemies
threaten the republic. An accidental explosion has blown Vermeer's
hometown very nearly off the map. There is violence in the streets.
Andriessen and his co-directors, Greenaway and Saskia Boddeke, seek
to show us both the history and the art, as if the silence to which
Vermeer's pictures escape is best explained by the noise going on
around them. The stage flows with water, and occasionally milk or
blood. This large company, mostly women and children, bathe in it
or are doused from above.
</P>
<P>
   The finale is nothing short of a flood, pouring from above and
streaming down a raked stage that itself seems to float on a lake
of its own. Screens project fragments of Vermeer's work or a
writing hand. As the singers sing the letters (the text is in
English), we hear the scratching pen and read along as the words,
projected white on black, march across the stage floor.
Superimposed are animated scenes or intimate close-ups. Greenaway
does not wish us to be bored.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast is the watchword of ``Writing to Vermeer.'' The little
versus the big, the peace of isolation against public riot, time
brought to a halt against time racing frenetically forward,
theatricality next to modesty. These are not easy loads to bring
into balance, and one spends two hours in front of this opera
trying to figure out what it is about: A painter or a stage
director? Greenaway's audacity and imagination are usually welcome,
but here they bully Vermeer into inconsequentiality. If the
director's use of water represents the flood of events, it also
depicts the drowning of a painter under a high tide of theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is by design, the intention being to depict the
artist's peacefulness overwhelmed by sheer size. And this opera
does things big. Its three women are in turn played by three women
each. Such multiple images fill the stage with people as they
engage in busy, often spastic choreographies. Vermeer (who does not
appear) is presented in spirit with such bustle and crowding that
we soon lose sight of him. If ``Writing to Vermeer'' had become the
study in contrasts that it promises at the outset, Greenaway's
images would have had a point. Here they seem merely in
competition, and this is a director who has made sure we shall look
at him before we look at any picture on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   The opera is nearly rescued by its music, which is very
beautiful. There is a sense of song in Andriessen's writing that
for post-tonal composers has become both anachronism and anathema.
The lines are long, sinuous and gracefully balanced. The composer
has also transformed the sound and the style of early instruments.
The songs and dances of Sweelinck take on the Day-Glo of electronic
treatment or become warped and out of tune through the twist of a
dial. History is accented by synthesized explosions or sharp
thrusts. The Asko and Schoenberg Ensembles are in the pit,
conducted by Reinbert de Leeuw. Michel van der Aa has done much of
the electronic work. The singers are all women, and all do well.
Barbara Hannigan, Susan Narucki and Kathryn Harries are Saskia,
Catharina and Maria. Each has two dancing mirror images.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid and clever as this production is, and as musically
appealing as Andriessen makes it, ``Writing to Vermeer'' has a
difficult time deciding what it wants to be. I went home stuffed
with images of gushing waters and flowing blood and took another
look at ``The Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Andriessen's original idea was for a smaller, more modest piece,
but ambition seems to have had its way. Ambition indeed created a
brilliant commotion at Lincoln Center on Tuesday night, but
afterward, one looked again at the source, remembered the events
onstage and wondered what if anything could persuasively connect
Tuesday's opera with this tiny masterpiece of stillness, barely 17
inches high and 15 across. There are three more performances,
Thursday night, Friday and Saturday. They are in any case worth a
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The production originates with the Netherlands Opera.

FUGITIVE MOBSTER'S `SURROGATE SON' NAMES HIM IN MURDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Six months after leading investigators to a grave where
three bodies were unearthed, gangster Kevin J. Weeks has struck a
deal with federal prosecutors implicating his boss, James
``Whitey'' Bulger, in those murders and two others.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plea agreement made public Wednesday, Weeks admitted
that after joining Bulger's crew as a teenager, he helped Bulger
and his longtime sidekick Stephen Flemmi commit crimes and cleaned
up after them.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Weeks, 44, served as ``lookout'' on one
murder, held two men captive before they were killed by Bulger and
his cohorts, dumped murder weapons, and repeatedly buried bodies.
</P>
<P>
   When Bulger feared that the remains of three people he and
Flemmi had killed in 1983, 1984 and 1985 while working as FBI
informants might be discovered, Weeks helped exhume the bodies in
October 1985 and rebury them in a gully alongside the city's
heavily traveled Southeast Expressway, according to the documents
unsealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The gravesite remained a secret until January, when Weeks, known
as Bulger's ``surrogate son,'' turned on his mentor in a bid for
leniency on federal racketeering charges brought in November.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger has been a fugitive for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after months of secret negotiations, prosecutors
notified the court that Weeks will plead guilty July 20 to new
charges of racketeering, extortion, drug conspiracy and
money-laundering as a member of Bulger's criminal organization.
</P>
<P>
   He's also prepared to admit that he helped Bulger, Flemmi and
their associates in the slayings of five people between 1982 and
1985 while serving as a loyal deputy to Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for Weeks's cooperation, federal prosecutors have
agreed to recommend a prison term ranging from five to 15 years.
But Weeks's lawyer may argue for far less.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's decided to step up to the plate and square away his life
and move forward,'' said attorney Dennis Kelly, who represents
Weeks. ``He has no ax to grind against anyone and what he's going
to do is what the agreement requires: that when he's called upon,
he will tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Weeks is poised to plead guilty to charges that he served as
``lookout'' in the May 1982 murder of Brian Halloran, who was
gunned down just weeks after telling the FBI that Bulger and
Flemmi, both longtime FBI informants, were involved in a series of
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed in the shooting was Michael Donahue, who had the
misfortune of offering Halloran a ride home from a bar along
Boston's waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   The charges say Weeks helped others, including ``John Doe 1,''
kill Halloran and Donahue. While Bulger isn't named in the charges,
it's apparent from prior court testimony that he is John Doe 1.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Robert A. George, who represents the Donahue family,
said the family hopes Weeks's cooperation will help confirm
suspicions that rogue FBI agents warned Bulger and Flemmi that
Halloran was cooperating against him.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm not going to cry foul about the deal with Kevin Weeks,''
George said. ``If it wasn't for Kevin Weeks at this point we
wouldn't know as much as we know today. And I'm sure as time goes
on we'll know more and more. It's only going to help the Donahue
family get past all this.''
</P>
<P>
   The other murders Weeks has admitted involvement in are those of
Arthur ``Bucky'' Barrett and John McIntyre, and Deborah Hussey, the
daughter of Flemmi's longtime girlfriend. The remains of all three
were discovered in January in the makeshift grave.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, who was 46 when he disappeared on July 26, 1983, had
been involved in the 1980 Memorial Day weekend robbery of $1.5
million in cash and jewelry from Depositors Trust in suburban
Medford. Friends believe his murderers tortured him, trying to get
him to turn over his share of whatever was left from the heist.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre, who was 32 when he vanished on Nov. 30, 1984,
disappeared weeks after implicating Bulger in an ill-fated plot to
smuggle weapons to the Irish Republican Army aboard a Gloucester,
Mass. boat, the Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges say Barrett and McIntyre were kidnapped and
brought to an undisclosed location, where Weeks helped hold them
captive while they were murdered by John Doe 1 and John Doe 2,
apparently Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Hussey, who was 26 when she vanished in early 1985, was
kidnapped and murdered by ``leaders of the Bulger Group,'' then
Weeks assisted in burying her body, according to the superseding
information.
</P>
<P>
   Hussey was just a toddler when Flemmi began romancing her
mother, Marion, and moved them into his home in Milton, just
outside Boston. Marion Hussey and Flemmi had three other children
together.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources say Flemmi allegedly had been having a
sexual relationship with Deborah Hussey since she was a teenager
and they had had a falling out.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges against Weeks reveal that the bodies of Hussey,
Barrett and McIntyre were exhumed in October 1985 and reburied in
Dorchester ``to prevent the discovery of those remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's wife, Elaine, declined to comment on Weeks's admission
that he played a role in her husband's murder, saying only,
``Whoever did it should be brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Kevin Glynn, who represents the Barrett family, said
he'll be issuing a statement on their behalf within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre's brother, Chris, said, ``This is just too brutal to
put into words right now. He kills them and he buries them and he
digs them up and he buries them again. Can you imagine the horror
my brother went through that day.''
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern defended the deal with Weeks
Wednesday, saying, ``For the prosecutors and the investigators who
have worked on these matters for a long time, and we hope for the
families, this will be seen as an important step in the ongoing
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II has agreed not to prosecute
Weeks for the murders of Halloran, Donahue, Barrett, McIntyre and
Hussey.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Weeks will be placed in security while in prison
and has the option of joining the witness protection program after
he's released.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said he'll urge a judge to sentence Weeks to less than
five years in prison, if Weeks fulfills his promise to the
government to cooperate with authorities and testify at upcoming
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting that Weeks played only a minor role in Bulger's
organization, Kelly said, ``To the extent Kevin is pleading to
participation in the murders, it should be clear that he's not
someone who pulled the trigger or did any affirmative act to kill
somebody.''

   NEW YORK _ There are nights in the theater, the opera house, the
symphony hall that earn the designation legendary. We've all heard
about them, or perhaps, with luck, even caught a few. And that, of
course, is the point. Beyond their momentary transcendence,
legendary nights linger largely because of their evanescence. What
becomes a legend most is the very fact that you had to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Television and the recording industry have, to some degree,
successfully intruded upon this prerequisite. Audiences beyond
those originally in attendance can now share great performances
either caught on tape or broadcast live. Still, it's a hit or miss
proposition. Sometimes, the microphones and the cameras are
present. More often than not, they aren't. But what about the
Internet? Can the Webcam actually make every live performance a
widely shared, even permanently preserved, event?
</P>
<P>
   For three nights at Avery Fisher Hall in May, the New York
Philharmonic, led by the conductor Andrew Litton, presented a
concert rendering of Stephen Sondheim's Tony Award-winning Broadway
musical ``Sweeney Todd.'' Backing a mixed cast of Broadway and
opera performers, fronted by George Hearn (replacing the indisposed
opera idol Bryn Terfel in the title role) and Patti Lupone
(delivering perhaps the performance of her career), the
Philharmonic responded to Sondheim's music with unexpected passion
and empathy. The audiences in turn responded with unrestrained
delight, raucously echoing the refrain crowed by the show's meat
pie-gorging chorus: ``God, that's good!''
</P>
<P>
   These concerts seem to have taken everyone involved by surprise.
Not that the merits of Sondheim's ``Demon Barber of Fleet Street''
have ever been in doubt. Even stripped to its score and only
modestly staged, ``Sweeney Todd,'' in the hands of a symphony
orchestra, maintained enormous dramatic power. It also revealed,
however, a musical richness and formal sophistication previously
suspected but never before so emphatically confirmed. Inside Avery
Fisher Hall, the significance of the occasion was unmistakable; for
Sondheim, further acceptance on his own terms in the classical
music realm; for the Philharmonic, a category-shattering expansion
of its musical embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Here were performances just begging for wider dissemination.
And, in fact, the Philharmonic seems to have done just about
everything possible to see that the concerts would be recorded and
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it could not secure either a public television deal or a
commercial record contract for the occasion. Only at the
instigation of the orchestra members themselves (who also
voluntarily reduced their contractual recording fees) was an
11th-hour audio tape of the concerts made, in-house.
</P>
<P>
   How and why these performances nearly went unrecorded sheds
light on the priorities of today's broadcast and recording
industries, as rampant corporate consolidation reconfigures them
almost daily. In fact, though, it is the looming presence of a new
competitor, the World Wide Web, that shadows this particular
``Sweeney Todd.'' For, just weeks after these concerts, 66 American
symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies, including the
Philharmonic, announced an agreement with the American Federation
of Musicians that would soon enable them to offer events like
``Sweeney Todd'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement establishes compensation terms for musicians for
performances made available on the Web, either through what is
known as ``streaming audio'' _ live music that cannot be stored by
listeners _ or as recordings that can be downloaded for a fee.
Thus, performances like the Philharmonic's ``Sweeney Todd'' might
one day turn up on the orchestra's own Web site. Though not
``Sweeney Todd'' itself. As Paul Meecham, the general manager for
the Philharmonic, recently pointed out, ``It would be extremely
time consuming right now to download `Sweeney Todd.''' And so these
concerts are history.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the ``Sweeney Todd'' performances by the
Philharmonic was conceived in November 1997, says Welz Kaufman, the
orchestra's former artistic administrator, as a coda to the
Philharmonic's four-year American Classics program, a celebration
of the works of 20th-century composers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweeney Todd'' was an audacious choice for the Philharmonic.
Its musical director, Kurt Masur, while an admirer of Sondheim, had
never actually heard the show before. Nonetheless, boosted by
Terfel's commitment to appear in the title role, the notion soon
gained Masur's approval, despite internecine carping by
Philharmonic administrators who were opposed to what they saw as a
sellout of the orchestra to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Deutsche Grammophon, Terfel's record label,
evinced a strong interest in recording the event. Contract
proposals were drawn up in meetings with the label's executives,
including Chris Roberts, the current chairman of its corporate
parent, Universal Classics Group (which, in June, was swallowed up
by the French conglomerate Vivendi as part of its purchase of
Seagram). Casting decisions proceeded in consultation with the
record company. Discussions were also entered into with Jac Venza,
the director of cultural and arts programs for WNET, to televise
the production as part of the PBS series ``Great Performances'' at
some future date.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December 1999, Deutsche Grammophon suddenly pulled out.
Venza and PBS quickly followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point?
</P>
<P>
   ``Several changes impacted the potential marketing and related
commercial viability of the record,'' Deutsche Grammophon announced
in a prepared statement filled with bold pronouncements and curious
inconsistencies. ``The project did not become a vehicle for
Universal/DG artists, as had been suggested early on; other
Universal artists (Renee Fleming and Luciano Pavarotti) did not
materialize; no future life outside of the recording was planned,
such as possible additional performances in other markets; a PBS
broadcast didn't happen; a definitive recording of the `Sweeney
Todd' Broadway company already existed; and, ultimately, the N.Y.
Philharmonic could not come up with a budget acceptable to Deutsche
Grammophon.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Venza was more straightforward: ``It was just
too expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, nearly 15 years ago, when another Sondheim masterwork,
``Follies,'' was performed by the Philharmonic at Avery Fisher
Hall, PBS broadcast the event and a major record label, RCA,
released an accompanying recording.
</P>
<P>
   So what has changed since 1985?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the classical record business has changed. Corporate
conglomeration, coupled with huge crossover successes like Andrea
Bocelli and the Three Tenors, have virtually squeezed out more
adventurous classical recording projects, leaving behind an
industry that has largely lost its nerve. As Kaufman noted: ``The
recording not happening can be chalked up to the general crisis in
the industry. Yes, Bryn Terfel did leave the project, due to
illness _ an ongoing back problem that finally required surgery.
D.G., though, bowed out well before Bryn did. It didn't have
anything to do with not having his marquee name; it had to do with
D.G.'s own financial constraints. And that's across the board with
record companies and classical music today. No one wants to spend
any money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The world of public television has changed as well.
Increasingly, PBS is more focused on a generation of younger
viewers uninterested in either the Broadway of Sondheim or the
orchestral music of the Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   What has not changed is old-fashioned greed and its power to
rule out compromise. In that sense, it must be pointed out that the
Philharmonic also played a role in derailing its own hopes for a
recording agreement, as Kaufman indirectly acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole `Follies' experience, which many people point to as
a precedent, really wasn't a precedent,'' he said. ``RCA came to us
that time and said, we need the orchestra for this first complete
recording of `Follies' that we want to do. This time it was the New
York Philharmonic saying, we have this American classics program.
Sondheim is an American classic. Let's do `Sweeney Todd.' The
genesis was entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, to read between the lines, could one further difference
between the two events have been the steeper financial demands made
by the Philharmonic as the initiator of the ``Sweeney Todd''
concert, rather than as the hired band, for ``Follies''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' conceded Kaufman, ``it could.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, fine commercial videos of earlier productions of
``Sweeney Todd'' already exist, as well as original cast
recordings. And the Philharmonic has announced it will be pressing
10,000 copies of a limited-edition ``Sweeney Todd'' recording,
mostly for its own subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, what does it say about our contemporary cultural
supermarket that neither PBS nor Deutsche Grammophon saw enough
potential profit in the ``Sweeney Todd''-Philharmonic collaboration
to bank on it?
</P>
<P>
   What it seems to say is _ insofar as posterity and performances
like these are concerned _ the Internet is the future. For now,
though, ``Sweeney Todd'' in concert at the Philharmonic has been
allowed to slip away, eluding all but a relatively few firsthand
witnesses and Philharmonic subscribers. It is a sadly ironic
kickoff for a century already defined by the promised ability to
reproduce music seemingly on demand. Obviously, that promise,
unfettered by either technical or commercial constraints, still
remains to be realized. Meanwhile, in this unfortunate instance, of
such constraints are legends made.

 &HT;    Gas prices, credit problems put brakes on truck sales
 &HT;    By Russell Grantham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A combination of easy credit, high fuel prices and
hard times is filling truck dealers' lots with slow-selling big
rigs and repossessed trucks, say industry sources.
</P>
<P>
   And while truck drivers, dealers, manufacturers and lenders are
feeling most of the pain, a shakeout in the trucking industry could
translate into higher shipping rates and price tags for consumer
goods, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got guys calling us up and saying 'The truck's parked
here. Come pick it up,''' said Tom Nacey, regional remarketing
manager for Conseco's transportation finance division. ``That's
happening on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Carmel, Ind.-based insurer's finance unit stopped
making new loans on tractor trailers last month after its inventory
of repossessed units doubled since January to about 700 rigs.
</P>
<P>
   About 6 percent to 7 percent of the units Conseco has financed
have been repossessed or returned voluntarily _ about quadruple the
typical level, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons why many owner-operators and trucking firms can't
make their trucks pay their way runs the gamut from higher
interest, fuel and insurance costs to claims that DaimlerChrysler's
Freightliner LLC unit has flooded the market with thinly financed
heavy-duty trucks that have driven down used-truck prices.
</P>
<P>
   But No. 1 on the list is the high cost of diesel fuel, which hit
$2 a gallon this spring in some regions _ about twice its level
this time last year. The national average is currently about $1.45.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of a lot of small companies getting out because of
the fuel. (It's) a big killer for us,'' says Ron Pavuk, president
of Preferred Transport in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He began adding a surcharge of 3.5 percent to 6 percent to his
shipping rates this year to help cover the higher cost of fuel for
his 40-truck fleet. But that doesn't cover it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel costs amount to 20 percent to 30 percent of
owner-operators' revenues, says Todd Spencer, executive vice
president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a glut of used heavy-duty trucks caused prices to
drop about 30 percent since January, he adds. Some drivers owe more
on loans than their trucks are worth.
</P>
<P>
   Some truckers were wobbling under heavy debt payments after
manufacturers, particularly Freightliner, dangled zero-down
financing promotions before them, Spencer says.
</P>
<P>
   Freightliner President Jim Hebe says his company, the leading
heavy-duty truck manufacturer in the nation, has been laboring to
solve the used-truck problem, not exacerbate it.
</P>
<P>
   Freightliner's zero-down payment program ``is not unique to us''
and was in place years before the recent developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is real simple,'' he says. ``What's killed these
guys in the last year is fuel costs and interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local dealers say they haven't seen many repossessions or a
big drop in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still selling like hot cakes,'' says Gail Miller,
finance manager for Gainesville Truck Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Pavuk, who tries to replace his fleet every three years,
says it's a bear market for used trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The used truck market is really depressed right now,'' he
says. ``Because of fuel prices, nobody wants to buy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The market for new trucks has weakened as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're projecting the market will be down a good 20-25 percent
this year,'' Hebe says. He expects Freightliner's sales to be down
10 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of record sales, tractor-trailer sales dropped
in May for the second month. Freightliner's sales were down 15
percent in May compared to a year earlier, and 26 percent in April,
according to Ward's Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Hebe said Freightliner, which launched a network of used-truck
dealerships in 1996, will be ``doing some very dramatic things'' to
deal with the glut of used trucks, including remanufacturing and
exporting trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just too many trucks in the United States today,''
he said. ``We're going to be devoting significant manufacturing
resources to late-model used trucks.''

LEAKED SECRETS OR ANTI-MISSILE FRAUD? ENGINEER IS AT HUB OF
DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ohio, Calif., Iowa)   By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An engineer who leveled accusations of anti-missile fraud
against a big contractor is becoming caught in a federal clash.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon agents are trying to question her about leaks of
military secrets, even while congressional and criminal
investigators are gearing up to examine the merit of her
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Nira Schwartz, a senior engineer in 1995 and 1996 at TRW, a top
military contractor, has alleged that the company falsified work
meant to help anti-missile interceptors to distinguish incoming
warheads from decoys. The company strongly denies the allegation.
Schwartz contends that TRW then fired her when she protested.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz objected Wednesday to Pentagon plans to have its
security investigators quiz her about information that she had
provided to anti-missile critics. She said the scrutiny was clearly
aimed at shielding the $60 billion anti-missile plan from scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to kill the messenger,'' she said in an
interview. ``Right now, the court case is the only way to bring
this issue to justice. The nation needs an independent evaluation
of the project. Otherwise, we're being taken for a ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Her case, which languished in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles
for years, rose to prominence in recent months as the Clinton
administration pressed ahead with plans to deploy the anti-missile
system and as scientists and critics backed her allegations and
broadened them to contend that the Pentagon had tried to cover up
the purported flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Her top scientific ally, Theodore A. Postol, an arms expert at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that Pentagon
investigators were seeking to question Schwartz about declassified
documents that she shared with him, and apparently one in
particular. They are doing so simply to harass her, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is outrageous,'' Postol said Wednesday, adding that three
Defense Security Service investigators confronted him over the same
matter last month. ``It's very clear they know where the document
comes from. This is a transparent case of intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   Retroactively, Pentagon officials in May classified as secret a
letter that Postol sent the White House containing Schwartz's
declassified document, and he promptly denounced the move as
political censorship.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Postol said the Pentagon document in question had
been declassified by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service in
the course of reviewing Schwartz's allegations. He said the
Pentagon was apparently going out of its way to avoid investigating
itself.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, David W. Affeld, Schwartz's lawyer, wrote to Lt.
Col. Bill Groves, general counsel of the Pentagon's anti-missile
program, to complain about Defense Department plans to interrogate
his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned,'' he wrote, ``that the `investigation' of Dr.
Schwartz is motivated not to preserve national security, but rather
to intimidate an outspoken critic of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the White House is considering whether to press ahead
with the costly anti-missile plan. Postol provided a copy of the
letter; Affeld declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say that if Schwartz is found guilty of leaking
military secrets, her lawsuit may be crippled, especially if the
finding ends her ability to review classified documents needed to
prove her allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., who has called for congressional
and criminal inquiries into Schwartz's allegations, on Wednesday
denounced the Pentagon's interrogation plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' he said, ``hits are being put out on anyone who
betrays this high-tech code of silence. It's like the Mafia.
They're attempting to silence anyone who tells the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur L. Money, an assistant secretary of defense in charge of
security policy, said Wednesday night that no decision had been
made on whether to contact Schwartz. ``Our focus is internal to the
Department of Defense on whether any leaks occurred,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Markey, and separately, Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., and Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, the authors of 1986 false-claims
amendments, have called on the congressional General Accounting
Office to investigate the anti-missile allegations. In a July 5
letter, Berman and Grassley said the federal government's financial
recovery, if fraud was proven, could be its largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Levin, an accounting office official, said plans for
an investigation were so far unfocused. ``We haven't really started
interviewing witnesses or figuring out the scope of the effort,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Interested in whether laws were broken, 53 members of the House,
led by Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, a member of the government
oversight committee, wrote FBI director Louis Freeh in June asking
him to scrutinize the fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
   John Collingwood, an FBI spokesman, said Wednesday that he could
make no comment on whether an inquiry was under way.

FESTIVAL OPENS DOOR TO INDIAN THEATER  

</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: spellings of Aroon Shivdasani in second graf, Mahesh Dattani

 By FELICIA R. LEE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   NEW YORK _ For Indian playwrights,
involvement in New York theater has been more a flirtation than
anything serious. That has meant mostly short runs, small theaters
and few mainstream audiences, even for celebrated Indian
playwrights.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The growing population of Indian artists in New York hopes to
change this. Beginning on Friday, the TriBeCa Performing Arts
Center will present the Festival of Indian Theater, which will run
for three weeks and include 18 performances. The festival is
sponsored by the Indo-American Arts Council, whose director, Aroon
Shivdasani, says it is the first such festival in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The festival will feature the U.S. premieres of two plays, in
English with all-Indian casts, by two of India's leading
playwrights.
</P>
<P>
   Mahesh Dattani's ``Dance Like a Man'' is about the conflict
between two aging dancers who perform in the classical temple style
known as Bharata Natyam. Their careers are ending, and their
daughter's is taking off. It was written in English.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Tendulkar's ``Once Upon a Fleeting Bird'' is an English
adaptation of a contemporary love story set in Bombay. It was
originally performed in the Marathi language.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia Society has organized a series of conversations with
the playwrights, directors and casts before and after selected
performances.
</P>

   ``Indian theater has been shown here, but it has been a
one-night stand,'' said Shivdasani, who is a founder of the small,
multicultural Bear Theater Company in Toronto. ``It's one night in
Queens, one night in New Jersey, then it's out.''

<P>
   The Indian plays draw a niche audience, she said. That means
that American playgoers miss out on playwrights who are as well
known in their home country as Arthur Miller is here.

   The Indo-American Arts Council was formed two years ago to
introduce mainstream American audiences to Indian artists. A film
screening or performance is often accompanied by a discussion about
broader aspects of Indian culture.

CAPTAIN MCENROE WILLING TO PLAY DOUBLES IN DAVIS CUP SEMIFINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN B. ADAMS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McEnroe's star turn as the U.S. Davis Cup captain is not
exactly unfolding the way he envisioned. In the space of two days,
the capricious forces of injury and accident have deprived McEnroe
of Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi for the Davis Cup semifinal
against Spain, July 21-23, in Santander, Spain. Instead, the
first-year captain will take a team anchored by Todd Martin and
including Jan-Michael Gambill and Chris Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe has also turned, at least temporarily, to the player he
knows he can depend on: himself. As player-captain of the U.S.
team, the 41-year-old McEnroe could play doubles _ and, he insists,
doubles only _ against Spain, unless he can find someone younger,
stronger and willing (perhaps Paul Goldstein or Vince Spadea).
McEnroe can substitute any of his four players up to 10 minutes
before the July 20 draw for the semifinal, which will be played on
slow red clay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't actually decided to compete,'' McEnroe said
Wednesday in a conference call announcing the U.S. team. ``There is
a good chance I won't play, but there is a chance I will play, and
if I take the court, I'm not going out there to lose. Until
yesterday, it wasn't even something I was thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm not in this to play,'' said McEnroe, who has a
59-10 record in singles and doubles and five Davis Cup
championships in 12 years of playing for the United States. ``My
plan is to work with younger players and make them better, not for
me necessarily to take a spot from someone. The situation is that
there's not a lot of guys that have gotten themselves into a
position where they should be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And those who are in a position to play are bowing out. On
Tuesday, Sampras confirmed that the acute tendinitis in his left
shin that had plagued him throughout a successful run to his
seventh Wimbledon championship and a record 13th Grand Slam singles
title would keep him out of the matchup against Spain. Following
doctors' advice, Sampras will rest the injured leg for two to three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how injured he is,'' McEnroe said Wednesday.
``Davis Cup was something that was a priority to me. But, who am I
to say? I wish he had made an effort to do it, and perhaps played a
doubles match and been there; that might have been inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? Maybe he'd be risking further injury if he played
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sampras' withdrawal was not a surprise, Agassi's pullout
stunned McEnroe. Agassi, driving from the airport to his Las Vegas
home, strained his back when his car was rear-ended in a minor
automobile accident Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was obviously more shocking because it came out of the
blue,'' McEnroe said. ``We as a team, and myself as a captain, have
been banking on him to win a couple matches for us. To say that I
was disappointed would be a major understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Sampras and Agassi, the U.S. team would have faced an
imposing challenge against Spain. The host team includes
20-year-old Juan Carlos Ferrero _ ``one of the best clay-court
players in the world, bar none,'' according to McEnroe _ and two
other outstanding clay court players, No. 7 Alex Corretja and No.
22 Albert Costa. Now, McEnroe rated his team's chances at
``probably 10, 20 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will be led into a 10,500-seat temporary stadium
in Santander by the game but gimpy Martin, who has competed in only
seven tournaments in 2000 after sustaining a knee injury early in
the season. Woodruff won the fifth and deciding match against
Zimbabwe in the first round of the Davis Cup competition. Gambill,
at No. 30, is the highest-ranked player on the American team. He is
a fit, strong but largely untested 25-year-old who reached the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon and was 1-1 in limited Davis Cup duty in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, McEnroe sounded both deflated and defiant while
discussing his captaincy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I haven't been that successful in getting the
players,'' McEnroe said. ``Todd was injured the first couple. Pete
was unavailable for the first match. Now Pete and Andre. Chang has
said no both times that I've asked him to play,'' he said of
Michael Chang. ``Jim Courier has recently retired. This has
certainly not turned out the way it was planned beforehand, at
least in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that my presence there would make a real
difference. At this point, you either call it bad luck or it hasn't
made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In their last Davis Cup meeting, the United States defeated
Spain, 4-1, in the 1991 quarterfinals in Newport, R.I.

GORE TO NAACP CONVENTION: `IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Calif., Colo.)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ From his opening salutation _ ``I am a member of the
NAACP; it's good to be home'' _ to his closing motivational cry _
``I'm not asking you to read my lips; I'm asking you to read my
heart!'' _ a spirited Al Gore summoned black voters Wednesday to
support his presidential candidacy, reminding them of his long
commitment to their cause and deriding Gov. George W. Bush as
offering only words, not action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come here not just in an election year, but year after
year,'' the vice president told several hundred members of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the
nation's largest civil rights organization. ``I have worked with
you. I have stood with you. I am proud to have won some battles
alongside you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's message, threaded thickly with his policy positions, was
in deliberate counterpoint to Bush's speech to the same group on
Monday, when the Texas governor was criticized by many in the
organization who said he offered only breezy generalities. Bush was
the first Republican presidential candidate to court the NAACP
since his father spoke to the group in 1988; still, the governor
received a tepid response compared with the rousing and repeated
standing ovations that Gore drew Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president delved into details, from his support of
affirmative action and hate-crimes legislation to jobs and
education. He said he would defend affirmative action ``because it
is still needed in this country'' and it is ``good for our
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his opposition to raising the retirement age for
Social Security benefits and to Bush's proposal to divert some
Social Security investment into the stock market. Gore talked of
his support for a patient's bill of rights, gun control and a full
count of people in the census as opposed to sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the heroes of black history, from Frederick Douglass
and Harriet Tubman to Thurgood Marshall and Rosa Parks, Gore
promised to ban racial profiling so that people would not be pulled
over simply for ``driving while black.'' ``I will make the DWB
offense obsolete in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He castigated Bush for invoking the notion of ``state's rights''
to avoid taking a position on whether South Carolina should remove
the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse. And he reminded
his listeners of his longtime commitment to their concerns. ``I
have made more trips to Africa than I have to Asia,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance came amid some concern among his staff members
that blacks have been left dispirited by the campaign. Black voters
account for about 15 percent of the electorate, and they usually
support Democrats overwhelmingly. A recent New York Times Poll
showed Gore with 69 percent of the black vote and about 13 percent
 &UR;  &LR; for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton, by contrast, has more than a 90-percent
approval rating among black voters. Analysts said Gore could
probably claim that level of support by Election Day, but
questioned the commitment of black voters to get to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, chief pollster for the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies, said: ``He'll get 90-95 percent of the black
vote. The larger question for Gore really is black turnout as
opposed to his share of the black vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bositis said Gore would inherit the good relations with blacks
that the president had built up, stemming from the record economic
expansion, low unemployment among blacks, numerous appointments of
blacks to administration positions and falling crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bositis said, Bush's message of being a ``different kind
of Republican'' was aimed less at winning over black voters than
white swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, overall turnout in November is likely to be
low, precisely because the economy is doing so well, and Gore's
challenge is to activate his base, which he has had some difficulty
doing. While polls show Bush winning the support of 90 percent of
Republicans, Gore has the support of only about 70 percent of
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's event was aimed at drumming up enthusiasm among
voters who should be squarely behind him.
</P>
<P>
   This was evident in the introduction of Gore by William Lucy, an
NAACP board member, who said, ``Al Gore, unlike a lot of other
people, has not just discovered the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy also noted Gore's lineage as the son of a senator who
supported most civil rights legislation (although he did not back
the Civil Rights Act of 1964). ``He has drawn from that deep well
of public consciousness given to him by his father,'' Lucy said.
</P>
<P>
   And Lucy set a robustly partisan tone, although the NAACP cannot
endorse candidates because of its tax exempt status. In noting that
the Clinton administration had nominated 57 black judges to the
federal bench, he added:``Not a single Clarence Thomas among
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore easily assumed command of the audience. In imploring his
listeners to work hard to help the Democrats recapture the House,
Gore said: ``I want you to consider how much we can get done by
taking back the Congress, how much justice will be redeemed when
John Conyers is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, how much
economic progress will be made when Charlie Rangel is chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   To gales of laughter, he prompted delegates to their feet with a
cadenced ridicule of Bush's talk of compassionate conservatism _
``Talk doesn't cost much,'' he said _ compared to his own record of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you heard some nice-sounding words on Monday
afternoon,'' Gore said. ``But I remembered what scripture teaches
in the Book of James, Chapter 2, Verse 18: `Yay, a man may say thou
hast faith, and I have works. Show me thy faith without thy works,
and I will show thee my faith BY my works.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he faulted Bush for repeated failures to respond to minority
voters, at one point offering a dramatized rendition of an imagined
chilly, monosyllabic Bush response _ ``No'' _ to the family of
James Byrd, a black man dragged to his death in Texas in 1998, when
the family asked the governor to support legislation against hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP officials seemed thrilled with Gore's performance. Julian
Bond, the chairman, said flatly: ``The vice president had substance
and Governor Bush had a drive-by photo opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, the president of the organization, said he
appreciated the fact that Bush spoke to the group, but acknowledged
Gore's edge. ``Al Gore is pretty much a family member,'' Mfume
said. He told reporters he could forgive Gore's support for the
death penalty _ a subject the vice president did not raise _
because his stand was principled and not political.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the convention were pleased too. ``He's
beautiful,'' said Faye Sandle, 64, of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Watson, 55, a meat cutter from Monterey, Calif., said, ``I
believe Gore is more for the people. I like what he said about
affirmative action, jobs and investing back in the communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith McDougald, 57, an elementary school teacher from Glen
Burnie, Md., said that she would not hold Gore's support for the
death penalty against him, since that was the only area where she
disagreed with him. ``Bush's reaction to the executions will be in
the negative for him,'' she said, referring to the recent execution
of a black man in Texas.

   Bar Code Software For Comparing Prices
</P>
<P>
   Most people never even think about looking at the bar code on
the book or CD they are about to buy. But new bar code software may
cause some shoppers to hunt for those black-and-white symbols
whenever they pick up a product.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which is designed to be downloaded to Web-enabled
handheld devices like the Palm VII organizer, allows people to
conduct online price comparisons the minute they spot a product on
the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   By entering the 12-digit number that appears below the thin
black lines of the bar code, a person sends a request for
information over the wireless Internet. A few seconds later,
several lines of information pop up on the screen, including data
on the prices offered at other stores.
</P>
<P>
   Barpoint.com, a company in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., developed the
software, which can be downloaded from www.barpoint.com. Its
databases include books, videos, music and software, and the
company plans to add categories like consumer electronics, office
supplies, toys, groceries, health and beauty products and
automobile parts.
</P>
<P>
   With the comparison data in hand, said Jeffrey Sass,
Barpoint.com's chief operating officer, shoppers will be able to
decide, for example, whether a higher price in a store is worth the
convenience of having the product in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The software cannot accept credit-card information, which would
allow people to order immediately from Web sites or purchase items
without walking through the check-out line. But eventually, Sass
said, ``you'll even be able to shop from the wireless device.''
</P>
<P>
   Netpliance Is Betting That Less Will Be More
</P>
<P>
   Netpliance, the first company to offer a simple Internet
appliance for people seeking something less than a full-fledged PC,
said it is significantly upgrading its i-Opener device in
preparation for a big holiday-season retail push. But the price is
quadrupling, to $399.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in Austin, Texas, had trouble meeting demand at the
promotional price of $99, which ended June 30, and it is declaring
an unusual moratorium while it catches up and revises the product
line. Online orders placed today will not be filled until October,
although the new i-Opener 2001 devices will be in stores by Sept.
1.
</P>
<P>
   The new i-Opener 2001 system, which requires a $21.95 monthly
Internet service fee but no long-term service contract, adds
instant messaging among i-Opener users, multiple e-mail accounts
and stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   At $399, plus $21.95 a month, the i-Opener is no longer
significantly cheaper than a low-end PC with Internet access, and
yet it has more limited features. The company is betting that
customers will be willing to pay more for simplicity and ease of
use.
</P>
<P>
   Sending Digital Photos Directly From a Camera
</P>
<P>
   Shutterbugs with a passion for instantly shared experiences will
soon be able to send their digital photos by e-mail without ever
touching their computers. Wireless photo transmission is being made
possible by Digita Post software currently available in Kodak DC290
digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The software, developed by FlashPoint Technology, based in San
Jose, Calif., works with the company's Digita technology, which
functions as an operating system for digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Transmitting photos from digital cameras to cell phones to any
e-mail box anywhere in the world is expected to be particularly
handy for insurance adjusters, police officers and paramedics,
though the biggest market for the cameras is expected to be among
nonprofessionals, said Karen Meyers, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Users insert a flash card into the camera and take standard
digital photos. Then they start up the Digita Post software in the
camera, which allows them to select which photos they want to send
and even attach text and sound messages (the Kodak DC290 has a tiny
microphone).
</P>
<P>
   The camera is then connected to a cell phone through a cable.
Another click and the photos are on their way. They arrive in the
receiver's e-mail In box as a message with an attached JPEG file.
Sounds arrive as WAV file attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Digita Post is expected to cost $199 and will be available in
late September on the FlashPoint Web site (www.flashpoint.com).
</P>
<P>
   Other camera manufacturers, including Minolta, Hewlett Packard
and Sharp, that offer Digita-enabled cameras are expected to
incorporate the Digita Post software, too, Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Pulls Web-Based PC
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer of Round Rock, Texas, has pulled the plug on its
Web-based PC for computer novices. The WebPC, introduced in
November at $999, was neither simple nor inexpensive enough to
catch on with consumers, and it has disappeared from Dell's Web
site. Rather than continue to chase the market for inexpensive
Internet appliances, Dell this week introduced a line of midrange
computers for consumers called Dimension 4100. A Dimension 4100
with a 733-megahertz processor, 128 megabytes of memory, a
10-gigabyte hard drive and a 17-inch monitor costs $1,299.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, meanwhile, discontinued the sleek Presario 3500, which
fell flat with consumers and will be sold only in Japan.

N.H. HOUSE VOTES TO IMPEACH TOP JUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ The New Hampshire House of Representatives voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday night to impeach the state's top judge on
charges ranging from lying under oath to allowing justices to be
involved in cases from which they had been disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Unless he resigns, state Supreme Court Chief Justice David A.
Brock will now face an unprecendented trial in the state Senate
next month to determine whether he will be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   As the emotional day of debate wore on Wednesday, Brock's fate
in the 400-member House became sealed. The House not only
overwhelmingly approved all three articles of impeachment
recommended by the Judiciary Committee, but added a fourth. Then,
after a final vote of 253-95 to impeach, House members rejected
proposals that would have allowed Brock to collect his $80,000
pension and benefits if he resigned before the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brock has served on the court for a quarter-century, the last 14
years as its chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a solemn and difficult day for the state of New
Hampshire,'' Governor Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement. ``The
House conducted a thorough, thoughtful and dignified inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since 1790 that a Supreme Court judge has
been impeached in New Hampshire. That judge resigned rather than
face a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's attorney, David Barry, said, ``The House was entitled to
do what they did. Now they've done what they've done and they've
impeached the chief justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry criticized the impeachment articles as ``factually
deficient,'' and said he was confident that Brock would prevail in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said that Brock ``has had no due process to date. And as
much as we had hoped that a Senate trial would not be necessary, it
now is clear that it is going to happen, and we and the chief
justice greatly look forward to the opportunity to vindicate his
name and his reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the House proceedings, Brock or his lawyers will be
allowed to call and cross-examine witnesses during his Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Brock watched the proceedings on television from his home.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire constitution allows for four possible grounds
of impeachment: Bribery, corruption, malpractice and
maladministration. The articles against Brock dealt only with the
latter two.
</P>
<P>
   Brock was accused of lying under oath to the House Judiciary
Committee; allowing justices to comment on cases from which they
had been recused; and improperly intervening in a 1987 lower court
case involving a powerful state senator who at the time held sway
over a judicial pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   The votes, stressed state Representative John Pratt (D-Walpole),
a member of the House Judiciary committee, were not a finding of
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here to try Chief Justice Brock,'' Pratt said. ``Or
to convict him, or to reprimand him. We are here only to determine
whether...we should send this on to the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Henry Mock (R-Jackson), chairman of the House
Judiciary committee, said he was pleased that the House accepted
the recommendations of the committee, which has held a three-month
investigation before recommending three articles of impeachment
against Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's the Senate's ballgame,'' Mock said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Liz Hager (D-Concord), said she was surprised by
the vote's wide margain and disappointed that many House members
seemed to have come into the proceedings with their minds made up.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted that Brock would not be removed from office after
a Senate trial. ``But it will be a long, expensive, very ugly
experience for a very nice guy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mock set the tone early Wednesday, opening the debate by saying,
``There has never been a more somber day.''
</P>
<P>
   Speakers' voices rose against the sound of giant fans intended
to cool the historic chamber, but the temperature continued to rise
as the day wore on.
</P>
<P>
   Some House members' voices cracked as they described
``agonizing'' over the votes before them. Others defended Brock's
character and said his actions, while perhaps foolish, did not rise
to the level of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Barry said the votes on the original three articles against
Brock did not come as a total surprise. ``It is my understanding
that there is a great amount of deference paid by the House to its
committee reccommendations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first article taken up Wednesday, which the House adopted by
a vote of 219-138, dealt with allegations that Brock had called
Superior Court Judge Douglas Gray in 1987 to inquire about the
status of a case involving the then-Senate majority leader at a
time the Legislature was considering judicial pay raises. Brock has
insisted that Gray called him and not the other way around. But in
an internal Supreme Court investigation, Brock's colleagues found
that the chief justice had made the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He dialed the telephone,'' Mock said, adding, ``It was not to
discuss the Sunday golf game.''
</P>
<P>
   The second article, which the House adopted by an even wider
margin, 252-104, dealt with allegations that Brock allowed and even
encouraged justices to comment on the selection of substitute
judges to hear fellow Supreme Court Justice W. Stephen Thayer's
divorce; and with speaking with Thayer in a hallway about the
selection of judges to hear his case.
</P>
<P>
   Brock denies having had the hallway conversation with Thayer.
State Representative Martha Solow (D-Hanover) urged members to vote
against the second article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparing Chief Justice Brock's and Justice Thayer's
credibility, I have to come down on the side of Chief Justice
Brock,'' Solow said.
</P>
<P>
   Thayer resigned his seat on the bench rather than face criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the three initial charges alleged that he lied under
oath four times and deliberately tried to mislead the House
Judiciary Comittee during its recent investigation. The House voted
242-112 to adopt the perjury article.
</P>
<P>
   In an amendment vote at the dinner hour, the House adopted a
fourth article of impeachment against Brock by a measure of
244-108. Offered as an amendment by Representative Ralph Jacobson
(R-New London), the fourth article alleged that during his tenure
as chief justice, Brock permitted and oversaw ``a practice whereby
recused and disqualified justices were permitted to receive draft
opinions and to attend case conferences, thereby enabling them to
comment on and influence opinions in the cases from which they were
recused and disqualified.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Burt Cohen (D-Newcastle) called the entire matter
``sad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A government is weakened if any of the three branches are
weakened,'' said Cohen. ``And it's imperative that we rebuild
confidence in the court.''

 &HT;    Neagle traded to the Yankees
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Jim Bowden, the man with the itchiest trigger
finger in baseball, pulled another shocker Wednesday when the
Cincinnati Reds general manager traded the team's No. 1 pitcher,
Denny Neagle, and minor-league outfielder Mike Frank to the New
York Yankees for four minor-league prospects.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this season, Bowden told everybody that not only did
he want to keep Neagle, but that he was searching for additional
pitching help to aid the team's chase of first-place St. Louis in
the National League Central.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with the Reds eight games behind the Cardinals at the
All-Star break and 4 1/2 games behind the New York Mets in the wild
card, Bowden wrecked the rotation, sending the 31-year-old
left-handed Neagle to the Yankees for players not ready for prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   Obtained by the Reds were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Third baseman Drew Henson, 20, the Yankees No. 3 pick in the
1998 draft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outfielder Jackson Melian, 20, a free-agent signee in July
1996, from Barcelona, Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right-handed pitcher Brian Reith, 22, the Yankees No. 4 pick
in the 1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
   _ Left-handed pitcher Ed Yarnall, 24, a former New York Mets No.
3 pick in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball America rates Henson, Melian and Yarnall as the third-,
fifth- and sixth best prospects in the Yankees system.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden decided it was time to deal when he offered Neagle, who
can become a free agent this season, a three-year $18 million deal
and Neagle and his agent, Barry Meister, said they preferred to try
the free agent route after the season. When Neagle saw the
Minnesota Twins sign pitcher Brad Radke to a four-year $36 million
contract, his mind was made up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to realize we're a small- to middle-market team
and we don't have a $107 million payroll like the Yankees do,''
Bowden said. ``We have to make due with what we have and the best
way to do that is to stockpile young players. We took a lot of heat
when we traded Dave Burba for Sean Casey and Sean Casey became an
All-Star. We took a lot of grief when we traded John Smiley for
Danny Graves and Danny Graves became an All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope two of these four players might become All-Stars and
if it happens, we hope people will look back on this as a good
deal,'' Bowden said. ``It's a challenge when you are a small
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said the club is re-focusing on becoming a winner when
the new park opens in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Henson is a risk. In addition to playing baseball, hitting .287
in 59 games at Class AA Norwich this year with seven homers and 39
RBIs, Henson is the quarterback of the University of Michigan
football team. Going into his junior season, he is a Heisman Trophy
candidate and might opt for pro football.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what can be done to persuade Henson to stick with
baseball, Bowden smiled and said, ``A big losing year for Michigan.
I guess it is a matter of how well he does in football. He hasn't
decided which direction to go and he is going to play them both out
and see what works, what sport he excels in the most. At this
point, he has made tremendous strides in baseball _ at 20 years old
he is hitting .290 in Double-A.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall is closest to the majors and was penciled into the
Yankees rotation this spring but flopped. He was 13-4 with a 3.47
ERA at Class AAA Columbus last year and is 2-1 with a 4.56 ERA in
10 starts this year, plus he made two starts and three bullpen
appearances for the Yankees this season and is 1-0 with a 3.71 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was slated to be in the Yankees rotation this year, but had
some shoulder problems and arm problems and didn't have much
success,'' Bowden said. ``He is now healthy and threw a two-hitter
his last time out. We feel down the road he can be a 12- to 15-game
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Reith was 9-4 with a 2.18 ERA in 18 starts at Class A Tampa, his
fifth straight year in Class A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our scouts compare him to a Tim Belcher, Brian Moehler type of
pitcher and a guy who can be a solid starter in the big leagues,''
Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Meilian was hitting .252 with nine homers and 38 RBIs at
Norwich, his first year at Class AA after three years in Class A,
mostly because of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a right-fielder, a five-tool player, a Cincinnati
Reds-type player who can run, throw, hit, hit for power and has
potential to be an All-Star superstar type player,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   None is ready to help the Reds overtake the Cardinals and Bowden
realizes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't comfortable keeping Neagle until the end of the
season and risk having him walk on us to free agency and we'd get
only two draft picks of which we don't even know if we can sign as
draft picks,'' Bowden said. ``This way, we get four players as part
of the deal who are far superior to two draft picks we'd receive if
Neagle signs somewhere else as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   And Bowden may not be finished.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds are scouting the Boston system for prospects because
the Red Sox reportedly are interested in outfielder Dmitri Young as
a possible designated hitter. And several teams indicate that
Bowden is determining what interest there is in shortstop Barry
Larkin, who is asking for a three-year, $28 million deal. Bowden
said trading Neagle does not free up money for Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely concerned about how the Neagle trade will be
taken by the fans, the media and our players,'' Bowden said. ``No
one wants to lose a No. 1 starter. You want to trade for more Denny
Neagles, not trade Denny Neagle away. It was a very difficult
decision, but it is big business. You can't let assets go and get
nothing for it. The players have to understand it's big business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden agreed that trading Neagle also traded away hopes of
winning the division this year, but the club couldn't afford the
consequences of not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our payroll, which is between $43 million and $44 million now,
would be between $70 million and $80 million next year and we can't
afford to do that. . .it's not there,'' Bowden said. ``We've traded
our No. 1 starter and we've hurt our chances of winning now. We
know this. That was our No. 1 starter and there were 15 games he
was going to start the second half. He won't be out there now, so
it hurts our chances.''

YANKS SNARE NEAGLE FROM REDS FOR PROSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Making a pre-emptive strike for the best pitcher
available, the Yankees shipped a ransom in top prospects to the
Cincinnati Reds for the left-hander Denny Neagle, a two-time
All-Star whose style of pitching suits him perfectly to the
dimensions of Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scrambled to find quality pitching just two weeks
ago, but now their rotation is overstocked with six veteran
starters _ Orlando Hernandez, Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Neagle,
David Cone and Dwight Gooden _ for five spots. Gooden, who pitched
five solid innings against the New York Mets Saturday and seemingly
earned a chance for more starts, will be moved to the bullpen to
work in long relief.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the 31-year-old Neagle, who was 8-2 with a 3.52
ERA for the Reds, the Yankees paid sticker price: Drew Henson, a
power-hitting Class AA third baseman and the quarterback for the
University of Michigan who has not decided whether he will
ultimately play baseball or football professionally; Jackson
Melian, the Yankees' most prominent outfield prospect; the
left-hander Ed Yarnall, who struggled when given opportunities to
establish himself in the rotation; and Brian Reith, a Class A
pitcher. The Yankees also received minor-league outfielder Mike
Frank, a fringe minor-league prospect, as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds had been expected to contend for the championship this
season, after acquiring Ken Griffey Jr., but they are far behind
St. Louis in the National League Central. The trade of Neagle,
their ace, signals their intent to retool for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle will be eligible for free agency after this season, but
the Yankees initiated negotiations Wednesday on a long-term deal
with Neagle, who could end up with a contract akin to the
four-year, $36 million agreement recently reached by Minnesota's
Brad Radke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely open-minded to signing,'' said Neagle, who will
join the Yankees Friday and could pitch Saturday or Sunday. ``You'd
be foolish not to entertain offers from the Yankees. Let's put it
this way _ they were definitely on my short list of teams to
entertain offers from after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Barry Meister, Neagle's agent, the Yankees
``indicated they gave up good players and would like Denny long
term. I would expect to have substantive discussions sooner rather
than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle is in the last year of a multi-year deal that pays him
$4.75 million this season. A clause in Neagle's current contract
provides that he will be paid $250,000 in the event he is traded,
and the Yankees will pay that sum.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two weeks, the Yankees have added the slugger David
Justice and Neagle, and although they will seek a veteran to help
fill the void created by Shane Spencer's season-ending knee injury
_ someone like Chad Curtis _ the major part of the midseason
makeover is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to win this year,'' said Brian Cashman, the
Yankees' general manager. ``We've been careful about maintaining
our farm system, but we're going for it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had been told repeatedly by the Phillies that Curt
Schilling was not available, and given Schilling's symbolic
importance to the franchise and his relatively low salary of $6.5
million for next year, Yankees' executives never believed that was
going to change. Mike Mussina is a free agent, but he has a
no-trade clause and has told the Orioles flatly he will veto any
proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle was the top-rated pitcher on the Yankees' list of
prospective trade targets. About 10 days ago, after Cincinnati lost
a series against St. Louis, the Reds general manager, Jim Bowden,
called Cashman and asked if the Yankees were interested in Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Cashman replied. Bowden dispatched assistants
Bob Boone and Al Goldis to scout the Yankees' farm system and told
Cashman that he would call with names of prospects he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Henson was again asked if he would be willing to
give up his football career to play baseball, but Yankees'
executives knew he wasn't ready to answer the question. Henson is
set to be the start for Michigan this fall, and it seemed unlikely
he would change his mind after two years of working for that.
Henson indicated, again, that he hadn't made a decision which sport
he wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Bowden called Cashman with the names of the
prospects: Henson and Melian were at the top of his list. The
Yankees paid significant signing bonuses to both, but doubts about
each player have surfaced _ Henson, because he might play football,
and Melian, because of his long swing and propensity for
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees responded quickly, wanting to complete a deal
swiftly, sure in their assessment that Neagle was, far and away,
the best pitcher on the market, knowing that if they haggled and
dragged out negotiations, Bowden would be more likely to look
seriously at other offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you haggle,'' Cashman said Wednesday, ``then you have to be
prepared for the fact that the player is going to go to another
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman and Bowden spoke about a dozen times on Tuesday, and
into Wednesday morning, settling on three prospects _ Henson,
Melian, and Yarnall. With the Reds concerned about Henson's
intentions, the Yankees agreed to give a fourth player, which
turned out to be Reith. The Yankees were in a position to trade
prospects because they never agreed to the Cubs' exceptional
demands for Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden called Cashman at about 10:45 Wednesday morning and
agreed to the trade. The Yankees landed the left-hander they
wanted. And, in doing so, by moving swiftly and agreeing to pay
Cincinnati's demands, they kept him away other potential suitors,
such as the Mets, Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox and
Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle is 14-2 since the end of last August, with a career
record of 98-62. He won 16 games in 1996 for Pittsburgh and
Atlanta, 20 games for the Braves in 1997 and 16 games for Atlanta
in 1998. He had some weakness in the muscles of his rotator cuff in
1999 and was limited to only 19 starts, but has rebounded this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle's style is similar to that of Atlanta's Tom Glavine,
mixing a fastball of about 87-89 mph and a breaking ball, and a
phenomenal changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's going to help them,'' said Bruce Bochy. ``He's got
three great pitches. He's like Glavine, uses his breaking ball a
little bit more, pitches inside with his fastball a little more.
Tony Gwynn said he's one of the two toughest pitchers he's ever
faced, and the other is Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle generates an extraordinarily high ratio of fly balls,
which means he will fit in well in spacious Yankee Stadium. He
allowed only one run in 7 2/3 innings in his only start in Yankee
Stadium, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lefties have always had great success in that ballpark,''
Neagle said. ``With the deep center field and deep alleys, that's
going to suit me well.''

ANTHRAX VACCINATION POLICY IS A FAILURE, PENTAGON ACKNOWLEDGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By ELAINE SCIOLINO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In unusually blunt language, Pentagon officials
Wednesday acknowledged the failure of their ambitious policy to
inoculate all military personnel against the deadly anthrax virus.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, witnesses
described blunder after blunder in the Pentagon's 2{-year-old
program. The most severe was a shortage of the vaccine caused by
the mismanagement and financial problems of the only company
licensed to produce it _ a company in which a former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff controls an 11 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the hearing highlighted the anatomy of a failure.
``There are no immediate fixes,'' said Maj. Gen. Randall West of
the Marines, a senior Pentagon adviser on chemical and biological
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a crisis situation,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the
chairman of the committee, replied tersely. He urged the Pentagon
to ``sit down with these folks'' at BioPort Corp., the troubled
company based in Lansing, Mich., that makes the vaccine, and buy
them out.
</P>
<P>
   Because of of the vaccine shortage, the Pentagon is seeking a
second drug company to make it. Thus far, officials said, there
have been no takers. And even if a second supplier agreed to take
on the daunting task, it would take two to four years to begin
production, they added.
</P>
<P>
   And because producing the vaccine is not very profitable, the
Pentagon will also decide by the end of the month whether to build
its own plant, a process that would take five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., said the reason the Pentagon had
not built its own plant was a ``mystery to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   With much fanfare in late 1997, Defense Secretary William Cohen
announced a plan to inoculate all 2.4 million active and reserve
military personnel by 2003, because of the perceived threat of a
biological weapons attack. Although no country has used anthrax in
battle, the Pentagon says 10 have the ability to make biological
weapons. To prove his confidence in the safety of the vaccine,
Cohen rolled up his sleeve for a full series of six shots.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, about 445,000 military personnel have received at
least one dose of the vaccine. But on Tuesday, the Pentagon said
that because of dwindling stocks of the vaccine, it was curtailing
the program to cover only military personnel it considered most at
risk: those deployed near the borders of Iraq and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said Wednesday that the number of
vaccinations it administered would drop from 75,000 a month to
14,000. Earlier this week, West said the Pentagon had only 165,000
doses of the vaccine left. While not offering a revised schedule
for vaccinating all military personnel, officials on Wednesday
restated their intent to complete the program.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of Defense Rudy de Leon called the anthrax
threat ``immediate, real and constant.'' And when asked after the
hearing whether the Pentagon was still committed to inoculate every
man and woman on active and reserve duty, Adm. Craig Quigley, a
Pentagon spokesman, said, ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials insist that the decision to curtail the
inoculations has nothing to do with concerns among some service
members that the vaccine is unsafe and can produce adverse
reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses Wednesday insisted that the vaccine was safe to
take. Of 2 million doses given since 1990, 1,404 adverse reactions
have been reported. Of those, 73 were considered ``fatal,
life-threatening or resulting in hospitalization or permanent
disability,'' according to Kathryn C. Zoon, a senior biological
weapons and vaccine expert for the Food and Drug Administration.
But she said none of those cases ``can be attributed to the vaccine
with a high level of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred to 300 service members have refused to take the
vaccine, questioning its safety and the legal right of the Pentagon
to force them to submit to the injections.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax bacteria generally afflicts animals, especially sheep
and cattle. But dry anthrax spores can be turned into weapons and
are particularly dangerous because anthrax is a colorless,
odorless, tasteless agent that can kill after it is inhaled only
once.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the vaccine was halted in December after the FDA
found dozens of violations in safety, consistency, record keeping
and sterility during an inspection of the BioPort plant in Lansing.
Retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., a former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, is an unpaid member of the BioPort board and
controls an 11 percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is scheduled to resume production after the FDA
decides that the violations have been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Pentagon audit completed in March, BioPort
forecast an $18 million shortfall this year. Initially, the company
sold the Pentagon the vaccine at $2.26 or $4.36 a dose, depending
on the year of manufacture. The price jumped to $10.64 a dose last
August as part of a deal that raised the Pentagon contract by $24
million, including an $18 million advance to help keep the company
afloat.

ISRAEL DROPS PLAN TO SELL RADAR PLANE TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has canceled
plans to sell a $250 million military radar plane to China,
eliminating a major irritant for Washington and easing the way for
Israel to obtain more US aid to secure a peace agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Wednesday to reporters near Camp David, where US-led
peace talks are under way, Israeli spokesman Gadi Baltiansky said
Barak, in a letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, had expressed
his ``sorrow'' for scuttling the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Baltiansky said Barak had informed President Clinton of his
decision at a meeting Tuesday night, and that the move was based on
America's objections to the sale and the desire of Israel to
maintain ``intimate relations with the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing US security concerns over the sale, White House Press
Secretary Joseph Lockhart said, ``We welcome the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli announcement came on the second day of a summit at
the mountainous presidential retreat in northern Maryland, where
Clinton is trying to help Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat resolve some of the thorniest issues to confront Mideast
peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hardest issues to resolve are the status of Jerusalem
and ``the right of return'' of some three million Palestinian
refugees. Wednesday, a member of Barak's Cabinet expressed
pessimism in Jerusalem that a deal could be struck at the summit
regarding the city's status.
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, the minister responsible for Jerusalem issues, said
in a briefing to the foreign press corps, ``I assume Jerusalem will
be on the table, and that there will be creative ideas on the
table. . . . But in the end it will be impossible for Israel to
give up full sovereignty. I will be very surprised if we reach an
agreement on Jerusalem now.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``In five to ten years maybe we could have creative
solutions. But both sides are not ready, and their people are not
ready now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon also outlined what he said was Barak's opening proposal on
partitioning the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials conceded the difficulty of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that we went into this knowing it would be a
struggle, we have not been disappointed by that,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   One complicating factor Wednesday was a request from Arafat that
members of the Palestine Liberation Organization's ruling Executive
Committee and ministers in the Palestinian Authority be allowed to
enter Camp David to lend support for his negotiating position with
Israel, according to Palestinian officials. Some of those who
Arafat wants invited in had opposed the 1993 Oslo accord which
paved the way for the summit.
</P>
<P>
   US officials scoffed at the idea, appearing to rule out any
possiblity that Palestinian officials other than those already in
the delegation would be invited or that Arafat would leave the
secluded retreat to meet with them. ``We agreed in advance on the
size of the parties, and those people are at Camp David now, and I
expect those people to stay there through the talks,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said US officials had not received a request from
Arafat to expand the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day in a row, Clinton met individually with
Arafat and Barak, using a stroll through the woods of the retreat
for his talk with the Palestinian leader. The three men and their
delegations also ate dinner together. Tuesday night, the group
dined on tenderloin of beef with sun-dried tomatoes and filet of
salmon with Thai curry sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton slept at Camp David a second night, and was planning to
return to the White House early Thursday. He is scheduled to speak
to the annual convention of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People in Baltimore and also attend a
congressional gold medal ceremony on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   While adhering to a news blackout on the substance of the talks,
Lockhart said Wednesday had been a busy day among all the parties,
adding, ``there's been real engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   At the press briefing in Jerusalem, Ramon detailed the plan for
a compromise on West Bank land that Barak brought with him to the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon said Barak had developed a formula for the percentages on
land return in the West Bank that he refered to as ``70, 20, 10.''
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy percent of the West Bank would come under full
Palestinian control. Currently, the Palestinian Authority has full
or partial control over 40 percent. The additional land would give
the Palestinian Authority a large area that is contiguous, and
closer to the parameters of a viable state. The Palestinian
Authority currently controls an archipelago of enclaves scattered
througout the chalky, terraced hills of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   --Twenty percent of the West Bank would fall under shared
control, with the Palestinians having administrative responsibility
and the Israelis having security control. Much of this land would
eventually be transferred to full Palestinian control provided
security guarantees were established.
</P>
<P>
   --Ten percent of the West Bank around the core blocks of Jewish
settlements, the Jordan River Valley, and military installations
would be annexed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barak came back with something close to this, we would be
very happy,'' Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
   But this proposal for ceding West Bank land to Palestinians
still falls short of the Palestinian demand that Israel withdraw
from all of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territory it captured
from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians insist that the historic peace accord signed on
the White House Lawn more than six years ago was established within
the framework of Israel complying with UN Resolution 242, which
calls for Israeli withdrawl from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, both Palestinian and Israeli, see the
two sides emerging from the summit with the broad parameters of an
agreement on borders.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in the United States, meanwhile, said Israel's decision
to call off its sale of the advanced Phalcon airborne radar system
to China, as the administration and members of Congress have been
been insisting it do, would help its cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It greases the skids a bit by removing what has really become
an obstacle,'' said Geoffrey Aronson, head of the foundation for
Middle East Peace. ``Assuming there is some sort of positive
outcome at Camp David, then when the day comes that Congess has to
consider a request for what will be called a peace package, they
will be more likely to approve it and less antagonzied over the
whole issue of Israeli arms sales to China,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Baltiansky, Barak's spokesman, appeared to leave the door
open on some future sales. ``Israel will continue to look for ways
to implement the deal in understanding with the US if the
circumstances change,'' he said.

 &HT;    Neagle trade called a business decision
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Jim Bowden pulled the plug on the Cincinnati Reds
for 2000. The patient, barely breathing as it was, officially
expired at 1:02 p.m. Wednesday when the general manager announced
the trade of No. 1 pitcher Denny Neagle to the New York Yankees for
four minor-league prospects, none of whom is ready to make a
contribution this year.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Bowden didn't try to put a positive spin on the
transaction, volunteering that when you trade your pitching ace you
are conceding, tossing in the rosin bag. It was business, he said,
big business.
</P>
<P>
   Just three days ago, Bowden coaxed Junior Griffey out of playing
in the All-Star game to rest a sore right knee and said, ``We want
him strong and ready for the second half run. We are only eight
games behind in our division and 4 1/2 behind in the wild-card.''
</P>
<P>
   What changed?
</P>
<P>
   Bowden said the Reds offered Neagle a three-year contract for
$18 million. Neagle, realizing he will get at least $18 million for
two years on the free agent market, didn't respond, other than to
tell Bowden he has never tested free agency and wanted to do it
after this season. Faced with losing Neagle without compensation,
Bowden chose to trade him for four young players who might make an
impact when the club moves into a new ballpark in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Why now? Why not wait until closer to the July 31 trade
deadline, when the Reds might be closer to the lead? Bowden said he
feared the Yankees might go elsewhere for a pitcher and yank their
offer off the table and he wanted the best he could get for Neagle,
who was 8-2 for the Reds this season and owns a 98-62 major-league
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we traded our No. 1 starter and we're hurting our
chances to win now and we know this,'' Bowden said. ``We're staying
with our goal of 2003, a championship club when we open the new
park. In order to do that, we have to make deals like this. I know
this deal with be unpopular, but the White Sox took a lot of grief
when they made a similar-type trade two years ago, but in the end,
that's how you win, by stockpiling young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it definitely hurts our chances of winning now,'' Bowden
added. ``We all know that. He was our No. 1 starter and won't be
out there the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden also conceded that one of the four players obtained for
Neagle is a major risk. Third baseman Drew Henson plays football
(quarterback) at the University of Michigan, starts his junior
season this fall, and is a threat to play pro football rather than
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden also said media and fans shouldn't assume that because
Neagle is gone there is more money to give shortstop Barry Larkin.
That isn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are totally separate issues,'' he said. ``We're not
letting one go to use money for the other. That's totally
unrelated. It is not done that way. We have to sign players for
numbers that work for us. You win with starting pitching, bottom
line. Denny Neagle is a pitcher we wanted to sign. We felt he would
negotiate off our offer, but he never gave us that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden cited Minnesota signing pitcher Brad Radke to a four-year
$36 million deal, ``So I certainly don't blame Denny Neagle for
wanting to go see what he can get. When he told us he would not
sign, we felt we had no alternative but to make the best deal we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Why so early?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had seven teams who were after Denny, so we did a lot of
scouting and research of their farm systems,'' Bowden said. ``There
was not a deal out there that was close to the Yankees and we
didn't want to get in a situation two weeks from now when the
Yankees offer might not be there, that they might go in a different
direction, and we couldn't get this much talent from other
organizations. So we made the best deal we possibly could.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle was scheduled to pitch tonight in Denver against the
Rockies, which sends manager Jack McKeon and pitching coach Don
Gullett scrambling. Either a well-rested Steve Parris will step in
or Ron Villone, exiled to the bullpen last week, re-emerges into
the rotation. Bowden admits that when he traded Neagle he had no
contingencies for a rotation replacement.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon, bless his optimistic heart, refuses any unconditional
surrender terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now? No problem,'' he says. ``We'll put Villone back
into the rotation. No question, though, we have to get a pitcher or
two somewhere soon. Throw in the towel? I don't know about that.
They said that when we traded Dave Burba, our scheduled Opening Day
pitcher, in 1998. We just need somebody to step up. It's a golden
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   More like platinum.

U.S. AND VIETNAM REACH ACCORD ON TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and Vietnam have completed a
sweeping trade agreement that would allow generally unfettered
commerce between the two nations for the first time since the end
of the Vietnam War more than a quarter-century ago, people involved
in the negotiations said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnamese and American officials reached the agreement in
Washington this week after nearly four years of fitful negotiations
and after Vietnam walked away from a deal last year that the
Clinton administration had considered sealed. The agreement was
expected to be signed and formally announced later this week or
early next week, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Vietnam and the United States restored full diplomatic
ties in 1995, it has been s cold peace commercially. The two
nations have miniscule trade flows of less than $1 billion. America
ranks ninth among foreign investors there despite an initial flurry
of interest in the Vietnamese market.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of major American multinational corporations,
including Cargill, Caterpillar and Nike, have invested in Vietnam.
Some independent economic analysts expect that companies like Nike
would immediately add thousands of jobs in Vietnam if American
tariffs of Vietnamese-produced goods are substantially lowered.
Vietnam's industrious but low-wage workers could begin producing in
bulk for the American market as workers in China do today.
</P>
<P>
   The trade agreement would also open Vietnam's market of 77
million people to a wide range of American companies as never
before, though it would not immediately eliminate the bureaucratic
inertia that has made that market impenetrable for all but the most
resilient foreign multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts also see the agreement as an indication that
Vietnam's top leaders are willing to push the economic reforms
started in the 1980s to a new level, perhaps because neighboring
China has accelerated its economic overhaul in preparation to join
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The accord, if signed as scheduled, would allow President
Clinton to claim yet another milestone in trade liberalization
shortly after the House granted China permanent normal trading
rights, another of the administration's final remaining foreign
policy priorities. The Senate has yet to vote on the China trade
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in negotiating the Vietnam agreement
said that it is likely to be signed this week if Clinton is able to
return from Camp David, where he is brokering peace talks between
Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress would still have to approve the agreement and
extend normal trade privileges to Vietnam, a vote that some
administration official believe is unlikely this election year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would require sharp reductions in U.S. tariffs on
sensitive Vietnamese goods _ like textiles, shoes and electronics _
a concession that labor unions have often fought bitterly against
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Some 58,000 American soldiers died and 2,000 are still listed as
missing in action in Vietnam from the war years, and anti-Vietnam
sentiment among some veteran groups and members of Congress still
runs strong, especially because the Hanoi government has not
embarked on substantial political change.
</P>
<P>
   But few expect strong resistance to the pact in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this should be viewed as a sign that they are
undertaking serious economic and political reform there, and that's
something we have to be in favor of,'' Sen. John McCain, the
Arizona Republican who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, said on
Wednesday ``There's some negative sentiment left over, but I think
Congress would be happy to pass this.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would grant Vietnam the same trading rights here
that most other nations have, including reductions of up to 90
percent in tariffs levied on Vietnamese exports. That would make
Vietnam a far more attractive place for manufacturing companies,
which have invested much less in Vietnam than in China and
Southeast Asian nations that have broader trading rights in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   American companies, in turn, could crack open areas that are
essentially off limits in Vietnam today, including
telecommunications, financial services, retail and distribution,
people involved in the talks said. Vietnam would also agree to
protect foreign intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined to release details of the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trade agreement is absolutely necessary if Vietnam wants
to be connected to a globalized world,'' said Thomas Vallely, an
expert on the country at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
``It's just a huge problem for them to remain basically cut off for
the world's biggest economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached in principle after talks between U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Vietnam's trade
minister, Vu Khoan.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is expected to make use of the momentum created by the
deal to push for membership in the World Trade Organization. But
many analysts expect that process will still take several years.
</P>
<P>
   The people involved in the bilateral talks warned that there
could still be glitches before a final trade deal is signed.
</P>
<P>
   They said that translating trade language _ including some
seemingly straightforward financial terms like equity _ has proven
a stumbling block in the past, with Vietnamese negotiators agreeing
to the phrases in English but objecting to them when expressed in
their native language.
</P>
<P>
   A similar pact was initialed by trade negotiators last November
but then came to a dead stop after Communist leaders in Hanoi
apparently had second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that while the Vietnamese government generally
support trade liberalization, some elements of the Communist party
and powerful leaders of state-run industries, combined with a
lingering distrust of the United States, have kept Vietnam several
steps behind China in adapting to capitalist ways.

AS MEXICAN GOVERNMENT CHANGES HANDS, SO MAY ITS LOBBYING CONTRACTS
IN U.S.  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his office in Mexico City, Vicente Fox, Mexico's
president-elect, has already received a lot of callers from K
Street, Washington's corridor of political influence.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of law firms, lobbying groups and public relations firms
are preparing their pitches for the new government's business in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government spends millions of dollars annually to
lobby the executive branch and Congress on trade, immigration, law
enforcement and other issues and to burnish Mexico's image in the
United States. But Fox, who is to be inaugurated in December, is
likely to pick a new team of Washington lobbyists to press the
political agenda of Mexico's new governing party, the National
Action Party, known by the Spanish acronym PAN.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably some of the lobbyists who have worked with the old
government will be cut,'' said Carlos Salazar, a foreign-policy
adviser to Fox. ``This is very natural.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be bad news for a number of firms in Washington with
six-figure retainers from Mexico's current government, controlled
by the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as
PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Although it does not employ as many Washington lobbyists as
Japan or Hong Kong, Mexico has become one of the most prized
foreign government accounts since 1993, when it assembled a $20
million armada of law, lobbying and public relations firms to help
pass the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mexico has pared its team to about a dozen
firms, including Public Strategies Inc., whose president, Joseph P.
O'Neill, was a lead lobbyist for Mexico on NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, the government of outgoing President
Ernesto Zedillo has paid over half a million dollars spread over
various firms for lobbying on trade, immigration, and law
enforcement issues, according to reports filed with the Justice
Department by the lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Public Strategies, the list of lobbyists registered as
foreign agents to represent Mexico's interests includes two
high-powered Democratic law firms, Manatt Phelps &AMP; Phillips, and
Verner, Liipfert, Berhard, McPherson &AMP; Hand. Manatt Phelps is
headed by former Democratic National Committee chairman Charles
Manatt, and Verner, Liipfert employs many prominent Democrats,
including former Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell, although
former Senate Republican leader Bob Dole is also a member of the
firm. The Mexican government also retains the law firm Shearman &AMP;
Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is not well known in Washington and has not yet established
ties on K Street. This week a small group of Fox's international
advisers, including Salazar, has been visiting Washington for a
three-day visit. The trip was packed with one on one meetings with
senators, congressmen and political scientists from local think
tanks, but Salazar did not leave any time for lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, definitely not,'' said Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, Salazar has made other goodwill trips here
because leading PAN officials believed the agenda and image of
their party was misrepresented in the United States by the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, he has never met with lobbyists to discuss the
possibility of new accounts with the PAN or the renewal of existing
accounts at firms, which have ties to the current government.
</P>
<P>
   During the election, Fox relied on some U.S. political advisers,
including Dick Morris, President Clinton's veteran political
adviser. That work is done, but Morris said of Fox, paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything he asked me to do, I certainly would do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox government may decide to wait until after the U.S.
elections in November to replace its line-up of lobbyists. If the
Republicans win the presidency, Fox might want to retain firms with
more prominent Republicans. One thing is certain, he will not have
to look hard to find eager prospects for his business.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Jim Jones, who is now a
consultant at Manatt, Phelps and Phillips and has been advising Fox
on the presidential transition, said that several prominent
lobbying firms have already flown to Mexico to court Fox as a
client.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two bodies were recovered Wednesday from the rubble
of a Brooklyn townhouse that exploded on Tuesday night, and fire
investigators said that they strongly suspected the blast was
caused by a gas leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the main possibility,'' said Chief Fire Marshal Louis
F. Garcia, citing the nature of the damage, the absence of other
obvious causes and the accounts of neighbors who said they smelled
gas before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really looking at anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon Wednesday, firefighters discovered the body
of Leonard Walit, 72, buried under tons of rubble in the basement
of his townhouse at 420 State St. in Boerum Hill. Eight hours
later, firefighters discovered the body of his friend and neighbor,
Khay Cochran, 73, and they were continuing Wednesday night to
search for Walit's wife, Harriet, 66, a retired social worker.
</P>
<P>
   For friends and relatives and neighbors, it was a devastating
day _ a day in which hope faded to nothing and a stunned
neighborhood was left to confront the mystery of fate.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Mrs. Walit, 66, had called Cochran complaining
of the smell of gas, neighbors said. Cochran, 73, a close friend of
the Walits, went next door to help investigate. Minutes later, an
explosion obliterated the Walits' place and all but obliterated the
adjoining townhouse that Cochran shared at 418 State St. with his
longtime companion, Julian Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet miraculously, Jackson and another roommate, Francis Aguire,
escaped with barely a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, his white dress shirt coated
in black dust from a night of supervising several hundred
firefighters, said the explosion could have been touched off by
something as simple as someone turning on a light, or lighting a
match. The explosion _ so intense that it snuffed out all flames in
an instant _ appeared to have originated from the Walits' basement,
knocking out supported walls and allowing the upper floors to
collapse in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building just pancaked,'' said Philip J. Burns, a deputy
fire chief.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investigators said it was far from clear whether the leak came
from a gas service line or from an appliance. The townhouse, they
said, had a gas stove, a gas boiler and a gas water heater, and a
spokesman for Keyspan Energy, the utility company, said that the
company's investigators had not identified any leaks coming from
its supply lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found zero evidence of natural gas leaking in the area,''
said Robert J. Mahoney, manager of media relations for Keyspan. He
cautioned, however, that because of the damage the company had not
been able to test the service lines leading directly into 420 and
418 State St.
</P>
<P>
   And although neighbors reported smelling gas before the
explosion, Mahoney said that the company's records of gas
complaints did not show any telephone calls from the neighborhood
on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than a month ago, on June 5, a resident at 422 State
St. complained to Keyspan about a gas smell. The odor, the resident
reported, was strongest near a wall that adjoined 420 State St.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said that Keyspan workers promptly investigated the
complaint, performed extensive testing inside and outside 422 State
St., but failed to detect any leakage of gas. Given those results,
he said, there was no need to test 420 State St. or other
residences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went by the book,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunni Levinson, the person who made the complaint, said that
the Keyspan worker who responded told her that he, too, smelled
gas. ``It makes you wonder,'' she said. ``We smelled it, they
smelled it. When the gas man says he smells it, it has to come from
somewhere, and you have to find it.'' She added, however, that in
the weeks since she has not smelled gas.

   AUSTRIA: EUROPEAN PANEL PICKED
</P>
<P>
   The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg named three men
to a panel that will study Austria's human rights record and the
political nature of Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party. They
are former President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland; a former foreign
minister of Spain, Marcelino Oreja; and a German professor, Jochen
Frowein, director of the Max-Planck Institute. Their review could
lead to an end to Austria's political isolation within the European
Union.

   BRITAIN: SPEAKER TO QUIT
</P>
<P>
   Betty Boothroyd, the first woman to be Speaker of the House of
Commons, whose cries of ``Order! Order!'' are familiar to
television viewers in Britain and abroad, announced that she will
retire this fall. Boothroyd, 70, a Labor Party lawmaker since 1973
and Speaker since 1992, said ``Be happy for me!'' in response to
groans of disappointment. She received a round of applause, rarely
heard in Parliament.

   GERMANY: PROTESTANT CONFESSION
</P>
<P>
   The Protestant church admitted it used forced laborers in World
War II and said it would pay $4.9 million to a $4.9 billion
compensation fund for Nazi-era victims. The acknowledgment came
after disclosures that from 1943 to 1945, 26 Protestant and 2
Catholic parishes in Berlin ran a camp for about 100 forced
laborers from eastern Europe and Russia for work in graveyards. A
Catholic spokesman said the church had no plans to contribute to
the fund.
</P>
<P>
   GREECE: GERMAN PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   Germany lodged a protest with Greece as bailiffs, guarded by the
police, moved to assess the value of German property in Athens to
be seized and sold in compensation for the massacre of 218 Greek
villagers by Nazi forces in 1944. The properties include the Goethe
Institute. The Supreme Court sanctioned the move in an April ruling
awarding $30 million to the victims' families.

<P>
   GREECE: ANTITERROR MESSAGE
</P>
<P>
   Greek television broadcast a message against terrorism at noon
as lawmakers and civil servants held a minute's silence in tribute
to terrorist victims. The message, reading ``Terrorism is an insult
to Greeks, and a threat to Greece,'' comes a month after the
assassination of Brig. Stephen Saunders, Britain's top military
envoy to Athens.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ To comprehend baseball's power epidemic, look no
further than the Braves' midseason acquisition of right-hander Andy
Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   Others teams have blamed shrinking ballparks, the batters'
expanding biceps, the microscopic strike zone and an enigmatic
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves knew they needed pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight games into the 2000 season, the always
pitching-strong Braves had been exposed as weaklings. Despite the
best record in the National League, they were fortunate to have a
three-game lead in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are counting on Ashby, a two-time All-Star with a
career record of 76-81, to shore up a starting rotation that has
struggled. Not even All-Star first halves by Greg Maddux and Tom
Glavine and a better-than-could-be expected contribution from John
Burkett could make up for the fact that ``The Untouchables'' just
aren't anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Big Three'' used to refer to Maddux, Glavine and John
Smoltz. At the moment, it could be used to describe the earned-run
averages of starters Kevin Millwood (5.34), Terry Mulholland (5.71)
and Burkett (5.05).
</P>
<P>
   At the break, the Braves' ERA of 4.31 is third in the majors,
behind Boston (4.19) and Arizona (4.21). Not since 1990 (4.58), the
year before their postseason streak started, have the Braves
finished a season with a staff ERA higher than 3.63.
</P>
<P>
   That team ERA shows the absence of Smoltz, a pitcher known best
for his October feats. The Braves are missing the 14 wins and 214
innings he averages a season. With Smoltz gone, Mulholland has to
start, which has contributed to the disarray in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Braves used 15 different pitchers in
relief. Included were two starters, Burkett and Mulholland; two
21-year-olds, Jason Marquis and Luis Rivera; two players turned
loose by other teams at the end of spring training, Greg McMichael
and Scott Kamieniecki; the best a losing AAA Richmond team had to
offer, Don Wengert, Dave Stevens and Ismael Villegas; one elbow
surgery survivor, Kerry Ligtenberg; and John Rocker, who, in
addition to his other problems, is fighting the worst control
problems the Braves have seen since Mark Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (hurt by a batting-practice flyball to the shoulder) and
Mike Remlinger (reaction to dye injection from an MRI) have had
freak injuries recently, to go along with the shoulder problems of
Luis Rivera, McMichael and Kevin McGlinchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken some unfair criticism this year,'' Glavine said,
``because you take Smoltz and (Rudy) Seanez and Rem out of the
equation, (and,) my god, what do you expect?''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise has been Millwood's problems. The 25-year-old, who
last year made his first All-Star team and contended for the Cy
Young Award contention, has rivaled Mulholland as the least
consistent starter. In his first two full seasons, he won 17 and 18
games; at the break this year, he has five. His eight losses
matched Mulholland for the most on the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood and new outfielder Reggie Sanders _ .179 batting
average, 4 homers and 13 RBIs _ have been the biggest
disappointments so far.
</P>
<P>
   In April, however, the Braves went on the biggest run in
franchise history to win 15 games in a row, the most in the
National League in 51 years. Since then, however, the record has
been just 32-30.
</P>
<P>
   Over the first six weeks of the season, the Braves went 20-4
when scoring four runs or more. Over the next six weeks, they were
24-9 in those games. The Braves have gone from 18-6 in April and
17-10 in May to 13-15 in June and 4-5 in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very fortunate to be up (three) games,'' 1999 MVP
Chipper Jones said. ``The team that won 15 games in a row, this
team hasn't resembled that team in quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part of the Braves' schedule is still to come. They
have not played the other division leaders, the St. Louis Cardinals
and the Arizona Diamondbacks. They have played just four of the
scheduled 13 games against the Mets and have gone 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``As badly as we've played, in our minds or by our own
expectations, nobody else in our league has really taken advantage
of it,'' Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, to still look up and find you're in first place
is a big boost mentally. We're not dominating the pitching side of
things the way we have in the past, but to me, man for man, we're
still better than a lot of teams.''

SCAFFOLDS: SAY, WHO BLOTTED OUT THE SKY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to correct reason for Local Law 11, in 8th graf; changes
`streetwalkers' to `passers-by' in 7th graf.) 
 By JOHN LELAND    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the ribbon of scaffolding and razor coils went
up around his building on 101st Street and Broadway a few months
back, Paul Byard took it as a harmless inconvenience. As an
architect, he'd been responsible for his share of those steel and
plywood constructions over the years. The awning was an eyesore,
but a temporary one. Then, walking down Broadway on a recent night,
he approached yet another makeshift overhang, this one more
isolated, an ad hoc darkened alley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was grungy, scary, not well lit,'' Byard, a partner in
Platt Byard Dovell, recalled. ``And it was richly inhabited by
people with social problems.'' He considered crossing the street
but soldiered through, more annoyed than genuinely threatened.
``It's a nuisance,'' he said of the structures casting a shadow
over an ever-greater part of the city grid. ``You have to walk in
the street to get around it. It cuts off diagonals. And it makes it
awkward to jaywalk.''
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming the signature profile for much of the city: not
the grand Deco kitsch of the Chrysler building or the telltale
green canvas of Starbucks creep, but the unlovely clump of plywood
and metal tubing known in the trade as the sidewalk shed or bridge.
The Department of Buildings, which regulates the structures, issued
1,806 permits for sheds in the first six months of 2000, up roughly
80 percent from the same period just five years ago. Obstructing
sightlines and walking paths, squeezing already congested
sidewalks, the sheds have become pedestrians' analog to squeegee
guys, a minor obstacle replicated onto every street corner, at
least when you're in a hurry. ``They're out of hand,'' said Vanessa
Gruen, director of special projects at the nonprofit Municipal Art
Society, referring not just to the sheds but to the giant
billboards screaming from many. ``I think they're terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sheds come and go in a few months; others, erected around
buildings caught up in litigation or other financial entanglements,
can linger for years, without any sign of repair work above.
</P>
<P>
   So where, you might ask, is the outrage? New Yorkers, especially
those who sit on co-op boards, can come to blows over carpet
samples. Yet they have been strangely accommodating on the scaffold
question, accepting the civic intrusion as a twist of providence,
like car alarms or private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``One gets used to it,'' said Michael Blackwood, a documentary
filmmaker who has for more than a year lived behind a dark steel
mesh while workers restore the facade of his landmark 58th Street
co-op. Blackwood described the disruption as necessary and minor.
``It's like being sick for a while,'' he added. ``You go through it
and then you get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for shed spread are mundane. Contractors like Sal
Impieri, branch manager of Safway Steel Products in Brooklyn,
credit the strong economy for a boom in construction and
renovation. At the same time, the city's infrastructure is showing
the effects of a century of erosion and stress, developing
unfortunate creaks and cracks that threaten the pedestrians below.
There is no telling how many passers-by or billable hours have been
saved by a timely shed. Impieri, who works the high end of the
market, estimates that his business has grown 30 to 40 percent in
each of the last two years, a rise he described as common in the
industry. By his lights, the aesthetic impact of all that
scaffolding is not to be underestimated. ``When you're in the
business,'' he said, ``everything looks beautiful, whether I do it
or someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason for all the sheds may be bureaucratic. In
1998, after bricks fell from a Madison Ave- nue office building,
the city passed a  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  regulation known as Local
Law 11, calling for inspection of all facades over six stories. The
deadline for inspection was in March. Once up, sheds can linger,
sometimes for several years. Landlords run out of money for
repairs; contrac- tors leave for more lucrative jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like dealing with contractors on my own house,''
said Gary Larson, executive vice president of the Scaffolding
Industry Association, a trade group. ``I'm ready to shoot them.''
Scaffolding contractors set up the sheds, then take them away when
all is finished: It is up to all the other parties to get the work
done. Though scaffold permits last only a year, landlords can renew
them by attesting that they have not done the repair work. As long
as the shed keeps the sidewalk safe, the city doesn't penalize
landlords for not finishing the work.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent stroll up the Avenue of the Americas toward Herald
Square, Neel Scott emerged from the shadow of one rusty overhang
like a swimmer coming up for air before diving under the next.
Scott is a campaign coordinator for Transportation Alternatives, an
advocacy group for pedestrians and bicyclists; strictly speaking,
this disarray is his metier. ``That's just what I'm talking
about,'' he said, trying to squeeze upstream against a rush-hour
tide heading down. The shed's support poles stood about 2{ feet
from the building and 1{ feet from the curb, trimming the sidewalk
by about four feet. Sidewalk vendors hawked cheap toys and gadgets
underneath; a man oblivious to the crush slept under a ragged
blanket in the shade.
</P>
<P>
   For Zoltan Lebovich, the building's superintendent, this scene
was a vision of progress. ``Everyone likes it, they hide from the
rain. Even the homeless,'' he said, adding that the shed would come
down in four to six months, once the building was repointed.
</P>
<P>
   David Barone, standing in the shadow before his empty shop, was
less enthusiastic about the obstruction and the community growing
beneath it. ``People are missing the store,'' he complained, his
awning obscured by the protective canopy. ``It hurts, but what are
you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, some architects contend, is prettier scaffolding.
Michael Graves drew mostly positive responses to the aluminum and
blue polyester sheath he erected around the Washington Monument,
since removed in time for the Fourth of July festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after a 16th-century etching by the Roman architect
Domenico Fontana, the construction was a cover-up Washington people
could get behind; groups in Minneapolis and Richmond, Va.,
campaigned to move it to their towns for permanent display. Both
projects fell through, but Graves sees the restoration as a
possible lead to a new, decorative age of scaffolding. ``Think of
the advertising opportunities, or the opportunities for younger
artists,'' he said, speaking from a hotel phone in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Graves considers New York's current scaffold glut
an emblem of dynamism, not an aesthetic blight. ``My worry isn't
about the scaffolding, but that what you see when it comes down is
a disappointment. You think maybe the scaffolding was better.''
</P>
<P>
   The British writer G.K. Chesterton proposed that ``there is
something strangely primary and poetic about this sight of the
scaffolding and main lines of a human building; it is a pity there
is no scaffolding round a human baby.'' A warming thought, perhaps.
But then, Chesterton never had to squeeze himself under a cramped
midtown awning at rush hour, or return home to find his apartment
swaddled in steel tubes and marquee-size ads for a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say, he did not live in New York City at the start
of the 21st century, looking up for the stars and seeing instead
the corrugated sheet metal of yet another sidewalk shed. If he had,
he might have viewed scaffolding differently. Or he might have kept
his head down and commented on it not at all.

MARKETPLACE: BROKERAGE HOUSES THRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also UBS-IMPACT) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only a year ago, it seemed, the future of the
traditional brokerage firm was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of unprofitable, upstart electronic brokers had soared
while those of some Wall Street titans were sagging. Predictions of
the demise of the stockbroker ran rampant as investors flocked to
the Internet, attracted by cheap trades and the ability to control
their financial destinies.
</P>
<P>
   But, judging by the announcement on Wednesday that UBS, the
Swiss banking giant, will pay about $12 billion to buy PaineWebber
Group, the traditional brokerage firm is not dead yet _ far from
it. At a purchase price of $73.50 a share, UBS is paying a premium
of 47 percent over PaineWebber's closing price on Tuesday, before
the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Although some analysts said they thought UBS was paying too
much, most agreed that PaineWebber's network of brokers who cater
to investors with at least $500,000 in assets is a franchise that
has proved far more valuable than its critics ever acknowledged
through most of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   PaineWebber has capitalized on the shift away from traditional
pensions toward more reliance on individual retirement accounts,
401(k)s and the like, said Donald B. Marron, the company's chairman
and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created a nation of individual pension fund managers _
50 million of them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The firm earned more than $1 billion before taxes last year,
more than triple its pretax profit in 1995. Its momentum has slowed
recently. On Wednesday, PaineWebber announced second-quarter
earnings that were down 10 percent from a year ago before a charge
for expenses related to the firm's $620 million acquisition of
brokerage firm J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co. Including the charge,
PaineWebber earned $127.5 million, or 82 cents a share, down from
$163.5 million, or $1.02 a share, in the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its success is a direct result of its ability to persuade
wealthy investors to pay for advice on what they should do with
their money. Most of those clients could save several thousands
dollars a year by managing their money themselves through an
account at ETrade or Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   But Marron has never wavered in his belief that they would not.
He has long preached the value of personal advice and has staunchly
refused to compete on price with the wave of discounters that shook
up the business over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of PaineWebber came about six months after Schwab
acknowledged the importance of offering advice to wealthy investors
by agreeing to pay $2.7 billion to buy U.S. Trust, a New York-based
firm that manages private money in much the same way as UBS does in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Deals like that one demonstrate that ``You've got to keep moving
upstream,'' said Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group. To gauge the threat posed to traditional brokerage firms by
the electronic challengers, he said, ``All you have to do is look
at where the pure e-brokerage stocks are trading today.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of ETrade are at $16.50, more than 70 percent below where
they were trading in May 1999. Meanwhile, shares of Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co. closed on Wednesday at an all-time high of $131.5625.
</P>
<P>
   While turmoil in the market, particularly big plunges in some
technology stocks popular among individual investors, contributed
to the reversal, this turnaround did not happen automatically.
PaineWebber, along with its three bigger rivals, Merrill Lynch,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Salomon Smith Barney, all moved last
year to offer online trading. Even more important, they repriced
their basic brokerage accounts to narrow the cost gap between
themselves and the discounters.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than appearing endangered, stock brokers are in demand.
All of the major United States brokerage firms say they will
continue to expand their ranks of brokers and some analysts expect
PaineWebber's competitors to use the takeover as a reason to step
up efforts to lure brokers from other firms.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for established brokers with rosters of clients
is intense, and most firms offer brokers big cash bonuses to defect
and bring their customers' accounts with them. Those tussles often
wind up in court as the firms scramble to court the customers.
</P>
<P>
   An undisclosed part of the $875 million UBS set aside to retain
PaineWebber employees is earmarked for brokers. But holding on to
its best brokers will be a challenge for PaineWebber because they
tend to fear change and many of them will be cashing in restricted
stock and options that they would have lost if they had left the
firm before a buyout.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Marron and Ospel played down the likelihood of a
clash of cultures when UBS takes control of the brokers in what
would be the first direct acquisition of a major United States
brokerage firm by a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
   He and other UBS executives and their financial advisers talked
up the potential increase in revenue from selling stocks and bonds
and other investment products created by UBS's investment banking
operations to PaineWebber customers. But that strategy runs the
risk that the harder UBS pushes its own products, the more it
threatens to alienate brokers and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts argue that PaineWebber's success derives in part
from an image of giving generally unbiased advice because its
investment banking side _ where deals are struck and new companies
are taken public _ has never mounted much of a threat to its
competitors on Wall Street. Moreover, while PaineWebber has built a
strong asset management business, known as Mitchell Hutchins, the
firm's own mutual funds account for only about a quarter of the
funds sold by its brokers. In contrast, about three-fourths of the
funds sold by Morgan Stanley's Dean Witter brokerage unit are its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of PaineWebber and UBS took pains to emphasize that
PaineWebber's management would remain in place and only the
investment banking operations of PaineWebber would be merged into
UBS. Even then, they said, the number of job losses would be
minimal because there is so little overlap between the two firms'
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Mr, Marron, 65, said he would stay on as chairman of
PaineWebber, which will keep its name as the brokerage unit of UBS,
and will take on the new title of chairman of UBS North America. He
said he also would spend more time on investments in private
companies and would retain responsibility for the impressive
collection of modern art that PaineWebber has accumulated during
his tenure.

   Joseph Grano, PaineWebber's president, will run the brokerage

   Last year, he said, 7 percent of the households in the United
States controlled about two-thirds of the nation's investment
assets, or about $12.5 trillion. By 2003, he predicted, that group
will grow to include 11 percent of households that will control 78
percent of the assets, or about $24.6 billion.

MYLAN SETTLES PRICING LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the world's largest producers of generic
drugs tentatively agreed on Wednesday to pay $147 million to settle
accusations that it improperly cornered the market on raw materials
for two widely prescribed drugs and then raised the price of those
drugs, in some instances by more than 3,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the government and a judge, the settlement with
Mylan Laboratories Inc. would be the largest ever reached by the
Federal Trade Commission in an anti-competition case.
</P>
<P>
   It would resolve lawsuits filed almost two years ago by the
commission, 33 states and a number of other drug purchasers, from
the largest health maintenance organizations to groups of insured
and uninsured patients. They had accused Mylan of monopolizing the
market and conspiring to restrain trade.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative settlement, which was confirmed by government
officials, also proposes to plow new legal ground by using most of
the money to reimburse consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In the majority of antitrust cases, the Federal Trade Commission
has sought injunctions to halt illegal conduct. It is rare for the
commission to force a company to surrender what it regards as
ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also marks an important step in efforts by the
government to control spiraling medical costs. Generic drugs have
historically been more attractive to consumers, particularly people
on fixed incomes and the elderly, because they are less expensive
than brand names.
</P>
<P>
   But a few years ago the prices of many popular generic drugs
began to rise drastically, far outpacing increases in brand-name
drugs, and some analysts said that Mylan was the most aggressive of
the price raisers.
</P>
<P>
   The cases concerned two widely prescribed anti-anxiety drugs,
which shot up in price in 1998. Doctors issue more than 21 million
prescriptions each year for the drugs, lorazepam, the generic
version of Ativan, and clorazepate, the generic version of
Tranxene.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Mylan raised the price of a bottle of 500 tablets of
clorazepate to $377 from $11.36. A similar-sized bottle of
lorazepam was raised to $190 from $7.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the price increases were a result of
exclusive license agreements Mylan had reached with its supplier
for certain ingredients of the drugs. The government said the
agreements prevented Mylan's rivals from obtaining sufficient
supplies and enabled the company to gouge patients on the prices it
charged for the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said on Wednesday that they had vigorously pursued
Mylan because they thought the company's conduct was particularly
egregious and had hurt society's most vulnerable members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This illegal conduct has cost consumers millions of dollars
over the past two years,'' said Betty D. Montgomery, the attorney
general of Ohio. ``What makes this behavior even more
unconscionable is that these drugs, especially lorazepam, are
anti-anxiety mediations frequently prescribed for nursing home and
hospice patients, including those suffering from long-term
debilitating conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk of the restitution will go back into the pockets of
the affected seniors, where it belongs,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   As they have since 1998, Mylan executives said on Wednesday that
they never violated any antitrust laws. But they said that they had
decided to settle because of the continuing costs and uncertainties
associated with the lawsuits. Mylan officials estimated that the
lawsuits had already cost the company more than $20 million and
that in recent months it was spending about $6 million every
quarter on the litigation. Company executives also said they were
willing to settle the cases for more than the federal government
had sought because they feared that the government might try to
expand the lawsuit, include broader accusations and seek larger
damages. The federal government had sought $120 million, and the
amount being sought by the private plaintiffs has not been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in Mylan's 39-year history that any
government agency has accused us of improper conduct,'' said Milan
Puskar, chairman and chief executive of the company, which is based
in Pittsburgh. ``We continue to believe we acted properly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The board and I view these settlements to be in the best
interest of our company's shareholders, customers and employees,''
Puskar said. ``By putting a significant portion of this case behind
us, we can now look forward to devoting our full resources to the
business of this company.''
</P>
<P>
   While many details of the tentative settlement must be ironed
out over the next month, the plan is to distribute $100 million to
all of the states, which will then determine which purchasers
should be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen states have their own drug assistance programs
to help low-income patients, and they may be among the larger
beneficiaries of Wednesday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   An additional $35 million is earmarked to settle private
lawsuits brought by institutional purchasers. The remaining $12
million will be paid to the government and private lawyers to cover
legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the tentative settlement does not end all of the legal
disputes. Mylan executives said the agreement did not settle 11
lawsuits brought by some institutional purchasers, like
wholesalers. The company said it would continue to defend against
those cases and that it was confident it would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Three other companies that were accused of conspiring with Mylan
to corner the market on raw ingredients also settled, but because
they are indemnified by Mylan they will not have to pay any
damages. The three are the Cambrex Corporation, a chemical supplier
in East Rutherford, N.J.; Profarmaco, an Italian drug supplier
owned by Cambrex; and Gyma Laboratories of America, which is in
Westbury, N.Y., and is Profarmaco's American distributor. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines, the diamond company that reigned as
one of the most powerful monopolies of the 20th century, announced
Wednesday in London a seismic shift in the way it does business.
</P>
<P>
   It will retreat from its 70-year-old practice of manipulating
prices by hoarding the world's diamonds and charge into the
advertising-driven game of selling the stones as branded luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic overhaul, analysts say, is driven by the anemic
performance of De Beers stock in recent years and by public
relations fears that ``conflict diamonds'' from Africa are
poisoning a carefully nurtured image of De Beers stones as symbols
of ``love, beauty and purity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all need to become more customer-focused and recognize the
power of marketing to sell more diamonds,'' Nicky Oppenheimer, the
company chairman, said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers, which was created 110 years ago in South Africa,
controls two-thirds of the trade in uncut diamonds and owns mines
around the world that produce about half the stones unearthed each
year.
</P>
<P>
   It has been embarrassed by disclosures that to prop up prices,
it bought millions of dollars of diamonds from rebels in Angola.
</P>
<P>
   The company has insisted that it bought the stones on the open
market and stopped all buying when a U.N. embargo was imposed in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   In London on Wednesday, De Beers made the most far-reaching of a
series of moves to back away from trading in diamonds mined by
African rebels who brutalize civilians. The company warned its 125
major trading partners that they would be barred from buying De
Beers diamonds if they trafficked in stones that originated in war
zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``De Beers is sending a clear signal to the rest of the industry
that it is no longer tolerable to profit from these diamonds,''
said Christine Gordon, a diamond industry analyst in London who
serves on a panel monitoring the U. N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council imposed a global ban this month on
diamond exports from Sierra Leone, where the stones have fueled a
savage rebel war. There are no sanctions, however, on stones from
Congo, where the scramble for diamonds helps sustain a war among
rebels, the government and armies from six African countries.
</P>
<P>
   While De Beers' move will further reduce the chances that
rebel-mined diamonds will trickle into American jewelry stores,
Gordon said there remained a large network of dealers who are not
beholden to De Beers. In addition, human rights groups are
skeptical about De Beers' ability to enforce its new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one thing to announce all these changes, but it is
another thing to make it stick,'' said Ian Smillie, co-author of a
scathing report this year about how the diamond industry supplied
the money that made war possible in Sierra Leone. ``There are quite
a lot of diamonds coming from these areas, and somebody is going to
lose money if they stop dealing with the rebels.''
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch called the De Beers move ``an important
announcement,'' but said more remained to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental issue is verification,'' said Carroll Bogert,
a spokeswoman in New York for the group, which has closely
monitored the trade in rebel-mined diamonds. ``Unless you have an
independent monitoring mechanism, I think questions will remain.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of its shift in business strategy, De Beers executives
said the company would reduce its stockpile of uncut diamonds in
London from $3.9 billion to about $2.5 billion by the end of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven decades, De Beers has used that stockpile _
which as recently as last year was valued at $5.2 billion _ as a
way to absorb excess diamonds from Africa, Russia or around the
world that might lower the cartel price of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   With the money earned by selling off much of the stockpile, De
Beers officials said, they will expand spending on diamond
advertising, while insisting that the company's trading partners do
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge untapped opportunity for all of us in the
industry to grow the diamond business and match the growth rates
enjoyed by leading luxury goods companies,'' said Gary Ralfe,
managing director of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Although diamond sales have soared in the last year, De Beers'
profitability has not. Much of the reason, company officials have
said, is that too much capital is tied up in the diamond stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond sales have grown far less robustly over the last 50
years than sales of other luxury goods. By reducing the stockpile
and increasing advertising, De Beers executives have said, they
hope to experience the sales growth of items like Gucci handbags.

PROPOSAL ON PRESCRIPTION DRUGS GETS MIXED RECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans carped Wednesday at a proposal
from one of their own, William Roth of Delaware, to add
prescription drug benefits to Medicare. But they praised him for
making the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is trying to
narrow the gap between Democrats and Republicans on the issue in an
election year. Under his proposal, the government would offer drug
coverage to all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, but if they
accepted the offer, they would have to pay more for some services,
like home health care.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Senate Democrats greeted Roth's proposal
with some optimism. Conservative Republicans showed little
enthusiasm for the proposal, but were circumspect in their
comments. They said they feared that the cost of prescription drug
benefits would soar, and they said Congress should not rush to pass
legislation just to appease voters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, a member of the Finance Committee,
expressed grave reservations about Roth's proposal, saying the
costs to the government ``could explode on us overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Medicare drug benefits may look unstoppable,
Gramm said in an interview, but he declared: ``The politics of this
issue are not as sweet as Bill Clinton thinks. There is not going
to be a major expansion of Medicare this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm suggested that Congress simply give money to the states _
$20 billion over the next five years _ so they could help
low-income people buy prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the assistant majority leader,
expressed concern about the long-term cost of Roth's proposal. Many
beneficiaries need drug coverage, he said, but Congress should not
try to solve the problem by creating ``a big expensive program.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Majority Leader Trent Lott appeared ready to
let the Finance Committee work its will. Lott said the committee
had ``a green light'' to write legislation offering drug benefits
to elderly and disabled people on Medicare. Without endorsing the
details of Roth's plan, he said he hoped the full Senate would
address the issue later this year.
</P>
<P>
   A bill passed last month by the House would give subsidies to
insurance companies that provide drug benefits to people on
Medicare. Under Roth's proposal, the government would administer
drug benefits and bear the financial risk.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton welcomed Roth's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that there is growing momentum on Capitol Hill to
provide a real Medicare prescription drug benefit, not a flawed
insurance model,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, went further,
describing Roth's proposal as ``a sharp repudiation of what the
House Republicans proposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said Republicans ``appeared to be
astounded'' at Roth's proposal. ``It's unique,'' Breaux said of the
proposal. ``It has opposition from Democrats and Republicans
both.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said they needed more details before they could
comment on the proposal. They did not embrace or reject it, but
said it might come in handy later this year if they saw a political
imperative to address demands from elderly voters clamoring for
relief from high drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators voiced other concerns, saying they worry
that elderly people with low incomes will not receive enough help
in drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And they said the government should spend more than the $40
billion proposed by Roth for drug benefits over the next five
years. They also generally oppose Roth's proposal to make
beneficiaries who choose drug benefits _ those who select his
so-called high-option alternative _ pay 20 percent of the cost of
home health care visits.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., said, ``I have a serious problem with
forcing seniors who need prescription drugs to leave Medicare as we
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., told colleagues that the proposal
would create a two-tier system in which affluent beneficiaries
chose the high-option plan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., expressed concern that under Roth's
proposal, people with very high drug costs would still have to pay
a substantial share of the costs, perhaps 20 percent. By contrast,
under many Democratic proposals, the government would pick up 100
percent of drug costs above some level, perhaps $4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these concerns, senators of both parties, including
Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the senior Democrat on the
Finance Committee, welcomed Roth's effort. They said it could be a
vehicle for further action if the Finance Committee proceeds to
debate and vote on the issue later this month, as Roth wants.

JOYCE'S PRIMARY GOAL: GET HEALTHY FOR UCLA SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cody Joyce sat in the New York New York Hotel in
Las Vegas and watched ``Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated it,'' he said. ``Absolutely terrible. I was bored
after 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet through his suffering, he nonetheless saw the dancers moving
their legs quickly and thought of his knee and how he can't move
like that.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce, a UCLA junior receiver from Hart High of Newhall, had
arthroscopic surgery four months ago _ and no one knows exactly
what's wrong with his knee. It appears regular stress has affected
it, that and surgery revealed scar tissue and dead tissue around
his patella tendon. However, it's not as definite as a torn
anterior cruciate ligament.
</P>
<P>
   The injury follows an infected blister on a toe, which followed
the flu, which followed a hamstring injury, which together have
limited Joyce to just four catches for 56 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to see him be successful,'' his receivers coach,
Ron Caragher, said. ``I don't see how the injuries can continue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the phone, Joyce sounds happy, laughing at his misfortunes.
He tries to stay positive.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates say he constantly smiles and says things are going to
work out. Yet it's not funny when he enters the UCLA locker room
and sees the countdown to the Bruins' Sept. 2 opener against
Alabama on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   He's 28 days away from the Aug. 10 start of fall camp and 51
days from Alabama and declares himself just 70 percent healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knees are frustrating,'' he said. ``You've got good days and
bad days. If I push it hard for a day, it swells up and I have to
lay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically happy-go-lucky. I dwell on the positive things,
but every once in a while, I get depressed for a day. I know if I
don't make in in camp, chances are I won't play.''
</P>
<P>
   He has healed enough to start running patterns with other
receivers and he has started lifting weights again. Jerry Owens,
his teammate at Hart and UCLA, himself rehabbing a hamstring pull,
sees Joyce at practice and knows he's frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an athlete, deep down inside you want to get out
there,'' Owens said. ``He didn't come to UCLA to sit on the bench.
. . . I ask him about it occasionally. Guys don't like to talk
about it. I don't bring it up too often.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of quitting doesn't come up. Although Joyce
realizes perhaps rest is the only cure, he wants to play and
doesn't want this injury to get the best of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to beat me,'' he said. ``I have too much fun
playing with the guys. I won't rest until after my career's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the playbook very well. The only issue is to get
healthy.''

gallery owner Evelyn Siegel walked through Grant's home, she saw
the painting and told the artist that it was one of the finest she
had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She also said that she would rather have her fingernails
pulled out than to wake up to that painting every day, because
she'd want to keep taking him down, and hugging him, and telling
him that everything would be OK,'' Grant says. ``I took that as a
supreme compliment, that she was getting the story.''
</P>
<P>
   But the anecdote also illustrates the paradox facing Grant and
most other serious artists. Although his art has been critically
praised, most of his early paintings were darkly provocative, often
difficult to look at, and as a result, off-putting to many
potential collectors. A few years ago, critics raved when Grant's
work was featured at a show in Santa Fe, but not one painting was
sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love art that they don't have to think about,'' Grant
says. ``They want something that decorates their environment and
makes it pretty. Then I go doing something with a guy in a
strangely lit situation wih a rope around his neck and his back to
you, and that requires some thought.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grant says any paintings he's attempted with an eye toward
sales have been disasters, ``weak, watery and embarrassing.'' His
natural evolution, personally and as an artist, has only recently
led to subjects that would appeal to a broader audience: skyscapes
and still lifes. He cannot identify the source of the rage that
produced his dark, almost defiantly uncommercial early work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often wondered about that,'' he says. ``I just think I
was a hypersensitive kid and terribly intuitive, overly intuitive
and overly aware of what was going on around me.'' That dark
world-view became increasingly exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Among his earliest childhood memories, he says, was of a spring
day in the family car, when the ground had thawed ``and you could
smell that perfume, the rain and the musk of the ground. And I was
aware in that moment that we had gone from the dead season to the
time when things were going to open and bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   But somewhere, in his life and work, that sense of wonder at the
mysteries and beauty of nature had been lost. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a small group of children would congregate on
Grant's front porch to watch him paint. Grant noticed one boy in
particular, a sweet-natured, handsome child, whose inner life as
Grant came to know it inspired the artist to render the boy's
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was born out of wedlock, ``and he was reminded of that
every day,'' Grant says. The boy has since left town with his
family. ``His mother and stepfather loved him _ in spite of the
fact that he wasn't legitimate. You could see that he knew that
this was bad, that something was wrong with him, something organic
was wrong with him.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving permission from the boy's parents, Grant
sketched the boy and photographed him from several angles. But
before he did, Grant asked his young subject to let his face go
blank, to think of himself as an empty glass of water. The
transformation was remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see everything about him,'' Grant says. ``You could
read his emotional history in his eyes. What I read was that there
was this little 8- or 9-year-old kid who basically had as much
information as I did at 40 about how the real way the world can
operate, that it can be an intensely painful place.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant painted the boy against an evening skyscape. The
melancholy of the finished painting escaped the boy and his family,
who were delighted with the work. Grant, however, was unnerved by
the experience. In his young subject, he had been reminded of the
dichotomy of life, the intense pain on one hand, but also the
beauty and natural innocence on the other. It was no coincidence
that the blindfolds began to fall away from his subjects a short
time later. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a time every year when, as the seasons change, sunsets
become particularly resplendent. During one such period last year,
Grant photographed several evening skies from a favorite open space
along Eighth Avenue in south Fort Worth, and tried to replicate the
colors with oils on canvas.
</P>
<P>
   The large, dreamlike skyscape that resulted, ``Looking North,''
was to be part of a Grant exhibit at the Campbell gallery last
spring. But Wendy Owsley Garrett, an art collector and Grant's
friend, had an opportunity to see the painting first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost fainted when I saw it,'' Garrett says. ``It's an
immortal painting. You see this very powerful skyscape and have the
very powerful experience of viewing heaven, but you can also see
yourself bound to earth by the landscape that's visible. That was
the kicker for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrett purchased the work for an undisclosed amount, and
proposed the painting to the Dallas Museum of Art as a gift
honoring her uncle, David Owsley, a prominent New York collector
and leading patron of the Dallas museum. The offer brought Charlie
Wylie, the DMA's curator of contemporary art, to Fort Worth for a
look.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just a cloud in the sky, as beautiful as that would
have been,'' Wylie says. ``It was dreamlike, in a certain way, and
had a real incisive quality that I enjoyed looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   One day in April, Wylie interrupted Grant's work with the news
that the museum had accpeted ``Looking North'' for its permanent
collection. The artist says he spent the next several days humming
as he walked around his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to talk about,'' Grant says. ``This is all I ever
wanted to do, and I almost killed myself trying not to do it.
Having someone respond is a very powerful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ecstasy of that moment has passed. There are still times
when oatmeal cookies are his sustenance. There are dark, haunting
paintings to be done, for that is the way of life. But beauty has
now found an equally important place in Grant's life and work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to stop looking down and only look at the sky,
because then I'm doing bluebonnet paintings,'' he says. ``They only
have meaning in contrast to other paintings, the context of the
body of work. A lot of my paintings deal with what we are and what
we do to one another, and then other paintings deal with what we
can become, with God or beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the contrast between our conflict with each other and the
quiet of nature,'' he says. ``I know that sounds watery, but
there's a way to act naturally. Nature is up there, and it's out
there. It's very attainable and it's important.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lesson Grant learned first as a young child. Years later,
it took another child to remind him.

ARTIST LIVES FOR THE BEAUTY HE ONCE TRIED TO IGNORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sometime in the next few months, J.T.
Grant's skyscape will find a place on the walls of the Dallas
Museum of Art. That will be a significant moment in the life of the
Fort Worth artist who, as a young adult, nearly drank himself to
death while trying to stifle his creative impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's painting, which the museum accpeted for its permanent
collection in April, is unabashedly beautiful and affirming, a
backlit finger of cloud coiling toward the heavens against the hues
of evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really loved it and hated to sell it,'' Grant says of the
painting titled ``Looking North, Fort Worth 1999.'' ``I could get
lost in it. I could sit and stare at it. It made me happy. It made
me feel serene... I think the beauty of it is its deeper spiritual
meaning. They're extremely violent things, clouds. Yet at the same
time, this perfectly natural system operating in a perfectly
natural way.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Grant would have been largely incapable of such
art or sentiment. When his artistic career began six years ago, his
paintings were almost exclusively haunting, depicting human figures
bound or blindfolded, often-seething allegories of religious or
social intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Then his own blindfold fell away. He rediscovered the natural
world. He had spent too much time looking down, he realized,
peering into the earthly cesspool, and not enough looking up,
toward the clouds, toward transcendence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew I had to do something to clean myself out,'' Grant
says. ``It really sank in that there had to be something to look
forward to, and something to focus on outside of the pain.
Otherwise it was just pain for pain's sake.''
</P>
<P>
   So the images of bondage began disappearing. His work became,
instead, a dichotomy of existential darkness and light. Sometimes
both were incorporated in the same work. There were more still
lifes of fruit and sage, and skyscrapers at sunset, and finally the
stunning piece that found its way to the Dallas Museum of Art,
where it will be exhibited and cared for into perpetuity. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a dark-haired, soft-spoken man of 44, is the
quintessential starving artist. On a recent day, he is subsisting
on a large batch of homemade oatmeal cookies. His kitchen cabinets
hold the ingredients for the cookies _ and not much else. He has
spent the last of his money shipping paintings to an art show in
New York and will be virtually penniless until a check from one of
his handful of art students arrives in a few days. His next full
meal, he figures, will be at a reception and dinner he is invited
to attend the next evening at the Dallas Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it romantic?'' Grant, who is single, says in the living
room of his home, a fix-it-up bungalow in Fort Worth's Fairmount
neighborhood. ``I hope that someday, sitting on a comfy stoop
somewhere, I'll think back on the great days when I ate oatmeal
cookies. I'd love that, and I don't mind it now. I mean, I eat
oatmeal cookies at home and then go out and rub elbows with
somebody who's got $750 million in the bank. And they feed me well.
It's kind of a bipolar existence.''
</P>
<P>
   But against the larger arc of Grant's life and career, those
current deprivations seem trivial, material scarcities he suffers
more or less gladly.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in North Carolina and Virginia in a household of
bankers and educators, ``so financial success was a big part of
their experience,'' he says. From an early age, however, he was
drawn toward a world where success was measured less tangibly.
</P>
<P>
   Grant remembers his intense fascination at age 6 with the
etchings of an older girl at a community art workshop. When he was
12, relatives paid him a dollar for his painting of the Matterhorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just nice to be able to cause something to come into
being, even if it was just a copy,'' he says. ``I really liked the
smell and the touch and the feel.''
</P>
<P>
   But a career in art seemed impractical. Years later, Grant also
faced a crippling fear: that even if he tried to pursue painting,
he would lack anything worthwhile to say with his art. He dropped
out of several colleges, trying to find an alternative, then fell
into a well-paid job managing a document and price control
department for a retail chain on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   He was miserable. Although most of his friends at the time
didn't know it, Grant eventually consumed more than a case of beer
and two liters of wine a day while sitting alone at home in
Richmond, Va., watching television. Fifteen years ago this month,
feeling he could no longer conceal his addiction, Grant checked
himself into a treatment center. He's been sober ever since. The
decision to pursue art came a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized so much of my drinking had been about my terror
that the one thing I wanted out of life was unavailable to me, that
I wouldn't have the talent to be a good painter,'' Grant says.
``That's when I was like, `I've got to find out.' Because if I
didn't, I figured I'd start drinking again just to cover up the
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant quit his job and enrolled in the arts program at Virginia
Commonwealth University, pulling all-nighters several times a week
to paint. He then entered the master's program in the art
department at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, where
relatives had recently moved. His works engendered immediate
enthusiasm from instructors, gallery owners and collectors; his art
had an edgy realism that was technically excellent. Within months
of graduating from TCU in 1994, Grant has his work featured in a
show at William Campbell Contemporary Art, the first of several
exhibits at the popular gallery in west Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of his images seemed to have some sort of a psychological
bent to them,'' William Campbell says. ``Nothing was explicitly
laid out, but something unknown was always implied. I just thought
it was all very, very interesting. He was a professional painter
and a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant went on to supplement modest if steady sales with art
lessons, or with commissioned portraits and murals such as the rear
wall of The 8.0, the popular nightspot in downtown Fort Worth. He
otherwise has been free to pursue his artistic vision in his
upstairs studio, painting seven days a week, sometimes for 14 hours
a day. MORE &QL;

N.H. LEGISLATORS VOTE TO IMPEACH STATE'S CHIEF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ In a historic first, the New Hampshire House of
Representatives impeached the chief justice of the state Supreme
Court Wednesday, accusing him of four ethical lapses and handing
his fate over to the state Senate for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 253-95 vote on Chief Justice David Brock culminated weeks of
constitutional agony in New Hampshire, triggered by a nasty
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The divorce of one of the five Supreme Court justices led to an
inquiry by the state attorney general into the court's practices,
which led lawmakers to examine whether there were grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly Wednesday, House members decided that there were
grounds to impeach Brock, though they spare two of his Supreme
Court colleagues, Justices Sherman Horton and John Broderick. The
House had last impeached a Supreme Court justice in 1790, and it
had never before impeached a chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   By approximately 2-to-1 ratios, not particularly along party
lines, the Republican-dominated House approved four separate
articles of impeachment against Brock. The articles accused Brock,
64, of making a phone call to a Superior Court judge 13 years ago
seeking to influence a case; allowing the divorcing justice to
influence the appointment of judges in his own case; allowing
judges to comment on cases from which they had recused themselves;
and repeatedly lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investigation, if it accomplishes nothing else, has
lifted the skirt of Lady Justice and taken a peek,'' said Henry P.
Mock, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which
recommended the impeachment. ``Did we see anything there that was
really, really naughty? Not too bad, but we have seen things that
were absolutely wrong. Not only that, but her blindfold slipped.
Justice is blind but she took a peek and she wasn't supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock, who was not present Wednesday, has acknowledged that he
made errors of judgment. But, said David Barry, one of his lawyers,
Brock contended that they were not impeachable conduct, and that he
looked forward to the opportunity to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote ``will be viewed as a historic aberration,''
Barry said, and possibly a dangerous one because ``it has lowered
the impeachment bar and put at risk the independence of the
judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, advised by former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, is
expected to begin the trial next month, and even advocates of
Wednesday's impeachment are predicting that Brock is likely to
prevail there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll clean our clocks in the Senate,'' said Rep. Tony F.
Soltani, a Republican, pointing out that the Senate tends to be
more sympathetic to the judiciary than the 400-seat House.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of impeachment Wednesday complained in the House
hallways that they believed the impeachment was based not on the
facts but on festering anger against the state Supreme Court for
its 1997 ``Claremont'' decision requiring the state to revamp its
heavily local system for financing schools. The state is still
struggling to work out a new system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, because Brock was a substantial influence in getting
the Claremont decision passed, that this was in part a great
backlash against him,'' said Rep. Beth Rodd, a Democrat. ``I don't
feel that justice is being done. I feel there's a vindictive
spirit, a mob mentality has taken over.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of the impeachment said it was necessary to
restore public confidence in that court.
</P>
<P>
   The divorcing justice, W. Stephen Thayer III, could influence
the selection of judges for his divorce, while his wife could not,
Soltani commented, and that ``is repulsive to me, repulsive beyond
belief.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said Wednesday that she was
committed to doing all she could to restore confidence in the
courts, including pushing a constitutional amendment providing that
judges be appointed for set terms rather than for life.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire standards for impeachment are lower than the
federal standards that became familiar to many during President
Clinton's impeachment proceedings. It is enough, under New
Hampshire law, for a judge to commit no ``high crime or
misdemeanor'' but merely ``maladministration'' _ a word that
lawmakers seemed to have trouble defining Wednesday. Some argued
that since it was listed together with bribery and corruption, it
must involve malice and ill-intent.
</P>
<P>
   Many speakers Wednesday pointed out that Brock's main error had
been one of compassion, in that he had felt sorry for Thayer, and
tried to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to hang a man for compassion?'' demanded one
lawmaker, Richard Kennedy, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates of impeachment depicted the chief justice's
misdeeds as too serious to be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   He was accused of making a phone call in 1987 to a superior
court judge who was hearing a contract dispute, and reminding him
that one of the litigants was a powerful senator who could
influence judicial pay raises. Brock has denied making such a call.
</P>
<P>
   He was also accused of committing ``maladministration'' in
February when he informed Thayer which judges he would appoint to a
special panel needed to hear the Thayer divorce case because the
Supreme Court justices had all recused themselves. When Brock made
that announcement, witnesses said, Thayer objected to one of the
judges, and Brock tried to hold back the court clerk from calling
that judge.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Brock has had little chance to mount his own defense.
But his day will come in the Senate, Barry, his lawyer, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of New Hampshire should make no mistake,'' he
said, ``this man has been on trial for three months now, and he's
had no due process, no rights and no voice. This `jury' that
convicted him today has acted as a result of a one-sided process.''

   United States and Vietnam in Sweeping Trade Accord
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Vietnam have completed a sweeping trade
agreement that would allow unfettered commerce between the two
nations for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War more
than a quarter-century ago, people involved in the negotiations
said. A handful of large American companies have invested in
Vietnam, and some analysts think they would immediately add
thousands of jobs in Vietnam if American tariffs of
Vietnamese-produced goods are substantially lowered. The agreement
would also open Vietnam's market of 77 million people to a wide
range of American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Not All Profiting From Oil Prices
</P>
<P>
   Drivers have been paying almost twice as much for gasoline as
they did a few years ago, but many operators of service stations
and convenience stores, like Kenneth Cerny, who runs a market in
Wisconsin, are poorer for it. The wholesale price of gas has risen
faster than the price retailers can charge and still stay
competitive, so rising gas prices have brought little benefit, and
in some regions they have actually made it tougher to do business.
For producers and refiners, however, higher gasoline and oil prices
have meant sharply higher profits.
</P>
<P>
   Mylan Settles Price-Fixing Case
</P>
<P>
   Mylan Laboratories, one of the world's largest producers of
generic drugs, tentatively agreed to pay $147 million to settle
accusations that it improperly cornered the market on raw materials
for two widely prescribed drugs and then raised the price of those
drugs.

   Motorola Reports Strong Earnings
</P>

   Global Crossing to Sell Local Unit
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing agreed to sell its local phone operations to
Citizens Communications of Stamford, Conn., for $3.65 billion in
cash, which Global will use to further its construction of a
worldwide communications network. The deal transfers to Citizens
about one million phone lines in Iowa, Minnesota, New York,
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and about 3,000 employees. Shares of
Global Crossing rose $2.9375, to $32.0625, while Citizens rose 12.5

   The Economic Cost of `Ugly'
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, conflicts are brewing over aesthetics, with
more and more Americans demanding a world free of ``visual
pollution'' like tacky porch furniture. This push to expand the
definition of ``pollution'' forces us to re-examine why and how we
regulate the spillovers that economists call externalities.

   Even over the telephone, you can hear Rocky barking and the
deafening roar of jets flying up the Potomac River. Mariah Burton
Nelson brushes off the noise pollution as she might dust on her
desk.
</P>
<P>
   She is not easily annoyed; she won't rail against the dog or the
planes. This is typical of Nelson's new-found demeanor; she has
learned to be more tolerant, to forgive, whether it is the
noisemakers of the world or those guilty of far more serious
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way. At one time, Nelson says, forgiveness
was out of the question. She held grudges. She was angry, arrogant
and acerbic.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed after she found the courage to reconcile with
the man who made her that way, who sexually abused her. Still, it
took Nelson two decades to forgive.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old author and free-lance writer, who lives in
Arlington, Va., details her journey to forgiveness in ``The
Unburdened Heart: Five Keys to Forgiveness and Freedom'' (Harper
San Francisco, $22).
</P>
<P>
   The book is a poignant story of betrayal and reconciliation that
includes Nelson's conversations with the coach who molested her,
the emotional breakdown that ensued and, ultimately, her ability to
forgive him. The book is also about spiritual wisdom gleaned from
Scripture, poetry, psychological studies and interviews with others
who have forgiven offenses great and small.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, Nelson likes to think of ``The
Unburdened Heart'' as a love story, of love gained when, as she
says, ``we lay down our burdens of anger, rage, recrimination,
retribution and superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgiveness frees us to love fully,'' Nelson says. ``It
requires loving and honoring yourself enough to do what's right
even though it can be scary and difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Her journey began with the willingness to be open to the
possibility of forgiveness and then working toward that goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was risk-taking, and it involved making mistakes along the
way,'' she says. ``Compassion did play a big part, as did humility.
I remembered that I'd hurt a lot of people, too, so I'm not just a
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson says that by her 40th birthday, the question of whether
she was going to spend the rest of her life being angry about
something that happened in her teens weighed heavily.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, while researching the subject of coach-athlete abuse for a
book, Nelson began to wonder whether forgiveness might be possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who engages in any sort of criminal or rude behavior
must be coming from a place of pain or ignorance or suffering,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has made the transition to being what her friends call a
professional forgiver. ``I take a radical stand that nothing is
unforgivable,'' she says. ``The only limits on forgiveness is our
unwillingness, our inability to open our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who was 14 when she was first abused, says she never got
an answer from her former coach about why he molested her. He told
her that he was in over his head in his job and that his marriage
was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would've liked some neat answer, like he was molested when
he was a kid,'' she says. ``We're complicated human beings, so it's
not always clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Nelson says she is convinced that forgiveness frees
us to love again and live our lives to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to start a national conversation about forgiveness
... because forgiving people contribute a lot more loving, generous
energy to the world,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews, the Star-Telegram talked to North
Texas residents who have found the courage to forgive. These are
their stories and the paths they took to forgiveness: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BARBARA ALLEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She is ironing the shirt and slacks she will wear to her new job
at Catholic Charities. Her three sons saunter in and out of the
room, curious about the stranger visiting their mom.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Allen is 24 and mature beyond her years. Life has made
her that way. She was 15 when she left home and checked herself
into a Fort Smith, Ark., halfway house for teens. She says she had
become disgusted because her mom seemed to put the men in her life
ahead of her daughter. The family moved a lot.
</P>
<P>
   When her four-month stay in the halfway house was completed,
Allen called her mom to come get her. Her mom refused, Allen says.
``She said, `I'm sorry, you're on your own,' '' Allen says.
</P>
<P>
   Three years would pass before she would talk to her mother
again. ``I didn't want to talk to her until I could prove I was
somebody,'' Allen says.
</P>
<P>
   But when she was 18, Allen became pregnant. She decided to
swallow her pride and call her mother again. She needed support;
she wanted her son to know his grandmother. It was time for
reconciliation. MORE &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: time for reconciliation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Pride or no pride, I picked up the phone and called,'' Allen
says.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was distant at first, Allen says. Allen kept calling,
and the day she went into labor, her mother showed up, as she said
she would.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the breakthrough, their relationship remained strained.
Allen would give birth two more times but still would fend for
herself, sometimes living on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, feeling desperate, she prayed that her life would
change, that she would find a home for herself and her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told God I was tired, emotionally and physically tired,''
Allen says. ``I told him this is it, if I leave my friends, their
(the children's) dad, the drinking, will you give me a home for my
children?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks later, I got a letter that I'd been accepted for
conventional (Section 8) housing. Little by little, the miracles
started to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen went to Catholic Charities, earned a high school
equivalency diploma and got a job at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The best part, she says, is that she recognized through her own
experiences that her mother had also tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made plenty of mistakes,'' Allen says. ``I did the best I
could, just like she did the best she could for me. Our
relationship is so, so much better. We talk about once a week
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Allen says, her mother ended their conversation with,
``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are words I wanted to hear forever,'' Allen says. ``They
mean I accept you for who you are, and I don't compare you to
anyone else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VAL NANCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, Val Nance lived with the belief that his parents
favored his siblings. Even as an adult, he was angry with them,
believing that they had not loved him enough. He also was angry at
God for calling him to the ministry, only to seemingly abandon him.
</P>
<P>
   Nance was a church pastor but was struggling to make ends meet.
``I was teaching school, driving a bus and pastoring a small
church,'' he says. ``I was angry at God and my (congregation). What
I didn't realize was it was impairing me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, when he was 50, Nance fell into a deep depression. ``My
first question was was I going crazy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He sought help at a counseling center and discovered that the
anger was paralyzing him. But, he says, ``God began to deal with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a pastor, Nance knew that forgiveness was a major part of his
calling. ``God commands me to forgive even if I'm not ready to,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   It took time for Nance to understand that he would have to
forgive his parents, regardless of whether the slights were real or
imagined, or the anger would never diminish.
</P>
<P>
   He decided to let go. ``It opened up my life in a way that is
really indescribable,'' he says. ``And it makes it easier for me to
go and ask for forgiveness because I'm willing to forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance, who is 68 and no longer a clergyman, lives in Azle with
his wife and 15-year-old granddaughter. He likened the ability to
forgive to a bridge across the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am on one side and God is on the other,'' he says. ``If I
don't forgive, I've removed one board of that bridge; I've impaired
my ability to reach God. If we don't forgive, God won't forgive
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Through counseling and heart-to-heart talks with siblings, Nance
says, he came to a better understanding of his childhood and his
calling.
</P>
<P>
   It was only later that his brother told him that Nance had been
his parents' favorite because he became a minister. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOLANDA TATUM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Yolanda Tatum's brother settled in a chair in her
den, shot heroin into his veins and died.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum sits in her living room now, a room apart from the
tragedy, and she cries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't even live here; why did he have to come here and do
that?'' she asks. ``Why come to my mother's home, why this house
where we grew up?''
</P>
<P>
   Tatum is angry. She doesn't understand. Her brother had a
bachelor's degree and was earning a master's. He was so handsome,
she says, that she often had to explain to other women that she was
just his sister. He was loved by his entire family.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, Tatum says, her brother Dandryea was
drug-dependent. He did time in prison for a botched armed robbery;
but after being released in 1998, he did well for a time and
appeared to be drug-free.
</P>
<P>
   Even as his problems resurfaced, Tatum says, she remained loyal
to her brother. She helped him every way she could, although he
pawned her personal belongings for $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   When Dandryea moved in with his girlfriend and started working
again, Tatum thought things might be different. And they were. Only
worse.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, Dandryea pawned more of his sister's belongings and
used the proceeds to buy heroin. He returned to his childhood home,
wrote a two-page letter to Tatum and shot the drugs into his vein.
</P>
<P>
   When Tatum arrived home later that day, Dandryea was still
sitting in the chair, a syringe, the pawnshop receipt and the
letter lying on a stool next to his lifeless form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into the den and said, `Dandryea, this CD player is
stuck,' '' Tatum says. ``I walked over and hit the power button to
turn it off.''
</P>
<P>
   When he didn't respond, Tatum says, she thought her brother was
asleep. She tapped him on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``His head fell to the side and I ran to the phone and called
911,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Dandryea was dead. And Tatum was left with questions.
</P>
<P>
   What if she had come home sooner? Was there any way she could
have prevented this?
</P>
<P>
   She wishes that she had had even just 15 minutes more with him.
She knows that ultimately, peace of mind will come only through
forgiveness _ for him and for herself for not being there. But, she
says, ``telling myself to forgive and forgiving is two different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Her journey toward forgiveness has yet begun. But there are no
other options.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God forgave the world, surely I can forgive him,'' Tatum
says.

TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER, JAWS STILL HAS A HECKUVA BITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not safe to go back in the water.
</P>
<P>
   With his 1975 classic ``Jaws,'' which gets a 25th-anniversary
special edition DVD release this week, a 27-year-old upstart
director named Steven Spielberg did for the ocean what Alfred
Hitchcock's ``Psycho'' did for showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaws,'' based on Peter Benchley's bestselling novel about a
coastal town terrorized by a giant great white shark, went on to
become one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. (It would
eventually get nudged off the top 10 list by some of Spielberg's
later efforts.) The movie's unparalleled success invented the
concept of the summer blockbuster, forever transforming the season
into an FX- and action-oriented battleground for the biggest box
office take.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``Jaws'' changed Hollywood _ and the art of making
movies _ overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It also changed us, and how we thought about the water. As a
9-year-old growing up in the coastal Texas town of Corpus Christi,
I watched ``Jaws'' with equal parts fascination and horror. For
months I wouldn't set one toe on the sandy, tar-streaked shores of
Padre Island. Lakes, rivers, even neighborhood pools gave me the
willies. I couldn't even relax in a hot bath unless the surface was
Mr. Bubble-free, to allow for maximum shark-spotting.
</P>
<P>
   And I wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have people say to me, `You wrote ``Jaws?'' ' I was a
diver and I wouldn't go in the water for months,' '' recalls
co-screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, who appeared in the original film as
the editor of the ``Amity Gazette.'' ``Or, `I was scared to take a
bath; I thought Jaws would come up through the plug.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaws'' grip on the public consciousness was as relentless as
John Williams' deceptively simple and oft-imitated ``da-nun,
da-nun'' score. The poster showing the shark's open-mouthed jaws
rising to devour a hapless swimmer became one of the most
recognizable and widely lampooned images in the world, showing up
in everything from editorial cartoons to the cover of ``Mad''
magazine. The film was a regular source of comedy, from Dickie
Goodman's ``Mr. Jaws'' radio parody to ``Saturday Night Live's''
Land Shark.
</P>
<P>
   Awards followed, with the film taking home three Oscars _ for
Best Sound, Score and Film Editing. Despite its nomination for Best
Picture, Spielberg was snubbed for the director's prize.
</P>
<P>
   But Spielberg, of course, had the last laugh. Twenty-five years
later, ``Jaws,'' despite what are now considered somewhat crude
effects, continues to fascinate and frighten movie lovers,
including a new generation of fright seekers. So to honor the
landmark film, we take a fond look at the cast and the phenomenon
that is ``Jaws.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIGGER FISH ...
</P>
<P>
   Many of the cast members of ``Jaws'' followed its dorsal fin to
fame, but where are they now?
</P>
<P>
   Roy Scheider (Chief Martin Brody), along with ``Jaws 2,'' made a
number of respectable post-shark films, including ``All That Jazz''
(for which he nabbed an Oscar nomination) and ``52 Pick-Up.'' He
even returned to the sea for the short-lived NBC series ``seaQuest
DSV.'' Last seen: Starring in ``Chain of Command,'' premiering July
22 on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dreyfuss (Matt Hooper) leaped immediately from ``Jaws''
to his greatest critical acclaim in Spielberg's ``Close Encounters
of the Third Kind'' and Neil Simon's ``The Goodbye Girl'' (for
which he won an Oscar), both in 1977. Then came a down period.
Between lots of forgettable films, he appeared in a number of
crowd-pleasing comedies ``(Down and Out in Beverly Hills, What
About Bob?'' and ``Lost in Yonkers)'' and heart-tugging dramas
``(Stand by Me, Nuts'' and ``Mr. Holland's Opus).'' Last seen: As
the president in this year's TV remake of ``Fail Safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shaw (Quint) Few knew that Shaw was an accomplished
author who scripted most of his now-legendary USS Indianapolis
speech in ``Jaws.'' He appeared as the Sheriff of Nottingham in
1976's ``Robin and Marian,'' as well as ``Black Sunday'' and Peter
Benchley's ``The Deep,'' both in 1977. Last seen: His final films,
``Avalanche Express'' (1979) and ``Force 10 from Navarone'' (1978)
were released posthumously after his death of a heart attack in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Hamilton (Mayor Larry Vaughn) Bounced back with
appearances in TV's ``Rich Man, Poor Man'' (1976) and ``Jaws 2''
(1978). He worked with Spielberg again in ``1941'' and also
appeared in ``The Amityville Horror,'' both in 1979. Last seen: His
final film was 1986's ``The Last Days of Patton.'' He died of
cancer that year.
</P>
<P>
   Lorraine Gary (Ellen Brody) Followed with appearances in ``Car
Wash'' (1976) and ``Jaws 2'' (1978). Also appeared in Spielberg's
``1941.'' Last seen: Hasn't been, not since 1987's awful ``Jaws the
Revenge.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
... BIGGER PONDS
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the folks in front of the cameras weren't the only
ones to ride ``Jaws'' to fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg is still getting work. He followed up ``Jaws''
with ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' in 1977 and then
directed what would become the highest-grossing movie of all time
for a several-years period, ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.'' His
early attempts to grow up proved disappointing until the success of
the dino epic ``Jurassic Park'' reaffirmed his clout, which allowed
him to direct Oscar darlings ``Schindler's List'' (which earned him
Best Director and Picture Oscars) and ``Saving Private Ryan'' (Best
Director).
</P>
<P>
   Peter Benchley (novelist/co-screenwriter) never matched the
success of his 1974 20-million-copy bestseller, but it wasn't for
lack of trying. Filmed versions of his novels ``The Deep'' and
``The Island'' failed to reel in audiences, and most of his
subsequent novels _ usually dealing with aquatic adversaries of
some kind or another _ came off as pale imitations of his most
memorable work.
</P>
<P>
   John Williams (composer) forged an incredibly successful
relationship with Spielberg, earning Academy Awards for his scores
to ``Jaws,'' ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial'' and ``Schindler's
List.'' His music for the ``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana Jones''
trilogies have become the stuff of legend.

BUSTA'S HARDLY REVOLUTIONARY IN `ANARCHY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Busta Rhymes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Anarchy'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elektra Records &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen rapper Busta Rhymes perform live knows that
he's a walking ``Animal House'' onstage, a guy who'll drop his
pants, talk trash about women and play all the usual shallow,
crowd-hyping games.
</P>
<P>
   When he's in the studio, though, Rhymes is often amazing. On his
past few efforts, the rapper-turned-actor (he has a role in
``Shaft'') has taken intelligent looks at the decay of
civilization, corruption in government, war and the sad state of
urban America. Rhymes is one of the few hip-hop stars to
sagaciously, sometimes savagely, address those subjects without an
it's-all-someone-else's-fault attitude.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of intelligence is hinted at on Busta's fourth disc,
the misleadingly titled ``Anarchy,'' but it's Rhymes' party-animal
attitude that rules. And it gets old. Like, real fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anarchy'' isn't rebellious at all. Rather, it's full of the
usual gangsta-rap boasts: Women get called derogatory names, racial
slurs are used over and over and, who's No. 1? Busta is, baby!
</P>
<P>
   Insert very long yawn here.
</P>
<P>
   What's even worse is the music. Usually, Busta has a dark,
terrorizing tone to his music that perfectly fits his razor-sharp
lyrics. Since many of the songs here _ ``Here We Go Again, Salute
Da Gods!!'' _ are party anthems, the music is upbeat but
excruciatingly elementary. Parts of ``Anarchy'' sound like Busta
rapping over the tinklings of a music box.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there aren't a few good songs. ``The Heist,''
in which Rhymes is joined by Ghostface Killah, Raekwon and several
other prominent rappers, is a frightening scenario of a stickup
gone wrong, and the first single, ``Get Out,'' makes clever use of
a children's sing-along chorus, a la Jay-Z's ``Hard Knock Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Other strong moments are scattered throughout, but the disc is
75 minutes long, and you get kinda tired of looking for them.

EPISCOPAL BISHOPS REJECT PLAN FOR RITES OUTSIDE MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The bishops of the Episcopal Church, acting on the most
contentious issue facing their denomination's general convention,
voted late Wednesday to reject a proposal that church officials
develop rites to bless relationships between couples living
together outside marriage, rituals that would likely be
particularly applied to gay relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, with 85 bishops against the proposal and 63 supporting
it, came after more than three hours of debate, during which
several of the prelates gathered here warned that were the proposal
to pass, it could threaten the unity of the 2.4 million-member
denomination, so severe are divisions among Episcopalians over what
recognition to extend to gay and lesbian parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Ed Little of the Diocese of Northern Indiana said he did
not support the proposal ``because it will deepen our divisions.''
But another prelate, Catherine Roskam, a suffragan or auxiliary
bishop of New York, called for supporting the development of the
rites, saying, ``We have been pioneers in the ordination of women
and we can be pioneers in this.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' vote marked the second time in two days that church
leaders have rejected the proposal that an Episcopalian commission
develop rites to be considered and voted upon at the next
convention, which will be held in 2003.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The convention, held every three years, is the church's top
policy-making body, divided into two separate chambers, one
composed of bishops, the other of clergy and lay people who are
called ``deputies.'' On Tuesday, at the meeting at the Denver
Convention Center, the house of deputies voted against the
proposal, but by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for the rites originally appeared as the eighth
paragraph in an unusual resolution on sexuality that has been under
consideration at the convention. After the deputies deleted that
controversial paragraph, they overwhelmingly approved the
resolution and sent it on to the bishops to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution states that the church officially acknowledges
that among the people in its pews are unmarried couples living in
long-term relationships. It adds that although such relationships
depart from traditional Christian teaching on sexuality, the church
should give the couples involved its pastoral care and ``prayerful
support.'' The statement makes no distinction between heterosexual
and homosexual relationships _ and so implicitly includes both.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops have yet to vote on the resolution itself, although
in their debate many expressed support for it, without the
controversial eighth paragraph. The resolution is a carefully
nuanced document, deploring promiscuity, declaring that
Episcopalian leaders ``expect'' that nonmarital relationships will
be monogamous and also noting that the church teaches that marriage
is sanctified.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' vote Wednesday centered on whether to amend the
resolution to re-attach the eighth paragraph that the house of
deputies had rejected. Had that passed, the question would have
been placed again before the house of deputies, which could either
re-affirm its earlier vote or change it.
</P>
<P>
   When they re-convene on Thursday, the bishops will consider
another amendment to the resolution on whether a church commission
should try in the next three years to find out whether it is
possible to develop a theological basis for the blessing of
relationships outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The broader question of how far a church should go in
recognizing gay relationships is highly controversial among
Episcopalians and many other Protestant denominations. Two weeks
ago, the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
passed an amendment to its constitution that would prohibit
ministers from officiating at same-sex unions. The amendment must
ratified by a two-thirds majority of the church's regional
jurisdictions within the next year if it is to become law.

 &HT;    FBI agent: Smoke was visible from Mount Carmel following tear
gassing
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ An FBI agent testified Wednesday that smoke could
be seen moments after he fired a tear gas cannister into the back
of Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony in the Branch Davidians' $675 million wrongful-death
lawsuit against the government could wrap up today.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Dave Corderman said he fired a ferret round into the
dining room about noon on April 19, 1993. He insisted it did not
help set the fire that destroyed Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fired three rounds in succession, all within a minute,''
Corderman testified. ``Upon the last round going in, I still had
visual. I saw smoke coming from the black (or back) side of the
cafeteria.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, he turned to the others in his tank, Corderman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately said to the others in the Bradley, 'They're
setting a fire. They're killing themselves,''' Corderman said.
</P>
<P>
   He was sure the tear gas round didn't cause a fire because 15
seconds later he also saw a fire at the south end of Mount Carmel,
Corderman testified.
</P>
<P>
   James Quintiere, an engineering professor at the University of
Maryland who studies fires, testified that he was also sure the FBI
wasn't responsible for the fire in the dining room _ one of
possibly four fires at Mount Carmel that linked.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiere said the ``growth rate'' of the fires led him to
conclude they could not have started from a tear gas round. They
are more indicative of fires started by accelerants, he testified.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that three fires started within two minutes of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are distinct and separate fires and as far as them being
anything accidental, that would be highly, highly improbable,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell, lead attorney for the plaintiffs,
derided Quintiere's conclusion that the start of the fires was
coordinated.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do the Davidians communicate from an upstairs bedroom to
that dining room when Mr. (R.J.) Craig has driven his tank right
through the middle of the only hallway that communicates through
those two parts of the building?'' Caddell asked later, during a
brief press conference.
</P>
<P>
   During his questioning of Corderman, Caddell asked what color
smoke he saw coming from the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Caddell had shown Corderman a photograph depicting the
white smoke produced by the military tear gas rounds that Corderman
fired at an underground tunnel outside Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was white smoke from a fire,'' Corderman responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a fire expert?'' Caddell asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not,'' Corderman said.
</P>
<P>
   Corderman testified there were approximately 20 military tear
gas rounds, which are pyrotechnic, in the tank in which he was
riding. He said he fired three of them at the underground tunnels
beyond the north end of Mount Carmel at about 8 a.m. on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very concerned as we had discussed beforehand to make
sure the military gas rounds did not go near the above-ground
structure,'' Corderman said.
</P>
<P>
   He sought permission to fire the military gas rounds because
ferret tear gas rounds had already bounced off the plywood over the
underground tunnels, Corderman testified.
</P>
<P>
   The military tear gas rounds, which are metallic rather than
plastic like a ferret round, also failed to penetrate the covering
over the underground tunnel, Corderman testified, even after the
Bradley Fighting Vehicle was repositioned in order to gain a better
firing angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two rounds also bounced off the structure and dissipated
in an area next to the underground structure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another FBI agent, R.J. Craig, backtracked Wednesday and
testified that he may have demolished at least two interior walls
near the front of Mount Carmel. He drove a tank through the
building trying to insert tear gas at the base of the tower where
the FBI believed many of the Davidians, including David Koresh,
were hiding.
</P>
<P>
   Craig first testified that he didn't hit any interior walls in
his mission, which he said failed. He was not trying to demolish
the building by plowing through it, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   His tank wasn't equipped to disassemble Mount Carmel, Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's disassembly plan _ which was to be implemented after
48 hours if the Davidians didn't leave the building _ called for a
railroad tie, sticking out 12 inches on either side, to be attached
to a combat engineering vehicle, Craig said. The tank was to run
along the front of Mount Carmel, peeling away the sheathing and dry
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like a kid running down a picket fence with a stick,''
Craig said, until the procedure ``exposed the insides.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, however, showed Craig a government sketch of the
dimensions of Mount Carmel. It showed two interior walls within 13
feet of the front of the building. Craig's tank was 26 feet long,
according to testimony. At least three-quarters of it was inside
the Davidian building at one point, Craig testified.
</P>
<P>
   Craig conceded he would have had to go through two interior
walls, ``If that's accurate, yes.''

<P>
   DENVER _ The bishops of the Episcopal Church, acting on the most
contentious issue facing their denomination's general convention,
voted late Wednesday to reject a proposal that church officials
develop rites to bless relationships between couples living
together outside marriage, rituals that would likely be
particularly applied to gay relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, with 85 bishops against the proposal and 63 supporting
it, came after more than three hours of debate, during which
several of the prelates gathered here warned that were the proposal
to pass, it could threaten the unity of the 2.4 million-member
denomination, so severe are divisions among Episcopalians over what
recognition to extend to gay and lesbian parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Ed Little of the Diocese of Northern Indiana said he did
not support the proposal ``because it will deepen our divisions.''
But another prelate, Catherine Roskam, a suffragan or auxiliary
bishop of New York, called for supporting the development of the
rites, saying, ``We have been pioneers in the ordination of women
and we can be pioneers in this.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' vote marked the second time in two days that church
leaders have rejected the proposal that an Episcopalian commission
develop rites to be considered and voted upon at the next
convention, which will be held in 2003.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The convention, held every three years, is the church's top
policy-making body, divided into two separate chambers, one
composed of bishops, the other of clergy and lay people who are
called ``deputies.'' On Tuesday, at the meeting at the Denver
Convention Center, the house of deputies voted against the
proposal, but by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for the rites originally appeared as the eighth
paragraph in an unusual resolution on sexuality that has been under
consideration at the convention. After the deputies deleted that
controversial paragraph, they overwhelmingly approved the
resolution and sent it on to the bishops to consider.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution states that the church officially acknowledges
that among the people in its pews are unmarried couples living in
long-term relationships. It adds that although such relationships
depart from traditional Christian teaching on sexuality, the church
should give the couples involved its pastoral care and ``prayerful
support.'' The statement makes no distinction between heterosexual
and homosexual relationships _ and so implicitly includes both.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops have yet to vote on the resolution itself, although
in their debate many expressed support for it, without the
controversial eighth paragraph. The resolution is a carefully
nuanced document, deploring promiscuity, declaring that
Episcopalian leaders ``expect'' that nonmarital relationships will
be monogamous and also noting that the church teaches that marriage
is sanctified.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' vote Wednesday centered on whether to amend the
resolution to re-attach the eighth paragraph that the house of
deputies had rejected. Had that passed, the question would have
been placed again before the house of deputies, which could either
re-affirm its earlier vote or change it.
</P>
<P>
   When they re-convene on Thursday, the bishops will consider
another amendment to the resolution on whether a church commission
should try in the next three years to find out whether it is
possible to develop a theological basis for the blessing of
relationships outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The broader question of how far a church should go in
recognizing gay relationships is highly controversial among
Episcopalians and many other Protestant denominations. Two weeks
ago, the top policy-making body of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
passed an amendment to its constitution that would prohibit
ministers from officiating at same-sex unions. The amendment must
ratified by a two-thirds majority of the church's regional
jurisdictions within the next year if it is to become law.

OFFICIAL SAYS DNA TEST IMPLICATES INMATE GIVEN STAY BY BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITORS: this story, eliminated earlier, is now restored and
appears on Page 1)  
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A DNA test has failed to exonerate a Texas death row
inmate, Ricky Nolen McGinn, whose case took on political
significance last month when Gov. George W. Bush interrupted his
presidential campaign to grant the man a stay of execution,
according officials know familiar with the results.
</P>
<P>
   The case of McGinn, 43, who was convicted of raping and
murdering his 12-year-old stepdaughter, attracted national
attention when his lawyers urged that new DNA tests be conducted to
address doubts about his conviction. Bush, who has presided over
137 executions since taking office in 1995, granted McGinn a
reprieve _ the first time the governor had done so _ to allow the
DNA tests to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one of a series of DNA tests being conducted in response to
Bush's reprieve has confirmed a match with McGinn, a law
enforcement official and a high-ranking Texas Republican said. In
June, following the reprieve, Judge Stephen Ellis in Brown County,
ordered tests on pubic hairs and semen collected from the victim's
body. Under the judge's order, the FBI is testing the hair, while
the Texas Department of Public Safety is testing the semen. DNA
experts hired by McGinn's lawyers also are conducting tests. The
law enforcement official did not say which test had confirmed the
match.
</P>
<P>
   The complete battery of tests are expected to be completed by
Aug. 15 when a hearing is scheduled and when Ellis could rule and
set a new execution date. USAToday reported Wednesday that the test
conducted by the FBI showed that the hair belonged to either McGinn
or a maternal relative, which officials see as an unlikely
alternative because none of his relatives were implicated in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The test findings could provide some political ammunition for
Bush, who has come under heavy scrutiny and criticism for the
capital punishment system in Texas. Michael Jones, a spokesman for
Bush, said the governor's office had not yet been notified of any
DNA results and noted that the additional testing could take
several more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've said all along is that at least in Texas the
justice system has ample safeguards to make sure that only guilty
people are executed,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn had been scheduled to die by lethal injection on June 1,
and the state Board of Pardons and Paroles had voted against
recommending a reprieve for DNA testing. But Bush, who under state
law can override the board in such a case and grant a 30-day stay,
decided to do that. In doing so, he said McGinn could ``have his
full day in court.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue of DNA testing arose at McGinn's initial trial five
years ago. But DNA tests conducted at the time were inconclusive.
But because of advances in testing technology, McGinn's lawyers had
argued that new tests would now yield conclusive results. McGinn's
lawyers professed his innocence and argued in particular that DNA
testing could at the very least exonerate him of the rape. It was
the conviction that crime that when added to the murder conviction,
created the aggravated circumstances that qualified McGinn for the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor in the case, Lee Haney, did not return telephone
calls seeking comment. Lawyers for McGinn, citing a gag order in
the case, declined to discuss the DNA test. But speaking in broad
terms, one lawyer, Maurie Levin, said a test result from any single
case should not serve as an endorsement of the state's death
penalty system.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Governor Bush's reprieve acknowledged problems in the
system,'' said Levin, who as the head of Texas Defender Service
regularly handles death row appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In June, state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, announced that he
would introduce a bill the legislative session next year that would
allow convicted felons under certain circumstances to request DNA
testing if such testing could definitively prove their guilt or
innocence. Currently, only New York and Illinois have such a law.

BUSH ADVISER COUNSELED ISRAELIS BEFORE SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the days leading up to the Camp David peace
talks, a foreign policy adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
counseled Israeli officials to accept only a comprehensive peace
agreement and to resist any efforts by the Clinton administration
to use the summit meeting in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by the adviser, Richard Perle, caused Bush to
distance himself on Wednesday from those views. Bush said Perle had
been ``speaking for himself'' and not the Bush campaign when he
talked with Yossi Alper, an aide to Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and
another Israeli official, Yoram Ben-Zeev.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the administration all the best when it comes to
bringing peace to the Middle East,'' Bush said, appearing outside
the governor's mansion after an hourlong meeting with former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Bush said that he opposed any
efforts to politicize the peace talks and that ``my campaign will
not do so.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that, ``This is an important time, and it's important
for Republicans to wish the administration well. There would be
nothing better than a lasting peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that President Clinton ``deserves credit'' for his
efforts to try to achieve a lasting peace settlement between the
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Perle is one of a small circle of former State and Defense
department officials from previous Republican administrations who
advise the governor on foreign policy, though they are not paid
staff members of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized on a report about Perle's action in Wednesday's
The New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are Governor Bush and his advisers interested in peace or
politics for Israel?'' asked Rep. Sam Gejdensen, D-Conn., the
ranking Democrat on the House International Relations Committee.
``We should all be hoping that Camp David is successful, not
figuring out how to score political points.''
</P>
<P>
   Perle said on Wednesday that he had long been involved in Middle
East policy. He said he had told the two officials in the days
leading up to the meeting between Barak and Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, that Israel should try to achieve a
comprehensive peace agreement resolving all outstanding issues,
including the final status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on all sides of the talks have said that a good
partial agreement might be the only realistic end to themeeting at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the West Bank issues were separated from the Jerusalem
issue, I though it would greatly diminish the chances of a
resolution of the Jerusalem question,'' Perle said. He said
Jerusalem would then become the ``focal point'' of the conflict
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   He said that a Bush aide had called him about the article in The
Post and that he recounted what he had said and had not said. He
denied the contention in the article that he had told the Israelis
not to let Vice President Al Gore participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Perle said he did, however, tell the Israelis that they ought to
avoid being drawn into presidential politics. ``I said `the
administration may be tempted to inject a partisan note in this and
I hope you resist any such effort.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perle said he was not injecting politics into the meeting but
was trying to do ``exactly the opposite.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times and Holtzbrinck Publishers, the
U.S. arm of the German media company von Holtzbrinck Group, agreed
Wednesday to restart the Times Books imprint and expand the Times'
book development.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Holt &AMP; Co., a U.S. unit of Holtzbrinck, will publish in
cooperation with The Times a list of books under the Times Books
imprint, beginning next year with about 14 titles. The Times Books
imprint will eventually publish 20 nonfiction books a year about
current events, history, science, technology, business, health and
other subjects. Some of the first books will be based on coverage
in The New York Times, including ``How Race Is Lived in America,''
``Writers on Writing,'' ``The New York Times Management Reader''
and ``The New York Times Guide to Alternative Medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, another unit of Holtzbrinck in the United
States, will publish other books bearing the New York Times brand,
like Times' crossword puzzle books. St. Martin's will also
distribute other books published by The New York Times. The Times
has previously published hotel, restaurant and museum guides as
well as yearbooks about the Yankees and a photographic history of
Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co., a diversified media company that also owns The
Boston Globe, began publishing books in 1969, when the company
acquired Quadrangle Books, based in Chicago. In 1977, the company
changed its imprint to Times Books. From 1984 through 1999, the
Times licensed the imprint to Random House. The imprint ceased
publication when the license agreement expired in December 1999.

MOTOROLA REPORTS STRONG RESULTS IN LINE WITH FORECASTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc., the telecommunications and
semiconductor giant, reported strong sales and profit growth for
the second quarter Wednesday that were in line with Wall Street
estimates, despite lingering weakness in the sale of its cellular
telephones in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which released its earnings after the close of
regular trading, reported revenue of $9.26 billion in the second
quarter, up 22 percent from $7.6 billion in the period a year
earlier. Profit from continuing operations nearly doubled, to $515
million, or 23 cents a share, from $269 million, or 13 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola took an after-tax charge of $316 million, or 14 cents a
share, related to research and development and acquisitions
completed during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts, who had been worried about shrinking
margins in the cellular telephone business, said they were pleased
with the report. Though sales and profit margins were lower in
Europe, analysts said Motorola seemed to have stemmed the decline
and prepared for a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Net net, people should come out of this positive, with a sigh
of relief,'' said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at PaineWebber Group.
``There were concerns they were going to miss the number, and they
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Motorola closed at $35.50, up $1.875. In after-hours
trading, the stock slipped to $33.0625 after the earnings were
reported, then bounced back to $36.25. Still, the shares are down
sharply, having started the year at nearly $50, after a huge run-up
over the last two years. Those share gains had been predicated on
the notion that Motorola was remaking itself for the ``wired
world'' and benefiting from enormous demand for microchips, digital
telephones and a host of other communications devices, like cable
modems.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola executives said Wednesday that the second-quarter
report represented the eighth consecutive quarterly profit gain and
was just the latest indication that the company was aggressively
moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola executives said sales and profits in many units were up
more than 20 percent. Sales of set-top boxes and cable modems were
strong; two-way radios and networking sales jumped; and
semiconductor profits were up, with improved margins.

   ``This is a pretty good story,'' said Albert R. Brashear, a
spokesman at Motorola, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill. ``All of
our businesses are hitting it pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did acknowledge, however, that digital handset
revenue had slipped in Europe as the company has pulled out of some
lower-tiered products. Motorola is expected to offer further
explanation in a conference call on Wednesday, but executives said
Wednesday that profit margins in the cellular business were
expected to rise to 10 percent by the fourth quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the shift in strategy had been outlined by
Motorola months ago, and the report Wednesday seemed to indicate
that the company was moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers look pretty good,'' said Greg Teets, an analyst
at A.G. Edwards Inc.

PATAKI ADMINISTRATION CRITICIZES MRS. CLINTON'S MEDICAID PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pataki administration Wednesday criticized a proposal by
Hillary Rodham Clinton to increase the amount of money New York
state receives from Washington for Medicaid expenditures, charging
that she was far too late in addressing an issue state leaders have
complained about for years.
</P>
<P>
   Her proposal, about which she has offered few details, would
require the federal government to foot a larger portion of the
state's total annual Medicaid bill. Under her formula, New Yorkers'
taxes could be cut by an estimated average of $400 a year through
$3 billion in new funds.
</P>
<P>
   What annoys officials in the Pataki administration is not the
proposal itself, which they fully embrace, but its timing. New
York's elected officials have gone after federal increases for
years. And a proposal to increase the state's percentage of money
from the federal government was part of a bill vetoed by President
Clinton in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Rodham Clinton is using this issue for her own
political benefit, just like her husband,'' said John Signor, a
spokesman for the state Health Department. ``This administration
has been fighting for this change for years and the Clintons have
not said boo about it since that veto. This is a credibility
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism was echoed by the campaign staff of Rick A. Lazio,
Mrs. Clinton's opponent in the New York race for the United States
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a recycled broken promise,'' said Michael
Marr, Lazio's spokesman. ``Mrs. Clinton has been in a position of
influence for 7{ years and never spoke out on this issue. Now she
is having a deathbed conversion for the need to convert this
formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the current formula, the state and New York City generally
split 50 percent of all Medicaid costs, with the federal government
picking up the other half. This calculation has long bothered
Democratic and Republican politicians in New York, who believe that
the state shoulders too much of the burden and that its costs are
greater than those of other states.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose seat Mrs. Clinton desires,
has made many proposals over the years to change the formula in New
York's favor. Mrs. Clinton, whose plan involves the federal
government's picking up a 56 percent share of the state's total
costs, said this week that an expected increase in the federal
budget surplus would make her plan more viable than those of
previous years.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki officials say their attack on Mrs. Clinton's plan has
nothing to do with the governor's support for Lazio, and that their
ire is molded by policy rather than politics. ``This has been an
issue for us for the last five years,'' said Robert Hinckley, the
state's deputy commissioner for operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a large urban poor population and our taxpayers are
footing the bill for other states,'' he said. In an example, he
cited Arkansas as a state that receives 72 cents on the dollar from
Washington for its Medicaid expenditures. ``This is an issue for us
every single year,'' Hinckley said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Mrs. Clinton suggested that the current spending formula be
left as is, the Pataki administration would have been equally
unhappy, he conceded. ``We would have been opposed to that, too,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's staff disputed the assertion that the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995, which President Clinton vetoed, would have
allocated more federal Medicaid money for New York. Further, her
staff questioned why the state was bringing up the issue at all.
``It sounds like a political attack and they don't have their facts
straight,'' said Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   And he questioned the Health Department's motives in
conspicuously releasing a critique of the first lady's plan. ``I
can't imagine that this has anything to do with Governor Pataki's
support for Rick Lazio, because that would be a misuse of
government resources on behalf of a political campaign,'' Wolfson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a fashion, both camps' accounts are factual. Under a
complicated formula in the 1995 bill, New York would have received
more money for Medicaid. But the bill also set a cap on how much
money each state would get each year. That amount would have risen
at roughly the rate of inflation, even though Medicaid spending was
then outpacing inflation. So in effect, New York would have ended
up footing a larger percentage of each year's Medicaid bill.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the overall Medicaid budget, as well as that for
Medicare, was reduced under the bill, cuts the president criticized
when he vetoed it. New York's hospitals and health care workers
strongly opposed the bill as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much wanted it to be vetoed,'' said David Rich, a
senior vice president at the Greater New York Hospital Association.
``There was a lot in it not to like.''

`DIRT GUY' IS NO CLOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ For three years, Al Wasner has been trying to
get the dirt on the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area.
</P>
<P>
   Wasner, known simply as the ``Dirt Guy,'' uses his pick, shovel
and pickup truck to scour the area. Almost daily, the 44-year-old
U.S. Department of Agriculture soil scientist takes a ribbing as if
he were an eccentric digging for oil or gold.
</P>
<P>
   He has not found either, but his work as part of the National
Resources Conservation Service soil study has produced some big
finds. Wasner, the project leader of a five-member group, expects
to find more before his five-year study of the 150,000-acre region
is completed in May.
</P>
<P>
   The findings by Wasner, Louis Alberti, Daniel Johnson, Curtis
Talbot and Ken Oster will be detailed in a manuscript to be
published in December of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   For Wasner, the discoveries have been hardly earth-shattering,
considering there are more than 100,000 soils identified in the
U.S. Still, his study is the first soil mapping of the area in more
than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science has changed tremendously,'' Wasner said. ``When they
did those studies, there were ecological concepts we did not know
30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tools remain relatively unchanged. There is no
laboratory analysis. Wasner, who carries a backpack full of
reference, examines the soil by texture and composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are kind of like a private eye trying to figure it all
out,'' Wasner said. ``You look at it as a package. Why do you have
strange bushes on one side of the mountain and why does it not grow
on the other. It is like putting two and two together and slowly
evolving a picture. One of the fun parts of the job is getting to
name a soil which does not exist elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As of yet, there is not a ``Wasner'' soil. Instead, he has named
his soils after the Chumash and Tongva native Americans, who were
inhabitants of the area more than 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al delves into the subject deeply and is not satisfied until
there is some type of agreement technically,'' said Johnson, a USDA
Supervisory soil scientist of the South Coast and Desert Areas who
oversees Wasner. ``There is a lot of enthusiasm in his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasner's work, a maintenance update commissioned by the National
Park Service, will be used to identify soil areas where roads can
or cannot be built or to spot erosion and slippage trouble for
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Wasner, who has made more than 800 excavations, is careful to
restore an area to its original condition and to stay off private
property. On occasion, residents have solicited Wasner's expertise
to bore holes for fence posts with his auger, a drill-like digging
tool.
</P>
<P>
   Although he informs residents of his work in the area, Wasner
has often been confronted by those suspecting he is digging a
grave. But police officers, who have responded to numerous calls
and know Wasner by name, are quick to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He does not hesitate to lend a hand when needed. He discovered
an injured mountain biker, who needed to be airlifted to the
hospital, while working in Point Mugu. He also found a hiker who
required medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of soil scientists are reticent and solitary people who
spend a lot of time in the field alone,'' Johnson said. ``Al enjoys
the interaction with people and when someone who may not be
involved in soils has a question, he is very quick to be
informative.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wasner has completed the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area, the Oxnard resident will perform a similar study
at the Channel Islands National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Wasner began his 22-year USDA career with a 10-year project
mapping the soils of 2-million acres in Northern Nevada. He also
undertook a nine-year study of 250,000 acres in Tulare County
before coming to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite a sense of accomplishment to finish a project,''
Wasner said. ``The bad part is leaving everybody, getting a new
mortgage and starting over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monicas, although small in area compared to Wasner's
previous projects, has offered challenges with its rough terrain,
rattlesnakes, dense vegetation, scorpions and ticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Santa Monica Mountains is relatively small,'' Wasner said.
``It is a pimple, but it is an interesting part of the world with
all the canyons and creeks. Some of the nicest places are hidden
off the road where most of the park people have never seen.''
</P>
<P>
   What has left the greatest impact on Wasner has been the
relationships with park visitors and staff in the Santa Monica
Mountains National Recreation Area. Wasner, who also worked in the
Midwest, didn't expect this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have worked in Kansas, the land of the Wizard of Oz, but I
have never met any nicer people,'' Wasner said. ``It is totally the
opposite of what I had been told. It has made it enjoyable meeting
some of the really nicest people from Calabasas to Malibu.''

   NADER WORRIES GORE CAMP
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's new campaign chairman, William M.
Daley, says that Ralph Nader, the Green Party presidential nominee,
poses a threat to Gore's campaign, and allies inside and outside
the campaign have made informal overtures to some key Nader
supporters. ``There's been some discussions,'' Daley told the
Associated Press on Tuesday, ``kind of just, `What is this? Why are
you over there?' Nothing official where we've approached the
candidate.'' Nader says at least three of his ``celebrity
supporters'' have been contacted, one by the vice president
himself, but he refuses to name them. Nader is drawing less than 10
percent in most presidential polls and is given no real chance of
winning. But he could hurt Gore because much of the support he has
appears to come at Gore's expense, especially in swing states.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE COMMITTEES ARE FLUSH
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic Senate campaign committees
released their June 30 fund-raising figures yesterday, with both
showing big bank balances. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee said it had $27 million in the bank on June 30 after
having raised $49 million since January 1999. The National
Republican Senatorial Committee reported $21 million cash on hand
at the end of June, having raised $55.7 million in this election
cycle. Both said they had more cash on hand at this point in the
election calendar than they had ever had in previous elections.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL GROUPS UNCLOAKED
</P>
<P>
   Political groups that until now have enjoyed the anonymity and
secrecy of Section 527 of the tax code will have to file disclosure
forms with the IRS by July 31. Moving quickly to implement a law
passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton on July 1, the
IRS sent word Wednesday to groups operating under Section 527 that
they must disclose their existence and intent to operate under the
tax provision, which governs political committees. The new law
requires such groups to disclose their contributors, spending and
the identities of senior officers, effective July 1.

   ADS STAR BUSH ON ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood plans $2.5 million in television advertising
spotlighting Gov. George W. Bush's anti-abortion views, hoping to
reach independent and Republican women who support abortion rights.
The group says its research suggests that many women respect
Planned Parenthood but are leaning toward Bush. ``We're focusing on
those `compassionate conservative' Republican and independent women
who are very pro-choice,'' said Gloria Feldt, president of the
Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the group's political arm. ``They
believe us when we tell them about George W. Bush's position. These
are the women who elected Bill Clinton twice.'' The first
advertisement will run nationally on cable TV beginning on Monday
and through the Republican National Convention, July 31-Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   GOP DUO PLAN BUS TOUR
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the former Republican presidential hopeful,
will be revving up his Straight Talk Express this fall _ for House
Republican congressional candidates in at least half a dozen swing
states. McCain, a Republican of Arizona, and Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma, the fourth-ranking House Republican, are planning to team
up after their party's convention in Philadelphia later this month
to campaign by bus on behalf of candidates several states,
including Ohio, California, Florida, New York, Illinois and
Michigan. The campaign seeks to exploit the appeal of McCain and
Watts, the only Republican African-African in Congress, with
independents and other swing voters. The two would conduct their
bus tour in August and October, when Congress is out of session.
McCain and Watts will also start a Web site featuring online chats
with the two Republican leaders from their bus.

JUDGE ORDERS IRAN TO PAY IN TWO DEATHS  

</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a ruling that may be largely symbolic, a federal judge has
ordered the government of Iran to pay $327 million to the families
of a New Jersey woman and a Connecticut man who were killed in a
1996 terrorist bombing in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the families of the victims, Sara Duker, who was 23, and
Matthew Eisenfeld, 25, ever see any of the money depends on several
factors, including whether legislation allowing the families to
seize Iranian assets in the United States is approved, and whether
the Clinton administration, which has blocked the families'
efforts, reverses its position that those efforts are counter to
national interests.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Eisenfeld's father, Dr. Leonard Eisenfeld, and
lawyers involved in his and similar cases, said they were concerned
about the government's admission, in a June 23 letter, that the
Treasury Department had destroyed documents being sought by lawyers
in an effort to locate Iranian assets in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, which the government said were inadvertently
destroyed during a renovation and downsizing of the Treasury's
Office of Foreign Asset Control in Washington, involved more than
800 licensing applications to do business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The documents had been subpoenaed in relation to the case of
Alisa Flatow, a student from New Jersey who died in a 1995 bombing
in Israel, but could have been relevant to the Duker and Eisenfeld
case, as well as other claims against Iran, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Other victims of terrorism and their families have been awarded
judgments against Iran, including $247.5 million in 1998 to
Flatow's family and $341 million to Terry Anderson, a journalist
held hostage by an Iranan-backed group in Lebanon. Those victims
still have not received any money.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenfeld, a neonatal specialist in West Hartford, Conn., said
he was ``encouraged'' by Tuesday's ruling, issued by Judge Royce C.
Lamberth in U.S. District Court in Washington, but not joyful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always have mixed feelings because for this particular issue
I don't like to be in the public eye. On the other hand, the issue
is worth it to deter terrorism and it's something that my family
and Sara Duker's family are interested in,'' Eisenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not understand the government's opposition to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it seems like almost a no-brainer that if countries are
doing terrorist activities in order to advance their political
agenda,'' he said, ``that we cut off their economic resources to
block their future terrorist activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Duker's mother, Arlene Duker, could not be reached for
comment, but her lawyer, Thomas Fortune Fay, said he was happy
about the decision, despite the uncertainties surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
   Duker, who lived in Teaneck, N.J., and Eisenfeld were among 25
people who died in a suicide bombing of a bus on Feb. 25, 1996 in
Jerusalem. An Iranian-backed terrorist group, Hamas, has claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Miller, the Justice Department spokesman for the case,
was not available for comment on Wednesday, his office said, and
the State and Treasury departments did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have voiced concern that, in addition
to complicating relations between the two countries, allowing
individuals to claim Iranian diplomatic property could would invite
similar claims on United States property abroad.

BARAK KILLS ARMS DEAL WITH CHINA AFTER PRESSURE BY U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: Includes trim indicators) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THURMONT, Md. _ Under pressure from Congress and the Clinton
administration, Israel called off the sale of a military radar
plane to China on Wednesday as negotiations aimed at finalizing an
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord continued at the Camp David
presidential retreat near here.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, encamped at the compound with
President Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, announced
his decision to abort the controversial $250 million sale of the
Phalcon aircraft shortly before the leaders opened their second day
of discussions.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli spokesman said Barak expressed ``sorrow'' about the
action in a letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, explaining
that it would be difficult to allow the sale to go through while
Israel ``is in the midst of an effort to achieve historic decisions
related to her vital interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Israeli officials denied that Barak had succumbed to
U.S. security concerns about the sale, they acknowledged that the
strong objections from Clinton and congressional leaders were taken
into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an important issue to us and a subject of
continuing discussion at a variety of levels of the government,
including between the president and the prime minister. We are
pleased to see that they've taken our security concerns into
account in making this decision,'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said during a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The pending sale of the Phalcon, similar to an American AWACS
plane, had been a concern as well on Capitol Hill, where Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and others had begun to
question whether Congress would be willing to provide the financial
assistance that will be needed to help the peace process succeed.
American aid will play a key role in paying for the possible
relocation of both Palestinian refugees and Israeli settlers if an
agreement can be achieved at Camp David. Military aid to help beef
up Israeli security after a deal is also at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is keenly aware that Congress will in many ways control
the purse strings of a final deal. So it was no surprise that he
not only informed Clinton of his decision to cancel the advanced
airborne warning system sale, but telephoned Lott as well.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had insisted that Israel scrap the sale
because of tensions between China and Taiwan and out of concern
that Beijing might use the sophisticated radar plane to track
American aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations, even threatened to cut aid to
Israel by $250 million, roughly the cost of one high-tech aircraft,
if the sale weren't canceled.
</P>
<P>
   While the Israeli announcement won U.S. praise, a Palestinian
official irritated U.S. officials when he turned up outside the
summit press center, housed at the elementary school in Thurmont,
and began talking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official interrupted Nabil Amr, a Palestinian
Cabinet minister, in front of television cameras and accused him of
breaking the news blackout that Clinton, Barak and Arafat agreed to
before the start of their talks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only analyzing and repeating the known Palestinian
positions,'' Amr replied.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lockhart would say only that the three leaders had
met again several times Wednesday in various formats, and had
touched on all of the core issues that have prevented the two sides
from finalizing the agreement they signed under the Oslo accords
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The thorniest of the issues are where to draw the final
boundaries of a Palestinian state and how to redraw Jerusalem to
make room for a Palestinian capital. The two sides also have to
decide what to do about the 3 million Palestinian refugees who have
fled the region since Israel became a state in 1948, and the 40,000
Israeli settlers living in occupied territories scheduled to be
returned to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a substantive progress report, Lockhart spent
the day discussing atmospherics with reporters, telling them that
the informal living and working conditions at Camp David is adding
``some value to these discussions'' by bringing both sides closer
together.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the layout of the cabins at the presidential compound
makes it nearly impossible for the two sides to avoid each other
even when they're not working. Lockhart said they are not only
dining together in a common hall, but are often seen meeting
informally at various locations on the grounds and whipping about
in golf carts, the preferred mode of transportation at the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was quick to point out, however, that the friendly and
cordial atmosphere should not be taken to mean that the talks are
on the verge of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was expected to leave the talks briefly this morning to
deliver a speech at the annual convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Baltimore and
then attend an awards ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright will oversee the discussions with Arafat
and Barak until the president returns this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   One White House official said Clinton believes that leaving
Barak and Arafat alone to talk from time to time might enhance the
chances of a breakthrough. But nonetheless, this official said,
Clinton has prepared a number of proposals to help bridge the
differences between them, which he may present later today. This
official, however, declined to give any details of what the
proposals will include.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he would like to have at least the outline of
an agreement ready by July 19 when he departs for the so-called
Group of Eight economic summit in Japan. But the deadline Clinton
is most concerned about is Sept. 13, when Arafat has threatened to
unilaterally declare a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip if a final settlement has not been reached.

   Peter M. Cicchino, 39, a Professor of Law &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peter M. Cicchino, a professor of constitutional law and
jurisprudence at American University in Washington, died July 8 at
his home in the capital. He was 39.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, said his companion, Jonathan
Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Cicchino was born in Kearny, N.J., and graduated magna cum laude
in political science and philosophy from the University of Scranton
in 1982. He received a master's degree in philosophy at Fordham
University in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 to 1988, as a lay member of the Jesuit order, he
served in prisons, hospitals, homeless shelters and soup kitchens,
working especially with young people. After earning his law degree
at Harvard University in 1992, he was a staff counsel on the
Lesbian and Gay Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties
Union in New York City and the founding director of a similar
program at the Urban Justice Center.
</P>
<P>
   A specialist in public-interest law and laws affecting the
needy, he taught in the Program on Lawyering at New York University
Law School before joining the faculty of American University's
Washington College of Law in 1998. The college honored him at a
conference in May and announced the establishment of an annual
Peter M. Cicchino Award for Outstanding Service in the Public
Interest.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Springer, Cicchino is survived by his parents, Peter A.
and Mary Jane Cicchino of Kearny; three sisters, Sally Rooney, Jane
Goretski and Jill Cicchino, also of Kearny; and a brother, William,
of Cranford, N.J.

   Ronne Wohl Wulwick, 85, Founder of Jewish Outreach Group
</P>
<P>
   Ronne Wohl Wulwick, a founder of Hineni, an outreach group that
encourages young Jews to reconnect to their heritage, died July 8
at her home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 85.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Wulwick, a Bronx native who also lived in Palm Beach, Fla.,
helped establish Hineni in the early 1970s and remained an active
member. The organization is based in the Hineni Heritage Center on
the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Wulwick was also involved in Fight for Sight, an organization
that fosters vision research, and was active in groups for teen-age
suicide prevention. She helped raise money for Hadassah, the
Anti-Defamation League and the United Jewish Appeal. She also
helped start a fund-raising campaign for Long Island Jewish
Hospital in Hyde Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Wulwick's first husband, Joseph S. Wohl, to whom she was married
for 46 years, died in 1979. She is survived by Sam Wulwick, whom
she married in 1988; three daughters, Elinor Wohl of Manhattan,
Nancy Drake of Aspen, Colo., and Vicki Greenberg of Lawrence, N.Y.;
a son, Larry W. Wohl of Manhattan; a brother, Jack Jaffess of
Miami; and seven grandchildren.

CONNECTICUT POST IS SOLD ALONG WITH 5 SMALLER PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Colo.)   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. _ The Toronto-based company that owns The
Connecticut Post, the state's second-largest daily newspaper, said
Wednesday that it would sell the paper and five community
newspapers in Fairfield County to a chain based in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Post's owner, Thomson Corp., did not disclose terms of the
sale to MediaNews Group _ a deal that had interested several of the
country's major newspaper companies. The Post's suburban market is
one of the wealthiest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Post, which was called The Bridgeport Post until
1992, has a daily circulation of about 76,000, second in the state
to The Hartford Courant, which has a daily circulation of about
216,000. The Courant was also sold this year as part of Tribune
Co.'s acquisition of Times Mirror Co.
</P>
<P>
   MediaNews Group, which owns 130 newspapers in 13 states,
including The Denver Post, said it did not plan to make any staff
or management changes at the Connecticut newspapers, which include
weekly papers in Westport, Fairfield, Norwalk and Darien, and a
monthly publication called Inside Fairfield County.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, MediaNews announced that it had sold 4 daily
newspapers and 40 weekly newspapers in southern New Jersey and
Pennsylvania. William Dean Singleton, the president of MediaNews,
said the proceeds would be used to acquire the Connecticut papers
in a tax-free exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to size and position in the market,'' Singleton
said Wednesday. ``The New Jersey newspapers were scattered and were
small and were not in dominant positions and this is one larger
daily in a dominant position, and quite frankly in a better
market.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Connecticut publications completes Thomson's
divestment of its newspaper holdings in the United States, which
had included 49 daily papers. Combined proceeds from all of the
sales totaled about $2.4 billion, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson announced earlier this year that it would leave the
newspaper business, except for publishing The Globe &AMP; Mail, its
flagship property in Toronto, which circulates throughout Canada.
The company is focusing on its fast-growing, Internet-based
information management businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Lodovic, a spokesman for MediaNews Group, said that
the company had not been actively searching to buy newspapers in
Connecticut but that it became interested after Thomson's
negotiations with other potential buyers began to stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of fell into our lap,'' Lodovic said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Tribune Co. became the dominant newspaper company in
Connecticut when it reached a deal to buy Times Mirror, the parent
company of The Hartford Courant, The Advocate of Stamford and
Greenwich Time. Those papers have a combined weekday circulation of
more than 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson Newspapers had purchased The Bridgeport Post and The
Telegram, evening and morning sister newspapers, in June 1988 for
$210 million from Post Holding, a company controlled by the Pfriem
and Flicker families.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the newspaper was changed in June 1992. The editors
said it was done to help the newspaper appeal to a wider audience.
But critics said the change was designed to cut ties with the city
of Bridgeport, which was suffering from high crime and deep
financial woes.

SUSPECT IN EMBASSY BOMBINGS SAYS HE WAS COERCED INTO MAKING
STATEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man charged in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies
in East Africa is asking a federal judge in Manhattan to suppress
statements he made after his arrest, saying he was the victim of
coercive police tactics over nearly three weeks of sustained
interrogation in Pakistan and Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, also contends in a newly
filed court affidavit that law enforcement officials from the
United States who were investigating the bombings cooperated with
the Kenyan authorities ``to get the information they wanted, by
using both direct and indirect threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Odeh, a Jordanian citizen, has been charged in the bombings of
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
on Aug. 7, 1998, which killed more than 200 people and wounded more
than 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said Odeh, who has pleaded not guilty, made
statements to the authorities accepting responsibility for the
attacks, admitting that he gave technical advice and other
assistance to the bombers in Tanzania, and saying he was a member
of a group led by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile whom the
authorities suspect of masterminding the attacks and other acts of
terrorism against Americans abroad.
</P>
<P>
   But Odeh, who faces trial next January with five co-defendants,
contends in his four-page affidavit that his statements to the
authorities overseas were not voluntary. His lawyers have asked
Judge Leonard B. Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan to bar
prosecutors from using the statements at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The filing by Odeh's lawyers is one of at least two made so far
seeking the suppression of statements in the case. Another
defendant, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, said in a three-page affidavit
that he gave a statement to American interrogators in Germany only
after he was deprived of food, asthma medication and a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors and the FBI in New York would not discuss
the allegations Wednesday. Of the allegations by Odeh, Herbert
Hadad, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White, said: ``It is a
pending motion. We will be fully responding to the allegations in
our answering papers to be filed with the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Odeh, who was arrested in an airport in Pakistan on the day of
the bombings, was questioned for seven days in that country without
Americans present, his lawyers said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Odeh said in his affidavit that he was ``subjected to violence,
threats of torture, psychological coercion, sleep deprivation and
other inhumane conditions'' by his captors. His lawyers said in
their papers that they had been given a videotape of Odeh's
interrogation in Pakistan, adding that the tape appeared to have
been edited by the Pakistanis ``to remove evidence of their
improper interrogation techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Rashid Chaudhry, press attache for the Pakistani Embassy in
Washington, called the charges of misconduct by Pakistani
interrogators ``false and baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Odeh was next flown to Kenya and questioned there for 12 days,
his lawyers said. His Kenyan interrogators were joined by an
American prosecutor and FBI agents. Odeh's lawyers contend that in
Kenya, American law enforcement agents controlled the interrogation
of Odeh at all times.
</P>
<P>
   In his affidavit, Odeh said the Americans periodically left him
alone with the Kenyans, ``who threatened to torture and kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, his lawyers said, the Kenyans, out of the presence of the
Americans, threatened to take him to a garden in the city, ``tell
the people that he was responsible for the bombing, and allow them
to cut him to pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Odeh said the American agents told him that if he insisted on
having a lawyer, they would leave him alone with the Kenyan
interrogators, who he believed would torture him. ``I felt I had no
choice but to sign the piece of paper giving up my rights,'' Odeh
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan Embassy issued a short statement that did not address
Odeh's specific allegations but said Kenya's Constitution expressly
prohibited the subjecting of any person to torture or to inhuman or
degrading treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One of Odeh's lawyers, Sandra L. Babcock, said, ``Courts
recognize that when a defendant is subjected to these types of
coercive techniques, he'll say anything to get the interrogation to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Sand has not yet said when he will rule on the suppression
requests.

ANTICIPATE CRISES AND PREPARE, GREENSPAN SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that globalization is showing no signs of slowing and
that further international financial crises are all but inevitable,
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, offered
a prescription on Wednesday night for preventing and coping with
acute economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on lessons learned during the financial crisis that
began in Asia in 1997, Greenspan said industrialized and developing
countries alike needed to focus on developing strong banking
systems and active capital markets so that if one source of
financing dried up, another would be available.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed the need for governments to regulate their financial
systems adequately, for governments and the private sectors to
provide investors with full and timely economic and financial
information and for governments not to insulate investors from risk
by bailing them out when times get tough. And he warned about
allowing a buildup of debt within the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York,
Greenspan did not mention current economic conditions in the United
States or provide any hints about whether the Fed will raise
interest rates again when it meets next, on Aug. 22. Greenspan is
scheduled to testify about monetary policy before the Senate
Banking Committee next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan broke no new ground in his speech. But he said it was
``essential that we employ the current period of relative
international financial stability to address as best we can some of
the more evident short-run potentials for crises.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, he said, is to develop ``flexible institutions that can
adapt to the unforeseeable needs of the next crisis, not financial
Maginot Lines.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason to be flexible, he said, is the complexity of the
financial transactions and instruments through which capital flows
around the world. The best insurance against allowing a nasty
surprise to develop under the cloak of complexity, he suggested, is
to limit the amount of debt in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan spent much of his speech building a case that
countries with both strong banking system and healthy capital
markets were far better able to weather financial troubles than
countries that have only one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Countries like Thailand and Japan that relied heavily, if not
exclusively, on their banking systems found themselves without
another steady source of capital when their banks ran into trouble,
he said. But countries like the United States and Sweden, he said,
have come through crises relatively unscathed because they were
able to turn to banks when their capital markets got in trouble,
and vice versa.

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: AN EVERGLADES ACTION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 13:
</P>
<P>
   Just before the July 4 recess, a Senate committee approved a
bill that, with some crucial adjustments, could provide the
framework for the most ambitious environmental restoration project
ever undertaken in the country. The stated purpose of the bill is
to restore the historic flows of fresh water that once made the
Everglades one of the world's most wondrous and biologically
diverse ecosystems in the world. It will cost $8 billion over 20
years, shared by the federal government and Florida, and is the
product of seven years of work by the Army Corps of Engineers, the
environmental community and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Its success so far in the Senate owes much to the two Florida
senators, Connie Mack and Bob Graham. But most of the credit
belongs to Bob Smith, a New Hampshire conservative whose
stewardship of the bill has put to rest fears that he would not be
as sympathetic to the Everglades as John Chafee, the reliable
environmentalist who preceded him as chairman of the Environment
and Public Works Committee and who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill is not a sure thing. What it needs now is a timely
and powerful legislative push to get it through an uncertain House
of Representatives and onto the president's desk before Washington
is overwhelmed by the election campaign. To leave the bill until
next year would be to commit it to the uncertain hands of a new
Congress and, quite possibly, a new administration far less
interested in conservation generally and the Everglades
specifically than this one.
</P>
<P>
   Congress owes the Everglades restitution. More than 50 years
ago, after back-to-back hurricanes that put much of South Florida
under water, Congress ordered the Army Corps to drain a
half-million acres south of Lake Okeechobee with a web of levees,
canals and pumping stations. The result was to keep Florida's
booming east coast free from floods and safe for development, and
to create conditions under which the sugar cane industry could
flourish. But it robbed the Everglades and Florida Bay of their
traditional sources of fresh water, and nearly killed both.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, with the Senate's help, wants to set
things right by recapturing and rerouting most of the 1.7 billion
gallons of water that are wastefully flushed out to sea every day
in the name of flood control. The bill specifically authorizes over
$1 billion for the first 10 of 68 planned projects. Much of this
money would be used to construct massive reservoirs to store
Florida's copious rainwater that, at least in theory, will be
delivered to the natural system through a redesigned network of
canals and levees.
</P>
<P>
   The bill needs clarification. From the beginning, the state and
the administration have quarreled over who should get most of the
newly captured water _ the natural system, Florida's exploding
cities, or agriculture. The administration has argued that nature,
having been shortchanged for half a century, deserves top billing _
otherwise, why embark on this project at all? Florida, where the
developers, the water utilities and sugar interests have great
political power, has insisted on doing what it wants to.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says at one point that restoration is its ``overarching
purpose.'' Elsewhere, however, it gives urban and agricultural
needs equal weight. This is first and foremost a restoration bill,
not a water supply bill for the cities and farms, and any
ambiguities on this point must be cleared up. The bill should also
provide a greater oversight role over the life of the project for
the Interior Department, which manages about half the land to be
restored.
</P>
<P>
   While making these fixes, the bill's supporters must also focus
on building political momentum in the House, where opponents will
try to create mischief. One person who could help move things
forward is Jeb Bush, Florida's governor. He has promised $200
million, Florida's share of the project's first-year costs. But he
has not shown the enthusiasm of his predecessor, Lawton Chiles, who
courageously blocked efforts by the agricultural interests to
exercise line-by-line veto power over the project through their
friends in the state legislature. A more vigorous public commitment
on his part would be welcome and might have real influence in the
House. At risk is an irreplaceable natural asset that happens to be
dying.

BANKS SETTLE DISPUTE OVER ACCOUNTS  

</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four banks that serve about one-third of bank
customers in New York State have agreed to stop discouraging
consumers from opening low-cost basic accounts, state officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies _ the Chase Manhattan Corp., KeyCorp, the
Manufacturers and Traders Trust Co. and HSBC Bank USA _ agreed in a
settlement with the attorney general's office to follow a state law
that requires them to provide the basic bank accounts. They also
agreed to spend $300,000 on a statewide advertising campaign to
promote the low-cost accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came after a yearlong investigation by the
attorney general's regional office in Syracuse. The investigation
was started after a consumer complained that a Chase bank in
Syracuse would not allow her to open a low-cost account. Under the
informal agreement, the attorney general's office has agreed not to
sue the companies if they comply with the law and undertake the
consumer ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Gilbert-Biro, a spokeswoman for Chase Manhattan, which
banking officials say accounts for about 23 percent of the state's
customers, said the company was ``happy to be doing this'' as a
part of ``our ongoing efforts'' to inform consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Banks are required to offer low-cost accounts under a 1994 state
law. Consumers could open such an account with a deposit of as
little as $25. Account holders must maintain a minimum monthly
balance of 1 cent, and they are charged a monthly maintenance fee
of no more than $3. The accounts allow for eight free withdrawals
each month and third-party check cashing at no cost to the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said on Wednesday that ``access
to low-cost accounts is a right of all New Yorkers.'' He said that
the people who suffered most from unavailability of the low-cost
accounts were the poor and the elderly, who often have to rely on
check-cashing services that charge a percentage of the check total
as a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said his investigators found ``industrywide
noncompliance'' with the law on low-cost bank accounts and would
soon begin discussions with other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Haven, legislative counsel of the New York Public Interest
Research Group, which lobbied for the 1994 law, praised the
agreement, but said, ``The other part of this story is that the
Banking Department has done an awful job enforcing the law and
ensuring that the banks promote low-cost checking accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   State Banking Department officials disputed that assertion. An
official said there were about one million basic accounts in New
York.

PATAKI SIGNS LAW TOUGHENING SENTENCES FOR LIVERY-CAB CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tougher sentencing laws have long been used to deter
violent crimes against minority groups or those in dangerous public
jobs, like police officers. But Wednesday, Gov. George Pataki
signed into law a bill meant to deter violence against a private
occupation: livery-cab drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was in response to the killings of 10 livery-cab
drivers this year. Pataki announced the signing at a news
conference at the offices of Seaman Radio Dispatch, a livery
company in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, where he
was joined by the families of slain drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in a sense a sad day,'' the Republican governor said,
``because when I look out in the front row I see the widows of
people, immigrants that came to this country with a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure directs judges to add three to five years to the
minimum sentence of anyone convicted of committing certain violent
crimes against on-duty livery-cab drivers, as well as yellow-cab
drivers and drivers with black car limousine services. The covered
crimes include assault, manslaughter, attempted murder and robbery.
The sentencing changes take effect Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for legislators to single out a private occupation
for protection, said Burt Newborne, a professor at New York
University School of Law. Laws of this sort have typically been
adopted for classes of people considered vulnerable to violence,
like members of ethnic groups or gays, who are protected by
hate-crime laws, he said, or government officials like tax
collectors, police officers and prison guards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tradition in criminal law of identifying vulnerable
groups, particularly classes of people, for these types of
protections, in the hope that they will increase the deterrent, but
it's rare,'' Newborne said. ``It's extremely rare that it is done
by profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure is the latest attempt by public officials to help
New York City's estimated 41,000 livery-cab drivers, who work in
poor, high-crime neighborhoods where yellow cabs seldom venture.
They ``perform an enormously important service,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the livery-cab business praised the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only right, it's fair,'' said Fernando A. Mateo,
president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, which
represents 15,000 livery drivers.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, several of the widows, surrounded by
their children, broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want justice,'' said Maria Lopez, whose husband, Cesar
Lopez, 42, was killed in Brooklyn in April. ``They have to make
people pay for what they did.''

DNA TESTS OK'D FOR 2 MORE ON TEXAS DEATH ROW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Two more condemned men in Texas will get new DNA
testing in efforts to exonerate them, including one felon who had
been scheduled to die Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gray County District Attorney John Mann said Wednesday he has
decided to conduct additional DNA testing in the case of Henry
``Hank'' Skinner, who was convicted in a 1993 triple homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bexar County District Attorney Susan D. Reed joined
defense lawyers in asking that the execution of Caruthers Alexander
be postponed so that DNA tests could be performed. Alexander, 51,
was sentenced to die for the 1981 rape and strangulation of a San
Antonio waitress.
</P>
<P>
   His execution had been set for Wednesday. Instead, Orien Cecil
Joiner was put to death last night for the 1986 murders of two
women who lived in the apartment next to him in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' decisions, made independently of one another,
reflect a growing acceptance of DNA testing, said Maurie Levin of
the Texas Defender Project, a group that represents condemned
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is becoming more and more widely recognized that it is
important to have procedures in place to facilitate DNA testing,''
Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   There is a ``recognition . . . that the system is fallible and
makes mistakes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The additional DNA testing in the Skinner and Alexander cases
comes just six weeks after Gov. George W. Bush agreed to postpone
the execution of Ricky McGinn for further DNA testing in that case.
The reprieve was the first-ever during the Bush administration and
came just minutes before McGinn was to receive the lethal
injection.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today reported Wednesday that preliminary results of those
additional DNA tests failed to clear McGinn of the 1995 rape and
murder of his 12-year-old stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted anonymous sources close to the case as
saying the FBI test results point to McGinn or a maternal relative
as the source of a pubic hair found inside the body of Stephanie
Flanary. No other member of McGinn's family has been linked to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   McGinn's lawyers have the option of submitting the evidence to
separate labs for additional analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The USA Today report heartened the slain child's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me a little inspiration that justice is going to be
served _ not just for satisfaction of the murderer of my own
daughter to be killed,'' but also for victims of McGinn's other
crimes, said Steve Flanary, Stephanie's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've prayed and I've thought and I've prayed throughout the
last seven years and came to peace of mind that it's OK for me to
seek the man's justice and it's also all right for me to go ahead
and ask the Lord to forgive his soul that he may go in to heaven,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to comment Wednesday on the McGinn case, saying he
would honor a court-imposed gag order.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors spared Bush from having to decide whether Skinner
and Alexander deserved reprieves.
</P>
<P>
   Mann did not wait for defense attorneys to request additional
DNA tests in court. Instead, he decided to have a private lab
conduct the tests to end ``speculation and public hysteria'' about
the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said it will be at least a week before he can get DNA
evidence to an independent lab and ``God only knows'' how long
before results will be known.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner's attorneys are leery of Mann's offer. The attorneys
wrote to Mann on Wednesday saying they would oppose any DNA testing
conducted without court supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Steve Losch of Longview said he fears Mann will destroy
the evidence if it comes back in Skinner's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trust John Mann to tell me the time of day,'' Losch
said. ``He is the least trustworthy prosecutor I've ever run into,
with the possible exception of (an assistant prosecutor) in
Lubbock.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, 38, was sentenced to die for bludgeoning his live-in
girlfriend, Twila Jean Busby, 40, with an ax handle and fatally
stabbing her two mentally impaired sons, 22-year-old Elwin Caler
and Randy Busby, 20. The murders occurred Jan. 1, 1994, at Busby's
home in the Panhandle city of Pampa.
</P>
<P>
   Mann insists there is strong physical evidence linking Skinner
to the murders, including DNA tests of blood on Skinner's clothes
that ties him to two of the victims and a bloody palm print on a
door.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner contends he is innocent. He said he passed out after a
night of drinking and awoke to find the family murdered, which
would explain how he got the victims' blood on his clothes, Losch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mann said demands by defense lawyers for additional DNA testing
have ``almost reached the point of hysteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``brought a lot of this on with his statement'' that no
innocent person has been executed in Texas while he was governor,
Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those pushing for new DNA tests in the Skinner case is a
class of journalism students from Northwestern University near
Chicago. The students conducted their own investigation of the case
and claim they have uncovered evidence implicating someone else in
the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The students want hair found in Busby's hand, skin from under
her fingernails and the contents of a rape kit collected at the
scene to undergo additional DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alexander case, District Attorney Reed went along with a
defense request for further tests on hair samples in evidence. DNA
testing was unavailable at the time of Alexander's 1982 trial.
</P>
<P>
   Reed acknowledged the evidence against Alexander is
circumstantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't think district attorneys who put up a
fight (about post-conviction DNA testing) are doing themselves a
favor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the McGinn case, where the victim's family protested
the delay posed by testing, the family of 19-year-old Lori Bruch
did not object in the Alexander case, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to have to go through the Huntsville
circus,'' she said of protests that have been carried out at the
Texas state prison during executions of some high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
   While only a very few death row cases are being subjected to
post-conviction DNA testing at this point, Skinner's attorney is
hopeful there will be more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the battle is virtually won,'' Losch said. ``I think
there is now a social and almost political consensus this testing
needs to be done, and if it wasn't it needs to be done before you
put someone to death.''

EDITORIAL: BUILDING PEACE IN ULSTER  

</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 13:
</P>
<P>
   The summer parade season in Northern Ireland is always a time of
volatility, and this year is no different. But even the recent
disturbances have been overshadowed by a common desire among
Protestants and Catholics to strengthen a still-fragile peace. This
year's marchers, who commemorate Protestant victories long ago, are
fewer in number and less violent than in the past. They are also
more marginalized, criticized even by their traditional allies for
their intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs of progress. Last month the Irish
Republican Army allowed two international envoys to visit a weapons
dump and certify that the contents could be monitored _ a measure
that should be followed by real IRA disarmament later. Home rule
has been revived and is working well. The ministers in Northern
Ireland's cabinet belong to parties ranging from Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the IRA, to the Democratic Unionists, who reject
the entire peace process. They are proving to be effective and
surprisingly collegial.
</P>
<P>
   Britain can help reinforce the peace by reforming the Royal
Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force. The RUC,
which is 93 percent Protestant, is viewed by many Catholics as an
alien body. The composition, law enforcement practices and even the
name of the force should be changed so that it can fairly serve the
interests of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The British government has recently revised an earlier reform
plan that fell well short of the changes that are needed. The
version voted out of the House of Commons on Tuesday improves
efforts to recruit Catholics into the police and strengthens the
powers of a new civilian oversight board. But serious flaws remain
that must be remedied. The bill gives too much power to the British
secretary for Northern Ireland to impede or block investigations of
police misconduct by the civilian board. A new ombudsman would be
barred from looking at past events except under extraordinary
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But the most controversial provision is the name. Under the
bill, the police force would be called the Police Service of
Northern Ireland for all operational purposes. But the group's
formal documents would use ``Royal Ulster Constabulary'' in its
name as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even symbolic continuity with the RUC may persuade Catholics to
continue rejecting the police, which undermines the inclusiveness
that is crucial to peace. It could also give the IRA an excuse to
stall on disarmament. Northern Ireland's moderate Catholic party
also worries that reforms will be watered down when the legislation
is instituted. The British government should amend the bill, which
now goes to the House of Lords. Northern Ireland cannot have a
lasting peace if the police _ in appearance or in fact _ remain a
divisive force.

EDITORIAL: GOVERNOR WHITMAN'S GAFFE 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, July 13:
</P>
<P>
   A startling photograph has surfaced showing Gov. Christine Todd
Whitman of New Jersey grinning and frisking a black man who has his
hands up and is facing a wall. The picture was taken on a night in
1996 when she accompanied state troopers who were patrolling in
Camden. The man she frisked had apparently already been searched by
the troopers for weapons and drugs and then handed over to the
governor. The man had not been accused of any crime.
</P>
<P>
   The picture has caused a furor, and Whitman is now criticizing
her critics for taking the picture ``out of context.'' But the fact
remains that the posed look of the photograph and Whitman's smiling
expression add up to the appearance of a gratuitous insult. The
controversy over the photo may also help explain why Whitman has
had so much trouble putting the political problem of racial
profiling by New Jersey state troopers behind her.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the issue will not disappear is that racial profiling
_ the targeting and searching of motorists based solely on race _
has gone on for years, despite denials by political leaders like
Whitman. Also, the anger and mistrust in minority communities over
this issue are deeply rooted, despite Whitman's subsequent
acknowledgment of the problem and her efforts to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph simply feeds that anger and mistrust. Whitman
insists the episode had nothing to do with racial profiling. But
that does not change the fact that the man in the picture was
treated callously by the person who is chiefly responsible for
setting the direction and tone of law enforcement in the state.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Whitman was the first New Jersey governor to
acknowledge that state troopers had engaged in systematic racial
profiling. In the past year she began efforts to combat profiling
as part of a consent decree entered into between the state and the
Justice Department. She has also conceded that state police
commanders have tolerated racial and sexual discrimination against
minority and female officers. In the face of numerous lawsuits
brought by former state troopers, she has ordered an overhaul of
the agency's hiring and promotion practices and its command
structure.
</P>
<P>
   But those bureaucratic reforms do not take the sting out of the
photo. Whitman's refusal to apologize for the conduct in the photo
adds to public skepticism that her administration will
energetically crack down on illegal policing practices. A lawyer
for two troopers who have been criminally charged for shooting
three unarmed minority men on the New Jersey Turnpike has already
said the photo would be used to support their contention that
racial profiling was encouraged by the police leadership. If the
governor cares to heal the mistrust, she needs to show that she
understands why the picture is offensive to so many people.

GORE TO NAACP CONVENTION: `IT'S GOOD TO BE HOME' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Calif., Colo.)   (Eds: SUBS 8th graf, Gore's appearance ..., to CORRECT Bush's
percentage of black vote in poll to 17 percent, add CBS News to
poll.) 
By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ From his opening salutation _ ``I am a member of the
NAACP; it's good to be home'' _ to his closing motivational cry _
``I'm not asking you to read my lips; I'm asking you to read my
heart!'' _ a spirited Al Gore summoned black voters Wednesday to
support his presidential candidacy, reminding them of his long
commitment to their cause and deriding Gov. George W. Bush as
offering only words, not action.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come here not just in an election year, but year after
year,'' the vice president told several hundred members of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the
nation's largest civil rights organization. ``I have worked with
you. I have stood with you. I am proud to have won some battles
alongside you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's message, threaded thickly with his policy positions, was
in deliberate counterpoint to Bush's speech to the same group on
Monday, when the Texas governor was criticized by many in the
organization who said he offered only breezy generalities. Bush was
the first Republican presidential candidate to court the NAACP
since his father spoke to the group in 1988; still, the governor
received a tepid response compared with the rousing and repeated
standing ovations that Gore drew Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president delved into details, from his support of
affirmative action and hate-crimes legislation to jobs and
education. He said he would defend affirmative action ``because it
is still needed in this country'' and it is ``good for our
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his opposition to raising the retirement age for
Social Security benefits and to Bush's proposal to divert some
Social Security investment into the stock market. Gore talked of
his support for a patient's bill of rights, gun control and a full
count of people in the census as opposed to sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the heroes of black history, from Frederick Douglass
and Harriet Tubman to Thurgood Marshall and Rosa Parks, Gore
promised to ban racial profiling so that people would not be pulled
over simply for ``driving while black.'' ``I will make the DWB
offense obsolete in America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He castigated Bush for invoking the notion of ``state's rights''
to avoid taking a position on whether South Carolina should remove
the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse. And he reminded
his listeners of his longtime commitment to their concerns. ``I
have made more trips to Africa than I have to Asia,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's appearance came amid some concern among his staff members
that blacks have been left dispirited by the campaign. Black voters
account for about 15 percent of the electorate, and they usually
support Democrats overwhelmingly. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in
May showed Gore with 69 percent of the black vote and about 17
percent  &UR;  &LR; for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton, by contrast, has more than a 90-percent
approval rating among black voters. Analysts said Gore could
probably claim that level of support by Election Day, but
questioned the commitment of black voters to get to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, chief pollster for the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies, said: ``He'll get 90-95 percent of the black
vote. The larger question for Gore really is black turnout as
opposed to his share of the black vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Bositis said Gore would inherit the good relations with blacks
that the president had built up, stemming from the record economic
expansion, low unemployment among blacks, numerous appointments of
blacks to administration positions and falling crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bositis said, Bush's message of being a ``different kind
of Republican'' was aimed less at winning over black voters than
white swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, overall turnout in November is likely to be
low, precisely because the economy is doing so well, and Gore's
challenge is to activate his base, which he has had some difficulty
doing. While polls show Bush winning the support of 90 percent of
Republicans, Gore has the support of only about 70 percent of
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's event was aimed at drumming up enthusiasm among
voters who should be squarely behind him.
</P>
<P>
   This was evident in the introduction of Gore by William Lucy, an
NAACP board member, who said, ``Al Gore, unlike a lot of other
people, has not just discovered the NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy also noted Gore's lineage as the son of Sen. Albert Gore,
who supported most civil rights legislation (though he did not back
the Civil Rights Act of 1964). ``He has drawn from that deep well
of public consciousness given to him by his father,'' Lucy said.
</P>
<P>
   And Lucy set a robustly partisan tone, although the NAACP cannot
endorse candidates because of its tax exempt status. In noting that
the Clinton administration had nominated 57 black judges to the
federal bench, he added, ``not a single Clarence Thomas among
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore easily assumed command of the audience. In imploring his
listeners to work hard to help the Democrats recapture the House,
Gore said: ``I want you to consider how much we can get done by
taking back the Congress, how much justice will be redeemed when
John Conyers is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, how much
economic progress will be made when Charlie Rangel is chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   To gales of laughter, he prompted delegates to their feet with a
cadenced ridicule of Bush's talk of compassionate conservatism _
``Talk doesn't cost much,'' he said _ compared to his own record of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that you heard some nice-sounding words on Monday
afternoon,'' Gore said. ``But I remembered what scripture teaches
in the Book of James, Chapter 2, Verse 18: `Yay, a man may say thou
hast faith, and I have works. Show me thy faith without thy works,
and I will show thee my faith BY my works.'''
</P>
<P>
   And he faulted Bush for repeated failures to respond to minority
voters, at one point offering a dramatized rendition of an imagined
chilly, monosyllabic Bush response _ ``No'' _ to the family of
James Byrd, a black man dragged to his death in Texas in 1998, when
the family asked the governor to support legislation against hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   NAACP officials seemed thrilled with Gore's performance. Julian
Bond, the chairman, said flatly: ``The vice president had substance
and Governor Bush had a drive-by photo opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kweisi Mfume, the president of the organization, said he
appreciated the fact that Bush spoke to the group, but acknowledged
Gore's edge. ``Al Gore is pretty much a family member,'' Mfume
said. He told reporters he could forgive Gore's support for the
death penalty _ a subject the vice president did not raise _
because his stand was principled and not political.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the convention were pleased too. ``He's
beautiful,'' said Faye Sandle, 64, of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Watson, 55, a meat cutter from Monterey, Calif., said, ``I
believe Gore is more for the people. I like what he said about
affirmative action, jobs and investing back in the communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith McDougald, 57, an elementary school teacher from Glen
Burnie, Md., said that she would not hold Gore's support for the
death penalty against him, since that was the only area where she
disagreed with him. ``Bush's reaction to the executions will be in
the negative for him,'' she said, referring to the recent execution
of a black man in Texas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRMONT, W.Va. _ At the edge of the crowd of mourners, a chorus
of Bible-quoting protesters began sounding off behind a police
cordon, proclaiming that the victim of a grisly fatal beating last
week, a young gay black man, had been dispatched to hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuality is an enormous sin _ Read Leviticus 21:8,''
proclaimed one of the less vulgar signs bobbing at the fringe of
the street scene.
</P>
<P>
   David Stricker, a husky, 48-year-old local resident who is gay,
knew what he had to do. He strapped on an oversized pair of
theater-prop wings and used them to most politely block the
protesters' view of an otherwise peaceful evening memorial on
Tuesday in this city of about 20,000 people 115 miles northeast of
Charleston, the state capital. ``They say they're coming in the
name of God, but they're coming in the name of hatred,'' he quietly
explained above the protesters' din.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker played the protective angel, an anti-heckler role being
seen increasingly at gay rights gatherings. He helped reduce the
small band of anti-gay visitors to a minor nuisance on an
extraordinary night for this rural county seat in which hundreds of
gays and lesbians, blacks and whites, stood together in the streets
and demanded justice on behalf of Arthur Warren Jr., whose beaten
body was found last week on a back road near Paw Paw Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, 26, was openly gay and his mourners, while conceding the
difficulty of plumbing the nature of hatred and homicide, demanded
a full investigation and disputed official insistence that neither
racism nor homophobia had been a motive in the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Warren was taken for a hit-and-run victim. But then a
conscience-stricken 16-year-old boy, who has not been charged in
the crime, went to the authorities. Two unidentified 17-year-old
white teen-agers were arrested and charged with the killing; the
authorities said the teen-agers beat and kicked Warren to death and
then drove a car over his body in an attempt to mask the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The battered corpse in an open coffin drew sobs and shrieks on
Saturday as local mourners demanded more information. Many were
incredulous when the police flatly insisted that hatred of gays and
blacks was not a motive in the slaying. Friends said Warren was a
gentle person and a church volunteer who had a summer park job and
other occasional employment. The friends said he occasionally told
of incidents of harassment stemming from both racial and sexual
bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no indication of a hate crime,'' Sheriff Ron Watkins
of Marion County said in a radio interview when asked about the
reported confessions of the defendants. ``There was no indication
anyone hated a particular group, especially gays,'' Watkins said.
He did not elaborate, saying the two teen-agers were subject to
closed juvenile proceedings until the court decides within the next
month whether they should be tried as adults.
</P>
<P>
   As human rights activists congregated from around the country,
members of the Tuesday night memorial crowd insisted that hatred
had to be at the heart of the slaying, whether it was racism,
homophobia or a combination of both. In any case, they heard
speakers complain that there were shortcomings in existing
hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's hate-crime statute, like federal law, covers
race but not sexual orientation. A bill to remedy this passed the
state Senate but died in the House of Delegates earlier this year.
In Washington, a proposal pending in the Senate would include
sexual orientation under the hate-crime law and enable federal
prosecutors to step in when local authorities do not act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dying from the inside out in this country because of
hatred,'' said Stricker, a social worker, his paper mache wings
stretched upward as he stood outside the county courthouse during
the memorial. ``We want this to be treated as a hate crime,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He argued, like many in the crowd of 400, that a clear law
against bias crimes would not be redundant in this first-degree
murder case and would be an object lesson against hateful practices
that can and do turn deadly.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker, David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and
lesbian watchdog group, drew cheers as he told the crowd, ``There
is no doubt in our minds that hate was a factor in this crime _
hate based on sexual orientation and hate based on race.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd referred to their own experiences in
speculating about the hatred they insisted had to be at the heart
of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason he was killed was because he was black,'' said
Lydia Robinson, a black woman who was born here and visits every
summer from Dearborn Heights, Mich. ``Being gay didn't help him
either, but if he had been white I don't think it would have gone
this far. Over the last 20 years I've seen a supremacy attitude
develop toward local blacks around here.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted as juveniles, the two teen-agers could be freed by
age 21. If convicted as adults, they would face life in prison. In
the face of such extreme alternatives, plus the dearth of
information, the throng lighted candles, sang hymns and pledged
unity as they demanded that authorities not stint in prosecuting
the case against the victim, known to friends as ``J.R.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ravenscroft, a white man and friend of the victim, told of
long-standing ties between some black and white families. Looking
over at the protest signs about hell, Ravenscroft declared, ``J.R.
Warren is my friend and where J.R. is right now is with love, and
the rest of us are just who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   In Grant Town, an old coal-mine hamlet near where Warren lived,
the Rev. Nelson Staples, his pastor at Mt. Beulah Baptist Church,
said ``J.R. was a gentle soul'' who confided in him some casual
instances of harassment that he was able to weather.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the church has been firebombed, smeared with
racist epithets and shot at by night-riders, Staples said,
describing the incidents as ``this spirit of evil that occasionally
arises'' among some in the community.
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasized that the killing of Warren was the worst
possible reminder of the longstanding need for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.R. had a great sense of humor but he must have lived a very
anguished life trying to find a place to fit in,'' Staples said, in
wondering whether the sudden burst of attention on Grant Town would
disappear just as suddenly as the crowd did after the memorial.
``One thing about J.R., he was always forgiving,'' the pastor
added. ``He was always forgiving.''

JONES HAS BENEFITED FROM HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Hype exploded out of the starting blocks, a little
too quickly if you ask us. We wouldn't be terribly surprised if all
of those involved in the race to anoint Marion Jones the breakout
performer of the 2000 Olympics are called back because of a false
start.
</P>
<P>
   The next 10 days will give the world's judges a clearer picture
with which to render their judgment. By the end of the U.S. Olympic
Track and Field Trials, which begin Friday at Cal State
Sacramento's Hornet Stadium, we'll know whether we and Mrs. Jones
jumped the gun in accepting the former Thousand Oaks resident's
pronouncement that she can win five gold medals in Sydney as if it
were a relay baton and running with it.
</P>
<P>
   No track athlete, male or female, has mined that much gold in
one Olympic fortnight, which is why the pursuit of history has been
her story for the past year. For those who lost track of Jones
after her Rio Mesa High and Thousand Oaks High days, it's possible
to get up to speed on her life by reading her recently published
biography or any number of magazine articles. Or you can dig the
basketball and track standout in bohemian television promotional
spots for her shoe-and-apparel company.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a bit dizzying. Lost in the publicity deluge is this
simple truth: Jones isn't the first female sprinter to try to run
down history at the Olympics, merely one of the first to attempt it
with Madison Avenue's full attention.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, a basketball player-turned-sprinter from a dusty town
in Georgia upset a U.S. teammate, Edith McGuire, whom she never
previously had beaten, to win the Olympic 100 meters. In Mexico
City four years later, Wyomia Tyus became the first Olympian, male
or female, to successfully defend the sprint when she prevailed in
the final of what was then the fastest field ever assembled.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, female athletes largely fell below the public's
radar. So there was no build-up for Tyus' feat; there was no shoe
company or network trumpeting her cause. In as much as people
mentioned her at all, it was to not-so-subtly suggest that Tyus, a
Tennessee State Tigerbelle, was too old to be chasing more Olympic
gold.
</P>
<P>
   Tyus was 23, one year younger than Jones is now, when she won
her second Olympic 100-meters crown in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   More than Jones' skin-tight hooded tracksuit, the advances that
have been made in her sport are manifested in the acceptance and
acclaim Jones wears like a birthmark. For perspective's sake, it's
worth remembering on the eve of these Trials a time not that long
ago when history wasn't rewarded before it was made and, in fact,
often got the short shrift afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Tyus had reason to wonder for the longest time whether her track
career wasn't one big riddle: If you make history but no one
notices, did you really do anything special?
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Tyus, an outdoor-education specialist with the Los
Angeles Unified School District, was tuned to the telecast of the
Summer Games in Seoul. She heard an announcer say American Carl
Lewis, the defending 100 meters champion, could become the first
sprinter to win back-to-back Olympic titles (he ultimately would
become the first male sprinter to do so after the apparent winner,
Ben Johnson, failed a drug test and was stripped of his gold
medal).
</P>
<P>
   Tyus didn't scream at the television. She simply laughed. What
else is a pioneer to do?
</P>
<P>
   By then Tyus was inured to slights. When she was chasing
history, she might as well have been running in a vacuum. ``Nobody
ever mentioned it,'' Tyus, a softspoken woman incapable of
self-aggrandizement, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the Age of Aquarius was not to be confused with today's
Age of Awareness. ``If I look back at interviews,'' Tyus said, ``it
didn't really catch people's attention until years later, until
they really started to publicize women's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyus wasn't just a step ahead of her competitors in 1968, she
was ahead of her time. To wit: Her clocking in Mexico City (11.08)
wasn't surpassed by an American in an Olympic final until 1984.
Thirty-two years later, Jones can break 11 seconds without breaking
a sweat. Her personal best in the 100 is 10.65, which is the
second-fastest time in history behind Florence Griffith-Joyner's
world record of 10.49 from the 1988 Olympic Trials.
</P>
<P>
   Tyus would be less than honest if she said she didn't
occasionally wonder how low she might have been able to go if she
had had the chance to continue running as a professional after
college, something that wasn't possible in her day when strict
rules of amateurism were enforced.
</P>
<P>
   She looks at the late Griffith-Joyner, who set the world
standard at the age of 28, and Merlene Ottey, who ran the 100
meters in 10.94 at the 1996 Games at 36 and is going strong at 40,
and ``I think, absolutely, what could I have done if I had had the
opportunity to stay with it?'' said Tyus, a naturalist who calls
the Angelus National Forest her office. ``I was not encouraged to
stay in the sport. There were people saying even before 1968 that I
was too old to be running. That just goes to show the state of mind
of people at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now we're perhaps a little too eager to mint
female sports icons. The sleek Jones is saddled with bloated
expectations at these Trials; a world is watching to see how she
manages.

MINORITIES' HEALTH LAGS BEHIND THAT OF WHITE PEOPLE IN KC, DATA
SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ By almost every measure, the health of Kansas
City's African-American community lags far behind that of the
city's white population _ and the disparities are growing greater.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued Wednesday by the Kansas City Health Department
paints a statistical picture of minority groups that have not fully
benefited from a decade of improvements in health care.
</P>
<P>
   Over the period covered by the report, 1990 through 1998, black
Kansas City residents lived on average about 11 years less than
white residents. Their babies were three times more likely to die
in infancy. Their teen-agers were about 18 times more likely to be
homicide victims. And in adulthood, they had a 50 percent greater
chance of dying of heart disease or cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics fared better on many health measures, the report
found. But on average, they, too, died earlier than white people.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Council is expected to vote today on a
resolution establishing a mayor's minority health improvement task
force. The task force will make recommendations by March 2001 on
how to eliminate racial disparities in health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are calling this issue to action,'' Health Department
Director Rex Archer told the council's Neighborhood Development
Committee on Wednesday. ``We are going to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer said he hoped to have the task force appointed this
month. Eventually, it will involve hundreds of people in health
care, charitable organizations, businesses and church groups, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just city government. It's going to take every part
of our community to fix these problems,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   The report findings parallel those of a recent report on the
health status of the Kansas City area issued jointly by the United
Auto Workers and Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Black people in the five-county area had an overall mortality
rate that was 63 percent higher than that of white people, the
UAW//Ford report found. And black people had higher death rates
from most chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The divergent health status of racial and ethnic minorities and
white people long has been recognized as a serious and intractable
national problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, infant mortality rates are 2.5 times higher for
black people and 1.5 times higher for American Indians. Vietnamese
women suffer cervical cancer at nearly five times the rate of white
people, and Hispanics have two to three times the rate of stomach
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, President Clinton announced an initiative to
eliminate these disparities by 2010. He called for outreach
programs by the surgeon general's office, collaboration with
foundations and the strengthening of public health programs in such
areas as AIDS prevention, prostate cancer screening and diabetes
education.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent research suggests that doctors may not be treating
illnesses of minority members as intensively as they treat the
maladies of white patients.
</P>
<P>
   But the poorer health of minority members has much to do with
the disadvantages of poverty, such as poor education and little or
no health insurance, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the population we serve seeks health care at a
catastrophic point,'' said Benjamin Pettus, executive director of
the Samuel U. Rodgers Community Health Center, where many patients
are minority group members.
</P>
<P>
   That means patients often wait until a health problem becomes
critical before seeing doctors because they cannot afford regular
care, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Black people have higher cancer death rates at least in part
because they are diagnosed at later stages of their disease when
treatment is less effective, said Nancy Moylan, director of
outreach for the Heartland Division of the American Cancer Society
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have equal access to a doctor or if you're poor
and don't have insurance, you're not going to use health care the
same way as someone well-to-do,'' Moylan said.
</P>
<P>
   By some available measures, the health status of minority
members in Kansas City was comparable to that in many other cities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a report in 1997 by the Chicago Department of
Public Health found that the death rate among black people in
Kansas City was the 11th lowest among 44 cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's relatively good news,'' Archer said. ``But we clearly
want to be number one.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer said the task force probably would focus on seven problem
areas: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, infant mortality, AIDS and
sexually transmitted diseases, immunizations, cancer screening, and
management and injury prevention.
</P>
<P>
   To bring minority health up to that of white people may mean
catching a moving target. The health status of white people in
Kansas City appears to be improving steadily on some measures,
while that of minority groups has changed little.
</P>
<P>
   While the cancer death rate among white residents in Kansas City
declined by 24.2 percent from 1990 and 1998, it stayed the same for
black people.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of breast cancer, the death rate actually has been
increasing among black women while declining among white people.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, the stroke death rate among white people
decreased by 27 percent but remained steady among black people.
</P>
<P>
   Although new AIDS infections have been declining among all
racial groups, the decline has been less pronounced among black
people. They now account for more new AIDS infections in Kansas
City than any other group.
</P>
<P>
   Solving these problems will require the removal of barriers to
care such as a lack of transportation to a doctor's office or
clinic, and the lack of affordable care, Pettus said.
</P>
<P>
   And better education is needed about health risks and disease
prevention, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to really work to educate the population...that they
understand diseases for which they are at high risk,'' Pettus said.
</P>
<P>
   Some work along those lines already is under way in the Kansas
City area.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Kansas City Division of the American Heart
Association recently initiated a health promotion called ``Search
Your Heart'' in predominantly African-American churches.
</P>
<P>
   And the association also offers cooking classes and a cookbook,
Cooking South of the Border, with low-fat Mexican recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cancer Society has support groups geared specifically to
black people with breast and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the (health) messages haven't been culturally
sensitive,'' Moylan said. ``The messages were addressed to the
people who look like the members of the health-care system _ the
white middle class.''

AMERICAN LEGION HONORS KC MAN FOR 80 YEARS OF MEMBERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Front and center.
</P>
<P>
   That is where World War I veteran Urban Schick sat Wednesday
afternoon, as area officials of the American Legion lined up to
salute him at Bishop Spencer Place, a retirement-nursing center in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Schick is the oldest known living member of the American Legion
with continuous membership, said Tony Curtis, adjutant of American
Legion Post 224, the Kansas City post that Schick joined in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   The American Legion formed only two years earlier, after the
conclusion of World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Schick's tenure is remarkable, said Del Snodgrass, state
commander of the American Legion's Department of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``We quite often refer to members of the American Legion as
family,'' Snodgrass said. ``Although Mr. Schick hasn't been able to
attend many functions lately, we still respect his membership and
past services to the American Legion.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Schick, who will turn 104 in October, appreciated
Wednesday's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chain of command,'' Curtis commanded. ``Move in.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, officials came up and presented Schick with gifts,
such as a golden name tag and his 80-year American Legion
membership certificate.
</P>
<P>
   To each man Schick nodded, and sometimes shook hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you doing during all this?'' asked Diane Schick, a
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' Schick replied.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Memorial officials consider Schick the Kansas City
area's one remaining World War I veteran, said Christie Green,
marketing director for the Liberty Memorial. And, in recent years,
Schick has done what he can for the memorial. Last summer he
attended a dedication ceremony celebrating the Kids for Liberty
campaign, in which Kansas City area children contributed to the
memorial's renovation.
</P>
<P>
   After World War I, Schick worked as a lawyer for many years in
Kansas City. Among his keepsakes are copies of pages from the
Kansas City School of Law's 1924 yearbook. Schick's photo appeared
there, as did that of Harry S. Truman, who as president signed the
yearbook for Schick in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, however, are trying to find more documentation
on Schick's life and career.
</P>
<P>
   One example is his apparent career with the St. Louis Cardinals.
Bruce O'Neal, a nephew of Schick's from Arizona, recalls relatives
describing how they watched Schick pitch for the Cardinals before
World War I. But Schick's name does not appear in a recent edition
of The Baseball Encyclopedia, the standard player reference, and
family members have no solid evidence of his baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important is Schick's service record.
</P>
<P>
   Documentation of Schick's wartime service cannot be found, Green
said, perhaps because of a fire in a national personnel records
facility in the St. Louis area.
</P>
<P>
   If records can be found documenting that Schick set foot in
France in World War I, he would be eligible to receive the Legion
of Honor from the government of France. French President Jacques
Chirac recently instituted a program to honor surviving members of
the U.S. armed forces who fought on French soil in World War I.

KC SOUTHERN STOCK CLIMBS ON DAY BEFORE SPINOFF OF FINANCIAL UNIT

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. saw its
stock price surge on its final trading day as a railroad and
financial services company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern closed Wednesday at $92.94 a share, up
$2.50 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in
the day, the stock reached a one-year high of $95.75 a share before
falling back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading Wednesday, Kansas City Southern's stock
climbed further to $93.75 a share. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Kansas City Southern's stock responded to merger
activity in the financial services sector and the pending spinoff
of its Stilwell Financial Inc. unit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boosting stocks of several asset management companies Wednesday
was news that UBS AG had bid to acquire PaineWebber Group Inc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the close of trading Wednesday, Kansas City Southern spun off
Stilwell Financial into a separately traded public company.
Stilwell, whose holdings include the fast-growing Janus Capital
Corp. mutual fund group, will begin trading regularly today on the
New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SV. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Landon H. Rowland, Kansas City Southern's chairman and
Stilwell's chairman and chief executive officer, is expected to
ring the bell to open trading on the stock exchange today. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern stockholders of record on June 28 are
receiving two shares of Stilwell for each Kansas City Southern
share. In addition, shares of Kansas City Southern are undergoing a
1-for-2 reverse split. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An investor who owned 100 shares of Kansas City Southern will
receive 200 Stilwell shares and 50 Kansas City Southern shares

DON'T FEAR HIRING THE DISABLED

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If Karen hadn't kept a diary of her job
search, she would have lost track of how often she was rejected or
simply never heard back after her initial interview. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karen's award-winning resume got her in the door, but she could
see in interviewers' eyes that she wouldn't get job offers. Why? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Karen has severe hearing loss, and what she saw in those eyes
was fear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Americans With Disabilities Act guarantees workers with
disabilities the right to ``reasonable accommodation'' to help them
perform the ``essential functions'' of their jobs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the law doesn't _ and can't _ mandate is attitude
readjustment to make employers less fearful of the costs of that
accommodation or less fearful of integrating workers with
disabilities into their work forces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After months of searching, Karen finally has a well-paying
position that fits her professional expertise. Her accommodation is
special telephone equipment; listeners have no idea she's using
it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week in Kansas City, the Association of Higher Education
and Disability is holding an international conference. The
organization's purpose is to increase participation in higher
education by people with disabilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In today's work world, higher education is a vital step toward
fuller work force participation. Without it, the much discussed
``digital divide'' will continue to be an employment barrier for
people with disabilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Coelho, chairman of the President's Committee on Employment
of People With Disabilities, is scheduled to speak Friday at the
conference. He's likely to sound what has been a common theme in
recent speeches: hiring trained (or trainable) people with
disabilities is good for the bottom line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more people with disabilities enter the workplace,
employers are seeing for themselves and hearing from others how
productive they can be. Prejudice crumbles in the face of
performance,'' Coelho said in a speech earlier this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fear fades, too, as more employers see that the costs of
accommodation are not prohibitive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The national Job Accommodation Network says only 3 percent of
employers spent more than $5,000 to provide work site
accommodations for employees' disabilities. Some accommodations
cost as little as $5. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In return, employers get employees who typically stay on the job
longer and get equal or better performance reviews than their
nondisabled peers, at least one long-running study at DuPont
found. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Higher education and high-tech training will improve the
employability of many peoples with disabilities. But there needs to
be a parallel push to educate and train nondisabled workers to work
with them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many people with severe disabilities may be ready, willing and
able to work. They will never succeed in the workplace, though, if
they can't get past the interview because someone is afraid of the
challenges, costs or communication difficulties their employment
might bring. &QL;

VETERAN CENTER VAN ALLEN SIGNS WITH STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The signing of center Shaun Van Allen, a versatile role player
the past four seasons for the Ottawa Senators, highlighted a busy
first day of activity on the free-agent market for the
bargain-hunting Stars yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Van Allen signed a two-year deal worth $1.1 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also signed goalie Rick Tabaracci to a two-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   And two players, 6-foot-5, 225-pound defenseman Sami Helenius,
as well as Stars minor-league goalie Mike Bales, who backed up
Marty Turco last season, signed one-year deals. Terms of the
contracts for all three players were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Van Allen, a goal scorer a decade ago during his minor-league
days, has developed his game over a nine-year career into that of a
dependable defensive forward with good skills.
</P>
<P>
   His experience and versatility in penalty-kill and man-down
situations with the Senators made him a good fit to fill holes on
the third and fourth lines left by Guy Carbonneau and Brian
Skrudland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He suits a style of player we are going to be in need of,''
Stars general manager Bob Gainey said of the 6-foot-1, 204-pound
veteran. ``He is a centerman whose strengths are on the defensive
side of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Allen, 32, posted 28 points last season, his finest
offensive numbers with the Senators. His nine goals were two shy of
his career high in 1994-95 for Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a defensive player first,'' Van Allen, a native of
Saskatchewan, said. ``I worry about my own end first and try to be
a consistent, physical force, take the body and play a simple
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Allen said his decision to sign with the Stars became an
easy one when the club informed him that they had located a school
for his autistic son to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is such a quality organization,'' Van Allen said.
``They've been first-class all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tabaracci, 31, might never wear a Stars uniform. A career
backup, Tabaracci earned $500,000 last season. He played in one
game for Atlanta and two for Colorado. He will challenge Turco to
back up Ed Belfour next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backup job is Turco's to lose,'' Gainey said.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said the Stars would send Tabaracci, who has played for
seven teams in 11 seasons, to the club's minor-league affiliate in
Salt Lake City if Turco maintains his edge, as expected. The Stars
needed goalie depth after losing Roman Turek and Manny Fernandez
the past two seasons in pre-expansion draft trades.
</P>
<P>
   Helenius, 26, played 33 games for Colorado last season, none in
the playoffs. In his two prior seasons with Calgary and Tampa Bay,
he never played more than eight games. Bales, who turns 29 on Aug.
6, will compete for the starting goalie job on the Stars'
minor-league squad.
</P>
<P>
   Gainey said he is in discussions with two other free-agent
forwards. The Stars also want to sign a defenseman. Unrestricted
free agent Dave Manson remains one possibility.

   KOSOVO-MEDIA (Pristina, Kosovo) _ The publication by an Albanian
newspaper of the name and photograph of a Serb accused by the daily
of crimes against Albanians, and his murder soon after, has stirred
passionate debate about press freedom. Afterwards, U.N. officials
shut down the Albanian-language newspaper, Dita, for eight days.
When Dita reappeared, it promptly reprinted the offending article.

to the pending invitation of the Japanese emperor to Seoul, which

   TURKEY-GAME (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Clouds of dust enveloped the
riders who galloped across a field, wooden spears in hand, on a
recent Sunday afternoon in this former capital of the Ottoman
Empire. When one rider came close enough to a competitor, he would
hurl his spear, hoping to score six points by hitting him. Forcing
an opponent's horse to veer off course counts for three points. A
rider who falls from his horse loses three points and the respect
of the crowd. This lightning-fast sport, called cirit and
pronounced jir-IT, is played only in Turkey. It is a throwback to
the days when Ottoman cavalrymen were among the world's most
fearsome warriors. After a long period of decline, it is enjoying a
rebirth of popularity. By Stephen Kinzer.

EDITORIAL: AN EVERGLADES ACTION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf to delete the word `world's')  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 13:
</P>
<P>
   Just before the July 4 recess, a Senate committee approved a
bill that, with some crucial adjustments, could provide the
framework for the most ambitious environmental restoration project
ever undertaken in the country. The stated purpose of the bill is
to restore the historic flows of fresh water that once made the
Everglades one of the most wondrous and biologically diverse
ecosystems in the world. It will cost $8 billion over 20 years,
shared by the federal government and Florida, and is the product of
seven years of work by the Army Corps of Engineers, the
environmental community and the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Its success so far in the Senate owes much to the two Florida
senators, Connie Mack and Bob Graham. But most of the credit
belongs to Bob Smith, a New Hampshire conservative whose
stewardship of the bill has put to rest fears that he would not be
as sympathetic to the Everglades as John Chafee, the reliable
environmentalist who preceded him as chairman of the Environment
and Public Works Committee and who died last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill is not a sure thing. What it needs now is a timely
and powerful legislative push to get it through an uncertain House
of Representatives and onto the president's desk before Washington
is overwhelmed by the election campaign. To leave the bill until
next year would be to commit it to the uncertain hands of a new
Congress and, quite possibly, a new administration far less
interested in conservation generally and the Everglades
specifically than this one.
</P>
<P>
   Congress owes the Everglades restitution. More than 50 years
ago, after back-to-back hurricanes that put much of South Florida
under water, Congress ordered the Army Corps to drain a
half-million acres south of Lake Okeechobee with a web of levees,
canals and pumping stations. The result was to keep Florida's
booming east coast free from floods and safe for development, and
to create conditions under which the sugar cane industry could
flourish. But it robbed the Everglades and Florida Bay of their
traditional sources of fresh water, and nearly killed both.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, with the Senate's help, wants to set
things right by recapturing and rerouting most of the 1.7 billion
gallons of water that are wastefully flushed out to sea every day
in the name of flood control. The bill specifically authorizes over
$1 billion for the first 10 of 68 planned projects. Much of this
money would be used to construct massive reservoirs to store
Florida's copious rainwater that, at least in theory, will be
delivered to the natural system through a redesigned network of
canals and levees.
</P>
<P>
   The bill needs clarification. From the beginning, the state and
the administration have quarreled over who should get most of the
newly captured water _ the natural system, Florida's exploding
cities, or agriculture. The administration has argued that nature,
having been shortchanged for half a century, deserves top billing _
otherwise, why embark on this project at all? Florida, where the
developers, the water utilities and sugar interests have great
political power, has insisted on doing what it wants to.
</P>
<P>
   The bill says at one point that restoration is its ``overarching
purpose.'' Elsewhere, however, it gives urban and agricultural
needs equal weight. This is first and foremost a restoration bill,
not a water supply bill for the cities and farms, and any
ambiguities on this point must be cleared up. The bill should also
provide a greater oversight role over the life of the project for
the Interior Department, which manages about half the land to be
restored.
</P>
<P>
   While making these fixes, the bill's supporters must also focus
on building political momentum in the House, where opponents will
try to create mischief. One person who could help move things
forward is Jeb Bush, Florida's governor. He has promised $200
million, Florida's share of the project's first-year costs. But he
has not shown the enthusiasm of his predecessor, Lawton Chiles, who
courageously blocked efforts by the agricultural interests to
exercise line-by-line veto power over the project through their
friends in the state legislature. A more vigorous public commitment
on his part would be welcome and might have real influence in the
House. At risk is an irreplaceable natural asset that happens to be
dying.

   GLENDALE, Calif. _ Some new retailers at the trendy Glendale
Galleria are hoping to lure cash-flush Generation Y shoppers into
The Zone.
</P>
<P>
   It's a case of the kids speaking and the mall opening its
checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   The Zone concept was created with input from a focus group of
146 Southern California teens.
</P>
<P>
   They helped persuade the mall owners to spend $2.5 million
creating what officials say is the nation's first entertainment,
dining and shopping venue designed specifically for people 6 to 21.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: ENETBOT ORGANIZES E-MAIL  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: America Online's e-mail filing system is terrible. You can't
sort messages by name, date or size. Is there any other e-mail
software that I could use for my AOL mail?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: By themselves, third-party e-mail programs can't work with
America Online because that company doesn't use the standard POP3
Internet protocol for mail. However, an outfit called eNetBot
offers a $19.95 program by the same name that acts as a bridge
between your e-mail software and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   It can be used to send and receive AOL mail from any popular
e-mail program, including Outlook, Outlook Express, Netscape and
Eudora. And those programs let you sort your messages any way you
like. You can download eNetBot at  &LR; www.enetbot.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Cache All the News
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a problem getting the updated page on a couple of Web
sites. I first visited the sites about six weeks ago, and I am
still getting the same pages when I go back now. My friends' pages
are updated every time. I'm worried that I may be getting old pages
from other sites as well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Browsers store permanent elements of Web pages the first time
you go to a site so that they'll load faster on subsequent visits.
But the dynamic elements, like news or sports scores, aren't
``cached'' this way.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear why the sites you mention don't get updated, but
you may be able to solve the problem by telling your browser to
check for new material every time it loads a page.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how: In Netscape Navigator, choose Preferences from the
Edit menu, then click the plus sign next to Advanced. In the
Advanced menu choose Cache, then click the option at the bottom
that tells the browser to compare the document in the cache to the
document on the network every time.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using Internet Explorer, choose Internet Options from
the Tools menu, then click Settings in the section on Temporary
Internet Files. In the Settings dialog box, choose the option for
checking newer versions of stored pages on every visit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Keep Internet Local
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought a new computer and signed on with Juno as
my Internet service provider. But when my telephone bill came, it
was a whopping $175. I could make monthly payments on a new car for
that kind of money. Is there an ISP out there that offers unlimited
access to the Internet for a fixed monthly fee? Or am I dreaming?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Juno does give you unlimited access, and it should cost you no
more than $9.95 a month. The problem isn't your ISP. It's your
phone number. You are obviously accessing Juno through a toll
number, not a free local number.
</P>
<P>
   Check with Juno to see if it has a local access number in your
area. And double-check with the phone company to make sure it's a
local number. If there is no local number, you'll have to switch to
an ISP that offers one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
2 Ways to Reformat
</P>
<P>
   Q: I need to reformat the hard drive on my Windows 98 computer.
What's the easiest way to do it?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: If your PC came with a ``recovery'' disc, you should be able to
use it to reformat your hard drive. In most cases the recovery
process also reinstalls Windows and all the software that was on
the computer when you bought it.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a recovery disc, it's a little more
complicated, but still doable. First, create a Windows Startup Disk
(a diskette that lets you start Windows in the event that you have
a problem starting it from your hard drive).
</P>
<P>
   Click the Start button, point to settings and choose Control
Panel. Double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon, then tab over to
Startup Disk and follow the instructions. Once you've done that,
use your new Startup Disk to restart the computer. When the A:
prompt appears, type in format c: /s. This will start a formatting
program, which will erase your hard drive, reformat it and make it
bootable.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that this procedure will only reformat
the drive _ it won't reinstall Windows. For that, you'll need a
Windows 98 CD. And you can't use an ``upgrade'' version because
there's nothing to upgrade. You'll need the full version, which
will cost you a little more than $200.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Bought a new PC lately? Many come with Microsoft Works, but if
you're looking for a better office suite, try downloading the free
StarOffice from Sun Microsystems ( &LR; www.sun.com &LR; ). Sun just released
version 5.2, and while it's not as robust as Microsoft Office, you
may find that its word processor, spreadsheet, database and
presentation program are all you need.

 BALLPARK UNITS PRICED TO MOVE  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For sale: the shortest commute in the city to
Pacific Bell Park _ first come, first served.
</P>
<P>
   Upscale condos at 1 Embarcadero South, right across the street
from the new baseball stadium, are now available for between
$700,000 and $2.3 million, the property's owner said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And in a rare twist for San Francisco, where bidding wars among
home buyers can send prices into orbit, Eikon Investments of Dallas
said each of the nearly 200 units available will go for list price.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no bidding wars, no auctions, no
see-how-high-we-can-jack-up-the-price schemes,'' said Zack
Davidson, Eikon's chief executive. ``It will be a civilized sales
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Civilized or not, luxury condos in San Francisco have been
getting snapped up almost as soon as they hit the market. Nearly
all the 142 units atop the still-unfinished Four Seasons Hotel on
Market Street _ some costing as much as $5 million _ were spoken
for within weeks of being offered.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective buyers at 1 Embarcadero South will want to move
quickly as well. Although the condos won't officially be up for
sale until September, reservations are now being accepted for
$5,000 per unit.
</P>
<P>
   80 Units Already Gone
</P>
<P>
   Davidson said 80 units already have been reserved, despite there
having been virtually no marketing to date, and he expects the
remainder to move quickly now that the project is being publicized.
</P>
<P>
   James Wiggs, a real estate broker with Pacific Union, said he
wouldn't be surprised if the condos at 88 King St. are bought up
almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very hot property,'' he said. ``Expensive, high-end
properties are going very fast south of Market.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these properties, Wiggs added, are being purchased by
``the cyber-generation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was surprised by the no-bidding-war aspect of the
sale. Luxury properties in San Francisco, Wiggs noted, frequently
go for as much as $1 million over the asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very unusual,'' he said. ``Maybe these guys should be
investigated for lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing offers pushed up the median condo price in the city
last month to $542,000, according to the San Francisco Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Eikon bought the property in April from San Diego's Urban West
Associated for $131 million. The 233 condos were completed earlier
this year and about two dozen tenants moved in prior to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Eikon is now completing the paperwork for putting the remaining
condos up for sale. Available facilities include 25 two-story
townhouses and a number of three-bedroom units.
</P>
<P>
   $2.3 Million View
</P>
<P>
   The top of the line is a $2.3 million, 1,360-square-foot unit on
the 14th floor of one of the complex's two towers. This condo
overlooks the yacht harbor, the Bay Bridge and even affords a few
glimpses of the downtown skyline.
</P>
<P>
   But the real selling point is its unique view of the ballpark.
From the condo's windows, tenants will look down on the giant Coke
bottle, the scoreboard and the left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to watch the Giants in action, though, forget it.
Far-sighted city planning officials stipulated three years ago,
when the project was still on the drawing board, that no condos
provide a view of the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since a phone number was posted recently outside the
building, prospective buyers have been rushing to book appointments
for viewings.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who view the condos make a reservation to buy
right there on the spot, said sales manager Randi Masotti.
``Actually,'' she said, ``we were caught unaware as to how popular
this location is.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents will be required to pay $700 in monthly fees.
Amenities include a pool, a Jacuzzi, a fitness club, high-speed
Internet lines and valet parking in an underground garage.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers will be able to move in as soon as their purchases close.
But if a buyer prefers slightly more upscale surroundings, an
in-house design crew will spiff up each unit to the owner's
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, the Eikon executive, said he is having no second
thoughts about the no-haggle sales policy, even though his company
could have vastly increased its profits by allowing market forces
to rule the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective was always to treat people fairly and make a
reasonable profit,'' he said. ``We're asking a certain price here,
and we're going to deliver it.''

 ROBOTIC SURGEON A CUT ABOVE  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sitting four feet away from his so-called
patient, Dr. Barry Gardiner deftly used his thumbs and forefingers
to guide two robot arms to thread a suture in place.
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner was operating on a slice of chicken breast Wednesday to
demonstrate the da Vinci Surgical System, a cutting-edge robotic
device that experts say could revolutionize surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first major advance in surgery since 1990,'' said
Gardiner, a San Ramon (Calif.) Regional Medical Center surgeon who
led the clinical trials of the da Vinci system.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Tuesday approved the
device, made by a Intuitive Surgical Inc. of Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, surgeons at Henrico Doctors Hospital in Richmond,
Va., used the da Vinci system to remove the gallbladder of
35-year-old Kimberly Briggs, who was wheeled into a news conference
less than four hours after her surgery was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' she told reporters, adding that the less
invasive procedure would allow her to be home in time for her son
Mario's sixth birthday party Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The San Ramon hospital is one of four in the United States and
thefirst on the West Coast to install the da Vinci, which the
hospital plans to start using in about three weeks. The
revolutionary device carries a hefty price tag of $900,000 plus
continuing costs of replacing custom designed surgical tools.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has approved the device for laparoscopic procedures such
as surgeries on gall bladders or gastroesophageal-reflux disease, a
severe heartburn problem.
</P>
<P>
   Both the da Vinci and a rival device called the Zeus Robotic
Surgical System from Computer Motion Inc. of Santa Barbara are
designed to give surgeons more-precise computer-aided movements
than they could achieve by hand when performing minimally invasive
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are seeking FDA approval for their devices to be
used in cardiac surgery, particularly in ``beating-heart''
procedures that allow the operation to go on without stopping the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of traditional surgery, which causes large incisions and
traumatizes the body, minimally invasive surgery has become popular
in the 1990s because it requires smaller body incisions that are
just large enough to insert thin tubes with surgical instruments
and optical devices.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that surgeons have only a limited amount of
movement possible when moving the tubes in and around the incision.
</P>
<P>
   But the da Vinci, named for the famed Italian artist-inventor,
attaches small, microchip-enabled surgical instruments to the ends
of two thin robotic arms. That technology gives the surgeon a
greater range of motion, as if the surgeon's hands were inside the
patient's body.
</P>
<P>
   The da Vinci has a third arm holding a camera that provides a
three-dimensional video display of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon sits at a console, slips his or her thumbs and
forefingers into the control rings and can move the robotic tools
in any direction using the 3-D video display and a series of foot
pedals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to replicate the movement a surgeon makes at the
console with the movement of the instrument tips inside the
patient,'' said Gardiner, who conducted tests of the da Vinci in
Mexico. ``This solves most of the problems caused when we went from
open surgery to laparoscopic surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   FDA Commissioner Jane Henney said in a statement that the da
Vinci ``could change the practice of surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   While the device has taken time to clear FDA regulatory hurdles
for commercial use in the United States, Intuitive has sold nine da
Vincis in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, where there is less regulation, surgeons have
already performed about 1,000 operations, including minimally
invasive cardiac surgeries, said Dr. Fred Moll, who co-founded
Intuitive in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Although the da Vinci model in San Ramon has the console and
robot arms in the same operating room, the technology could be used
to enable doctors to operate on patients in the next room or
thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The technology for the da Vinci is the result of research
originally funded by the Department of Defense, which wanted to
know if doctors some distance away could operate on wounded
soldiers on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The news of FDA approval sent the stock of Intuitive, which went
public in June, up $2.25 to $15 Wednesday on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is quite groundbreaking technology,'' said Dr.
Wade H. King, a medical technologies analyst for San Francisco's
Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   About 3.5 million minimally invasive procedures are performed
annually in this country. King said Intuitive has an edge over
rival Computer Motion in the growing $3 billion-per-year invasive
surgery market because the da Vinci can mimic the surgeon's wrist
movements, which are critical in microsurgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Intuitive system is light-years ahead,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer Motion filed a lawsuit against Intuitive in May,
claming the da Vinci's design infringed on eight patents. Computer
Motion Chief Executive Officer Bob Dugan said the contested patents
were part of 23 held by the company, although Intuitive's Moll said
he is confident his company will prevail in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Dugan also noted the FDA has put the Zeus Robotic Surgical
System on a faster track for approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both in an outstanding business with an incredible
future,'' Dugan said.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies, however, still must convince hospitals that the
high cost of their devices will be cost-effective in the long run,
said Brady R. Shirley, marketing director for Stryker Endoscopy
Inc., a San Jose company that designs operating rooms with
cutting-edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a daunting task in an era of rising medical costs.
But, Shirley said, ``this is probably the most exciting opportunity
in medicine right now.''

MEDIA BYTES: SITE CREATOR THROUGH SUCKING UP _ OFF TO NETWORK
IN  NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ So long, Sucksters.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Anuff, co-founder of the hip, irreverent Webzine Suck, has
moved to New York to help shepherd his site _ at long last _ into
the Internet big time. His co-founder, Carl Steadman, is no longer
involved but he said in an e-mail, ``I'm moving to the Hudson
Valley so I can pop in every so often and make a nuisance of
myself.'' (He may have been kidding, but it's hard to tell with
Steadman.)
</P>
<P>
   Although Suck was around before many other media sites even
thought of launching, it has stayed small. Anuff is one of only two
full-time staffers.
</P>
<P>
   uncx But now, after months of closed-door talks, a new venture _
Automatic Media _ was unveiled this week, with Suck, Feed Magazine,
and Alt.Culture forming the nucleus of a new Web network.
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't announced was the name of the network. It would have
been called Pop.com, but that bubble burst when Suck's erstwhile
parent, Lycos, sold that hot domain name to a new venture backed by
Hollywood directors Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand how Lycos even came to own Suck and Pop, and
where those media properties are headed, a little history is in
order.
</P>
<P>
   x It all started at HotWired, the groundbreaking online arm of
Wired magazine. Anuff and Steadman worked in the production
department at HotWired in 1995, but they weren't able to actually
write for the Web site. ``There was a great big psychological
Berlin Wall between the production department and the editorial
department,'' Anuff said the other day. ``We knew we could do
better than those schmucks any day of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   uncx So Anuff, in his first inspired moment, bought the Suck.com
domain name. ``We realized, if we called ourselves `Suck,' our
tagline could be, `We admit it,''' Anuff said.
</P>
<P>
   Other pioneering concepts followed. Suck was the first Web site
to put black type on a white page, Anuff said; remember HotWired's
garish neon colors? Suck also updated its content daily; it put the
content right on the front page, instead of forcing readers to wade
through a table of contents; it reviewed Web sites with a harshly
critical eye; and, most startlingly, it did it all anonymously,
with the writing done under pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   It was so anonymous that even the HotWired staff didn't know who
was behind it. Anuff recalled a ``bold, bilious moment when half
the office was reading Suck. We'd walk around and see it on
people's computers, and they didn't know we were doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few exhausting months, however, their cover was blown,
and they sold the company to Wired. ``We sold it for zero
dollars,'' Anuff said. ``It was an equity swap. We got equity in
pre-public Wired shares.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Wired tried _ twice _ to go public, but never got its
IPO off the ground. ``We made out like bandits,'' Anuff said.
``Incredibly stupid bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   (To be fair, when Wired magazine was sold to Conde Nast, and
later, when Wired Digital was sold to Lycos, Anuff and Steadman did
reap some financial gains. Steadman, in his e-mail, said, ``In the
end, I got an Audi TT out of the deal, with `MICRSTR' plates. Which
I promptly crashed.'')
</P>
<P>
   So Suck was part of Wired Digital, which last year became part
of Lycos. Meanwhile, Wired Digital stopped using Pop.com, which had
been its cultural site. Anuff knew the domain was a good one,
though, so when it was about to expire, he renewed it for Wired
Digital, paying for it with his own credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine his chagrin, then, when Spielberg came calling.
Spielberg's firm, DreamWorks SKG, and Howard's Imagine
Entertainment _ with backing from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen _
announced last fall that they acquired  &LR; www.pop.com &LR;  from Lycos for
an undisclosed sum. According to press releases on the site, they
plan to put short videos online, mostly comedy.
</P>
<P>
   But Anuff pressed on, and with the help of Lycos exec Bo
Peabody, he helped hatch the plan for Automatic Media. Automatic
Media launches with $4 million in backing and a chief executive
officer, Lee deBoer, who is a 20-year veteran of Home Box Office.
</P>
<P>
   Automatic Media has already acquired a domain name for its
forthcoming online network, but no one will say what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Anuff, who will be a vice president of the network, said it will
use new technology to create ``the next generation of content
environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great. But then again, it sounds like just the sort of
thing Anuff and Steadman would have mercilessly mocked several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   LIMBO STOCK: How low can it go? Salon.com's share price is
heading for dangerous territory. It slid as low as $1.13 this week,
perilously close to the sub-$1 level. (Wednesday it rebounded
slightly, closing up 13 cents to $1.25.)
</P>
<P>
   It's dangerous, because if the stock dips below $1 _ and stays
there for 30 business days _ the company could find Nasdaq moving
to delist it.
</P>
<P>
   CEO Michael O'Donnell remains confident that's not going to
happen, figuring that sooner or later, Wall Street will notice a
spate of what he called good news. That includes its biggest ad
sale ever, to Ask Jeeves, for an undisclosed amount; the hiring of
Steve Reed as senior vice president of sales; and a forthcoming
announcement on the hiring of a chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, O'Donnell said, he's laying low. He has turned
down about 25 interviews in recent weeks, including one with Dan
Rather. (Other media want to ``make Salon the poster child for the
dot-com demise,'' O'Donnell said.)
</P>
<P>
   He focuses on the business, not the stock. ``I've gotten to the
point where I'm not even looking at the stock on a daily basis,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in looking at the business, O'Donnell is pushing for
profitability, because that's what Wall Street seems to want now.
When Salon went public last year, it said it did not plan to reach
profitability for two to three years. But O'Donnell now aims to
turn a profit in the next 12 months. ``We're focusing on how we can
get profitable without cutting to the bone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll just keep taking his lumps. He figures
Salon has it coming: After all, Salon's journalists don't pull
punches in their writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You throw stones,'' O'Donnell said, ``you've got to be
prepared to take a few.''
</P>
<P>

 ORACLE'S LANE SAYS, `I JUST DIDN'T FIT'  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After an hourlong phone conversation on June 30
with Larry Ellison, Oracle Corp.'s mercurial chief executive, Ray
Lane saw the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   And it didn't include him.
</P>
<P>
   While Lane, 53, Oracle's president and chief operating officer,
was on vacation with his two daughters in Oregon, Ellison called
him and essentially stripped him of most of his duties _ from the
departments that reported to him to the deals that Lane usually
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, who has dramatically increased his role in the Redwood
Shores company's day-to-day operations in the past year, would
extend his control to the approval of ``every PC the company
bought, to every person the company hired'' under the new plan,
Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   So Lane resigned, fueling speculation of a rift with Ellison or
a tie-in to the now-infamous Microsoft-related Dumpster diving.
</P>
<P>
   But Lane, in his first interview since his resignation, told The
Chronicle that neither was the case. Lane said it was his decision
to leave, and he holds no bitterness toward the database software
company that helped make him a billionaire. ``I just didn't fit''
within Ellison's new hierarchy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he conceded that the split ``wasn't amicable'' and
``doesn't sit well. I think the president (of a company) should
make decisions. I think the CFO should make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a CEO micromanage every decision at a
company,'' Lane added. ``It's strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Still stranger was the timing of Oracle's announcement of Lane's
resignation before the July 4 holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company gave Lane and four other executives hefty
bonuses to keep them with the company. Lane, rumored to be flirting
with posts at Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, received salary and
bonuses totaling $3.3 million _ 10 times more than he made the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, though Lane's retirement was rumored for several
months, the terse, two-line announcement released on the evening of
June 30 seemed hasty and didn't give any reason for the
resignation. And it occurred days after Ellison confirmed that
Oracle hired investigators to dig into possible financial links
between Microsoft and groups that support Microsoft's fight against
the Department of Justice's antitrust case against it.
</P>
<P>
   Both Oracle and Lane, who said he didn't know about the
investigation until he read several newspaper accounts, said there
was no connection between the espionage efforts and his departure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lane said the abrupt nature of the news release was
corporate protocol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my decision, (Ellison) accepted it, and when you have a
material change at a company you have to send out a press
release,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To others, the alacrity of the decision signaled Ellison's
desire to effect a major, but quick, shakeup. It wouldn't be the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, the self-made billionaire known for his flashy clothes
and daredevil sailing, has been on a rampage of sorts lately. Along
with shifting more responsibility onto his own plate, he's
streamlined the company's workforce and cut Oracle's operating
costs by $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics appear to be working. Excluding investment income,
Oracle earned $926 million in the fourth quarter ended June 20, up
76 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison is ``the transformer, the samurai warrior,'' said Marc
Benioff, a former Oracle executive who founded Salesforce.com a
year ago. ``He's a very aggressive guy and if he thinks Oracle's at
risk and not as strong, he makes a change.''
</P>
<P>
   One source close to Oracle said Ellison ``wanted Ray out of
there'' and is now trying to smooth things over by offering Lane
additional money.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said ``there is no separation agreement or money on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Benioff, who recently removed Ellison from Salesforce.com's
board because the firm is developing products that compete with
Oracle, speculates that Ellison and Lane wanted to take the company
in divergent directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is trying to plan Oracle's future around taking
(Oracle's software) and making it online services,'' he said.
``Ray's skills are much more that he's a strong relationship
builder and strong at running a sales and consulting force.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison and several other board members didn't return calls and
e-mails seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lane denies that any major disagreement preceded his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he understands Ellison's motivations for wanting to
exert more influence over the firm during what he describes as a
pivotal point in Oracle's evolution. And Lane says he believes
Oracle will continue to be a ``great, successful'' company under
Ellison's watch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some investors appear worried that Lane _ who many
saw as Oracle's ballast _ would no longer balance out Ellison's
brash promises to the market and media. The company's stock dipped
nearly 10 percent on the first two days of full trading following
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minus to take out such a capable executive and Wall
Street wasn't pleased,'' said Bob Austrian, an analyst at Bank of
America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a former Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton executive who came to
Oracle eight years ago, was also credited with adding integrity to
Oracle and building strong relationships with customers at a time
when the company was known for its aggressive sales tactics and
efforts to boost market share at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``He coined the term the `Old Oracle,' '' Benioff said. ``Ray
took the cowboys off their horses and said, `We're going to play
fair.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some wonder whether the company will revert to its former self.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oracle's going to become what Larry wants it to, and the fear
is that it will become what it was, an art-of-war company that's
not as focused on customers' success as it is winning,'' said
Terilyn Palanca, an analyst at Giga Information Group, a research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   However, some say Ellison's leadership is just what the company
needs as it works to tailor its software to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, Larry is delivering on what Oracle
needs most _ vision, e-business software _ and there's less focus
on execution and operations areas where Ray has been helpful,''
Palanca said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, who says he is relishing additional time with his family
and pursuing a part-time venture capital career, believes Ellison
could make Oracle more profitable in the short term with his
immediate focus on cutting costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison may also better steer the company toward overtaking
arch-nemesis Microsoft as the No. 1 software company in the world _
a goal Ellison hasn't been shy about promoting. Oracle is No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Internet and Microsoft's problems, (Larry) saw it as
an opportunity to drive all the decisions in the company, and it
began giving me reason to say, `Why am I here?' '' Lane said.
``There needs to be one boss, one decisionmaker. There's no
question that at Oracle, that's Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lane isn't sure how long that can last.
</P>
<P>
   ``During times of great change, I think one person can make all
the decisions ... we'll have to see in two or three years if that's
still the case (at Oracle),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making a lot of decisions based on profitability and
that's good now. Over the long haul, you have to fuel revenue
growth and people development.''
