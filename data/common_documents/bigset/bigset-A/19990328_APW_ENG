<HEADLINE> Milwaukee Area Landmark Demolished </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLENDALE, Wis. (AP) -- Spectators laughed when a second attempt  
to demolish a Milwaukee area landmark, the former Schlitz Brewing 
Co. grain elevator, seemed to fail. 
</P>
<P>
	After the blast of explosives, the structure stood in place for  
several seconds Sunday before finally toppling in a cloud of smoke 
and dust, to cheers from the onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a first attempt Saturday, workers set off a 245-pound charge  
of dynamite but the white structure that stood about 25 stories 
tall never fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Maslowski, the Glendale city administrator, said a  
structural analysis showed that an elevator and staircase had been 
holding the building up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They underestimated the strength of the building,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Maslowski said the structure, built in 1953, was made of  
concrete and reinforced steel with walls up to a foot thick. The 
columns also were woven with steel, producing a very solid 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the old German heritage that when you build  
things, you build things to last,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's blast targeted the parts that were keeping the building  
standing, and it took a few seconds for gravity to take over and 
the structure to break loose and start coming down, workers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The city bought the structure in 1997 to make way for an office  
park.

<HEADLINE> Blackout at Boston Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A manhole fire in East Boston caused a temporary  
blackout at Logan International Airport on Sunday night and left 
hundreds of nearby residents without power. 
</P>
<P>
	The outage did not affect runway lights or air traffic, but  
caused some delays in boarding flights, MassPort spokesman Phil 
Orlandella said. 
</P>
<P>
	The manhole exploded in East Boston shortly before 9 p.m.,  
cutting power to the airport's terminals and a six-block area near 
the manhole. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup systems restored power within minutes to all but one of  
the airport's terminals, Orlandella said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people had to be temporarily evacuated from Terminal E  
-- Logan's international terminal -- when backup systems failed to 
come online, he said.

<HEADLINE> Korean Pitcher Joins D-Backs Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks sure know how to  
make South Korean pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a 13-hour flight from South Korea, Kim joined his new  
team for the first time Sunday and was surprised when he was paired 
with idol Randy Johnson for a game of catch. The right-hander also 
had a meet-and-greet session with his new teammates, donned his new 
uniform -- No. 77 -- and took in a few innings of Arizona's game 
against the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very pleased to be here and meet all the great players he  
was watching on TV,'' said Min-Soo Kim, a Diamondbacks scout who 
will be Kim's interpreter. ``Actually, he was shocked to see all 
the big-leaguers here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who struck out 15 in 6 1-3 innings playing for South Korea  
against a U.S. national team last year here, agreed to terms with 
the Diamondbacks on Feb. 19, but it took him until now to get all 
the paperwork completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very happy about being here. He was waiting for his visa  
long enough,'' Min-Soo Kim said as Kim grinned and nodded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim helped South Korea to the finals of last year's World  
Championships in Italy, giving up one earned run in five innings 
against Cuba, and he struck out 12 in six perfect innings against 
China in the semifinals of last year's Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old has dreamed about playing in the United States  
since his friend, Jin Ho Cho, signed with the Boston Red Sox. Kim 
visited Cho once about four years ago, and was impressed with the 
facilities U.S. major-league teams have. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since then, he wanted to come here and play real baseball,''  
Min-Soo Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said several teams were interested in him, but he wanted to  
play for the Diamondbacks. He already was familiar with Arizona 
after pitching against Team USA here last year, and since he played 
so well, had good memories of it. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the Diamondbacks' secret weapon.  
</P>
<P>
	``He liked Randy Johnson,'' Min-Soo Kim said. ``And since we're  
a young club, he'll get a better chance to get to the big leagues 
here. So he thought it might be a better deal for him to come 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim's goal is to be on the Diamondbacks roster next year. He'll  
likely start the season at Class A High Desert or Double-A El Paso, 
but manager Buck Showalter said he'll have a better idea of where 
to put him after Kim throws in the bullpen after Arizona's game 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said he knows this is a huge adjustment for Kim, and  
he and the team will do whatever they can to make things easy on 
him. Asked what his biggest adjustment will be, Kim pantomimed 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``English,'' Min-Soo Kim said as Kim nodded.  
</P>
<P>
	No problem, fellow pitcher Todd Stottlemyre said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be his English teacher,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to baseball, though, Showalter said Kim won't have  
any trouble settling in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fingers are fingers. One, two is pretty universal,'' he said,  
referring to catcher signs. ``We'll make adjustments to him instead 
of making him adjust for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is guaranteed $2.4 million his four-year contract with the  
Diamondbacks. He gets a $2.25 million signing bonus and is 
guaranteed yearly salaries of at least $38,100, the minor league 
minimum for players who have been on 40-man rosters for more than 
one season. The total guarantee in the deal, which was agreed to 
last month, comes to $2,402,400.

<HEADLINE> Bocelli: I'm Not Ready for Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Is tenor Andrea Bocelli ready for the opera?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel I'm really credible enough yet,'' the Italian  
singer says. ``I still have to suffer a little while longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bocelli's silky ballads have sold 20 million records worldwide  
and have earned a Grammy nomination. Last week, he sang with a duet 
with Celine Dion at the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	In fall, Bocelli is scheduled to step from the confines of pop  
to make his U.S. opera debut at Detroit's Michigan Opera Theater, 
singing the title role in Massenet's ``Werther.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an opportunity he credits to his commercial success.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was younger, if I had shown up to audition in an opera  
house, they would have suggested I check into a lunatic asylum,'' 
he says in Sunday's editions of Newsday. 
</P>
<P>
	If opera proves a comfortable fit, Bocelli says he wouldn't mind  
forsaking his pop career for the fine art.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Cells Could Change Power Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Thirty years from now, millions of  
American homes and businesses may get their electricity from small 
on-site generators that create no pollution and require no power 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells -- electrochemical generators now used to run  
spacecraft -- could revolutionize the way homeowners get their 
power, especially in remote areas, backers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fuel cells have the potential to change the way we look at  
electricity in fundamental ways,'' said Bob Rose of the U.S. Fuel 
Cell Council, a Washington, D.C.-based trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Think of it: Instead of depending on the grid for power, you  
can make your own and use the grid as a backup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is enormous potential for residential fuel cells  
worldwide, said Peter Bos, director of the Fuel Cell 
Commercialization Group, a San Mateo, Calif., consortium of U.S. 
and Canadian utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	High initial manufacturing costs and relatively short operating  
lives have been the major obstacles to widespread use of fuel 
cells, a non-polluting means of generating power. 
</P>
<P>
	As unit costs come down and quality improves, electricity  
produced by fuel cells will be available for the same price -- or 
less -- than that supplied by utilities through traditional 
transmission lines, Bos says. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a choice of a small, independent source of  
electricity, guess which one you will choose?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Residential and small-business sales could reach $50 billion a  
year in the United States by 2030, Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few companies nationwide are involved in research and  
development of commercial residential fuel cells, but the field is 
growing monthly, Bos and Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike batteries, which consume themselves, fuel cells are  
almost endlessly rechargeable as long as there is a fuel source to 
provide hydrogen, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells consist of two electrodes sandwiched around an  
electrolyte. Oxygen from air passes over one electrode and hydrogen 
over the other in an electrochemical reaction that produces 
electricity, water and heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells have been around since 1839, but it wasn't until the  
1950s and 1960s that scientists began using the technology to 
provide a primary electrical power source for space craft. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to  
develop fuel-cell powered cars that would enable them to comply 
with California's standard of zero emissions by 2003 for 10 percent 
of cars sold in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, DaimlerChrysler unveiled a fuel-cell powered  
car that would seat five passengers. Other automakers working on 
fuel-cell models include Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and 
Honda Motor Co. 
</P>
<P>
	There are five basic types of fuel cells, each using a different  
chemical medium used to produce an electrical current. Only a 
handful of companies are involved in residential fuel cell research 
and development. International Fuel Cells of Danbury, Conn., was 
the first to produce a commercial model, which uses phosphoric 
acid. 
</P>
<P>
	In Spokane, Avista Labs, an affiliate of the Spokane-based  
energy services company Avista Corp., plans to begin field trials 
in June of its own version, called a proton exchange membrane, or 
PEM, generator. The PEM cells -- one would fit in a shoebox -- use a 
thin polymer membrane that reacts with hydrogen to form electrical 
currents between two electrodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacked into a space the size of a refrigerator, racks of PEM  
fuel cells can supply all the electricity an average home needs, 
Avista Labs president Kim Zentz said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fuel cells represent a technology that has been around a long  
time, are well proven, with environmental benefits,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Avista is working on developing a fuel processor that can  
convert natural gas, propane or other fossil fuels into hydrogen, 
Zentz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Field trials will determine the average annual cost of fuel to  
operate the fuel cells, but it is anticipated that most homeowners 
would probably spend about the same, or less, for power, Zentz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity from home fuel cells should be 20 percent more  
efficient than that produced by a large natural gas turbine plant 
and delivered through transmission lines, Zentz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supplying power to remote, off-the-grid areas in the United  
States holds immense promise, Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Sierra Pacific Power -- a utility in Nevada and  
northern California -- recently concluded that as many as 50,000 of 
its potential customers live in remote areas not served by costly 
power lines, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in areas already served by power lines, fuel cells could be  
used as backup in power outages, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential U.S. market could be 140 million homes by 2030,  
Bos said. That would include new construction at remote sites and 
retrofitting of existing homes, because costs of 
fuel-cell-generated electricity would be competitive by then, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deregulation of the electrical-power industry is driving the new  
interest in small-scale fuel-cell development, Zentz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Customers are demanding more choice and more freedom of choice  
that may not have been there 20 or 30 years ago,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It might seem odd that a regional electricity and natural-gas  
utility is pushing a device that eventually could replace 
traditional transmission lines and monthly billings. 
</P>
<P>
	But Avista, formerly the Washington Water Power Co., is taking a  
global perspective. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are almost 2 billion people in the world currently not  
served by any utility,'' Zentz notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Avista is looking for a partner in the consumer-products field  
to help produce and market the device -- preferably someone in the 
heating, ventilating and air conditioning industry, Zentz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very special thing to take a scientific approach and  
move it across that last mile of commercialization,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  Christians Mark Palm Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Retracing Jesus' final steps into Jerusalem  
nearly 2,000 years ago, Christian pilgrims from around the world 
sang hymns and hiked on Palm Sunday from the Mount of Olives to the 
Old City of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of pilgrims walked down the ancient hillside, carrying  
palm branches of every size and shape. Young people waved 
six-foot-high branches while others had more modest palm sprigs 
tucked in their camera bags for the hour-long walk across the 
historical landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm Sunday marks Jesus's entrance into Jerusalem on a white  
donkey on the Sunday before his crucifixion, when his followers 
laid palm branches in his path. The day begins Christianity's most 
solemn period, the week that ends with Easter next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an incredible experience to be here in Jerusalem now,''  
said Heidi Vogeler, 20, of Salt Lake City, who surveyed the valley 
dotted with green vegetation and stone houses hugging the 
hillsides. Vogeler was with a group of 60 other students from a 
Mormon study center. 
</P>
<P>
	The hike, led each year by Christian Palestinian children in  
scout uniforms, began at the Church of the Ascension, where Jesus 
started his last journey to the gates of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Syverson, from a St. Paul, Minn. church group, watched the  
procession go by and said he was glad to be here this year, rather 
than on the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the year 2000 is a good year not to come,'' laughed  
the white-haired, slender Syverson, who wondered how there would be 
room for the millions of tourists expected to make the pilgrimage 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah, the highest representative of the  
Roman Catholic church in Jerusalem, celebrated Palm Sunday Mass at 
the Church of the Holy Sepulcher where Jesus was buried. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, worshippers turned and wished each other ``peace''  
in at least seven different languages. 
</P>
<P>
	They came from all over the world -- the Holy Land, North  
America, Europe and the Far East -- and stood shoulder to shoulder 
in front of the tall, ornate wooden structure at the church that 
represents the tomb of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no pews in the 4th century church built on the  
traditional site of Calvary, where Jesus took his last steps before 
crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
	With a big smile, John Goode from Dublin, Ireland, wished peace  
to everyone around him. ``To be here at this time is very relevant 
and really significant for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As he spoke, a procession of Syrian Orthodox priests passed in  
front of him. The church is holy to many Christian denominations. 
Each has its own services there, following its own calendar.

	Figgs doesn't consider the nap a good-luck ritual, but some of  
the other Boilermakers do. When she was unable to take a nap before 
a game against Ohio State in the recent Big Ten tournament, some 
teammates were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not superstitious, but a lot of my teammates are, so they  
were worried about that,'' said Figgs, who calmed their fears by 
scoring 21 points and handing out five assists in a 72-59 win over 
the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	While McCarty-White loads her body with sugar and caffeine, the  
Duke Blue Devils play games with empty stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team eats five hours before games,'' Duke point guard  
Hilary Howard said. ``It took some getting used to. I used to get 
hungry in the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SORORITY SISTER:* Duke point guard Hilary Howard is the first  
Blue Devils player to belong to a sorority, and that leads to 
endless ribbing from her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma, which teammate Michele  
VanGorp jokingly refers to as Visa Visa Mastercard sorority, and 
has been receiving e-mails of encouragement from sorority sisters 
back at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	One such e-mail said, ``We're so proud you're our sister.''  
</P>
<P>
	None of the Purdue players belongs to a sorority.  
</P>
<P>
	``We call our team our sorority,'' center Camille Cooper said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FLYING HIGH:* Purdue shooting guard Stephanie White-McCarty  
enjoys flying as much as she likes basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally an aviation major, White-McCarty said flying relaxes  
her. But it doesn't do the same for her husband, Brent. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first times she took him up in a plane, she practiced  
a flying maneuver called a ``stall,'' where the plane climbs at 
such a steep angle it seems as though the engine has stalled. Brent 
wasn't amused. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still married me,'' she said with a smile.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SWITCHING COACHES:* Before this season, Duke coach Gail  
Goestenkors switched the assignments of her assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Gale Valley, who had spent the previous few years working with  
the guards, now works with the post players. Joanne Boyle switched 
from post players to the guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors said she made the switch to prepare her assistants  
for head coaching jobs, but also to shake up a team that returned 
six seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	``My biggest concern with this team after last year was  
complacency, and my biggest concern with my staff was 
complacency,'' she said. ``I felt if I could change the 
responsibilities of the staff it would make them more hungry and a 
little on edge because they had to focus on another area of the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors also thought it would be good for the players to be  
exposed to a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was great,'' senior point guard Hilary Howard said.  
``We were used to doing the same things. It got us refreshed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior shooting guard Nicole Erickson also thinks the move was  
good in the long run, but found it difficult to make the switch at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little hard for us to adjust,'' she said. ``We were  
used to hearing things in a different way.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HILARY'S NICKNAME:* Duke point guard Hilary Howard is  
embarrassed when asked why teammates, teachers and friends call her 
``Hibby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was little, my mom said I needed to take a nap and I  
guess I couldn't pronounce Hilary, so I said: `Hibby doesn't,' '' 
she said. ``Now I'm 22 and it's stuck to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard is not the only Blue Devils player with a nickname. For  
the Final Four, the Duke players made up monikers for each other. 
Shooting guard Nicole Erickson is ``Bullseye'' and center Michele 
VanGorp is ``The Lanemaster.''

<HEADLINE> Kilborn Takes Over CBS Talk Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Talk show host Craig Kilborn may be a smart  
aleck with ``the greatest hair in television'' but he's certainly 
not arrogant, his former college basketball coach says. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilborn, a 1984 Montana State graduate, takes over ``The Late,  
Late Show with Craig Kilborn'' on Tuesday. Tom Snyder's final 
broadcast was Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of many promotional spots for his show, Kilborn says he  
played Division I basketball at Montana State in Bozeman until his 
senior year, when his coach told him he was too selfish and 
arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I have my own talk show on CBS,'' he says in the ad.  
</P>
<P>
	But his former coach, Stu Starner, says he never thought of  
Kilborn as arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a line,'' he said. ``He was a neat guy. We chuckle when  
we see that because Craig was just a solid guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starner recalled that Kilborn's ``was not overly gifted  
physically.'' But 15 years later, he said, ``look who's on top of 
the world.''

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Church on Palm Sunday </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
	ASPINWALL, Pa. (AP) -- Fire gutted a turn-of-the-century red  
brick church hours after final Palm Sunday services were conducted, 
leaving a charred shell in the midst of a quiet residential 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aspinwall Presbyterian Church is a total loss, Aspinwall  
Fire Chief Lee Albacker said Sunday night. The blaze destroyed the 
roof and blackened the inside and front of the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was baptized here. I was married here. This is very hard.  
It's like losing part of your life,'' said Anne Wyant, 46, a 
lifelong church member. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyant, who had skipped Sunday services, rushed to the scene when  
she heard about the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Albacker said that it was too early to speculate on a cause.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Boeh, an investigator with the federal Bureau of Alcohol,  
Tobacco and Firearms, also was at the scene Sunday night. He said 
the ATF likely would not be able to go through the church until 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire quickly spread thick smoke over Aspinwall, a bedroom  
community of about 3,200 people along the Allegheny River just 
north of Pittsburgh. The blaze was contained by 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Palm Sunday marks Jesus' entrance into Jerusalem the Sunday  
before his crucifixion, when his followers laid palm branches in 
his path. The day begins Christianity's most solemn period, the 
week that ends with Easter Sunday.

</P>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Roy M. Fisher, former dean of the  
University of Missouri School of Journalism and former editor in 
chief of the old Chicago Daily News, has died. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, who died Thursday in Evanston, Ill., was a journalism  
graduate of Kansas State University. He worked at the Hastings 
(Neb.) Tribune and was city editor of the Pratt (Kan.) Daily 
Tribune before joining the Navy in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Chicago Daily News as a reporter after the war,  
later becoming city editor and assistant managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Fisher's leadership from December 1965 until January 1971,  
the Daily News won several awards, including a 1969 Pulitzer for 
articles exposing a conflict of interest in the stock holdings of 
one of President Richard Nixon's Supreme Court nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the paper during the turbulent era of the civil rights  
movement, the 1968 Democratic Convention and the Chicago Seven 
trial. He also brought national attention to the Daily News by 
giving columnist Mike Royko prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher left the Daily News in 1971 to become journalism dean at  
the University of Missouri's main campus in Columbia, a job he held 
until 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	He moved to Washington to run the university's graduate  
reporting program, retired in 1989 and moved back to the Chicago 
area with his wife, Anne. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his wife, he is survived by four daughters, two brothers  
and a sister.

the Catholic community by adding a bar and grill to his church, 
died Saturday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	McCallin stirred controversy in 1975 when he opened a restaurant  
and bar at St. Thomas More Church in Arapahoe County. Critics 
called it the ``Catholic country club,'' but McCallin reasoned that 
``Christ loved to eat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parishioners protested to no avail when McCallin was forced by

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Rep. Going To China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky  
left on short notice today to join negotiations under way in 
Beijing on China's bid to enter the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. trade official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
cautioned against speculating that Barshefsky's last-minute 
decision to fly to Beijing meant that the negotiations were close 
to being wrapped up, saying ``substantial gaps remain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't envision this trip will result in a final package,''  
the official said. ``Rather, it is to work on remaining differences 
and maintain momentum towards creation of a commercially viable 
package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. negotiators have reported several breakthroughs in recent  
weeks as China has put better market-opening offers on the table in 
hopes of winning agreement before an April 8 trip to the United 
States by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
	China has sought membership in the WTO or its predecessor trade  
body for the past 13 years. But to gain entry it must satisfy 
demands by large trading partners such as the United States that it 
has done enough to lower trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has long complained that a good part of its  
trade deficit with China, which last year hit a record $57 billion, 
results from unfair barriers to sales of U.S. manufactured goods, 
farm products and services such as banking and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky will be the second member of President Clinton's  
Cabinet to be in China this week. Commerce Secretary William Daley 
and 18 top U.S. business executives arrived on Sunday for five days 
of talks which they hope will result in sales contracts for 
American goods. 
</P>
<P>
	All the activity is occurring at a time of strained relations  
between the two nations over allegations about Chinese espionage of 
American nuclear secrets and growing unhappiness over China's human 
rights record.

<HEADLINE> UAW Chief: Still Problems With GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Despite months of labor peace since last summer's  
devastating strikes, United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich 
said Sunday that ``we still have our problems'' with General Motors 
Corp. and hinted at another showdown when national contract talks 
begin later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech kicking off the union's triennial bargaining  
convention, Yokich said job security would again be the UAW's 
priority when it begins contract talks in June with GM, Ford Motor 
Co. and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG. The national 
contracts cover about 396,000 U.S. workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich reserved his toughest criticism for GM, suggesting to  
about 2,000 union delegates that little if anything had improved in 
UAW-GM relations since last year's costly battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes at two parts plants in Flint brought the world's  
largest automaker to a virtual halt in North America. They lasted 
several weeks and cost the company about $2 billion while they 
idled nearly 200,000 GM workers and thousands of employees at 
independent suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute was largely over job security and ``outsourcing,''  
the practice of contracting in-house work to outside suppliers who 
generally pay less and typically are nonunion. GM, which once made 
most of its parts, is moving toward becoming largely a designer and 
assembler of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the strikes, GM has announced plans to convert its aging  
U.S. small-car plants to so-called ``modular'' assembly to make 
them more efficient. The UAW describes it as a threat to union 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under modular assembly, outside suppliers preassemble parts such  
as an entire dashboard and deliver them to a plant, where they are 
installed on the chassis. Far fewer UAW workers would be needed to 
assemble each car, significantly reducing manufacturing costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing new about modular assembly,'' Yokich said.  
``It's just another word for ... outsourcing. It's just another way 
to destroy good-paying jobs and benefits, that we intend to deal 
with in this round of negotiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW argues that modular assembly will give the automaker  
less control over design and quality, increase logistical 
complexity and potentially add to warranty costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich also bristled at suggestions that GM loses money on its  
small cars because of its labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They claim they lose $1,000 on every small car they build  
themselves. It's funny, their competitors -- Ford and Chrysler -- 
never lose anything on their small cars. So is it our fault or 
their fault in how they run their plants? It certainly isn't our 
fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich chastised GM for failing to consult with the UAW before  
it decided to spin off its big parts unit. GM had an initial public 
offering of nearly 18 percent of Delphi Automotive Systems stock 
earlier this year and plans to spin off the rest of the company to 
GM shareholders by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The move has scared Delphi workers and retirees, said Yokich,  
who implied that the spinoff was being conducted with little, if 
any, consultation with UAW leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said the company would have no  
comment on Yokich's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich also said Mercedes-Benz, the German luxury car unit of  
DaimlerChrysler that operates a nonunion assembly plant in Alabama, 
should be under the UAW contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran union leader had no criticism of Ford, which has the  
best relationship with the UAW among the three automakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Yokich said the union will begin bargaining with the company  
that presents the best initial proposal. In 1996, the UAW 
negotiated first with Ford and used that deal as a pattern for 
pacts with Chrysler and GM. The current three-year contracts expire 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW gained more workers than it lost in 1998, the first time  
that has happened since 1989, Yokich said. Much of the gain, 
however, has come in businesses outside the auto industry, such as 
health care and government.

<HEADLINE> Mourners Pay Respects to Ripken Sr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, Md. (AP) -- Members of the Ripken family greeted  
mourners Sunday as they paid their respects to Cal Ripken Sr., the 
father of future Hall of Famer Cal Ripken Jr. and long time member 
of the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 people attended the first day of a two-day viewing  
at the Tarring Cargo funeral home. Inside, they were greeted by 
Ripken Sr.'s wife Vi, his sons Cal Jr. and Bill, and his daughter 
Ellen. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr.'s death prevented Cal Ripken Jr. from participating  
in the historic game Sunday between the Orioles and the Cuban 
national team, which the Orioles won 3-2 in 11 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The room was full of floral arrangements and mementos of Cal  
Ripken Sr.'s life, including a wedding photograph, family photos 
and pictures taken during his 36-year career as a minor league 
ballplayer and major league coach and manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken Sr. died Thursday of lung cancer at age 63. He will be  
buried Tuesday in a private ceremony at the Grace United Methodist 
Church in Aberdeen. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, D-Md., was escorted by police into a  
private entrance. After meeting with the Ripken family, she 
remembered the contributions Ripken Sr. made to baseball and the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cal will be remembered for what he instilled in his family, in  
Baltimore and in all of us,'' said Mikulski. ``Work hard, show up 
every day and always give it everything you've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most who came to say good-bye were fans and admirers of Ripken  
Sr. and his family. Tony Nemec, who drove from Baltimore with his 
stepson Brian, said the values Ripken Sr. lived in his life were 
passed on to his children. 
</P>
<P>
	``His kids are just like him -- down to earth, not phony. They're  
real, honest people,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Expands Attacks on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American and allied air armada broadened  
its attacks on Yugoslavia on Sunday to target Serb military forces 
in Kosovo, raising the risk to NATO pilots but also holding the 
promise of more effective airstrikes. President Clinton said ``the 
continued brutality and repression of the Serb forces further 
underscores the need for NATO to persevere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon and NATO were officially mum on what brought down  
an Air Force F-117A stealth fighter-bomber near the Yugoslav 
capital on Saturday. A senior defense official, however, said there 
are strong indications it was hit by a surface-to-air missile, 
possibly the Soviet-made SA-3 air defense missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was  
no reported mechanical problem but an explosion was heard. NATO 
officials, without referring to the F-117A, said SA-3 missiles were 
fired Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, Clinton met with his top national security  
aides and said he had talked with leaders of several NATO allies, 
including British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French Premier 
Jacques Chirac. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them share our determination to respond strongly to Mr.  
Milosevic's continuing campaign of inhumane violence against the 
Kosovar Albanian people,'' Clinton told reporters. ``That is what 
we intend to do.'' Clinton said he strongly supported NATO's 
decision to step up its air campaign in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Without specifically mentioning Saturday's loss of an F-117A,  
Clinton said he had warned from the start of ``real risks'' in 
NATO's confrontation in the sky over Yugoslavia. ``But the 
continued brutality and repression of the Serb forces further 
underscores the need for NATO to persevere,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As he stepped away from the podium, Clinton was asked whether  
the NATO bombings were a driving force behind the escalating 
atrocities in Kosovo. ``Absolutely not,'' Clinton replied. 
</P>
<P>
	The F-117A pilot, whose identity was not made public, was  
reported in ``good shape'' at Aviano Air Base in Italy after a 
daring rescue and recovery operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, speaking on the Sunday TV talk  
shows, said the loss of the F-117A -- one of the most sophisticated 
and secretive aircraft in the U.S. arsenal -- would not affect 
NATO's air campaign against the Serbian government as the attacks 
widen to target Serb forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to move into a wider array of targets including  
not only those dealing with command-and-control structures, 
ammunition dumps, but also start to go after the forces in the 
field as such,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, British Air Commodore  
David Wilby told reporters, ``We are now just beginning to 
transition'' from focusing air attacks mainly in Yugoslavia's air 
defense network to targeting the Serb tanks and troops that are 
continuing to pound the Kosovar Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO airstrikes were launched last week after Serbs refused  
to enter into a peace agreement with the majority ethnic Albanians 
in Kosovo, the largest Serb province. Serbia is the main republic 
in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, already signed by the ethnic Albanians, calls for  
NATO troops to be based in Kosovo to keep the peace. Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic steadfastly has objected to a NATO 
peacekeeping force in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and NATO officials provided a few details of Saturday's air  
attacks, which included a further use of the Air Force's B-2 Spirit 
bomber, a stealth aircraft built with radar-evading technologies 
that are a leap ahead of those employed by the smaller 
1980s-vintage F-117A fighter-bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials said 66 allied aircraft attacked 17 major targets  
on Saturday, including various elements of the Yugoslav air defense 
network as well as an airfield and an ammunition supply facility. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no indication that any allied planes had hit Serb  
tanks or other armored vehicles, although U.S. and NATO officials 
said that would happen as part of the intensified second stage of 
the air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at an expanded set of targets,'' U.S. Army Gen.  
Wesley Clark said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' As Supreme Allied 
Commander Europe, Clark is the top NATO military authority. He 
declined to answer when asked whether the main tank-killing 
aircraft, the A-10 Warthog, had been used. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon released a few aerial photographs of damage done by  
the NATO bombing. One showed a destroyed Serb military headquarters 
in Kosovo, which Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, said was hit by an American cruise missile on the 
second night of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton, speaking on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' also disclosed that  
the two Yugoslav MiG-29 fighters shot down Friday over Bosnia were 
not, as NATO officials first reported, targeting NATO ground 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said the MiGs were armed with air-to-air weapons. ``So  
there's no indication that they were in fact bound to attack our 
troops. That's not the type of ordnance that you'd carry for a 
mission like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he did not yet know what caused the F-117A  
fighter-bomber to crash Saturday. It was the first allied aircraft 
loss since the bombing began last Wednesday. Five Yugoslav planes 
have been shot down by NATO. The Serbs claim they shot it down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are unable to determine whether it was due to anti-aircraft  
fire, a surface-to-air missile or a malfunction,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	He denied that the loss of the F-117A would jeopardize the  
American monopoly on stealth technology. He described the plane's 
stealth capabilities as ``reasonably old,'' since they were 
developed in the 1970s. ``The aircraft itself would be hard to 
replicate'' with the remains of the downed plane, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said aircraft losses would not stop NATO from pressing  
ahead against Yugoslav. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have no impact,'' he said. ``We are going to continue  
this air campaign, it will be intensified, we are going to move 
into a wider array of targets including not only those dealing with 
command and control structures, ammunition dumps, but also start to 
go after the forces in the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described a ``very, very  
bad scene'' in Kosovo with civilians being executed, villages 
torched and women and children fleeing across the border. Her 
description of the scene in Kosovo underscored the urgency of 
NATO's mission to degrade the Serb military. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now think there are somewhere between 10,000 and 18,000 of  
his forces within Kosovo massing this last offensive,'' she said, 
referring to Milosevic's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	She said on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' that although Milosevic is  
stepping up his campaign against Kosovo, he will lose in the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will come out of this with a military that is devastated,''  
she said.

<HEADLINE> Calhoun's Mission Almost Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Thirteen years ago, a man named Jim  
Calhoun showed up at Connecticut and promised to build a national 
college basketball power. 
</P>
<P>
	His New England accent was thick, his speech confident, his  
smile engaging. His love of coaching, set aflame by the compassion 
his high school coach showed at the bedside of Calhoun's dying 
father, burns brighter than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, whose name symbolizes UConn's rise to elite status -- in  
the company of North Carolina, Kentucky, Kansas and, yes, Duke -- is 
one step away from his ultimate goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The dream is still alive. The 56-year-old Calhoun goes for his  
first national championship Monday night when the Huskies play 
Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``My obligation was to come to Connecticut in 1986 and do the  
best I possibly could,'' said Calhoun, who coached Northeastern for 
14 years before taking over the Huskies. ``We think we've done 
almost the best we possibly can. The best would be winning the 
national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Calhoun arrived, UConn's basketball program was entirely a  
regional phenomenon. The Huskies were happy to beat Holy Cross or 
Lehigh. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of his current players were in junior high when UConn had  
its breakthrough season in 1989-90, going 31-6 and making the NCAA 
tournament for the first time since 1979. Back then, the Huskies 
weren't mentioned in the same breath with the giants of the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was first coming in, it was UNLV, Duke and those  
guys,'' Jake Voskuhl said. ``I guess UNLV hasn't carried over as 
much with Jerry Tarkanian leaving and all the stuff happening 
there. You still have your teams, Duke and North Carolina. Those 
have been the teams that, year in and year out, have always done 
well. And Kansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And UConn.  
</P>
<P>
	For Calhoun's Huskies, nothing less than a national title will  
do. He is a victim of his own success, a man expected to erase all 
the terrible memories of NCAA tournament misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had terrific kids who've played for us,'' said Calhoun,  
fond of recalling players like Ray Allen and Donyell Marshall, who 
toiled without the reward of a Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not one of those kids ever let me down, frustrated me. They  
brought me a great deal of happiness, and our program, our state 
and university a great deal of success. We were criticized for mere 
excellence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun built some great teams in the '90s, dominating the Big  
East even more than Georgetown did a decade ago. UConn has won a 
record six straight Big East regular season titles and three 
conference tournament championships in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Huskies fell one game short of the Final Four in 1990,  
1995 and 1998, losing to Duke on Christian Laettner's buzzer-beater 
at the Meadowlands the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since I've been here, he has had his eyes on the Final  
Four and possibly the national championship,'' point guard Khalid 
El-Amin said. ``Last year we fell a game short of the Final Four, 
and this year ever since Aug. 19 he's been pushing us and 
motivating us every practice to get better at something. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we're here, we're going to try to make the most of  
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he stands on the precipice of the true greatness he seeks,  
Calhoun seems like a man who was always destined to coach. Not so. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played basketball in college and thought I was a much better  
player than what I was,'' said Calhoun, who grew up in the Boston 
area. ``I didn't ever think I was going to coach. The moment I 
walked into a gym -- I was 22 years old and put a whistle on my neck 
-- I saw I could combine things I loved. I could compete and I could 
give something to the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun's coach at Braintree (Mass.) High School, Fred Herget,  
taught him that coaches don't always have to be heartless 
intimidators. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my dad died when I was 15, the only person sitting in my  
home that day, looking after my family, was my high school coach,'' 
Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has carried a small photo of his first granddaughter in his  
breast pocket throughout the NCAA tournament. Mental snapshots of 
what the national championship game would be like have flickered in 
his mind for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who wants to step into the arena, you can win and you  
can lose,'' Calhoun said. ``I think we have chosen to try for 
excellence. In this case, ecstasy is what we're looking for.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Beryllium Endangers Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- During the last five decades, the U.S.  
government risked the lives of thousands of workers by knowingly 
allowing them to be exposed to dangerous levels of beryllium, a 
metal critical to the military, The Blade reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous government, scientific, and industry reports showed  
beryllium put workers in extreme danger, and hundreds of workers 
exposed to the metal's dust have contracted beryllium disease, an 
incurable and sometimes fatal lung illness, The Blade reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers at private weapons plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania  
were exposed to levels of beryllium dust 100 times federal safety 
limits, the newspaper said, citing government records. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Peter Infante, director of standards review for the U.S.  
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said the government 
has failed to protect workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are all deaths and disease that could have been  
prevented,'' Infante said. ``That's the sad thing about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beryllium is a gray metal lighter than aluminum yet six times  
stiffer than steel. It is vital to the operation of missiles, jet 
planes and nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear how many people have contracted the disease.  
Researchers cite an estimated 1,200 cases and hundreds of deaths 
nationwide but say many other cases are misdiagnosed or undetected. 
</P>
<P>
	At the nation's largest beryllium plant, at Elmore just outside  
Toledo, at least 39 workers have contracted the disease and six 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, owned by Cleveland-based Brush Wellman Inc., has  
never consistently met federal safety limits in all parts of the 
factory, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brush Wellman says it has always posted air test results for  
workers and has discussed beryllium exposure with them. But it 
acknowledged that by the time high dust levels are reported, 
workers already have been exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Hanes, the company's vice president for government affairs,  
said Sunday that the company and government were not attempting to 
hide any information from workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that there has been a conspiracy is wrong,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The company has invested greatly in protecting its workers,  
constantly monitors beryllium levels and aims to operate within 
federal safety limits, Hanes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the danger is not limited to weapons plant  
workers. Beryllium also is used to make everyday items such as golf 
clubs, and no one knows how many workers are potentially exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, about two dozen people have contracted the disease  
from dust carried into their homes by beryllium workers. Some 
victims have been women who washed their husbands' work clothes, 
the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by safety regulators to protect workers from beryllium  
have been scuttled by defense and industry officials, The Blade 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Carter's defense and energy secretaries helped kill  
one safety plan in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	They feared cutting off beryllium supplies for weapons would  
``significantly and adversely affect our national defense,'' U.S. 
Energy Secretary James Schlesinger wrote to two Cabinet members at 
the time.

<HEADLINE> Final NCAA Game at a Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Matchups for Monday night's national  
championship game between top-ranked Duke and No. 3 Connecticut: 
</P>
<P>
                           *FRONTCOURTS   	
</P>
<P>
	Duke: National player of the year Elton Brand is in the middle  
and he leads the Blue Devils in scoring, rebounding and field goal 
percentage. Forward Shane Battier is an excellent defender and 
solid rebounder and forward Chris Carrawell is a slasher and 
defender whose underrated play is constantly praised by coach Mike 
Krzyzewski. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut: Center Jake Voskuhl still isn't 100 percent since  
fracturing a bone in his foot but is still solid on the defensive 
end. Forward Kevin Freeman is as tough as they come and he stepped 
up to win Big East tournament MVP honors. Swingman Richard Hamilton 
was a first-team All-America and he has scored at least 20 points 
in six straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: Duke because of Brand, whose first half last night was as  
impressive as a big man has had in a while in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
                            *BACKCOURTS   	
</P>
<P>
	Duke: Trajan Langdon, a second-team All-America, is the  
emotional leader of the team and one of the best 3-point shooters 
in the country. William Avery inherited the point guard position 
from Steve Wojciechowski and has done an excellent job running the 
team, especially when it's running. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut: Khalid El-Amin, the poster boy for those who prefer  
gyros to gyms, bounced back from an 0-for-12 effort in the regional 
finals with 18 points and six assists against Ohio State. Ricky 
Moore is one of the best defenders in the game and he'll get a 
chance to cover both Avery and Langdon depending on the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: Even, because when both combinations are doing what they  
do best they are the best in college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
                              *BENCH   	
</P>
<P>
	Duke: Many have called this the deepest team ever in college  
basketball with the likes of Nate James, Chris Burgess and freshman 
sensation Corey Maggette available to keep the talent level so high 
with any substitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut: Albert Mouring had provided instant offense off the  
bench but the long-range shooter hasn't been the same since 
spraining a knee in the last regular-season game. The Huskies do 
have two big bodies to spell Voskuhl in Edmund Saunders and 
Souleymane Wane and they may need all 15 fouls from the center spot 
against Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: Duke in a no-doubter.  
</P>
<P>
                             *COACHES   	
</P>
<P>
	Duke: Krzyzewski has been to eight Final Fours and only Dean  
Smith has won more NCAA tournament games. This is Krzyzewski's 
sixth championship game appearance and a win Monday night would 
make him just the fourth coach to win three or more national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut: Jim Calhoun has taken the school from a respected  
regional program to a national power that has dominated the Big 
East for the past decade. This is his first Final Four, but his 
teams fell one game short three times since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Edge: Duke because of Krzyzewski's experience in title games.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco May Acquire Arco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Fresh off the completion of one merger, oil giant  
BP Amoco is reportedly holding talks to take over Los-Angeles-based 
Atlantic Richfield Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, worth about $25 billion, is expected to be announced  
later this week after the boards of the two companies vote on the 
deal, The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	If completed, the merger would be the latest integration in a  
rapidly consolidating oil industry and the second acquisition for 
the former British Petroleum Co, which completed its $57.6 billion 
merger with Chicago-based Amoco Corp. in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Both newspapers said the negotiations still could fall through.  
Any deal would have to be approved by U.S. regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at the companies' headquarters by The Associated  
Press were not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the Arco and BP Amoco operations in Alaska said  
separately that they could not comment on rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear exactly how much the deal would be worth, though  
based on Friday's closing stock prices of $65.37 1/2 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, Arco has a market capitalization of about $21 
billion. The Financial Times quoted people close to the 
negotiations as saying that Arco was looking for a premium of 20 
percent, putting the price tag at about $25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of BP Amoco rose $1.12 1/2 to $100.43 3/4 in trading Friday on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	One main advantage of the link is savings and improved  
efficiency that may be gained by uniting the two companies' Alaskan 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alaska, BP Amoco and Arco jointly operate the 13-billion  
barrel Prudhoe Bay field, the 800-pound gorilla of U.S. oil 
discoveries. But from a peak in 1988 of 2.1 million barrels a day, 
production has fallen off to about 1.2 million barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
	While BP Amoco now produces more oil than Arco in Alaska, it's  
Arco that has the best future prospects. The company expects to 
have its 360-million barrel Alpine field operating in about two 
years, and it also is eyeing acreage in the vast National Petroleum 
Reserve-Alaska west of Prudhoe for additional opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 percent of the state's revenues come from oil, and most  
of that is generated by Arco and BP. A combined BP-Arco company 
would own more than 70 percent of the trans-Alaska pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	Arco is the seventh-largest U.S. oil company, earning $452  
million in 1998 on revenue of $10.3 billion. It has more than 1,700 
gas stations in the Western U.S. and British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	It has interests in places like Indonesia, the Gulf of Mexico,  
the North Sea and Africa. But supply and sales are centered in 
Alaska and California. 
</P>
<P>
	Low crude prices, however, have hurt Arco; since October, it has  
announced plans to lay off 1,200 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco, the world's third-largest oil company, sells its  
products through a network of about 27,000 stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the BP-Amoco deal was completed, the new company has  
announced a total of 10,000 in merger-related cuts, roughly 10 
percent of the combined company's work force. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the combined BP Amoco earned $4.65 billion on revenue  
of $83.7 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil companies worldwide have been devastated by the low cost of  
oil, causing them to lay off employees and find other ways of 
savings -- including entering into mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Exxon Corp. announced in December it would purchase Mobil Corp.  
in a deal currently valued at $75.7 billion that would combine the 
two biggest U.S. oil companies and create the second-largest 
private oil company in the world, behind the Royal Dutch/Shell 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in December, French petroleum giant Total and Belgian  
refiner Petrofina announced plans to merge in a deal that would 
create the world's fifth-largest oil company.

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Sixth in Dubai Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- In a big upset at the Dubai  
World Cup, Silver Charm finished sixth Sunday in the showcase $5 
million race that was won by local entry Almutawakel. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby winner who won this race  
last year, was not a factor in the field of eight horses, four of 
them owned by Dubai's ruling Al Maktoum family. 
</P>
<P>
	The two other U.S. horses fared far better on the dirt track,  
with Malek finishing second and Victory Gallop third. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Silver Charm captured the winner's purse of $3 million, he  
would have moved past Skip Away and into the No. 2 spot on the 
career earnings list with $9,803,066. The great Cigar, now retired, 
is No. 1 at $9,999,815. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm's reputation, built on more than $6.5 million in  
earnings, lost some of its glitter after his defeat at Santa Anita 
this year when he finished third in the Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	The horses broke evenly at the start. Silver Charm fell behind  
in third place, trailing Central Park and Malek. He then dropped 
further back in the 1 1-4-mile race at the Nad Al Sheba racecourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek, who finished fourth in Dubai last year, earned $1 million  
for finishing second. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, the 1998 Belmont Stakes winner ridden by Jerry  
Bailey, won $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning time was 2:00.65. The rest of the order of finish  
was Central Park in fourth, followed by Daylami, Silver Charm, 
Running Stag and High Rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Almutawakel is owned by the world-famous Godolphin stables that  
belong to the Al Maktoums. The bay colt came to prominence when he 
won the Prix Jean Prat beating Gold Away and the St. James's Palace 
stakes winner Dr. Fong. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, ridden by Gary Stevens, his regular jockey, did  
not have trainer Bob Baffert on hand. He was at Turfway Park in 
Kentucky Saturday to watch Kentucky Derby hopeful Straight Man 
finish fourth in the Gallery Furniture.Com Stakes. Silver Charm and 
Straight Man are owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no betting at Nad al-Sheba. In North America, wagers  
were taken on the race at tracks and off-track facilities in Canada 
and 28 states, but not in New York, where betting on racing is 
prohibited on Palm Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm, second in the Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 7 at  
Churchill Downs, opened 1999 with a win in the San Pasqual Handicap 
at Santa Anita. In his last two starts, however, he finished third 
in both the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park and the Santa Anita 
Handicap March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, a 4-year-old colt, is trained by Elliott Walden  
and owned by brothers Art, Jack and J.R. Preston, was fourth in the 
Breeders Cup Classic. He opened 1999 by winning an allowance race 
March 3 at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek, ridden by Alex Solis, had raced only twice since his  
fourth place in Dubai last year. He finished second to Silver Charm 
in the San Pasqual, then was second in the San Antonio Handicap on 
Feb. 7 at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Maktoum-owned horses were making their dirt-racing and  
1999 debuts.

<HEADLINE> Duke Students Celebrate Women's Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Students gathered around a giant-screen TV  
in Cameron Indoor Stadium to cheer for what they hoped would be the 
first of two Duke basketball championships on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Things didn't quite turn out that way.  
</P>
<P>
	Purdue defeated Duke 62-45 to win the NCAA women's championship  
and doused a potential on-campus celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	The students now must rely on the men for a national title. The  
Blue Devils play Connecticut on Monday night in St. Petersburg, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	For many of the approximately 1,000 students who crowded the  
floor at Cameron, the women's team provided more thrills than the 
men late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most exciting game I've watched all year,'' said  
Jason Belk, a senior from Raleigh. ``They're used to be a 
difference between men's basketball and women's basketball at Duke, 
but there isn't any more. It's almost more exciting to watch the 
women because it's unexpected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just as important as the men's team,'' said Shannon  
Dooley, a freshman from Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the final seconds of Purdue's victory ticked away, the  
students filed quietly out of the arena and headed back to their 
dorms. A small group lingered outside in the grassy quad at the 
center of campus after the game had ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never expected the women to get this far. We're really  
happy for them,'' said Nicole Hess, a sophomore from Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Junker, 23, an alumnus and a native of Germany, came back  
to Durham from his homeland just to experience the Final Four 
atmosphere. He said the disappointment will be much more widespread 
if the men lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't win with the men, it's going to be much worse,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Wins 5th Cross-Country Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- With mud and chilling Belfast  
winds his toughest opponents, Kenya's Paul Tergat posted a 
record-setting fifth straight victory in the World Cross Country 
Championships Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tergat was timed in 38 minutes, 28 seconds, for the 7.5-mile  
race on a daunting Belfast track turned muddy and treacherous by 
rain and previous races. His feat broke the record of four straight 
victories he shared with countryman John Ngugi. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenya also took the silver medal, thanks to a gutsy and  
unexpected performance by little-known Patrick Ivuti. He led much 
of the way, before finishing four seconds behind Tergat. 
</P>
<P>
	Preventing a medals sweep for Kenya -- whose men also took the  
fourth through seventh places -- was Portugal's Paulo Guerra. The 
former European champion raised his arms in jubilation and blew 
kisses to the crowd as he crossed the finish line for the bronze, 
18 seconds behind Tergat. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Jackline Maranga of Kenya won the women's 2.6-mile  
race in 15:09. Seven seconds back in second place was Moroccan-born 
Yamna Belkacem of France. Annemari Sandell of Finland finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weather made it very difficult for me,'' said Maranga, the  
Commonwealth 1,500-meter champion and record-holder. ``I didn't 
necessarily plan to go so hard so early, but I found myself in 
front and feeling strong and the other girls couldn't keep up with 
me, so I just took it from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the strongest North American showing of the two-day  
championships, Kathy Butler of Canada finished fourth, at 15:30. 
Elva Dryer of the United States was 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	The prerace favorite, 1998 silver medalist Zahra Ouaziz of  
Morocco, withdrew late Saturday because of a left tendon strain and 
illness. Her younger sister, Seloua, finished 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	The junior men's 5-mile race featured a battle between Kenya's  
Richard Limo and Ethiopia's Hailu Mekonnen. They traded places 
throughout the race -- until Mekonnen blasted decisively ahead in 
the final straight to win in 25:38. 
</P>
<P>
	Mekonnen, last year's bronze medalist behind Limo, also won a  
bronze Saturday in the senior men's 2.6-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind made it hard but the mud was no problem for me,''  
Mekonnen said. ``But once I saw that he (Limo) looked tired I 
thought I would take a chance and overtake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The third-place finisher, Kipchumba Mitei of Kenya, was less  
charitable about the racing conditions. ``I found the course so wet 
and muddy and cold that it made it very difficult to run,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Suns Place Chapman on Injured List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Phoenix Suns guard Rex Chapman was placed on the  
injured list Sunday because of a sore toe on his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman must sit out at least five games before returning.  
</P>
<P>
	Chapman, known throughout his career as a long-range  
sharpshooter, has struggled this season. He is shooting 34 percent 
from the field and averaging 12.3 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the toe had been bothering him for a couple of weeks and  
he aggravated the injury last Wednesday in the Suns' 106-101 
victory over the Lakers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the schedule the way it is, it wasn't going to get any  
better,'' Chapman said. ``Hopefully with a few days' rest it will 
get better. I guess they put me on the list so I wouldn't come back 
too early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chapman, who started the season with a sore hamstring and later  
had a bruised calf, said he is not ready to write off the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just something you have to deal with,'' he said. ``You  
don't want to dwell on it or overreact to it. I just want to be a 
professional and do my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns did not make a move to fill the roster spot. General  
manager Bryan Colangelo said the team is considering signing 
another player.

<HEADLINE> Brand Is UConn's Biggest Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Finally, they've got the team  
they've wanted in the game they've wanted and the matchup ... well, 
the matchup no player would want. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially not Jake Voskuhl.  
</P>
<P>
	On a Connecticut team dominated by Richard Hamilton's scoring,  
Ricky Moore's defensive brilliance and Khalid El-Amin's 
personality, Voskuhl often is virtually ignored -- if that's 
possible for a 6-foot-11 man with sideburns almost to his knees. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's no disguising his importance in Monday night's NCAA  
championship game against Duke, one that may be decided by 
Voskuhl's ability -- or lack thereof -- to contain and control player 
of the year Elton Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	With a wingspan that seems to extend across Tampa Bay, and a  
scoring touch as soft as a shooting guard, the 6-9 Brand may be the 
closest thing to an indefensible player in college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	But if they don't defend Brand, the Huskies (33-2) won't win the  
national championship they feel has already been awarded to the 
Blue Devils (37-1). 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't say you're going to stop him, you just hope he  
doesn't go off on you,'' Voskuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, like Brand did Saturday by taking out Michigan State with 13  
rebounds and eight points in just the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Voskuhl, an infrequent scorer who is depended on mostly to block  
shots and rebound, will be UConn's tentative first line of defense 
against Brand. The last line will be ... 
</P>
<P>
	Get back to coach Jim Calhoun at about 9:15 p.m. or so Monday  
about that. He said he knows but hasn't even told his players yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke is not a very, very difficult team to prepare for,''  
Calhoun said Sunday before the team's practice. ``They're just a 
difficult team to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UConn will try to slow Brand by mixing up double teams, with 6-7  
Kevin Freeman often sliding over to help Voskuhl deny Brand the 
ball and force him to take off-balance shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I see a man-to-man matchup, my eyes light up,'' Brand  
said. ``I think I can either score or get fouled or find someone 
open. So maybe to double team me would be the best situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies also must make quick, in-the-flow rotation switches  
to prevent Duke's raft of scorers from beating them with 3s as they 
double down on Brand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him manhandle people,'' said Freeman, who first  
played against Brand in high school. ``He's 6-8, but when he 
extends those long arms it's hard to defend him. The key is to try 
to make him take tough shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How to defend Brand wasn't the only tough decision Calhoun and  
his staff made during a lengthy game-planning session following 
UConn's 64-58 victory Saturday over Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Does Ricky Moore, the self-described best defensive player in  
the country, try to take out Duke point guard and former high 
school teammate William Avery as he did against Ohio State's 
befuddled Scoonie Penn? Or does he match up against Trajan Langdon, 
a dangerous streak shooter? 
</P>
<P>
	And if Moore is occupied with Avery, can the extremely confident  
Khalid El-Amin, who said Sunday he feels he was destined to play in 
this game, do a job on Langdon? 
</P>
<P>
	And then there's 6-6 freshman super sub Corey Maggette, who  
doesn't start for Duke but might be an NBA lottery pick if declares 
for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to pick your poison and pick the idea of what  
you feel is going to hurt you less,'' Calhoun said. ``With Elton, 
we really feel that he becomes the center in all senses. When he 
went off with his fourth foul (Saturday), it was a different 
basketball game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To keep Voskuhl out of foul trouble, Calhoun will substitute  
frequently with 6-11 Souleymane Wane and 6-8 Edmund Saunders, a 
physical forward who averages 17.8 minutes a game to Voskuhl's 
21.3. 
</P>
<P>
	``He comes in with this attitude,'' Voskuhl said of Saunders.  
``The thing about him is he's not going to back down against 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not even Duke.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know, we've waited on this all season long,'' Moore said.  
``We just wanted a chance to play them. We've heard all year, `They 
can't be beat, they can't be beat,' but I think they can if we play 
a great game.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Rijo Puts Comeback on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Jose Rijo showed up at the Cincinnati Reds  
training camp on Sunday, played a little catch and came as close as 
he ever has to saying he'll never pitch again. 
</P>
<P>
	Rijo has changed his mind from a month ago, when he hoped to  
resume his comeback from elbow surgery by getting another minor 
league contract. Instead, he's going to devote his time to running 
his new baseball academy, set to open in the Dominican Republic 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he's retired as a player, Rijo said, ``Almost. Semi-.''  
</P>
<P>
	Rijo, 33, was the MVP of the Reds' 1990 World Series sweep of  
Oakland but has not pitched in a regular-season game since the 
first of his four major elbow operations in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was on a minor league contract last year when he came to  
training camp, developed soreness in the elbow and wound up working 
out on his own in the Dominican while overseeing construction of 
his complex. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Sunday he wants to keep doing the same thing. His ``Hill  
of Dream'' complex is expected to open next month in his hometown 
of San Cristobal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing I've accomplished is the World Series, and  
they say you live with your memories forever,'' Rijo said. ``This 
is going to be something that's going to be there forever and you 
can touch every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do something that's very productive for the Reds  
and my (hometown). That's my dream come true: something to help my 
community, because the job opportunities aren't too many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rijo said he's too young to consider himself retired from  
baseball, but he has no desire right now to work on a comeback 
full-time. He'll keep playing catch and maybe reconsider at some 
later time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to take it easy, run the complex, do a little  
scouting for the Reds and help them in the June free agent draft, 
stuff like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rijo talked to Reds officials about the complex after meeting  
former teammates and playing catch in the outfield. He planned to 
return to the Dominican Republic later in the week with assistant 
general manager Doc Rodgers to sign some players at the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Rijo probably will never pitch again for the Reds, his  
complex could provide a breakthrough for a team looking to 
establish more of a presence in the Dominican. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just puts us on the map,'' Rodgers said. ``It's like how  
Year 2000 is a big deal. This is a Year 2000-type deal for us as 
far as Reds scouting. It's something we've always dreamed of and 
were never able to implement. We've always wished we could catch up 
in a hurry (with other teams). We're caught up once we sign this 
agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodgers and Rijo have discussed a working agreement for some  
time. They hope to have one signed when the complex opens in 
mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, this is a major upgrade for the Reds,'' general manager  
Jim Bowden said. ``Jose Rijo deserves credit for what he's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rijo was offered the chance to put on a uniform Sunday and sit  
on the bench, but he declined. He feared that being so close to a 
game would tempt him to change his mind about dropping the 
comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get excited again,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Teams Jump-Start Women's Hoops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Duke and Purdue have given women's  
basketball a nice jump start into the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Parity long has been a buzzword in the sport, though with  
Tennessee reaching the national championship game four straight 
years and winning it three times, it was starting to sound hollow. 
</P>
<P>
	No more.  
</P>
<P>
	The Duke-Purdue final Sunday night produced not only a new  
champion, but a first-time champion. Georgia coach Andy Landers, 
among others, finds having new teams in the spotlight to be 
refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
	Landers said programs such as Connecticut and Tennessee have  
helped women's basketball because of the interest they generated 
with the media. But it hurts the sport, he said, if the marquee 
names are the only ones that win. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want teams, you don't want players, you don't want  
coaches becoming more popular or bigger than the game,'' said 
Landers, whose team lost to Duke in the national semifinals. ``You 
see that in the NBA, and sometimes it turns out not to be a pretty 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``So us being able to beat other teams from time to time, I  
think helps our sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That happened this season. Tennessee and Connecticut didn't even  
make the Final Four, even though Tennessee returned all its stars 
and Connecticut had the nation's best recruiting class. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke defeated Tennessee in the East Regional final and  
Connecticut lost in the Mideast semifinals to Iowa State, which had 
won only one NCAA tournament game before this season. Stanford, a 
two-time national champion, lost to Maine in the first round of 
this year's tournament and was upset by 16th-seeded Harvard in the 
first round last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of talent and women who can play the game,''  
said Purdue coach Carolyn Peck, who's moving to the WNBA's Orlando 
Miracle. ``That will help evolve the interest in women's basketball 
even more. There are more than one or two or three teams to watch, 
and that spreads the excitement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are more good teams because more good players are coming  
up. Thousands of high school girls play on summertime AAU teams, 
giving them a chance to develop their skills against strong 
competition and to be seen by the hordes of college coaches who 
attend those events. 
</P>
<P>
	The young players see the increased attention the college game  
is receiving and they also know that with the advent of the WNBA, 
they can play beyond college. So they work even harder to get 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``With that in mind, you are able to feed a lot more than 10  
Division I programs,'' Old Dominion coach Wendy Larry said. ``In 
the '70s, with all due respect, there were probably 10 programs 
that, year in and year out, would collect the best talent in the 
high schools and then compete for national titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the talent pool has grown significantly, it's  
becoming a time of parity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech coach Leon Barmore, whose team lost to Purdue in  
the national semifinals in its 10th Final Four appearance, gets 
wistful when he thinks about the deepening talent pool. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could roll back the clock and be 30 again so I could  
coach 25 more years,'' Barmore, 54, said. ``Because the next 10, 
15, 20 years, it will be unbelievable what you're going to see with 
women's basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the top programs continue to get their pick of the high  
school All-Americans -- doesn't that still happen in men's 
basketball with Duke and Kentucky? -- plenty of talent remains to 
fill rosters at places like Iowa State, Colorado State and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Girls on all these teams, they are tying their shoes on tight  
and saying: I can whip you, and they believe that,'' Barmore said. 
``That's good for the game. That's good for the fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not as much intimidation going on. Our uniform is not  
going to walk out there and beat anybody. Tennessee's uniform is 
not going to continue to go out there and beat everybody. This game 
is getting really good.''

<HEADLINE> Skating Judges Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Figure skating's governing body  
suspended two judges Sunday for possible collusion while scoring 
the pairs event at the World Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Skating Union barred Alfred Kortyek of Ukraine  
and Sviatoslav Babenko of Russia from officiating at any of its 
championships or any international event under its jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Television footage showed the judges exchanging glances, making  
gestures and possibly conversing during the final of the pairs 
event on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian pair of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won  
the event in a decision derided by many spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd favorite was Shen Xue and Hongbo Zhao of China, who  
followed the Russians with a spectacularly athletic performance. 
The tape shows Korytek and Babenko glancing at each other as the 
Chinese pair were taking bows, before the scores were announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally-Anne Stapleford, chairwoman of the ISU's technical  
committee, said she and members of the technical committee had seen 
the tape before a meeting of the ISU council Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	ISU rules say ``judges must mark independently and, while  
judging, they are not permitted to converse with one another or to 
indicate errors by action or sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two judges, sitting in adjacent spots, also placed Poland's  
Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek, the program's final skaters, 
lower than Russian pair Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the other seven judges placed the Polish pair third and  
gave the Russian pair fourth or fifth position. 
</P>
<P>
	Korytek was one of the judges in the 1994 Olympics controversy  
centering around Oksana Baiul of Ukraine winning the gold in a 5-4 
ballot. He also is the father of Baiul's first coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, Didier Gailhaguet, the head of the French skating  
federation, said he filed a protest to the ISU concerning the 
judging in the ice dance event that ended Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gailhuguet questioned the scores by one of the judges who  
switched from favoring the French duo of Maria Anissina and Gwendal 
Peizerat to the Russian team of Anjelika Krylova and Oleg 
Ovsiannikov apparently after the time allotted to change scores had 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the decision of the Russian referee of the event to  
allow the change as the basis of the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third time in the past two months one judge's vote  
made the difference -- all in favor of the Russians.

<HEADLINE> Birth of First Mutual Fund Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- It seemed ordinary enough at the time -- a few guys  
pooling their money to invest in stocks like the Lowell Bleachery 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	It turned out to be a big deal. A very big deal. That pooling of  
money in March 1924 marked the introduction of the Massachusetts 
Investors Trust, the United States' first mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
	From the time the fund began trading in July 1924, it flourished  
and was widely copied, opening the doors of stock market investing 
to millions in the middle-class. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, mutual funds turned out to be one of the century's  
biggest financial stories, although it took time to write. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mutual funds have been kind of the greatest growth story of  
the 20th century,'' said Robert C. Pozen, head of investment 
management at Fidelity Investments, which has almost $780 billion 
in assets, with more than $721 billion of that in mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts Investors Trust itself has grown enormously from  
its initial, 46-stock portfolio, which included 50 shares of 
General Motors, 20 shares of the Texas Company (now known as 
Texaco), 10 shares of the Nash Motor Co., 10 shares of American 
Telephone &AMP; Telegraph (now AT&AMP;T) and 10 shares of the Naumkeag 
Steam Cotton Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``It had five shares of General Electric in it (then worth  
$1,161). Today there are 1.9 million shares of General Electric'' 
worth $200 million, said David Oliveri, a spokesman for MFS 
Investment Management, which now controls the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	An investment in the fund of $10,000 in 1924 would be worth  
$12.5 million today, says MFS. 
</P>
<P>
	Total assets amounted to $50,000 in 1924. Today, America's  
oldest mutual fund has $12 billion in assets. That is nonetheless a 
tiny fraction of the $5.7 trillion total invested in mutual funds 
as of January 1999, according to the Investment Company Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund's changing portfolio reveals the progression of  
American business over 75 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, ``there was an emphasis on utilities, an emphasis on  
railroads and a couple banks and insurance companies,'' said John 
Reilly, another MFS spokesman. Today, financial services and health 
care account for more than 30 percent of the fund's stock. 
</P>
<P>
	As the American business scene has evolved, so have American  
investing options. The mutual fund was on the vanguard of a 
movement that gave average people the chance to invest. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were a lot of investing opportunities for wealthy people  
at that time, but mutual funds were a great opportunity for people 
in the middle class or the upper middle class to invest in the 
stock market,'' Oliveri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Hayes, a professor of finance at Harvard Business School,  
said investing options were few in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a passbook savings account, essentially. Or a  
government savings bond,'' Hayes said. ``You could buy a home, buy 
a piece of real estate. But there were very few ways to put money 
to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the U.S. economy heated up in the 1920s, more and more  
average people got into the stock market. Many crashed when the 
market crashed in 1929, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market roared up and people made a lot of money, but  
it was also being manipulated by wealthy investors,'' he said. ``So 
ultimately, the average investor got clipped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although other funds launched in the 1920s failed, the  
Massachusetts Investors Trust fund weathered the crash and the 
Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's economy recovered after World War II, but the  
mutual fund business merely puttered along. The big fortunes were 
being made in manufacturing and advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even in the early '70s, there was some question about whether  
the mutual fund industry would survive,'' said Robert Ash, managing 
director of Fleet Investment Management, which handles marketing 
and sales of Fleet's Galaxy Funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But after regulatory changes in the 1980s, the modern mutual  
fund industry sprang to life. Americans began using IRAs and 401(k) 
plans, both of which typically invest heavily in mutual funds, to 
take greater control of their financial futures. The new retirement 
plans not only helped fuel the explosive popularity of mutual funds 
but also hastened the demise of old-fashioned pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The result has been a heightened level of public sophistication  
about investing, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When (people) were expecting to receive a pension, they never  
gave a thought to how their capital was invested,'' Hayes said. 
``But now that it's on their shoulders, they're a lot more 
interested in how that works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Investment Company Institute, a trade organization of mutual  
fund firms, estimates about 66 million Americans, in 37 percent of 
the country's households, have money in funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have opened up the doors to average Americans to help  
build wealth. They're an ideal investment for average folks largely 
because they make investing simpler,'' said Chris Wloszczyna, the 
institute's spokesman. ``Not that long ago, maybe 15 years ago, a 
lot of people really didn't know what a mutual fund was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's impossible to say what Americans' personal investing habits  
will look like in 75 years, but Fleet's Ash sees continued savvy. 
While the generation that lived through the Great Depression might 
worry about losing their investments, younger generations are more 
inclined to worry about not investing enough, Ash said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now the biggest fear of most people,'' he said, ``is outliving  
their retirement benefits.''

<HEADLINE> China Making Progress in WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Negotiations on China's bid to join the World  
Trade Organization are going well, but an agreement may not be 
ready in time for the Chinese premier's visit to Washington in 
early April, a top U.S. trade official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	An agreement on terms for China's entry into the rule-making  
body for trade could help smooth Premier Zhu Rongji's U.S. trip, 
diverting attention from other areas of tension in U.S.-China ties. 
</P>
<P>
	But Commerce Secretary William Daley said he didn't know whether  
U.S. and Chinese negotiators could reach a deal in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that may not be realistic. But we are working very  
hard to see that,'' Daley said. 
</P>
<P>
	China has been seeking entry to the Geneva-based WTO and its  
predecessor for 13 years, but has been put off by U.S. demands for 
greater access to its markets and further opening of its fragile 
industries to foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley's five-day visit, which includes a Monday meeting with  
Zhu, comes at an awkward time in China-U.S. relations. Suspicions 
that Beijing may have stolen U.S. nuclear secrets have increased 
Republican criticism of President Clinton's policy of engaging 
China. 
</P>
<P>
	Coinciding with Daley's arrival, an official Chinese newspaper  
reported Sunday that China plans to further open its insurance 
market as part of its WTO bid, but will not grant foreign companies 
unfettered access.

<HEADLINE> An American Portrait of John Thomas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Jim Thomas feels more comfortable on  
roller skates than off. For six years, he dreamed a true devotee's 
dream -- to skate 25,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Semi-retired now at 73, Thomas pursued this goal while  
volunteering at Derrick's Roll Arena. ``I don't consider it work,'' 
he says of duties as floor monitor. ``I enjoy the skating, the 
people and kids here so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Dec. 17, when Thomas hit the milestone, more than three  
dozen buddies -- ages 30 to 60 -- were there to cheer. They even 
offered a victory salute, lining up for a triumphant skate-dance. 
``I saved the last two miles for the gang,'' he recalls. They skate 
on Thursday nights when, he notes, ``the deejay plays oldies 
music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Thomas watched one man attempt to circle the Earth in a  
hot-air balloon, a journey of 24,902 miles. Since he already spent 
at least five days a week on skates, Thomas knew he was on to 
something. After all, he had already logged 17,000 skate-miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could go the distance,'' Thomas says. No problem. ``I feel  
wonderful when I can skate and skate and skate. It energizes me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he set a similar goal -- in his heart. He didn't know if it  
would break any world records. He didn't know how long it would 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	And he didn't care. ``I'm going to stay on skates as long as I  
can,'' he says. ``As long as I can walk, I will skate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas started keeping track in 1992 when a passer-by watched  
him skate in the morning and again at night on an outdoor track. 
Her question was inevitable: How many miles was he averaging? He 
had no answer. 
</P>
<P>
	So he dons an odometer, now fastened with Velcro to the top of  
his left skate. ``I wore out two,'' he says. ``They only go up to 
9,999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also keeps a paper log, meticulously charting up to 60 miles  
a day. ``I had to settle down from my wild days,'' he admits. ``I 
always get tired at about 35 or 40 miles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas opts for roller skates rather than newer inline models.  
But he doesn't just skate. He struts. Knees reaching to his waist, 
arms and legs swaying, Thomas actually dances. ``I'm addicted,'' he 
says, zipping around the rink. ``I just love to dance, anywhere, 
anytime -- on skates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas glides to Next's R&AMP;B hit, ``Too Close.'' He tap-dances to  
``Long Neck Bottle'' by Garth Brooks and shuffles to anything by 
Elvis Presley. ``If it has a good, smooth rhythm... . Live organ 
music,'' he muses. ``That was good skating music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, he dresses for success: black-and-white stripe  
referee shirt, black shorts, a whistle that he seldom uses, plus 
$760 skates. The owner of the rink paid, though Thomas picked them: 
black leather boots with green urethane wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like getting a new car when they're all spiffed up,'' he  
says. So every 10 days, Thomas cleans them with a compressor gun. 
He also oils the wheels and polishes the boot. 
</P>
<P>
	The skates may be good for about 10,000 miles, he says, quite a  
difference from the first pair he owned at age 10, in the coal 
fields of Boone County, W.Va., where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were steel wheels and you needed a key to tighten them  
on,'' he recalls. ``Back then, it cost a dime for the movies, a 
dime for cigarettes and 12 cents for a bottle of beer. No one had 
any money. But any opportunity I got, I would skate. I skated on 
hard clay. I just taught myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas awes his co-workers. ``He's amazing. He gives you hope,''  
says Bernice Esteves at Derrick's concession stand. ``Just because 
you're 73, it doesn't mean you need to sit around and do nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skating since 1935, Thomas rarely stops. Just ask his wife,  
Rosalie. ``He spends more time on the skates than he does off,'' 
she confirms. ``When people say, 'How can you stand it?' I say, 'He 
could be out there doing much worse things.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The couple met on a Charleston rink about 40 years ago.  
``Rosalie was the most graceful skater I'd ever seen,'' Thomas 
says. ``She was so smooth and lovely.'' Now 72, Mrs. Thomas no 
longer skates because of a bad knee.	   Thomas credits his own toned physique, one a 30-year-old would 
admire, with his skating routine. ``I've never been to a doctor,'' 
he says, then hesitates. ``Well, I did in 1965, and the doctor told 
me to just keep doing whatever I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he mulls over the next 25,000 miles, estimating a dozen  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could do it sooner,'' he insists, ``but I promised myself I  
would relax some.''

<HEADLINE> Korean Pitcher Joins D-Backs Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks sure know how to  
make South Korean pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim feel welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a 13-hour flight from South Korea, Kim joined his new  
team for the first time Sunday and was surprised when he was paired 
with idol Randy Johnson for a game of catch. The right-hander also 
had a meet-and-greet session with his new teammates, donned his new 
uniform -- No. 77 -- and took in a few innings of Arizona's game 
against the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very pleased to be here and meet all the great players he  
was watching on TV,'' said Min-Soo Kim, a Diamondbacks scout who 
will be Kim's interpreter. ``Actually, he was shocked to see all 
the big-leaguers here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who struck out 15 in 6 1-3 innings playing for South Korea  
against a U.S. national team last year here, agreed to terms with 
the Diamondbacks on Feb. 19, but it took him until now to get all 
the paperwork completed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very happy about being here. He was waiting for his visa  
long enough,'' Min-Soo Kim said as Kim grinned and nodded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim helped South Korea to the finals of last year's World  
Championships in Italy, giving up one earned run in five innings 
against Cuba, and he struck out 12 in six perfect innings against 
China in the semifinals of last year's Asian Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old has dreamed about playing in the United States  
since his friend, Jin Ho Cho, signed with the Boston Red Sox. Kim 
visited Cho once about four years ago, and was impressed with the 
facilities U.S. major-league teams have. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since then, he wanted to come here and play real baseball,''  
Min-Soo Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said several teams were interested in him, but he wanted to  
play for the Diamondbacks. He already was familiar with Arizona 
after pitching against Team USA here last year, and since he played 
so well, had good memories of it. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the Diamondbacks' secret weapon.  
</P>
<P>
	``He liked Randy Johnson,'' Min-Soo Kim said. ``And since we're  
a young club, he'll get a better chance to get to the big leagues 
here. So he thought it might be a better deal for him to come 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim's goal is to be on the Diamondbacks roster next year. He'll  
likely start the season at Class A High Desert or Double-A El Paso, 
but manager Buck Showalter said he'll have a better idea of where 
to put him after Kim throws in the bullpen after Arizona's game 
Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said he knows this is a huge adjustment for Kim, and  
he and the team will do whatever they can to make things easy on 
him. Asked what his biggest adjustment will be, Kim pantomimed 
talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``English,'' Min-Soo Kim said as Kim nodded.  
</P>
<P>
	No problem, fellow pitcher Todd Stottlemyre said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be his English teacher,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to baseball, though, Showalter said Kim won't have  
any trouble settling in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fingers are fingers. One, two is pretty universal,'' he said,  
referring to catcher signs. ``We'll make adjustments to him instead 
of making him adjust for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim gets a $2.25 million signing bonus, with $625,000  
installments paid in 1999 and 2000, and $500,000 installments paid 
in 2001 and 2002. He gets a four-year major-league contract that 
guarantees at least the minor league minimum at each level: $850 a 
month at Rookie and short-season A-ball, $1,050 a month at Class A, 
$1,500 a month at Double-A and $2,150 at Triple-A. Once he is on a 
40-man roster for the second time, he would be guaranteed at least 
$38,100 per season.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Swimming Champion Has Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Olympic gold and silver medalist Gary Hall Jr.  
has been diagnosed with diabetes and is considering retiring from 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall withdrew from this week's national championships after  
being told by a family physician that diabetes was why he was 
having bouts of fatigue and dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm considering retirement at this point,'' Hall told The  
Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall saw his physician after feeling weak, saying he was having  
unusual fatigue after workouts in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``My arms would shake, and I thought that maybe it was just from  
hard training,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes is the latest blow in Hall's career since 1996, when he  
finished second to Russia's Alexander Popov in the 100-meter 
freestyle at the Olympics, then anchored two gold medal-winning 
relays for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was suspended for three months last summer by the  
International Olympic Committee after allegedly testing positive 
for marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually won a court-order that allowed him to compete in  
September in a World Cup meet in Texas, where he won the 50-meter 
freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hall always has been at odds with USA Swimming.  
</P>
<P>
	After the 1998 World Championship in Australia, he faced a  
disciplinary hearing for allegedly violating the conduct code. 
Among the charges was one involving wearing a wig for the team 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole string of events has made me wonder,'' he said. ``I  
don't enjoy it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, 24, plans to think through his options in the upcoming  
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to retreat, look at the future and try to come up  
with a strategy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Purdue Star Ends Hurt, on Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Stephanie White-McCarty spent the final  
minutes of her remarkable college basketball career writhing on the 
bench in pain and clutching an assistant coach's hand as her Purdue 
Boilermakers won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, the school's career scoring leader, sprained her  
left ankle while missing a shot with less than five minutes 
remaining in Purdue's 62-45 win over Duke on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	She squirmed on the court, and spit her mouthpiece about 10 feet  
away, as play continued. When play finally stopped, she was helped 
to the bench by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Her face writhing in pain, she sat on the bench as a trainer  
took off her left sneaker. White-McCarty then went to the end of 
the bench and had her ankle heavily taped, but she limped severely 
when she tried to walk around the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty, who had 12 points in the game, then took a seat  
on the bench next to assistant coach Kerry Cremeans, tightly 
gripping the coach's left hand and still looking agonized.

<HEADLINE> Fifth Day of NATO Attacks Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton worked to maintain allied  
support for the broadening air offensive in the fight to stop 
atrocities in Kosovo, while Pentagon officials declared the loss of 
an F-117A stealth fighter would not affect the aerial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	With a fifth day of air strikes underway Sunday, Clinton met  
with his national security team, and his advisers made the rounds 
on talk shows to affirm the need for stepping up the NATO assault 
to target Yugoslav military forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said more American warplanes, including four of the  
B-52 long-range bombers, were joining the nearly 200 planes already 
participating in Operation Allied Force. Six to 12 U.S. planes were 
being added, along with 12 more fighters and light bombers from 
Britain, said spokesman Ken Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen told NBC's ``Meet the Press''  
that the loss of the F-117A stealth fighter over Yugoslavia would 
not affect the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll have no impact,'' he said. ``We are going to continue  
this air campaign. It'll be intensified. We are going to move into 
a wider array of targets, including not only those dealing with 
command-and-control structures, ammunition dumps, but also start to 
go after the forces in the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO airstrikes were launched last week after Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic refused to sign on to a peace 
agreement with the majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a province 
of Serbia, which is in turn the main republic of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen denied the NATO attacks were responsible for the increased  
killings and repression in Kosovo, which caused 6,000 ethnic 
Albanian refugees to stream into nearby Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bloodbath has been underway for some time,'' Cohen said.  
</P>
<P>
	And when Clinton, on his way to Camp David, was asked whether he  
believed the air strikes have only made matters worse, he replied, 
``Absolutely not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The continued brutality and repression of the Serb forces  
further underscores the need for NATO to persevere,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he had discussed the NATO mission again with  
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac, 
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Prime Minister 
Massimo D'Alema within the previous 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them share our determination to respond strongly to Mr.  
Milosevic's continuing campaign of inhumane violence against the 
Kosovar Albanian people,'' Clinton said. ``That is what we intend 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
that although D'Alema previously expressed reservations, there was 
``absolute unanimity'' that the air campaign should be intensified. 
To ensure that unity continues, Clinton told each leader he would 
``stay in close touch'' in coming days, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Pentagon nor NATO commented officially on what  
caused the Air Force F-117A stealth fighter-bomber to crash 
Saturday 30 miles northwest of Belgrade. A senior defense official, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, said there are strong 
indications the F-117A was hit by a surface-to-air missile, 
possibly the Soviet-made SA-3 air defense missile. The Washington 
Post, citing Pentagon officials, reported today that it was indeed 
an SA-3 that struck the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	No mechanical problems were reported, but an explosion was  
heard, the official said. NATO officials, without referring to the 
F-117A, said SA-3 missiles were fired Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brig. Gen. William Lake, commander of the 49th Fighter Wing at  
Holloman Air Force Base, N.M., said he would not conclude that the 
bomber was shot down, because there are ``a vast degree and array 
of minor things that could lead to this, particularly in a combat 
arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials, he added, were not overly concerned that the  
Serbs might glean useful information from the wreckage. ``I'm not 
so sure that anybody can really do a whole lot with what they're 
going to find in a pile of rubble,'' Lake said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake declined to identify the rescued pilot, except to say he  
was in good condition at Aviano Air Base in Italy. The pilot whose 
name was visible on a piece of the wreckage, Air Force Capt. Ken 
Dwelle, did not fly the mission. Interviewed in New Mexico, Dwelle 
said he knew the rescued pilot, but he also declined to identify 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Without specifically mentioning the lost plane, Clinton said he  
expected the dangers that American pilots encounter will increase 
as the mission broadens. ``From the outset I have said to the 
American people that this military operation entails real risks,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> GM To Unveil Redesigned SUVs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Last month Ford Motor Co. marked its latest  
incursion into the big sport utility vehicle market by introducing 
the biggest SUV yet, the Excursion. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp., which has dominated the market for decades  
with its hulking Chevrolet and GMC Suburban, isn't planning to back 
down without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	GM will display a prototype of its redesigned 2000 Suburban  
tonight at Grand Central Station on the eve of the New York 
International Auto Show. GM also plans to show off the redesigned 
2000 GMC Yukon, a slightly smaller SUV whose Chevy twin is called 
the Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2 1/2-ton, nine-seat Suburban is a critical product for GM --  
one of its most profitable and enduring. It was introduced in 1935, 
predating even the Volkswagen Beetle and making it the 
longest-running automotive nameplate ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Suburban market is one of the few segments where GM can  
really claim leadership at the moment,'' independent analyst Susan 
Jacobs said. ``But that leadership position is being threatened by 
very aggressive product by Ford.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's Excursion has been targeted by anti-SUV environmentalists  
who say gigantic SUV encourages the wasteful use of gasoline, which 
pollutes the environment. In response, Ford and GM are promoting 
the ``green'' aspects of their big SUVs, such as increased use of 
recycled materials and, in the Suburban's case, improved fuel 
economy over its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	At nearly 19 feet long and nearly 6 1/2 feet high, the Excursion is  
more than a half-foot longer and up to 4 inches taller than the 
Suburban -- making it too big to fit in many garages. GM has taken 
note: In its literature on the new Suburban, it describes the truck 
as ``a sensible size that's easy to ... maneuver into the average 
parking space or garage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Full-size SUVs -- including the Yukon-Tahoe twins, the Ford  
Expedition-Lincoln Navigator siblings, the Dodge Durango and Lexus 
LX470 -- represent the fastest-growing SUV segment. Driven by aging 
baby boomers and a spate of new models, the market grew 34 percent 
last year. Their share of the SUV market nearly doubled to 29 
percent between 1995 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the new competition from Ford will be a big test for  
GM. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM is still focused on retaining buyers,'' she said. ``They're  
probably not conquesting as many as Ford is. It's important for 
them to transform the Suburban into a vehicle that can win new 
buyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suburban, Yukon and Tahoe share their chassis and major  
mechanical parts with GM's full-size pickup, which was redesigned 
last year. They will feature a stiffer frame and a new generation 
of V8 engines that feature 4 percent better fuel economy and 
reduced emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	GM says the new Suburban also will offer more room inside, lower  
step-in height and wider doors. The spare tire has been moved from 
the rear cargo area to underneath the truck for more room. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, the changes are relatively minor. The truck has a more  
rounded appearance but the overall look is the same. As it did with 
its new generation of full-size pickups, GM took a conservative 
approach in styling so as not to offend loyal customers. So far, 
the new pickups have been selling briskly. 
</P>
<P>
	The same approach was used with the redesign of the Yukon and  
Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strategically, that's probably a mistake,'' Jacobs said.  
``Manufacturers are afraid to change and evolve successful 
products. But in a market where styling is evolving very quickly, 
it's important for them to take some additional risk -- especially 
if you only restyle a truck once a decade.''

<HEADLINE> April Fools' Day Gifts Go High-Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Whoopee cushions, stink bombs and hand  
buzzers are passe this April Fools' Day as gag gifts are going 
high-tech with an array of silly items ranging from joke e-mail to 
rearview mirrors for your monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Passantino, president of Cobis, Inc., a Clifton Park,  
N.Y., company, said that while the Year 2000 Millennium Bug and 
computer viruses are very serious matters, people must keep their 
sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking a tongue-in-cheek approach,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He sells Bug Off 2000!!--a ``Computer Bug Spray and Virus  
Killer'' that's actually a high-quality screen cleaner. They also 
sell ``computer bugs,'' suction-cupped plastic insects including 
Millie, the Millennium Bug and Vinnie, the Internet Virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the country in Bellingham, Wash., Silvana Clark has sold  
more than 100,000 little plastic keyboard keys with adhesive 
backing labeled ``Panic'' and ``Any Key.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Panic'' can be used at times of great stress, she said, while  
``Any Key'' is handy when the software tells you, ``Push any key to 
continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They serve as a visual reminder to keep your sense of humor in  
the face of computer frustration,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At several Web sites, users can sign up to get a joke e-mailed  
to them every day. 
</P>
<P>
	If you're lucky, you might even get a high-tech joke like this:  
</P>
<P>
	A man walks into a Silicon Valley pet store looking to buy a  
monkey. The store owner points toward three identical monkeys in 
politically-correct, animal-friendly, natural mini-habitats. ``The 
one on the left cost $500,'' says the store owner. ``Why so much?'' 
asks the customer. ``Because it can program in C,'' answers the 
store owner. The customer inquires about the next monkey and is 
told, ``That one cost $1500, because it knows Visual C++ and 
Object-Relational technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The startled man then asks about the third monkey. ``That one  
costs $3000,'' answers the store owner. ``3000 dollars!!'' exclaims 
the man. ``What can that one do?'' To which the owner replies, ``To 
be honest, I've never seen it do a single thing, but it calls 
itself a 'Consultant'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the people behind the gag gifts began as technocrats but  
just couldn't take it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Hendin of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, left her desk job to  
open Cybereyes Inc. about a year and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was working in a cubicle and it was kind of annoying because  
I'd hear voices in the background and people were always alarming 
me when I was in the middle of doing something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her $4.99 inconspicuous wedges stick to monitors and serve as a  
rearview mirror. She's sold more than 100,000 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``People spend so much time at their computers, they're always  
looking for something amusing,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she's rolling out the spill.not, a beverage holder that  
mounts to either side of a computer monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun,'' she said. ``And a way to make money.''

<HEADLINE> Mich St. Students Arrested in Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The broken glass was swept up and the  
burnt cars were all gone Sunday as Michigan State University and 
East Lansing dealt with the aftermath of a violent disturbance by 
thousands following the school's basketball game with Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbance after Michigan State's loss in the Final Four  
left eight cars torched, 24 windows broken in downtown businesses 
and 24 people arrested -- so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they would be reviewing videotape to see if more  
arrests would be made. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 24 students arrested as of Sunday, 11 were Michigan State  
students, East Lansing Police Capt. Louis Muhn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo had planned to send his  
team back to East Lansing on Sunday. But the team stayed in Florida 
because their plane had mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo said the rampage that occurred after the Spartans' first  
apearance in the Final Four in 20 years ruined his night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally embarrassing and ridiculous. That upset me more  
than anything,'' Izzo said Sunday at the team hotel in Sand Key off 
the coast of Clearwater Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The first bottles were thrown at police officers and the first  
fire reported shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday, before the game even 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``These students would have rioted if our debate team made it to  
the Final Four,'' said Terry Denbow, Michigan State vice president 
of university relations. 
</P>
<P>
	About 230 police officers, included mounted patrols, were on the  
scene Saturday night and into early Sunday morning. Some 300 
canisters of tear gas were used to dispel groups of students that 
threatened police or firefighters.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Suspended for Two Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- All-Star center Eric Lindros of the Philadelphia  
Flyers was suspended for two games by the NHL Sunday for 
high-sticking and cutting Petr Nedved of the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros sat out the Flyers' game Sunday at Detroit and will miss  
Tuesday's home game against Carolina. He can return Thursday at 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Nedved had three facial cuts after being hit by Lindros' stick  
during Philadelphia's 3-1 victory Saturday. Lindros was given a 
double-minor penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Lindros used his stick in a careless manner and an injury  
to Mr. Nedved resulted,'' Colin Campbell, NHL senior vice president 
and director of hockey operations, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension will cost Lindros $86,458.33 in salary  
</P>
<P>
	Lindros leads the Flyers with 40 goals and 53 assists. His 93  
points are second behind Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr in the NHL.

<HEADLINE> Seinfeld Defends NYC Neighborhood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Call him the booster of his domain.  
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Seinfeld was forced to defend Manhattan's Upper West Side  
-- where he lives and where his TV show was famously set -- after an 
article by The New York Times said the area was not chic or trendy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported on March 21 that the neighborhood is no  
longer ``party central,'' and has become ``a sleepy suburb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seinfeld counterattacked in a letter published Sunday:  
</P>
<P>
	``The article said that since the Upper West Side lost Charivari  
(an expensive clothing retailer) and the China Club (a night spot), 
it's equivalent to 'a mall in Iowa.' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true. Now, to get ripped off I have to traipse all the  
way over to Madison Avenue, and to get crunched into a mass of 
pretentious drunken losers, sometimes I don't know where to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added that Upper West Siders, ``stinking from smoked  
salmon and covered in grass stains from playing in the park, are 
not going away.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. McCain: Use Troops As Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Administration officials say they have no  
plans to put combat troops on the ground in Kosovo. But one senior 
senator says the threat of such intervention may be crucial to 
ending Serb attacks on ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to exercise every option,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week.'' If Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic is convinced ground troops are an option, said McCain, a 
contender for the GOP presidential nomination, ``it could lend 
impetus to convincing him that he cannot win and we will not allow 
him to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a prisoner-of-war during the Vietnam War and a critic of  
the administration's Kosovo policies, said now that military 
strikes have begun, ``We have to do whatever it takes. All of us 
would grieve at the loss of a single American. But when you go into 
these things the primary purpose cannot be the safety of your 
forces, it has to be the achievement of your strategic and tactical 
goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But administration officials, led by Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen, repeated 
President's Clinton's position that he has no intention of sending 
ground troops to Kosovo unless the Serbs agree to the peace deal 
already signed by ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a peace settlement, then he has indicated we'd be  
prepared to contribute a small amount of a peace-keeping force, of 
the total, but absent that, we're going to continue with the air 
campaign,'' Cohen said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Hugh Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said  
it took 60,000 NATO ground troops just to keep the peace in Bosnia. 
Fighting hostile Serbian forces in Kosovo, he said, ``would involve 
hundreds of thousands of ground troops over a rather protracted 
period of time and in a very dangerous situation.''

<HEADLINE> Stephen Got Even Wins Gallery Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, Ky. (AP) -- This wasn't Bob Baffert's weekend.  
</P>
<P>
	The trainer spent all day Saturday flying from Dubai to London  
to Cincinnati only to see Straight Man, one of his 3-year-old 
prospects, fade to fourth in the $750,000 Gallery Furniture.com 
Stakes at Turfway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Sunday, the horse he left behind in the United Arab  
Emirates -- 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Silver Charm -- 
finished sixth in the eight-horse field at the $5 million Dubai 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	No, this was Nick Zito's weekend. When his colt, Stephen Got  
Even, roared past Straight Man at the top of the stretch and 
finished 2 1/2 lengths in front of K One King, Zito had another horse 
bound for the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been trying all spring to get myself into position,''  
Zito said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baffert, over the years, and Wayne (Lukas) have had a pretty  
good hand, and I just wanted to be equal with them when I go in 
this year. I think I've got a pretty strong hand now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zito, Baffert and Lukas have accounted for six of the nine Derby  
winners this decade -- Zito in 1991 with Strike the Gold and in 1994 
with Go for Gin. Lukas won two in a row with Thunder Gulch and 
Grindstone, and Baffert won the past two with Silver Charm and Real 
Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito already had one fairly solid Derby prospect -- Wondertross,  
who was second by a nose to Vicar in the Florida Derby. And Adonis 
gets another chance to redeem himself April 10 in the Wood 
Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stephen Got Even may have moved ahead of Wondertross in his  
barn, said Zito, who was thinking of taking the A.P. Indy colt to 
the Derby without another prep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really want to cool it this year because I want to be strong  
for the Derby,'' Zito said. ``We've got a ticket right now and a 
lot of times, if you've got a ticket you take it because if you 
don't, you get left out. Maybe I'll go to this Broadway show right 
from here. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Stephen Hilbert said Zito told him long ago that Stephen  
Got Even was a promising colt, even though the Gallery was only his 
fourth race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nick told us last November,'' Hilbert said. ``I said, `What  
are your plans here?' and I was thinking about the next race. And 
he said, `My plan's the first weekend in May, and that's at 
Churchill Downs.' 
</P>
<P>
	``If he stays healthy and keeps getting better, we think we've  
got a great shot at being there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert still has a top prospect, Prime Timber, and possibly  
another Triple Crown colt, General Challenge. But his best horses 
might be the fillies Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting, which 
could end up running in the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Straight Man, which has run only three times, will go back to  
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll go to Churchill and he'll have plenty of time,'' Baffert  
said. ``He didn't really run hard (Saturday). He may run in 
something like the Lexington Stakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jockey Shane Sellers rode four winners Saturday, including three  
lesser stakes, but might not be aboard Stephen Got Even again. He 
was subbing for Jerry Bailey, the regular rider, who was in Dubai 
and finished third in the World Cup with Victory Gallop.

<HEADLINE> Duke, UConn Final Was Predictable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- How fitting.  
</P>
<P>
	Way back in November the seers of college basketball put Duke  
and Connecticut atop the preseason poll. On Monday night, those 
teams will decide the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	No other schools held the No. 1 ranking this season, and it's  
been 34 years since two teams in that position played for the 
title, with UCLA beating Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have the two of us playing for the national championship is  
terrific,'' Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (37-1) has won 32 straight games, and another win would  
give it the NCAA record for victories in a season and its third 
championship of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski has taken the Blue Devils to the Final Four eight  
times since 1986, and on Monday he could become just the fourth 
coach with three or more championships. 
</P>
<P>
	His 48-12 tournament record also makes him the winningest active  
coach. Former North Carolina coach Dean Smith has the only better 
total, 65. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun, making his first Final Four  
appearance, is well aware of Krzyzewski's impressive credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about Final Fours, you're talking about Mike  
Krzyzewski,'' said Calhoun, who's in his 27th season as a head 
coach, the last 13 with the Huskies. ``He's the coach for our 
generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third-ranked Connecticut (33-2) hasn't exactly been a slouch in  
the '90s, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies have made seven regional semifinal appearances --  
tied for the most in that span -- and three in regional championship 
games. The first of those was a 79-78 loss to Duke when Christian 
Laettner hit a jumper on an inbounds play at the buzzer in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, for us, excellence hasn't been enough in the  
'90s,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since the brackets were announced two weeks ago,  
Connecticut has been looking ahead to the game most people saw as 
the tournament's best all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played this game in our minds and now we get to a chance  
to do it,'' Huskies center Jake Voskuhl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke comes in off a 68-62 victory over second-ranked Michigan  
State in the semifinals, a tough game in which the Blue Devils 
scored their fewest points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came out of that game in good health and it certainly was a  
very physical game,'' said Krzyzewski, who decided not to have the 
team practice Sunday. Instead, the team just went over some 
scouting material. 
</P>
<P>
	Win or lose, the Blue Devils will end their season on the same  
floor they did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost to eventual national champion Kentucky in the South  
Regional final at Tropicana Field after leading by 17 points in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's Trajan Langdon said that loss has provided some  
motivation, but he added that not a whole is needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In UConn being the only other team ranked number one in the  
nation and a lot of people saying that's the best team, it's a 
great way to finish the year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke won't end the year with an unprecedented double  
championship. The Blue Devils lost 62-45 Sunday night to Purdue in 
the women's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke men, who lead the nation in scoring at 92.3 per game,  
are also No. 1 in margin of victory (25.4), just off their NCAA 
tournament average of 25.2 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke's not a difficult team to prepare for,'' Calhoun said,  
``they're a difficult team to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that Duke is the heavy favorite doesn't seem to matter  
to Connecticut, which beat Ohio State 64-58 in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``At 33-2, we've been a pretty good team ourselves. We have been  
brilliant at times. We have been pragmatic at times. We have 
survived at times,'' Calhoun said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few teams have been afforded the opportunity to have the  
kind of season Duke has had,'' he said. ``Be that as it may, the 
game comes down to 40 minutes Monday night, not what some folks 
think it should be, would be, could be. It comes down to two teams 
that won 70 basketball games this season.''

<HEADLINE> Notes From Women's NCAA Title Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Stephanie White-McCarty and Ukari Figgs,  
best friends and backcourt partners for Purdue, went through vastly 
different pregame rituals before Sunday night's 62-45 win over Duke 
for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Whereas White-McCarty favors building up her energy with Reese's  
peanut butter cups and caffeine-laden Mountain Dew, Figgs goes for 
a pregame nap. 
</P>
<P>
	``I take a nap so I can pass the time a little faster,'' Figgs  
said. ``It's like a power nap. I try to replenish myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs doesn't consider the nap a good-luck ritual, but some of  
the other Boilermakers do. When she was unable to take a nap before 
a game against Ohio State in the recent Big Ten tournament, some 
teammates were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not superstitious, but a lot of my teammates are, so they  
were worried about that,'' said Figgs, who calmed their fears by 
scoring 21 points and handing out five assists in a 72-59 win over 
the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	While White-McCarty loads her body with sugar and caffeine, the  
Duke Blue Devils play games with empty stomachs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team eats five hours before games,'' Duke point guard  
Hilary Howard said. ``It took some getting used to. I used to get 
hungry in the second half.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SORORITY SISTER:* Duke point guard Hilary Howard is the first  
Blue Devils player to belong to a sorority, and that leads to 
endless ribbing from her teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard is a member of Kappa Kappa Gamma, which teammate Michele  
VanGorp jokingly refers to as Visa Visa Mastercard sorority, and 
has been receiving e-mails of encouragement from sorority sisters 
back at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	One such e-mail said, ``We're so proud you're our sister.''  
</P>
<P>
	None of the Purdue players belongs to a sorority.  
</P>
<P>
	``We call our team our sorority,'' center Camille Cooper said.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FLYING HIGH:* Purdue shooting guard Stephanie White-McCarty  
enjoys flying as much as she likes basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally an aviation major, White-McCarty said flying relaxes  
her. But it doesn't do the same for her husband, Brent. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first times she took him up in a plane, she practiced  
a flying maneuver called a ``stall,'' where the plane climbs at 
such a steep angle it seems as though the engine has stalled. Brent 
wasn't amused. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still married me,'' she said with a smile.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SWITCHING COACHES:* Before this season, Duke coach Gail  
Goestenkors switched the assignments of her assistant coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Gale Valley, who had spent the previous few years working with  
the guards, now works with the post players. Joanne Boyle switched 
from post players to the guards. 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors said she made the switch to prepare her assistants  
for head coaching jobs, but also to shake up a team that returned 
six seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	``My biggest concern with this team after last year was  
complacency, and my biggest concern with my staff was 
complacency,'' she said. ``I felt if I could change the 
responsibilities of the staff it would make them more hungry and a 
little on edge because they had to focus on another area of the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors also thought it would be good for the players to be  
exposed to a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was great,'' senior point guard Hilary Howard said.  
``We were used to doing the same things. It got us refreshed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior shooting guard Nicole Erickson also thinks the move was  
good in the long run, but found it difficult to make the switch at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little hard for us to adjust,'' she said. ``We were  
used to hearing things in a different way.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HILARY'S NICKNAME:* Duke point guard Hilary Howard is  
embarrassed when asked why teammates, teachers and friends call her 
``Hibby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was little, my mom said I needed to take a nap and I  
guess I couldn't pronounce Hilary, so I said: `Hibby doesn't,' '' 
she said. ``Now I'm 22 and it's stuck to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard is not the only Blue Devils player with a nickname. For  
the Final Four, the Duke players made up monikers for each other. 
Shooting guard Nicole Erickson was ``Bullseye'' and center Michele 
VanGorp was ``The Lanemaster.''

but a sloppily printed sign held by one Duke fan captured the 
remarkable run by the Blue Devils' basketball teams.

	The women lost in the title game to Purdue, while the men play  
Connecticut on Monday night for the national championship.

<P>
	Referring to the fact that there were more Purdue than Duke fans  
in the stands on Sunday night, the sign read: ``The reason you have 
more fans is because our men are gonna win, too.''

<HEADLINE> Celebrities Use Fame To Push Causes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Some of Hollywood's famous faces are coming  
together Monday to press for women's rights in Afghanistan, putting 
the spotlight on a tradition of Hollywood activism that some 
suggest may be growing in both its giving and its interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Sinatra, Frank Sinatra's widow, calls on friends to  
raise millions of dollars annually for her children's center, 
Elizabeth Taylor and Elton John do the same for AIDS research and 
Nancy Reagan, whose husband suffers from Alzheimer's disease, 
promotes its study. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood's younger stars have taken up newer, more diverse  
causes, too: Ted Danson's passion to stem ocean pollution, for 
instance, and Kim Basinger's vilification of animal research. 
</P>
<P>
	Their attention can prove key to the success of a cause.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is so much value in celebrity attention, even more than  
the money they give,'' said Michael Levine, author of ``Selling 
Goodness,'' a book on how charities and nonprofit groups can 
attract attention. ``They have an incredible, staggering influence 
on the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Entertainment Industry Foundation, Hollywood's key  
philanthropy, is the clearinghouse for 40,000 industry workers who 
contribute to 230 organizations. It will distribute more than $14.5 
million this year for cancer and AIDS research, child welfare and 
environmental causes, among others. That figure is up from $10 
million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	It has seen a change in giving, too, branching out from AIDS  
research, long one of the community's favorite causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Social, health and welfare issues change and so do the  
interests of celebrated individuals in our industry,'' said 
foundation President Lisa Paulsen. 
</P>
<P>
	The stars, as well as entertainment industry movers and shakers,  
managers and publicists, get daily calls from charities seeking 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of giving is done with anonymity,'' Ms. Paulsen said.  
``If you are a major star giving $1 million to a charity it puts 
you on the giving radar map and the calls start coming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there's what Levine calls ``the nuance cause.''  
</P>
<P>
	The clearest example is Jay and Mavis Leno's campaign to call  
attention to the Taliban's restrictions on 11 1/2 million Afghan 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to bring things to light. People will do the right  
thing for the most part if given a chance,'' Leno has said. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife is on the board of the Feminist Majority, which is  
leading a campaign in the United States to denounce oppression by 
the Taliban militia. The group controls about 90 percent of the 
Central Asian country, where it has imposed its strict 
interpretation of Islam that forces women to wear the veil and bars 
girls from attending school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mavis is focusing on a move toward the nuance cause, and she's  
doing a good job,'' Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Leno agrees there seems to be a shift in Hollywood  
activism. 
</P>
<P>
	And there's been no trouble getting Hollywood's support.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was instantly galvanizing to me and it has proven to be the  
same way to everyone I've told,'' Mrs. Leno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lenos donated $100,000 to the Feminist Majority's Campaign  
To Stop Gender Apartheid and Mrs. Leno chairs the fund-raising 
event Monday at the Directors Guild of America in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the guests include Kathy Bates, Natalie Cole, Claire  
Danes, Geena Davis, Delta Burke, Sally Field, Laura Dern, Melissa 
Etheridge, Daryl Hannah, Salma Hayek, Cybill Shepherd, Lily Tomlin 
and Alfre Woodard.

<HEADLINE> NATO Steps Up Air Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO lost its first plane in the  
assault on Yugoslavia and the four-day campaign intensified Sunday 
after airstrikes were ordered stepped up amid reports of worsening 
terror in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of ethnic Albanians continued streaming out of the  
separatist province into Albania, telling of roundups, forced 
expulsions, kidnappings and other allegations of brutal treatment 
by the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Air raid sirens sounded repeatedly around Yugoslavia and loud  
explosions were heard in Belgrade on Sunday morning, as NATO said 
it was taking the campaign into a new phase to target Serb forces 
acting in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as the stepped-up campaign began, however, NATO suffered  
its first loss. An F-117A stealth fighter crashed Saturday night 
inside Serbia, and the pilot was rescued in good condition by a 
combat rescue team, the U.S. Defense Department said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said they did not know the cause of the crash,  
and refused to give details about the rescue. Pentagon spokesman 
Kenneth Bacon said the jet's downing wouldn't affect the expanded 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials claimed the jet was shot down near  
Budjanovic, 30 miles northwest of Belgrade, and television showed 
the tangled, burning wreckage of a U.S. plane, hours before 
Washington confirmed the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Night Hawk plucked by Yugoslav air defense,'' boasted the  
state news agency Tanjug, using the jet's nickname. 
</P>
<P>
	The stealth fighter, designed to avoid most radar detection, had  
never been shot down in combat. 
</P>
<P>
	Protests continued Sunday at U.S. embassies in many capitals,  
including Moscow where shots were fired outside the building. 
Witnesses said the gunfire came from a vehicle which then drove 
off. There were no reports of injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said Saturday the assault  
had been ordered stepped up and would target tanks, artillery and 
troops in Kosovo. He said the move was needed to halt violence in 
Kosovo and ``prevent further humanitarian catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are now concentrating our attention on specific groups of  
people who are terrorizing villages,'' British Defense Secretary 
George Robertson said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Albania, U.N. refugee agency workers said about 2,000 more  
refugees crossed the border from Kosovo during the night. The 
government said 20,000 refugees had arrived late Saturday, mostly 
women and children from villages around Prizren in southern Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The fleeing ethnic Albanians, many of them weeping, related  
accounts of door-to-door raids by Serb gangs, looting, burning and 
other human rights violations -- accounts which were impossible to 
verify. 
</P>
<P>
	The first phase of NATO's attack, relying heavily on cruise  
missiles, was aimed partly at taking out air defense systems and 
focused on a period of a few hours after nightfall. But Belgrade 
remained under continuous alert for more than 10 hours Saturday 
night and Sunday morning -- the longest period since attacks began 
Wednesday -- and there were more reports of attacks within hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Large thuds were heard in the capital Sunday morning. Tanjug  
said NATO planes attacked before and after sunrise, targeting both 
the suburban air force base of Batajnica and the nearby region of 
Jakovo. Two other missiles cracked windows at Belgrade's main 
civilian airport. Other missiles fell near Cacak, site of a huge 
military factory in central Serbia, Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kosovo, Tanjug said four allied bombs fell on an army  
barracks outside Prizren, setting it ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, in a statement praising the pilot of the  
crashed plane and his rescuers, said the loss of the warplane would 
not deter the campaign. ``The continued brutality and repression of 
the Serbian forces further underscores the necessity for NATO 
forces to persevere,'' he said. Clinton and British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair on Saturday repeated their insistence that NATO had to 
act to prevent Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces from 
carrying out ``ethnic cleansing'' in separatist Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting with his foreign policy team, Clinton spoke with  
the leaders of key NATO allies Italy, Germany, Britain and France 
and agreed to proceed with the next phase of airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook warned Milosevic on Sunday:  
``Give up now, you're not going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The longer this continues, the more damage that will be done  
to his military,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, quoted in Sunday's La  
Repubblica newspaper, said NATO attacks would ``end when they reach 
their objectives. However, I don't believe it's a matter of hours. 
It is a certainly a question of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO raids are intended to force Milosevic to agree to a  
peace deal that calls for NATO troops to be based in Kosovo to keep 
the peace. The deal has already been accepted by the province's 
ethnic Albanian majority. 
</P>
<P>
	But Milosevic, through an official government statement issued  
Saturday, again rejected the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The citizens of Yugoslavia are unanimous in their resolve not  
to allow at any cost the enemies to occupy their country,'' said 
the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesmen have said there were no current plans to send  
troops into Kosovo, as ethnic Albanian separatist rebels urged. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel ethnic Albanian leader Hashim Thaci, who wants NATO to  
send in ground troops, called Saturday the ``worst day since the 
struggle began.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview with the Austria Press Agency, he said  
scores of people were killed in Djakovica in western Kosovo and 
accused Serb forces of ``rampaging like wild animals,'' raping 
women and shooting people. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanjug reported Saturday that gangs of ethnic Albanians had  
staged several attacks on Serbian police and Yugoslav army troops 
in Prizren. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent monitors left Kosovo before the bombing and almost  
all foreign journalists were kicked out of the province, making it 
impossible to confirm claims about the situation.

<HEADLINE> Purdue's Figs Overcomes Cold Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Purdue's Ukari Figgs wasn't about to let  
it end this way. After failing to score a point in the first half, 
she came out in the second to make sure the Boilermakers got their 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had 20 minutes to be a winner or a loser,'' Figgs  
said after an 18-point second-half performance. ``I don't like 
being a loser.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs has played most of her collegiate career in the shadow of  
fellow guard and Indiana star Stephanie White-McCarty. She 
certainly continued that in the first half against Duke on Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior guard went 0-for-7 from the floor and the shortcoming  
reflected on her entire team. The Boilermakers trailed 22-17 at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	She scored her first basket 17 seconds into the second half.  
Less than a minute later, she scored again, bringing Purdue within 
22-21. The Boilermakers wrestled for the lead, but didn't take it 
until Figgs' driving layup at 12:57 made it 32-30. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with that go-ahead basket, Figgs had eight points as  
Purdue went on a 12-4 run to extend the lead to 42-34. The 
Boilermakers easily led the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	When Figgs finally caught fire, White-McCarty casually held out  
her hand as she passed by her best friend during a lull in play. 
Figgs hit it, and each smiled. The Boilermakers were making their 
big move. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs and White-McCarty capped their college careers with a  
62-45 victory over Duke for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought earlier in the first half she was looking for a shot  
a little bit, but she was going to figure the game out,'' Duke 
coach Gail Goestenkors said of Figgs. ``She used her quickness, her 
speed, her athleticism and really got to the basket.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty and Figgs form what has been called the best  
women's backcourt in the country. Figgs quietly and competently 
played her game, while White-McCarty grabbed a lot of the attention 
in her home state -- leading many of their teammates to call Figgs 
Purdue's unsung hero. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs proved her worth during the Final Four. Against Louisiana  
Tech in the semifinals, Figgs scored 24 points, 18 in the first 
half. She also had 10 rebounds and went 5-of-7 on 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Final Four and the eventual national championship were the  
culmination of a turbulent tenure at Purdue for both Figgs and 
White-McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
	Both started as high school standouts. White-McCarty reached  
megastar status in the small town of West Lebanon, and was named 
Miss Basketball in Indiana. Figgs was Miss Basketball in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	Both chose Purdue, but after their freshman year, coach Lin Dunn  
was fired. Then sophomore-year coach Nell Fortner left to coach the 
U.S. Women's National Team. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players, including Duke's Nicole Erickson and Michele  
VanGorp, gave up on Purdue and transferred. 
</P>
<P>
	Figgs and White-McCarty stayed, and it paid off when Purdue  
assistant Carolyn Peck was named coach. Together, they began a 
two-year quest that landed them at the San Jose Arena on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Peck said that under Fortner, Figgs and White-McCarty made a  
commitment to winning at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you saw that from them,'' the coach said, ``you knew this  
was going to be something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White-McCarty was more steady Sunday night with 12 points,  
including eight in the first half, but left the game with about 
four minutes to go with a severe ankle sprain. As White-McCarty 
wailed in pain from the bench, Figgs made sure the Boilermakers 
stayed focused. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steph and I have been through so much together,'' she said.  
``We dreamed about it, we talked about winning a national 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the final buzzer sounded and many of the rest of their  
teammates celebrated at midcourt, Figgs headed to the bench and 
threw her arms around White-McCarty, by then on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
	Each cried tears of joy.

<HEADLINE> Stock Valuations Continue To Amaze / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors who insist on finding good value  
before they buy stocks have had a frustrating time in the first 
quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The supposedly overpriced blue chips, which soared much higher  
than the rest of the market in 1998, have gained still more ground 
in the January-March period. 
</P>
<P>
	And the depressed small stocks, widely described as cheaper in  
relative terms than they have ever been before, have posted further 
losses since the new year began. 
</P>
<P>
	Powered by the seemingly unstoppable blue chips, the Dow Jones  
average of 30 industrials has cracked the 10,000 barrier in recent 
days, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's composite index has broken 1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 index, a widely recognized gauge of  
trends in smaller stocks, has extended last year's declines, and 
languishes about 20 percent below the best levels it reached last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite solid earnings growth, emerging growth stocks are on  
one of their longest losing streaks on record,'' says L. Keith 
Mullins, an analyst who specializes in smaller stocks at the 
brokerage firm of Salomon Smith Barney Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	All this demonstrates that following the simple old adage ``buy  
cheap and sell dear'' is no simple job. Indeed, all through the 
bull market of the past 17 years, it has been a very chancy 
proposition to try to gauge when any group of stocks, or the market 
as a whole, was over- or undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
	At Dow 10,000 and S&AMP;P 1,300, many people consider the blue chips  
overvalued by as much as 20 percent. The aggregate price-earnings 
ratio of the S&AMP;P 500, recently hovering around 34, looks 
outlandishly high by historical standards. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts have been complaining about overvaluation ever  
since the bull market got rolling. The Dow has climbed more than 50 
percent since Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, 
issued his first warning about ``irrational exuberance'' in 
December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Greg Smith, investment strategist at Prudential Securities,  
``This is an exciting period of time for the U.S. stock market. 
There are plenty of naysayers out there, however, who claim that 
this good stock market can't last. Part of their concern is a 
notion that the stock market is very overvalued. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's dangerous to try to quantify a market's degree of over-  
or under-valuation,'' Smith says. ``Market valuation models are 
only as reliable as their underlying assumptions, which often bear 
little resemblance to reality. If you have low inflation and low 
interest rates, chances are good you don't have an overvalued stock 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even those who say stocks are overvalued right now acknowledge  
that such an insight doesn't help you pick the best moment to jump 
in or out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``History shows that valuation matters, but not all the time,''  
says Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities 
Inc. ``Overvalued markets can get even more overvalued before the 
eventual correction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trick, not easy to pull off, is to distinguish between  
market gains that correctly anticipate future earnings growth, and 
those that merely represent a bandwagon effect. 
</P>
<P>
	As the newsletter Dow Theory Forecasts in Hammond, Ind., puts  
it, ``Momentum that is self-fulfilling can be dangerous if not 
supported by comparable growth in a company's value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trying to make this distinction now, Smith says he is keeping  
a close watch on interest rates. ``If interest rates were to move 
into the 6 percent area, the stock market would be at significant 
risk,'' he suggests. ``But if inflation stays low and interest 
rates stay steady, as I expect, the risk to this stock market's 
valuation is not anywhere near what many forecasters have 
suggested, in my opinion.''

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Mike Petke scored on a header off a  
free kick in the 80th minute, lifting the New York-New Jersey 
MetroStars over the Columbus Crew 1-0 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the second in a row for the MetroStars, who opened  
their season last week with a 3-2 shootout victory at Miami. It was 
the season opener for Columbus, and the first win ever for the 
MetroStars in a home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Petke got his second career goal when he powered his header past  
goalkeeper Mark Dougherty after Miles Joseph's pass to the far 
post. A foul by defender Michael Clark on Petke set up the free 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	The Crew had its best scoring opportunity when Jason Farrell  
drilled a 28-yard shot that goalkeeper Mike Ammenn tipped off the 
crossbar.

<HEADLINE> Jordan As Owner Is Easy To Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It's easy to picture Michael Jordan as an  
executive. Dressed in the finest suit money can buy, chomping on a 
cigar in his office and simply taking charge, as he did so often on 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than three months removed from his second retirement as a  
player, Jordan is considering a move to the other side of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Hornets officials and those with the NBA say Jordan  
spoke with team owner George Shinn earlier this month about buying 
a 50 percent share of the NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan also told the Charlotte Observer he had met with John  
Fennebresque, who is in charge of developing a new arena for the 
Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Chicago Sun-Times, which cited unidentified  
sources in an article Sunday, Jordan and agent David Falk were in 
the Bahamas, discussing the move from retired player to part-time 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is something Michael wants to do, I'm all for it  
because he's earned the right to do whatever he wants to do,'' 
Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf told the newspaper Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also believe he would make a good owner. He is good at  
everything he does. Michael is very bright and has very good 
insight into things that he focuses on. So, I'm sure he would be a 
plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf said several years ago he had briefly talked to Jordan  
about buying into the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That wasn't an offer,'' Reinsdorf said. ``I asked him if he'd  
like to be. He said no. He said he didn't think he would enjoy 
being an owner because he thought he would not be tolerant of the 
players. And that was it. It was a 30-second conversation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reinsdorf, speaking to the Chicago Tribune from spring training  
in Arizona, speculated that Jordan would want to hire Phil Jackson 
as his coach. He said he would like to see Falk become general 
manager because ``then he (Jordan) will save all the rest of the 
teams a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets officials said that no firm dates had been set for the  
two sides to meet again but that both parties had agreed to stay in 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Shinn was granted an expansion franchise for $32.5 million and  
was revered in Charlotte when the Hornets made their debut in 1988. 
Now, he's gotten the reputation for refusing to pay the big money 
to keep top players -- the Hornets lost stars Alonzo Mourning, Larry 
Johnson and Glen Rice from a team that once appeared on its way to 
the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dave Cowens resigned in frustration this month, and fans  
have been staying away with attendance dropping the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan is a North Carolina native and the most famous alumnus of  
the University of North Carolina. He hit the game-winning shot to 
give Dean Smith his first national title in 1982, and his presence 
would be a big boost immediately to the lagging franchise -- even if 
it was from the board room and not the court.

<HEADLINE> NASA Copes With Space Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The cry came at the five-minute mark  
in the countdown: Smoke in the cabin! 
</P>
<P>
	As the master alarm sounded in the space shuttle cockpit, launch  
controllers swiftly determined that not one but two detectors were 
indicating high concentrations of smoke. So the urgent order was 
given: Mode 1 egress. 
</P>
<P>
	That's NASA talk for get out of the shuttle, jump into the  
emergency baskets at the top of the pad, and hurtle down the slide 
wires to safety -- NOW. 
</P>
<P>
	As suddenly as it arose, the tension in Firing Room 1 eased.  
``This is as good an opportunity as any to stop,'' the lead launch 
controller called out. With that, the make-believe countdown ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalk up one more dry run for the Kennedy Space Center launch  
team, forced to pretend because of a lack of space shuttle action. 
</P>
<P>
	A shuttle hasn't soared since Dec. 4 and another isn't due to  
take off until May 20 or 24 -- a gap of at least 167 days, or almost 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the longest drought in shuttle launches since the fleet was  
grounded for 975 days, or more than 2 1/2 years, following the 1986 
Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The unspoken fear is that launch controllers might become rusty  
and make a fatal mistake during the high-pressured final minutes of 
an actual countdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Launch director Ralph Roe liked what he saw at the mid-March  
drill, though he said controllers need to be more concise and 
prompt in their responses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't notice any rust per se,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Assuming a rustproof team is calling the shots, the chance of a  
catastrophic accident is 1-in-438 during liftoff, according to 
NASA's latest estimates. That compares with 1-in-78 odds just a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	What's different between now and then is computer technology,  
which allows for a more thorough and updated risk assessment, says 
William Readdy, an astronaut who serves as shuttle program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this year's slowdown especially troubling is NASA's  
meager flight rate of late. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Discovery takes off with supplies for the  
international space station in May, shuttles will have flown only 
four times in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The preferred flight rate is seven or eight per year.  
</P>
<P>
	Russia is to blame, as is a stalled telescope.  
</P>
<P>
	Because of Russia's inability to complete a crucial part of the  
international space station, all shuttle assembly flights, except 
for the one by Discovery in May, are on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	And a mission to deliver NASA's Chandra X-ray telescope to orbit  
keeps getting bumped because of bad circuit boards and other 
problems. It's scheduled to soar aboard Columbia in July. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep skills sharp -- and prevent another shuttle accident --  
NASA has summoned its launch team three times since February for 
morning and afternoon training sessions, many more rounds than 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
	It did the same thing during last year's 149-day launch  
stoppage, also caused by space station and telescope delays. The 
hiatus ended with John Glenn's triumphant flight aboard Discovery 
at the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel applauded the training  
sessions in its 1998 annual report, saying they were ``a 
significant factor in the smooth resumption of operations.'' The 
panel urged that the sessions continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Aside from that, what else can you do? You'd rather be  
launching,'' said Seymour Himmel, a former NASA official who is on 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	This month's morning exercise, the fifth of eight training  
sessions planned before Discovery flies in May, had launch 
controllers scrambling to fat reference books. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no fire, no crew, not even a shuttle on the pad for  
the drill, just 150 men and women at their launch day posts being 
bombarded by malfunctions dreamed up by fellow engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides two fake fires, the launch team sweated over improperly  
set valves, faulty booster heaters, popped circuit breakers, failed 
hydraulics and leaking propellants. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA usually doesn't have that many problems in a single  
countdown, let alone in the final nine to 20 minutes, the crucial 
segment that controllers keep practicing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past three years especially, we've had countdowns where  
we haven't talked about anything and there's no training value in 
that,'' said launch director Roe. ``What we're doing now is 
exercising them more than if we just sat through a perfectly good 
countdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the rehearsed problems have rarely, if ever, occurred in  
18 years of space shuttle flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire, for instance, has never erupted inside a shuttle on the  
launch pad. (It has, though, in an Apollo spacecraft; in 1967, 
three astronauts died inside their burning capsule.) 
</P>
<P>
	And astronauts have never had to escape down the emergency slide  
wires, which stretch 1,200 feet from the 195-foot level of the 
launch pad to the ground. Only one astronaut has ever taken the 
terrifying basket ride; a safety official who took part in that 
same trial run screamed all the way down. 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that such perilous events have little chance of  
happening. They tax a person's knowledge under stress, says Himmel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Believe me, once you're sitting at a console and you're  
looking at the data,'' he said, ``you quickly get caught up in the 
thing and you can't distinguish it from the real thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, Roe looked beat following 3 1/2 hours of launch practice  
that began at 7:30 a.m. sharp. He'd led his team through three 
countdowns, each one leading up to a scant five-minute launch 
window, the kind required for station assembly flights. Another 
round was scheduled for the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extremely real,'' Roe said during his brief lunch break.  
``You get that same stress level, I think, by the high number of 
problems and sticking to the time constraints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until this year, Roe's team rehearsed countdowns that mimicked  
the standard 2 1/2-hour launch window, allowing for prolonged 
discussion of most every problem. But following December's one-day 
delay in launching Endeavour to the international space station, 
Roe and others decided it would be better to practice under the 
severe time constraints of assembly flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers took too long discussing a cockpit alarm aboard  
Endeavour in the final minutes of the Dec. 3 countdown and 
consequently missed the launch cutoff by less than two seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't training as well as we could have,'' Roe said.  
However, he's quick to point out that now they are. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is in the midst of the longest drought in space shuttle  
launches since the Challenger disaster. Here's how the gaps stack 
up: 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1. Fleet grounded 975 days following the January 1986  
Challenger accident. Flights resumed in September 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 2. No shuttle launches for at least 167 days, from December  
1998 until May 1999, because of stalled space station construction 
and problems with an X-ray telescope that should have been placed 
in orbit last year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 3. Fleet grounded 165 days because of dangerous hydrogen fuel  
leaks, from April 1990 until October 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 4. No shuttle launches for 149 days, from April 1998 until  
October 1998, because of stalled space station construction and 
problems with the same X-ray telescope.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's leading leftist party has asked  
national regulators to nullify results from its party leadership 
election due to irregularities reported at more than a quarter of 
polling stations, media reports said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The elections committee of the Democratic Revolution Party said  
1,506 of its 5,351 voting booths reported problems such as improper 
changes in polling station officials and booth locations, and 
impossibly high voting totals. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee filed its request Saturday, and the National  
Commission on Guarantees and Vigilance will rule on it within four 
days, the daily La Jornada reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The March 14 vote was the first national election for a top  
party official in Mexico in which rank and file party members were 
allowed to vote. More than 500,000 people cast ballots. At stake 
was the party presidency, plus the post of secretary-general and 
128 national council seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Incomplete results in the party president vote showed a tight  
race between Amalia Garcia, a governor's daughter and former 
Communist arty reformer, and Jose Ortega, a 1970s student activist 
and past member of socialist parties.

between Colombian leaders and rebels from the leftist National 
Liberation Army in Maracaibo, the capital of Zulia state, which 
borders Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel told reporters Sunday that  
``state governors cannot carry out foreign policy in this matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arias Cardenas was a co-leader of a failed 1992 coup attempt

<HEADLINE> SLOC Trying To Cut Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Tough restrictions on new hires at the  
Salt Lake Organizing Committee are aimed at cutting costs, but they 
are hitting SLOC managers where it hurts. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, SLOC president Mitt Romney announced  
cost-cutting measures aimed at slashing $17 million from the 
organization's $1.4 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC still awaits $288 million in sponsorship contracts, and  
until that money is assured, Romney has planned for lean times, 
especially since the Olympic bribery scandal has put would-be 
sponsors in a holding posture. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney hoped to save $6 million from the freeze.  
</P>
<P>
	``This freeze does not mean we won't hire anybody for six  
months,'' said Ed Eynon, senior vice president for human resources. 
``It does mean we want to delay some hires, or perhaps do some job 
eliminations, in order to yield $6 million in savings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's supposed to happen in six months, meaning the committee  
has to save $1 million per month. The entire senior staff is 
scrutinizing open positions, determining if the jobs can be delayed 
or wiped out entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's been very helpful and supportive, but with a lot  
of pain,'' Eynon said. ``It means just that much more work for 
those who are already here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right now 188 people work for SLOC, about 20 fewer than the  
committee expected to have. Under Romney's schedule, the staff will 
be 50 positions below projections at the end of the six-month 
moratorium, Eynon said. 
</P>
<P>
	That is substantial for an organization expected to max out at  
800 people within the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Teen-Age Boy Wears Dress to Prom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIERSON, Fla. (AP) -- An 18-year-old senior walked into his high  
school prom in high-heeled shoes that matched his red satin evening 
gown. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Rice had worn women's clothing before, but he had to  
fight to wear a dress to the dance Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal at Taylor High School had said earlier in the  
month that Rice could not attend the dance in drag, citing concerns 
for the teen's safety and the potential for a major disruption of 
the prom. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, who is gay, said he felt he was being discriminated  
against because of his sexual orientation. He was in the process of 
hiring an attorney when the school reversed its decision last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Bill Hall said the decision had been reversed  
based on unique circumstances that led to advice from school 
district attorneys that ``we were not in a favorable position 
legally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Hall said that in the future, no male students could  
follow Rice's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice had dressed in drag at past events -- as the master of  
ceremonies of a school talent show last spring and at last fall's 
homecoming dance. There were no problems at either event. 
</P>
<P>
	When he arrived after 7 p.m., most students were already inside  
the Plaza Resort &AMP; Spa. Hotel employees forced the media off the 
property at the request of school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very nervous,'' Rice said. ``I'm very excited to go in and  
be with my friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He showed off his floor-length gown and rhinestone necklace  
while he fielded questions from reporters. Even without the high 
heels, at over six feet tall Rice towers over most of his 
classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Most students believed that Principal Pete Oatman's initial  
decision to deny Rice entry to the prom drew unwanted attention to 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's gotten blown out of proportion,'' said senior Jennifer  
Strickland. ``If he had said yes to begin with, half the parents 
wouldn't have known (Rice) was a guy. I've seen him dressed up and 
you can't tell until you look at his feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all students were happy with the results.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won't look back and talk about who went with whom,'' said  
senior Chris Gregory. ``It'll be, 'We went to prom and Charles wore 
a dress.'''

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Scorns NATO Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Extending a simmering dispute, Russian  
President Boris Yeltsin will tell the Russian parliament Tuesday 
that NATO's ``strong-arm'' tactics in Yugoslavia are unacceptable. 
But he will also reaffirm his commitment to sharp reductions in 
nuclear weapons arsenals and to ``constructive cooperation'' with 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state-of-the-nation message, the Russian leader again  
blasts the bombing of Serbs as a violation of international law 
standards. The use of force in Kosovo and also in Iraq is 
``dangerous and inadmissible,'' Yeltsin says, according to portions 
of his prepared speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's speech, excerpts from which were obtained by The  
Associated Press Sunday night from RIA Novosti, the Russian 
information agency, reflected both the rift and an otherwise 
cooperative spirit in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	On the domestic front, Yeltsin renews his commitment to market  
reform and blames conservatives in the Duma as well as government 
authorities for placing hurdles in its path. 
</P>
<P>
	``The policy launched in the early 1990s and aimed at creating a  
market economy in the country has been and remains correct,'' 
Yeltsin says. ``The country has no other road to follow. So the 
general direction must be maintained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On that, there is deep agreement with the Clinton  
administration, which has tried to nurture Russia's transition from 
communism to capitalism. But on Kosovo, the differences are deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, to protest the decision to have NATO warplanes attack  
the Serbs with missiles and bombs, Yeltsin suspended Russia's ties 
with NATO and recalled his chief military representative to the 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov called off talks in  
Washington with Vice President Al Gore, ordered his jetliner to 
turn around over the Atlantic and returned to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright attempted to  
heal the rift. Albright, in a series of telephone conversations 
with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, said the two countries should 
agree to disagree over Kosovo but not let that deter cooperation in 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``The use of force and, the more so, the violation of the  
international law standards is dangerous and inadmissible,'' 
Yeltsin says of the assault on the Serbs, in its fifth day Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defrosting'' of the chill between Russia and NATO ``depends on  
how soon the alliance will realize the peril of the military option 
towards Yugoslavia,'' Yeltsin says. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, he also says, ``Moscow attaches a great importance to  
the normalization of the Russian-American relations, the return to 
a constructive cooperation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pledges in the prepared message to continue a joint effort  
with the United States to reduce nuclear weapons arsenals as a 
priority goal and urges India and Pakistan to sign the nuclear test 
ban accord and to join an international treaty designed to curb the 
spread of nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The START II treaty, concluded more than six years ago, remains  
unratified by the Russian parliament. Yeltsin's statement amounts 
to an assurance to Washington that despite differences over Kosovo 
he intends to keep seeking approval of the pact, which sharply 
reduces long-range nuclear weapons stockpiles on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia is against dividing lines in Europe, both old and  
new,'' Yeltsin says in the address.

Kosovo. The Pentagon announced that more American warplanes, 
including B-52 long-range bombers, would be added to the nearly 200 
already participating in Operation Allied Force. Spokesman Ken 
Bacon said between six and 12 planes would go, and Britain

	MOSCOW (AP) -- Gunmen with rocket launchers and an assault rifle  
opened fire today on the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, the site of three 
days of protests against NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia. No one was 
hurt. Police firing pistols drove the attackers away from the 
embassy, which was hit by several bullets but suffered minimal 
damage. No one claimed responsibility for the attack. Russian news

said more than 500,000 ethnic Albanians, a quarter of the 
population of Kosovo, had been driven from their homes, 50,000 of 
them in just the past few days. ``We have to recognize that we are 
now on the brink of a major humanitarian disaster ... the likes of

the West Bank until the Palestinians meet their commitments under

that the United States still expects Israel to act on other aspects 
of the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords. ``If you read the Wye 
agreement you see that the handover of territory is the last step,

<HEADLINE> Matt Groening High on New Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Matt Groening, creator of ``The Simpsons,'' is a  
little sad that Bart, Homer and the gang don't offend people like 
they once did. 
</P>
<P>
	``'The Simpsons' used to be the downfall of Western  
civilization,'' says Groening, adding that he loved complaints that 
the show undermined parental authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Groening also says in TV Guide's April 3 edition that he has a  
lot of confidence in his new animated series, ``Futurama,'' a 
science fiction spoof set 1,000 years in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	He had originally written a part for the late Phil Hartman, who  
was to have voiced space commander Zapp Branigan. In the comedian's 
honor, the unspoken first name of the show's hero, Fry, is Phillip.

<HEADLINE> NY Senate Hopefuls Wait for Hillary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Snowmobilers are slicing trails through a  
fresh coating of March snow outside the Partridge Berry Inn as Rep. 
Nita Lowey fields questions from northern New York Democrats 
polishing off a hearty Sunday brunch inside. The first query is a 
telling one. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your name,'' one woman asks, appearing to waver on just what  
the six-term congresswoman's name actually name is. ``Could you 
spell it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Democratic party faithful in Republican-dominated  
Jefferson County admit they did not have a clue who Lowey was 
before the lawmaker who represents parts of New York City and 
suburban Westchester County ventured north for this Senate 
audition. But they have heard plenty about the race -- still some 20 
months away -- because of a woman with a household name. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hillary Clinton,'' St. Lawrence County Democratic Party chief  
Stephen Burke gushed. ``She really is something. If she runs it is 
some race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about Lowey inevitably turns to Mrs. Clinton these days.  
</P>
<P>
	Lowey has spent the last 11 years building a record on abortion  
rights, education and health care. Nevertheless, she is now cast as 
understudy to the first lady -- ready to assume the mantle of 
Democratic Senate candidate should Mrs. Clinton decide not to run -- 
and equally prepared to step aside gracefully if she does. 
</P>
<P>
	The 61-year-old Lowey is a candidate in limbo, but she is not  
sitting still. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton ponders whether she should enter the glare of  
a New York Senate race for the seat Daniel Patrick Moynihan is 
leaving in 2000, Lowey criss-crosses the state, laying the 
groundwork in case the first lady says no. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Hillary is seriously considering running for the  
Senate and I've made it clear that if she does I would support 
her,'' Lowey said. ``In the meantime, I'm doing what I have to do 
to prepare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means raising money.  
</P>
<P>
	At last count, Lowey had more than $800,000 in her congressional  
campaign account, an impressive figure given that many Democrats 
are keeping their pocketbooks sealed waiting for Mrs. Clinton's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent weekend she pressed the flesh at the Hispanic  
legislative dinner in Albany, working the room like a seasoned pol 
and hugging well-wishers with grandmotherly affection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, she's wonderful,'' Jackie Velasquez said of Lowey at the  
black-tie dinner. ``If Hillary Clinton wasn't in the picture, I 
think she'd be a great candidate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early the next morning, Lowey set off with her chief of staff  
for the more than three-hour drive to Watertown, in upstate New 
York not far from the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
	At the brunch there she jokes about living in Mrs. Clinton's  
shadow, playing off the first lady's own teasing remarks at a 
recent New York City luncheon about whether she had an announcement 
to make on the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watertown would be a great place to make an announcement,''  
Lowey said. ``And the announcement is that I am running for first 
lady of the United States!'' 
</P>
<P>
	To put the stature of the two prospective Senate candidates in  
perspective: Mrs. Clinton's New York City Plaza Hotel luncheon on 
March 3 raised $500,000 for the Democratic National Committee. At 
the Watertown brunch, Jefferson County Democrats raised about $100 
by raffling off a wooden bird house. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowey would be an early underdog in a race against Giuliani  
based on name recognition. But it would not be the first time she 
beat the odds. 
</P>
<P>
	When Lowey, who is Jewish, first ran for the House in 1988, her  
better-known opponent derided her as ``Bella Abzug without the 
hat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since winning that race, the former PTA president has  
established herself more as a centrist than an Abzug liberal. 
</P>
<P>
	She earned the wrath of some Democrats when she cast votes for  
President Clinton's welfare reform plan and the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	She was an early booster of breast cancer research and is know  
as a champion of school construction and after-school programs. In 
1993, the mother of three and grandmother of four landed a plum 
post on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	With a record like that, does Lowey like playing backup to a  
woman who has never run for elective office? 
</P>
<P>
	``I have an effective record of accomplishments in the House  
that I am proud of,'' she says. ``But Hillary is in a unique 
position ... and I respect her decision-making process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lowey's ever-present smile tightens a bit as she answers yet  
more questions about Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope in the next couple of months she makes a  
decision,'' she said. ``I think it's necessary that she makes a 
decision.''

<HEADLINE> Fusion 2, Revolution 1, Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Tyrone Marshall tied the game with  
four minutes remaining and Diego Serna scored in the final round of 
the shootout as the Miami Fusion beat the New England Revolution 
2-1 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Serna beat former Italian national team goalkeeper Walter Zenga,  
the Revolution's player-coach, to give Miami a 4-3 advantage in the 
shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	New England lost its opener despite setting an MLS record for  
quickest goal to start a game and a superb outing from Zenga. He 
made eight saves, including a 79th minute penalty kick by Nelson 
Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	New England, the worst team in MLS last year, took a 1-0 lead 22  
seconds into the game on a Giovanni Savarese goal. That beat the 
previous MLS record of 26 seconds by the Revolution's Johnny Torres 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion was awarded a penalty kick in the 78th minute when  
Serna was tackled by New England's Richard Goulooze, but Zenga 
stopped Vargas' shot to maintain the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami tied it on Marshall's goal, a header that started with a  
pass from Carlos Valderrama.

<HEADLINE> Duke Women's Title Bid Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Students gathered around a giant-screen TV  
in Cameron Indoor Stadium to cheer for what they hoped would be the 
first of two Duke basketball championships on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Things didn't quite turn out that way.  
</P>
<P>
	Purdue defeated Duke 62-45 to win the NCAA women's championship  
and doused a potential on-campus celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	The students now must rely on the men for a national title. The  
Blue Devils play Connecticut on Monday night in St. Petersburg, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	For many of the approximately 1,000 students who crowded the  
floor at Cameron, the women's team provided more thrills than the 
men late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most exciting game I've watched all year,'' said  
Jason Belk, a senior from Raleigh. ``They're used to be a 
difference between men's basketball and women's basketball at Duke, 
but there isn't any more. It's almost more exciting to watch the 
women because it's unexpected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're just as important as the men's team,'' said Shannon  
Dooley, a freshman from Raleigh. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the final seconds of Purdue's victory ticked away, the  
students filed quietly out of the arena and headed back to their 
dorms. A small group lingered outside in the grassy quad at the 
center of campus after the game had ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never expected the women to get this far. We're really  
happy for them,'' said Nicole Hess, a sophomore from Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Junker, 23, an alumnus and a native of Germany, came back  
to Durham from his homeland just to experience the Final Four 
atmosphere. He said the disappointment will be much more widespread 
if the men lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we don't win with the men, it's going to be much worse,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> New Kilborn Show Just Like Old One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Craig Kilborn is pragmatic about his new  
upcoming late-night TV program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just going to be a talk show with me and two or three  
guests,'' Kilborn, 35, told Newsday. ``You can't reinvent the 
wheel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Late Show with Craig Kilborn'' premieres early Tuesday on  
CBS. Along with guests, the show will include the wry news satire 
that vaulted Kilborn to fame on Comedy Central's ``Daily Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A signature segment where Kilborn poses five oddball or  
subjective questions to celebrity guests will also be a staple of 
the new show. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kilborn insists he won't be as scripted as he was on Comedy  
Central. 
</P>
<P>
	``The chains will be off,'' he said. ``I look forward to seeing  
where the goofiness will be.''

<HEADLINE> Lenos Seeks Money for Afghan Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Talk show host Jay Leno and his wife, Mavis,  
are among the celebrities hoping to raise money today to alleviate 
the plight of women living under strict religious rules in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Leno is on the board of the Feminist Majority, which is  
leading a campaign to denounce oppression by the Taliban militia. 
The Taliban controls about 90 percent of the Central Asian country, 
where it has imposed its strict interpretation of Islam that forces 
women to wear the veil and bars girls from attending school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a strong sense that a lot of people of both sexes have  
been wanting to make a gesture toward women and say to the world, 
`When we say human rights, we mean women's rights also,''' said 
Mrs. Leno. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she's had no trouble getting Hollywood's support.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was instantly galvanizing to me and it has proven to be the  
same way to everyone I've told,'' Mrs. Leno said. ``Once people 
understand this is not the culture or the nature of Islam, that 
it's something imposed from the outside, they are with us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lenos donated $100,000 to the Feminist Majority's Campaign  
to stop Gender Apartheid. Mrs. Leno will chair the fund-raising 
event today at the Directors Guild of America in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raiser will also serve as an educational session, with  
celebrities reading edicts of the Taliban and Afghan refugees 
describing their ordeals. Some of the guests include the singer 
Natalie Cole, and actresses Kathy Bates, Claire Danes, Geena Davis, 
and Sally Field.

<HEADLINE> Danes Not the Picture of Angst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Claire Danes, whose image became synonymous  
with teen-age angst in ``My So-Called Life,'' has a simple solution 
for enjoying her real life -- ditch the suffocating team of agents, 
managers and publicists. 
</P>
<P>
	``I live in New York; I go to school; I have a network of  
friends who are entirely unrelated to the business,'' she said. 
``The majority of my friendships are with people like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And when school is in session, Danes lives in a campus dorm with  
a roommate, the Daily News of Los Angeles reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I function on campus pretty well,'' she said. ``People who  
meet me are immediately disillusioned and are not awkward around 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danes, 19, is a freshman at Yale, the alma mater of her friend  
and mentor Jodie Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Danes appears in ``The Mod Squad,'' which was just released, as  
recovering addict Julie Barnes.

<HEADLINE> Duvals Share Winning Moments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- The Duval Double is complete.  
</P>
<P>
	And what an emotional payoff.  
</P>
<P>
	On the day David Duval got the biggest victory of his career,  
his father, Bob, was on the other side of the Florida panhandle 
picking up the very first of his. 
</P>
<P>
	David's victory at The Players Championship propelled him to No.  
1 in the world rankings. Bob's win at the senior Emerald Coast 
Classic near Pensacola made the Duvals the first father-son 
combination to win on the same weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would win the award as the most proud,'' David Duval  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Duval had his doubts about that. A few hours after his  
victory, he stood in the clubhouse at The Moors Golf Club and cried 
as his son received the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's No. 1 now, don't you?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The venues for these victories couldn't have been more  
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	David is a native of nearby Jacksonville and grew up around the  
TPC at Sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	How many times did he come to this tournament, hang around the  
driving range, follow the players down No. 18 and imagine it was 
him holding that trophy high in victory? 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest place to win is at home,'' Bob Duval said. ``Every  
time he tees it up there, he wants to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Florida State University in Tallahassee, Bob Duval  
has always held the Emerald Coast Classic close to his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	He got an exemption to the tournament in 1997, his first season  
on the senior tour. A third-place finish there allowed him to keep 
his card and turn the tour into a career, letting go the teaching 
jobs he had for years up and down the coast of North Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not looking back,'' Duval said of his late entry into the  
touring ranks. ``I had great club jobs and everything else. I can't 
look back at that. I'm playing probably better than I did then. And 
I couldn't win on the regular tour right now because those guys are 
too good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He found out just how good last week, when he worked in a few  
rounds with his son during David's four-week break before the 
Players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were out here all last week,'' David Duval said. ``I gave  
him a good beating, but he was still pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two stayed in contact throughout the weekend, offering  
advice, words of encouragement and chit chat about other topics, 
just to take their minds off the history at hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, ``Tomorrow while you are playing, you are going to  
think about winning, OK?'' David Duval said. ``So don't try to not 
think about what it would feel like and everything that would come 
with it. You are going to think about that tomorrow, so don't waste 
energy trying to block it out. When you think about it, embrace 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The father took the son's advice. And those trophies might look  
good sitting side by side.

<HEADLINE> Global Recovery May Help Wall St. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For the first time in months, a company may not  
need a sassy ``.com'' in its name to get some attention on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	This past week, the chairman of Caterpillar Inc. said the  
construction equipment maker's earnings outlook was improving amid 
signs of economic recovery in Japan and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	An analyst upgraded Procter &AMP; Gamble's investment rating, saying  
the consumer products company should benefit from a global 
restructuring. And Merrill Lynch issued a sweeping upgrade of 
Brazilian stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The world economy is improving -- maybe enough, analysts said, to  
allow soaring Internet and technology stocks to pass the mantle of 
market leadership to more traditional performers like basic 
materials and consumer products companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each of these sectors suffered from the loss of demand due to  
Asia's slump,'' said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's 
Investors Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in the latter half of 1999, exactly when U.S. household  
expenditures will begin to show exhaustion, U.S. companies could 
get boost from overseas customers, particularly from Asia. Give me 
a sufficient number of positive earnings surprises, and that could 
trigger a change'' in the stock market's leadership, Lonski said. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies like Caterpillar and Deere could benefit from the  
growth in construction projects abroad. Consumer products companies 
including Procter &AMP; Gamble, Colgate Palmolive and Coca-Cola could 
sell more soap and soft drinks. And U.S. manufacturers with 
overseas plants, such as General Motors, could quickly increase 
production to take advantage of growing local demand. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these companies are watching carefully for signs of a  
global turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	In eastern Asia, economic reforms are beginning to improve  
production. And the region appears to be done with most of the 
painful currency devaluations that began in Thailand in July 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, Asian investors are pouring money into their own stock  
markets, an early sign of economic growth, Lonski said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Latin America, Charles Lemonides, managing director of  
Sterling Advisors at Gruntal &AMP; Co., said, ``there are an awful lot 
of indications that the worst is behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trends in western Europe are harder to read, analysts said,  
especially with NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and the resignation on 
March 11 of Germany's finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other potential problems. The prognosis for Russia's  
economy is still uncertain. And some analysts worry that China 
might devalue its currency, further lowering prices on already 
cheap Chinese imports and hurting the profits of U.S. competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The bigger risk, said Barton Biggs, global investment strategist  
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is that a global recovery by itself 
might stir inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise U.S. 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	That would put a swift end to the bull market on Wall Street,  
Biggs said. ``Good news for the global economy could be bad news 
for stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the Dow Jones industrial average moved even farther  
from the so-far elusive 10,000 closing mark. On Friday, it fell 
14.15 to 9,822.24. The blue-chip index ended the week down 81.31 
points, succumbing to profit-taking after repeatedly hitting 10,000 
in intraday trading the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Friday, the Nasdaq composite declined 15.63 to 2,419.17,  
down 2.12 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 7.19 to 1,282.80, down  
16.49 for the week. A year ago the index was $10,443.074 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE index declined 2.51 on Friday to 602.35, declining 8.33  
for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Stock Exchange index added 6.34 to 718.74, up 6.87  
for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of medium-size companies rose 0.93 to  
393.92, down 2.66 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilshire 5000 index closed at $11.66 trillion, down 137  
billion for the week.

<HEADLINE> Five Arrested in Nuke Plant Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Five anti-nuclear activists were arrested  
after entering the grounds of the Three Mile Island Nuclear 
Generating Station to mark the 20th anniversary of America's worst 
commercial nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been to Chernobyl,'' said activist Michael L. Mariotte,  
46, one of the five, referring to the site of the 1986 Soviet 
nuclear plant disaster. ``I've seen what happens when things go 
wrong. The people of Pennsylvania are not in the clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five activists crossed over a set of railroad tracks onto  
the property of GPU Nuclear Corp. to close a pre-dawn rally Sunday 
and were arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The vigil marked the moment about 4 a.m. on March 28, 1979, when  
a pump stopped operating in a non-nuclear part of the plant's Unit 
2. Mechanical problems and human error caused more than one-third 
of the reactor's uranium fuel to melt. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said only  
insignificant amounts of radiation escaped the plant during the 
days following the accident, but activists contend monitoring was 
inadequate and the actual amount is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 people -- veterans of the nuclear debate and  
newcomers -- gathered in the rain outside the plant to light candles 
and speak out against continuing reliance on nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half the crowd here was not alive when TMI happened,'' said  
Eugene Stilp, a veteran anti-nuclear activist with No Nukes 
Pennsylvania. ``We're turning this over to a new generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers described the frustration of unsuccessfully fighting  
the 1985 restart of the Unit 1 reactor and their mistrust of 
industry assurances that the nation's aging nuclear plants will 
remain safe. Women who were pregnant at the time spoke of the fear 
they went through 20 years ago when news of the accident reached 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The vigil culminated with the five activists crossing onto plant  
property in front of a phalanx of state troopers, police and Three 
Mile Island security officers as the crowd chanted anti-nuclear 
slogans on public property a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were charged with defiant criminal trespass, a  
misdemeanor. All were released by late morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived within five miles of the plant for two years,'' said  
28-year-old Marci Culley, another of those arrested. ``I felt 
obligated to come back.''

	NATO Expands Attacks on Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American and allied air armada broadened  
its attacks on Yugoslavia today to target Serb military forces in 
Kosovo, raising the risk to NATO pilots but also holding the 
promise of more effective strikes at the heart of Yugoslavia's 
ground offensive. The Pentagon and NATO are mum on what brought 
down an Air Force F-117A stealth fighter-bomber near the Yugoslav 
capital yesterday. A senior defense official, however, said there 
are strong indications it was hit by an SA-3 surface-to-air 
missile. The official said there was no reported mechanical problem 
but an explosion was heard.

	NATO Says 17 Major Targets Hit  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Sixty-six NATO aircraft attacking in  
two waves struck 17 major targets on the fourth day of allied air 
operations against Yugoslavia, NATO officials said today. Adding 
urgency to the need for concentrated attacks against tanks, 
artillery and troops in Kosovo was the ever-growing wave of ethnic 
Albanian refugees streaming toward the borders, said NATO spokesman 
Jamie Shea. He said people driven from their homes in Kosovo 
numbered more than 500,000, a quarter of the population of the 
province. Shea said 50,000 of those have been forced from their 
homes in just the past few days.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Retracing Jesus' final steps into Jerusalem  
nearly 2,000 years ago, Christian pilgrims from around the world 
sang hymns and hiked on Palm today from the Mount of Olives to the 
Old City of Jerusalem. Palm Sunday marks Jesus's entrance into 
Jerusalem on a white donkey on the Sunday before his crucifixion, 
when his followers laid palm branches in his path. The day begins 
Christianity's most solemn period, the week that ends with Easter 
next Sunday.

the watchful eyes of Saudi security men trying to avoid a stampede 
like the one that marred the end of last year's sacred journey. 
Helicopters hovered over white-robed pilgrims coating a mountain 
plain near Mina, six miles north of the holy city of Mecca, their 
crews peering down for any signs of trouble. Some pilgrims 
sheltered themselves from the scorching sun with green or black 
umbrellas; others stood beneath trees or bridges.

	Penn Bans Alcohol at Campus Parties

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The University of Pennsylvania has banned  
alcohol at undergraduate campus parties after a partygoer died at a 
fraternity house. The ban, expected to last at least until a 
student-faculty task force at the Ivy League school takes up the 
issue in about six weeks, applies to registered campus parties, 
typically those hosted by fraternities and attended by nonmembers. 
The ban follows the death last weekend of alumnus Michael Tobin, 
26, of Pittsford, N.Y.

satin evening gown, after winning a battle to wear a dress to the 
dance. The principal at Taylor High School had said earlier in the 
month that Rice could not attend the dance in drag, citing concerns 
for the teen's safety and the potential for a major disruption of 
the prom. Rice, who is gay, said he felt he was being discriminated 
against because of his sexual orientation. He was in the process of 
hiring an attorney when the school reversed its decision.

celebrating the return of major league baseball to the communist

According to the Sunday Times, the gifts, such as laptop computers 
and video cameras, were part of the ``aggressive lobbying'' by two 
candidates. ``It was an attempt to influence us,'' David Will, a 
Scottish lawyer who is a FIFA vice president, was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Faldo Disqualified From TPC Tourney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Nick Faldo was enduring a dismal  
week. Thanks to Corey Pavin, he got the agony over with early 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggling Faldo was disqualified from the final round of  
The Players Championship because of a rule mixup that occurred 
after he hit a ball into a palm tree at the sixth hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo began walking back to hit another ball from the previous  
spot when his playing partner, Pavin, told him he could drop from 
under the tree for a one-stroke penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Corey talked him into a bad ruling,'' rules official Jon  
Brendle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo exited the tournament having shot 16-over-par for 59  
holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The infraction was Rule 20-7b -- playing from the wrong place.  
</P>
<P>
	After Faldo and Pavin played out the hole, a spectator told the  
rules committee what had happened. Brendle asked Faldo at the 
seventh green whether he had been able to identify the ball in the 
tree, and Faldo said no. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the sixth hole had been completed, there was no  
alternative for Faldo but disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just adds to the frivolity,'' Faldo said.  
</P>
<P>
	After completing his round at 2-over 74, 16-over for the  
tournament, Pavin said he encountered a similar situation about 
eight years ago at a tournament in Palm Springs, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a betting man, but I would have bet a lot that that  
was the ruling,'' Pavin said. ``It was just unfortunate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had seen a similar ruling involving Jose Maria  
Olazabal here a few years ago. That, plus his own experience, made 
him sure he was dispensing the correct advice. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball is considered lost unless it can be identified. Brendle  
said the rules committee would have accepted efforts to identify 
the ball such as using binoculars, even a spectator's word that it 
was Faldo's ball that went into the tree. 
</P>
<P>
	None of those efforts was used, however, and Faldo played out  
the hole without asking for help from a rules official. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo, who hasn't won in two years, shot an 83 Saturday,  
matching his worst round ever in the United States. He was at 
3-over through five holes of Sunday's round before the 
disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	He will still get $9,100 in unofficial money.  
</P>
<P>
	Pavin said the parting with Faldo was amicable.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was ... just a mistake,'' Pavin said. ``He wasn't playing  
well, I wasn't playing well. I'm not sure he was that upset to walk 
in anyway. I'm probably more stressed about it than he is, because 
I'm the one who said something.''

<HEADLINE> Duke Favored by 9 1/2 Over UConn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- This city's oddsmakers don't give Connecticut  
much of a chance against Duke in the national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is a 9 1/2-point favorite to beat Connecticut and win the  
national title at most Las Vegas sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bettors love Duke,'' said Pete Korner, who sets the odds  
for Las Vegas Sports Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke failed to cover the spread in Saturday's 68-62 win over  
Michigan State, in which the Blue Devils were 11 1/2-point favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, meanwhile, was a 5 1/2-point favorite over Ohio State,  
and won by six points. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just luck,'' Korner said of the oddsmaking in that  
game. ``You always remember the ones that are close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the makeup of the Final Four was set, bettors could get  
9-2 odds on Connecticut winning the national championship. But to 
bet Duke, they faced 1-7 odds, meaning they had to bet $7 to win a 
dollar.

<HEADLINE>  Castro, Cubans Meet Major Leaguers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- He walked onto the field like he owned the place,  
straight and tall and with purpose. And by the time Fidel Castro 
had cut across the diamond to meet them Sunday, the Baltimore 
Orioles could tell this meant far more than any spring training 
game they had ever played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fi-del! Fi-del!'' the 50,000 fans chanted at Estadio  
Latinoamericano at the sight of their president. ``Cu-ba! Cu-ba!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles gathered around the 73-year-old leader to shake  
hands, curious to see how he looked up close in his combat 
fatigues. Manager Ray Miller talked to Castro through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told me this was a good baseball town,'' Miller said after  
Baltimore beat a Cuban all-star team 3-2 in 11 innings. ``He said 
not to worry, that we were playing in front of the greatest 
baseball fans in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We know this is history,'' pitcher Scott Kamieniecki said.  
``This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Cuban defectors such as Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez,  
Livan Hernandez and Rey Ordonez had left and found fame in 
major-league baseball, no one on the Communist island had seen a 
big-league team visit since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	``For many years, we have been trying to have this match,'' star  
Cuban third baseman Omar Linares said. ``I'm very emotional about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets were issued on an invitation-only basis, ensuring the  
stands would be packed with loyal Castro supporters. In fact, many 
were in their seats three hours before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But that left out many of Cuba's most passionate ``pelota''  
fans, along with a lot of traditional touches. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing for most of the sunny afternoon were the drums, sirens,  
air horns, singing, dancing and rumba music that enveloped the 
ballpark from the first pitch during Saturday night's playoff game 
between the Havana Industriales and Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	No cheerleaders in black spandex jumped on top of the dugouts.  
No ballgirls served coffee to the umpires during the fifth-inning 
break. Even the 53-year-old stadium was spruced up -- gone were the 
wild dogs that usually roam the concourse, hoping for bits of the 
pork-leg sandwiches sold at concession stands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who go to the stadium every day cannot go,''  
complained Omar Ramirez. ``Why? Why?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few blocks away, though, little boys were undaunted. With  
nothing more than rotted sticks for bats and rolled-up socks for 
balls, they kept playing Cuba's national sport. They did it while 
dodging DeSotos and Ford Fairlanes, banged-up cars with big 
tailfins from the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the park, the Orioles and Cubans played beneath big  
outfield signs that proclaimed ``Socialist Cuba Sports'' and 
``Sports for the People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro had not been out to the stadium for several years, but  
was determined not to miss this chance, especially since he won't 
be accompanying the Cuban team when its plays at Baltimore's Camden 
Yards on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent about two minutes greeting the Orioles before visiting  
with the Cubans, and watched the game while sitting between 
major-league commissioner Bud Selig and Orioles owner Peter 
Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a Triple-A hotspot when the Havana Sugar Kings ruled, the  
Caribbean island had not seen a big-league club since March 21, 
1959, right after Castro took power. On that day at the very same 
ballpark, with guards strolling with machine guns, Sandy Koufax 
struck out eight as Los Angeles beat Cincinnati 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it's been a blackout and blockade for Cuban fans  
trying to follow major-league ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1963 Trading With the Enemy Act forbid most Americans from  
spending money in Cuba. Despite Angelos' efforts for several years 
-- he said he was driven by sportsmanship -- only President Clinton's 
recent relaxing of restrictions against Cuba made this game 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government, however, has stressed that these two  
exhibitions are not a matter of sports diplomacy, such as the table 
tennis matches with China in the 1970s. Rather, these are 
considered ``people-to-people'' contacts, much like those conducted 
with Cuban artists and academics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, these games drew protests in the United States. Several  
members of Congress opposed them, and Florida Marlins owner John 
Henry joined a protest outside the Orioles' spring training camp in 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles pitcher Juan Guzman, who was born in the Dominican  
Republic and employs several Cuban domestics at his home in Miami, 
asked out of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of issues that people are dealing with,'' said  
Charles Johnson, the Orioles catcher. ``They are issues that are 
above my head that I can't even discuss.''

<HEADLINE>  Michigan St. Fans Riot After Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A riotous crowd of about 5,000 people  
threw bottles and started fires around an apartment complex close 
to the Michigan State campus shortly after the Spartans lost to 
Duke Saturday in basketball's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 fires were reported since the end of the game, East  
Lansing deputy fire chief Pete Zamora said shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're starting fires wherever there is anything they can  
burn,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there were reports of trash bins, sofas and a car being  
set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Zamora said there were numerous injuries, mostly people being  
cut from bottles being thrown. One person was climbing up a traffic 
light pole and fell. WXYZ-TV reported that a student was burned 
while jumping over a burning sofa. 
</P>
<P>
	Campus police Capt. Tony Kliebecker said the department sent its  
riot unit in to quell the crowd that had gathered around an 
apartment complex. He said police sprayed tear gas to try to 
disperse the crowd so firefighters could get to a car that had been 
overturned and set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lansing police car was also set on fire.  
</P>
<P>
	East Lansing Fire Marshal Bob Pratt said firefighters were  
pulling back at Cedar Village because they were being pelted with 
debris. Zamora said one fire truck windshield was broken by thrown 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	He also reported people having trouble breathing because of the  
tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kliebecker said he's heard of at least four arrests made by  
campus police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're just trying to move crowds. We can't keep up  
with it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there were any problems, an East Lansing police  
dispatcher said: ``Major problems. We're under a state of emergency 
right now. That's all we know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelli Benson, 20, sophomore, said police were making the  
situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would eventually calm down if they didn't provoke us.  
Before we even did anything, there were cop cars everywhere,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just south of Cedar Village a crowd had started a fire and was  
ripping branches off trees and throwing them on the fire. A door at 
the College of Business had been smashed in, but a second door 
remained intact and it did not appear anyone had tried to go 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 Ingham County sheriff deputies on horseback were on the  
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Police closed Grand River Avenue, the main street in East  
Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State students have clashed with police before.  
</P>
<P>
	A student protest in May over an alcohol ban at a popular  
tailgating spot on campus turned into a melee. Up to 3,000 people 
were involved and more than 20 were arrested. Students tore through 
downtown East Lansing, setting bonfires and clashing with police 
who used tear gas to break up the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, two students were arrested for disorderly conduct  
at an off-campus apartment complex after Sunday's Michigan State 
victory over Kentucky. Revelers also set a small bonfire at the 
complex with pizza boxes and furniture.

	``The people who go to the stadium every day cannot go,''  
complained Omar Ramirez. ``Why? Why?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few blocks away, though, little boys were undaunted. With  
nothing more than rotted sticks for bats and rolled-up socks for 
balls, they kept playing Cuba's national sport. They did it while 
dodging DeSotos and Ford Fairlanes, banged-up cars with big 
tailfins from the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the park, the Orioles and Cubans played beneath big  
outfield signs that proclaimed ``Socialist Cuba Sports'' and 
``Sports for the People.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro had not been out to the stadium for several years, but  
was determined not to miss this chance, especially since he won't 
be accompanying the Cuban team when its plays at Baltimore's Camden 
Yards on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent about two minutes greeting the Orioles before visiting  
with the Cubans, and watched the game while sitting between 
major-league commissioner Bud Selig and Orioles owner Peter 
Angelos. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a Triple-A hotspot when the Havana Sugar Kings ruled, the  
Caribbean island had not seen a big-league club since March 21, 
1959, right after Castro took power. On that day at the very same 
ballpark, with guards strolling with machine guns, Sandy Koufax 
struck out eight as Los Angeles beat Cincinnati 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it's been a blackout and blockade for Cuban fans  
trying to follow major-league ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1963 Trading With the Enemy Act forbid most Americans from  
spending money in Cuba. Despite Angelos' efforts for several years 
-- he said he was driven by sportsmanship -- only President Clinton's 
recent relaxing of restrictions against Cuba made this game 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government, however, has stressed that these two  
exhibitions are not a matter of sports diplomacy, such as the table 
tennis matches with China in the 1970s. Rather, these are 
considered ``people-to-people'' contacts, much like those conducted 
with Cuban artists and academics. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, these games drew protests in the United States. Several  
members of Congress opposed them, and Florida Marlins owner John 
Henry joined a protest outside the Orioles' spring training camp in 
Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles pitcher Juan Guzman, who was born in the Dominican  
Republic and employs several Cuban domestics at his home in Miami, 
asked out of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of issues that people are dealing with,'' said  
Charles Johnson, the Orioles catcher. ``They are issues that are 
above my head that I can't even discuss.''

<HEADLINE> Strong 'Forces' Tops Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Forces of Nature'' proved unstoppable at  
the box office in its second weekend, beating out new films 
including the voyeurism comedy ``EDtv'' and retro crime-drama ``The 
Mod Squad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Forces,'' starring Ben Affleck as an uptight groom-to-be who  
becomes enamored of free-spirited Sandra Bullock on the way to his 
wedding, grossed an estimated $9.6 million, according to Exhibitor 
Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``EDtv,'' the Ron Howard-directed comedy about a dim-bulb video  
store clerk played by Matthew McConaughey who agrees to let 
television capture every minute of his life, grossed $9 million for 
second place. 
</P>
<P>
	That was nowhere near the $31.5 million opening weekend gross of  
last summer's ``The Truman Show,'' another tale of a man who lives 
his life on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' dropped to No. 3 in its fourth weekend, earning  
an estimated $8.8 million. The comedy stars Robert De Niro as an 
anxiety-ridden mobster who goes to a psychiatrist portrayed by 
Billy Crystal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mod Squad,'' an updated version of the 1960s TV series  
about three youths who become undercover cops to stay out of jail, 
opened with $6.1 million for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	With its pounding soundtrack, MTV-style editing and stylish  
stars Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi and Omar Epps, the film was 
geared more toward a younger audience than the baby boomers who may 
remember the original. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life is Beautiful'' climbed back into the top ten at No. 8  
after being named best foreign film at the Oscars, where its 
exuberant star and director, Roberto Benigni, also won for best 
actor. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, with final figures to be released Monday, were: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Forces of Nature,'' $9.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``EDtv,'' $9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Analyze This,'' $8.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``The Mod Squad,'' $6.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Doug's 1st Movie,'' $4.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $4.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``True Crime,'' $3.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Life is Beautiful,'' $3.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Baby Geniuses,'' $2.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Cruel Intentions,'' $2.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Sap Running, So Are Maple Producers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, N.Y. (AP) -- Maple-scented steam billows as sap froths  
and boils in Warren Wells' sugar house. Wells lifts his scoop from 
the pan and studies the gooey amber drips. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the syrup is almost right,'' he explains, ``it will hang  
on the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This batch oozes too quickly off the scoop: not quite there.  
</P>
<P>
	New York state is in the thick of maple season, and Wells is  
spending the spring thaw the same way he has for the past 30 years: 
shuttling between his sugar house and some 1,000 maple tree taps on 
his gently sloping land east of Albany. 
</P>
<P>
	The rush to collect and process sap is being repeated in  
woodlands across the Northeast and New York. With winter easing its 
grip, sap is running for a limited time and maple producers are 
trying to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, you're going like crazy,'' Wells said.  
</P>
<P>
	Sap runs during the sort of weather New York has recently been  
flirting with: chilly nights and daytime temperatures approaching 
the 40s. A brief run of mild weather across much of the state in 
February got sap running temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, the collecting and processing of sap is often aided  
by gadgets like vacuum taps, plastic hoses and high-tech 
evaporators. But the basic process has endured for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sap is gathered in old-style metal buckets or in pails. The  
watery sap, with about a 2 percent sugar content, is then hosed 
into evaporator pans to boil until it yields the sticky sweet 
syrup. 
</P>
<P>
	It takes about 40 gallons of sap to make a gallon of maple syrup  
-- which helps explain why a gallon of syrup can retail from $35 to 
$39. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is the No. 2 maple producing state, after Vermont.  
Canada, a country where the maple leaf is the national symbol, 
accounts for about 80 percent of the world's syrup production. 
</P>
<P>
	New York state has roughly 1,400 maple producers, and annual  
sales in the past five years have fluctuated between $4.8 million 
and $8.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a portion of maple producers rely on the fickle maple  
output for their main source of income. Many are farmers filling 
seasonal lulls. Even a big operator like Steve Rascher, of 
Washington County, has other income streams. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a hobby,'' he said. ``I'm also a tree surgeon and  
a Realtor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rascher describes this year's season so far as ``fabulous,'' and  
other producers around the state seem optimistic. The one pocket of 
gloom in the statewide industry continues to be the North Country, 
where trees were ravaged by an ice storm in January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the toppled tree tops, producers in that area set 380,000  
fewer taps last year. Statewide output plummeted last year by 
38,000 gallons to 231,000 gallons, according to the state 
Department of Agriculture and Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl Parker, a producer north of Plattsburgh, said his  
production was down about 80 percent last year. He and his family 
have spent the past year replacing some 60 miles of tubing and 
cleaning up the woods with bulldozers. He has spent about $75,000 
to replace equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were really down and out,'' he said. ``I thought we'd never  
bounce back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others weren't as lucky. Parker estimates that in Clinton  
County, probably only five maple producers are left from a group of 
50 before the ice storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Trees remain damaged in the North Country, but Lewis Staats of  
Cornell University's Natural Resources Department said many are 
still able to be tapped.

<HEADLINE> Maddux May Have Eye Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Greg Maddux has always pitched with  
laserlike precision. Now he wants to fix his eye sight the same 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time Cy Young Award winner told the Atlanta Braves he  
would like to undergo corrective laser eye surgery so he would no 
longer have to wear contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been talking about it since he got down here,'' manager  
Bobby Cox said Sunday. ``I don't know if he'll have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who wears contact lenses when pitching and small,  
wire-rimmed glasses off the field, has said if he had the surgery 
he probably wouldn't even miss a start. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no big deal,'' Maddux told The Orlando Sentinel. ``It's  
something that if I do it, great. If not, it's no big deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux has been having problems with several different sets of  
contact lenses, the newspaper said. The paper added that Cox was 
concerned that if Maddux had the procedure done, there could be 
complications, including blurred vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Cox and Maddux agreed to talk to general manager John  
Schuerholz and team doctors before any action is taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux, who did not travel to Vero Beach for a game against the  
Dodgers on Sunday, was not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz was not at the club's spring training office and his  
secretary said he would not be available until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux pitched six innings in a 6-1 victory against Kansas City  
on Saturday, allowing six hits and one run and lowering his spring 
ERA to 2.25 in 20 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddux was 18-9 last season with a 2.22 ERA and has a 12-year  
career mark of 202-117 with a 2.75 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Arthritis a Risk for Exercisers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- High-impact aerobics is out for Lori O'Koon.  
She suspects that was probably what got her into trouble in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Koon damaged cartilage in an ankle, and believes she is on the  
road to osteoarthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you damage the cartilage that protects the bone, that's  
when the process begins,'' said O'Koon, a 34-year-old surgical 
equipment saleswoman in Phoenix. Surgery to clean out the joint 
helped but hasn't cured the problem, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't do any high-impact aerobics,'' O'Koon said. ``I can't  
run.'' If she does run, she has to ``limp around for the next 3 
days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Koon is part of a growing group whose good deed, working out,  
has not gone unpunished. The results were joint injuries -- mostly 
in the knee or hip -- especially ones that needed surgical repair. 
</P>
<P>
	With 21 million people afflicted, osteoarthritis is the most  
common form of arthritis in the United States, according to the 
Arthritis Foundation. And doctors say it's afflicting baby boomers, 
who should be too young for a disease that commonly hits older 
people. Osteoarthritis can wait for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Osteoarthritis has many causes, including ones that involve  
exercise. They center on unusual stress or wearing away of 
cartilage in a joint. This can create friction and inflammation, 
which can lead to osteoarthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage grows worse with time. ``We are seeing middle-aged  
people who had injuries early in life,'' said Dr. David Fox of the 
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't only bad tackles, poor landings after layups, or  
endless miles of running that did them in, said Fox, a medical 
spokesman for the arthritis group. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease often had help from the sufferers' doctors. Trying  
to fix a torn meniscus, the cartilage cushion between the leg bones 
at the knee, the doctors took out much of the cartilage, and taking 
out the cushioning left the joint prone to osteoarthritis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Growing older in itself can make things worse, especially if a  
person doesn't stay in shape, said Dr. David Felson of Boston 
University. ``Our strength is diminished, the nervous system that 
provides information on how we protect our joints is diminished, 
and the cartilage doesn't respond as well to stress,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's why the age at which the injury occurs is important,  
Felson said. Younger people have more muscle strength to hold the 
knee in place, and better nervous system input to tell the muscles 
how to react to stress, he said. ``It isn't the high school athlete 
who messed up his knee, it's more the baby boomer who ran around 35 
and messed up his knee that's at risk,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nor does it have to be only athletics -- other physical activity  
will do, Felson said. A study in which Felson was senior author 
found a three- to seven-fold higher risk of knee osteoarthritis 
among seniors who had done repeated lifting when they were younger. 
The study was in the American Journal of Medicine's February 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
	These people hadn't been doing weight training, Felson said --  
they had been factory workers who had to move objects on their 
jobs, he said. Other studies have found simply being overweight may 
be enough to bring on osteoarthritis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And because the damage is cumulative, more cases of  
osteoarthritis should come up as the population ages, according to 
an arthritis foundation publication, Arthritis Today. 
</P>
<P>
	Just the same, this is no reason to be afraid of exercise, the  
experts said. Instead, they advise it. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies have shown that exercise is good for osteoarthritic  
joints, commented Dr. Peter Lynch of Boston University in the 
American Journal of Sports Medicine, which he edits. Exercise can 
keep the muscles around the joint strong, helping to absorb more 
energy and providing some protection. 
</P>
<P>
	People with osteoarthritis simply should find exercises, such as  
swimming and cycling, that don't put weight on the joint, Fox said. 
And people who are worried about developing osteoarthritis can 
switch to those exercises, because reducing impact reduces risk, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what O'Koon does. She does weight training, in-line  
skating and bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
	And, while she takes pain medication as needed, O'Koon keeps her  
options open on further surgery. New techniques let doctors take 
cartilage from areas in which it is not as urgently needed, and 
implant it in afflicted joints. The trouble is that the surgery 
been done more in the knee than the ankle, and it's ``a pretty 
invasive procedure,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Comeback Almost Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Trajan Langdon will end his career  
as the best 3-point shooter in Duke history. Coach Mike Krzyzewski 
will remember him for something more important. 
</P>
<P>
	Langdon is the lone connection between the Blue Devils' lowest  
point and what they hope will be their highest in Monday night's 
national championship game against Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some respect it would be a great honor. I was part of one  
of the worst teams in Duke history and now I'm part of one of the 
best teams in Duke history,'' the senior from Alaska said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be a good feeling to be talked about being a bridge  
from the down point to getting back to where Duke has been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Duke's great success since the mid-1980s, it's easy to  
forget the 1994-95 team, which went 13-18 and finished last in the 
Atlantic Coast Conference with a school-worst 2-14 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski left in the middle of that season to have back  
surgery. He wasn't too proud of what he left behind. 
</P>
<P>
	After consecutive national titles in 1991-92, Krzyzewski's  
demands began to spiral out of control. His off-court commitments 
increased tenfold and team priorities lagged behind. Krzyzewski 
also admitted making some mistakes recruiting players. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we went on hard times I think it was my responsibility  
because I don't think we showed the care for the program,'' 
Krzyzewski said. ``We didn't evaluate like I had normally evaluated 
it because of (a lack) of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Krzyzewski's success and importance on campus, no one  
from the Duke administration stepped in to help. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an assumption that we just were going to do what we  
did,'' he said. ``What I've tried to do in the last five years is 
to get Duke University and everyone to say, `Hey, take a look at 
it. What do we need facility-wise? Is this good enough? Don't 
assume that we're just going to do it. Let's all be a part of 
this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old Krzyzewski also tried to return too soon from  
his surgery, which led to physical and emotional exhaustion. He 
soon realized he would have to delegate some responsibilities and 
cut his schedule so he could devote more time to his team. 
</P>
<P>
	His first move was to hire former players Quin Snyder, Johnny  
Dawkins and David Henderson for his coaching staff, and begin 
recruiting athletes that shared the same tireless work ethic he 
previously demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``That next year with me being back, people immediately said,  
`Oh, they should be good.' There was an unrealistic view of what we 
had to do by everyone around. It was tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils slowly worked their way back into the NCAA  
tournament picture, going 18-13 in 1995-96 before using a 
four-guard lineup to win the first of three straight ACC titles the 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That year jump-started us,'' Krzyzewski said of the 24-9 team  
of 1996-97. ``I started seeing some things in my team that were 
really good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski and his staff then put together the missing pieces,  
landing one of the nation's best recruiting classes that included 
Elton Brand, William Avery, Shane Battier and Chris Burgess. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave us a talent base,'' the coach said. ``We had already  
started doing the character things that needed to be done and the 
work ethic things. That combination has worked out pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand remembers Krzyzewski's recruiting pitch. It wasn't a sales  
job at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``He actually told me, `I can't promise you anything. I can't  
promise you you will play a minute. But I can promise you if you 
work hard and you play to your capabilities there is a possibility 
you can play,''' Brand said. ``That's what I got. I didn't get, 
`You'll start.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Brand saw an opportunity to play for one of the game's  
best coaches and for a program that was on the verge -- once again -- 
of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is to get talented kids where it doesn't become work,  
that's just what you do,'' Krzyzewski said. ``It's their investment 
in the game, they already come to you with a certain level of 
commitment they do every day, then you have a chance to get them 
higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The highest level could very well come Monday night with a  
record 38th victory and third championship this decade.

<HEADLINE> Taking Steps To Avoid Computer Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Computer experts hope a weekend of warnings  
will prevent workers returning to their office terminals Monday 
from spreading a new virus that launches documents into cyberspace 
and clogs e-mail servers. 
</P>
<P>
	Several businesses and governments around the world have  
contacted Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response 
Team for help with the virus, said CERT manager Katherine Fithen. 
She said they should consider it a potential security breach. 
</P>
<P>
	CERT first learned of the virus Friday afternoon and its members  
worked through the night to analyze it, Fithen said. She said the 
full reach of the virus may become clear Monday when millions of 
people sit down at their computer terminals for the first time 
since Melissa emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's safe to say we're bracing ourselves,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Fithen declined to say if any government's security was  
breached. She also wouldn't name anyone affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The Melissa virus spreads via infected e-mail and attacks  
computers loaded with Microsoft's widely used Word 97 or Word 2000 
programs, according to CERT. 
</P>
<P>
	Infected documents are sent as attachments to e-mails most  
frequently bearing a header: ``Subject: Important Message From'' 
and the name of person whose computer relayed the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	The body of the message says, ``Here is that document you asked  
for ... don't show it to anyone else ;-).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several anti-virus software makers have posted software on their  
Web sites that their customers can download to detect and reject 
the virus. People can also protect themselves by not opening the 
attachments, Fithen said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a computer user opens an infected Word-format document, the  
virus propagates itself by reading the user's e-mail address book 
and sending an infected message to the first 50 entries, CERT said. 
</P>
<P>
	The message can include the contents of any Word document open  
on the computer, Fithen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the virus can send so much unwanted e-mail that it crashes  
mail servers, the computers that distribute e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft was among the companies hit by the virus, but it  
suffered no problems, said company spokesman Adam Sohn. The company 
limited its e-mail transmissions and didn't lose any confidential 
information, he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 1, Burn 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Galaxy won in a shootout  
Sunday for the second time in two Major League Soccer matches, 
defeating the Dallas Burn 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Goals by Cobi Jones, Clint Mathis and Greg Vanney in the  
shootout provided the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams failed to score on their first shootout shots.  
Dallas' Temoc Suarez missed his team's second shot before Jones 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
	Burn defender Richard Farrer tied the score, but Mathis put the  
Galaxy up 2-1. Each team missed its next shot, before Ted Eck 
retied the score, followed by Vanney's winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman made four saves and Dallas' Matt  
Jordan three in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	After setting an MLS record with 85 goals in 1998, the Galaxy  
(2-0) has scored only once in its two games this season. The team 
drew boos from much of the announced crowd of 27,034 at the Rose 
Bowl as it left the field at the end of the first half, and at the 
end of regulation play. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis, who scored the lone regulation goal in Los Angeles' 2-1  
shootout victory over Colorado on March 20, took four of his team's 
final five shots Sunday. Jordan made a save on his 63rd-minute 
shot, with Mathis' other three going wide or high. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartman made saves on shots by Brian Haynes and Jorge Rodriguez,  
both in the 83rd minute, and Mickey Trotman in the 54th, to 
preserve the tie, earning the 11th shutout of his three-season MLS 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was preceded by the U.S. women's national team's 3-0  
victory over Mexico.

<HEADLINE>  Guard Play Carries UConn Into Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Ricky Moore never met a player he  
couldn't shut down. Khalid El-Amin never met a player who could 
shut him up. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Richard Hamilton, the third wheel of a three-guard  
offense that never stops scoring, they have transformed Connecticut 
from a team that knew only failure in college basketball's final 
month into one of the sport's Final Two. 
</P>
<P>
	Take a bow, Mr. El-Amin ... whoops, you already were.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've said it before and I'll say it again, all this team was  
missing was a player of my stature and leadership,'' El-Amin said 
after scoring 18 points in Connecticut's 64-58 victory Saturday 
over Ohio State in the NCAA semifinals. ``I think I've done a good 
job. I think I've been a leader.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Good enough that he has led a team that had never previously  
reached even the Final Four in 20 previous NCAA appearances -- the 
worst track record of any Division I school -- to Monday's 
championship game against Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``That sounds awfully good,'' Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun  
said. ``Can you say it again please?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke (37-1) and UConn (33-2) are the only two schools to be  
ranked No. 1 this season. The Huskies ceded the top ranking at 
midseason only by losing to Syracuse amid a succession of injuries, 
a fact that seems to be lost on those who have already awarded the 
national title to Duke, which beat Michigan State 68-62 in the 
other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a little bit unfair,'' El-Amin said. ``I don't  
know if it helps us, but I think we'll be inspired by that a little 
bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A sophomore guard who began running the Huskies' offense from  
the first time he scrimmaged with them as a high school senior -- 
and began running his mouth about the same time -- was nearly left 
speechless after going 0-for-12 in Connecticut's 67-62 victory over 
Gonzaga in the West Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
	It took him only three possessions to get back on his game  
Saturday, hitting a baseline jumper that made it 5-2 and set the 
tone for an 8-of-15, six-assist day. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton led the Huskies with 24 points and joined Chris Smith  
as the only 2,000-point scorers in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other end of the court, Moore was disrupting and  
distracting Ohio State's Scoonie Penn, who was averaging 17.5 
points in the NCAA tournament but was limited to 11 points on 
3-of-13 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn was so off his game that he even forgot his own number. He  
couldn't find his No. 12, so was forced to wear a generic No. 35 
with no name on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a suggestion: Maybe Moore, who calls himself the best  
defensive player in America, stole his number. He certainly stole 
his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I think I did that, but I certainly had a lot of help,''  
said Moore, whose scoring average has dropped from 12 points per 
game two years ago to six points since he began concentrating on 
defense. ``I stayed aggressive on defense. I made him work for 
everything. That's my game, to wreak havoc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said he wasn't bragging about being the premier  
scorer-stopper in the country. These numbers don't lie: He held 
Gonzaga's Matt Santangelo to 1-of-9 shooting and two points, 
Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves to six points. Johnny Hemsley of 
Miami to no second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I work hard. Just look at the stats,'' Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
	Or look at his shoes. He wore a new pair of gold shoes --  
``They're 14 karat,'' he said smiling -- but ruptured the sole on 
his right shoe while chasing around Penn in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I blew 'em out,'' he said. ``They came apart, I was guarding  
him so hard. ... But I'll get them fixed before Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing needs fixing with Connecticut's game, not now, not with  
the biggest game in history of the school -- and a basketball-crazed 
state -- coming up Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seized the moment,'' Calhoun said. ``Now we've got to do it  
again.''

	NATO Broadens Kosovo Attack  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO intensified its attack against Yugoslavia  
to target Serb military forces in Kosovo in the fifth straight day 
of bombings. At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, British Air 
Commodore David Wilby said, ``We are now just beginning to 
transition'' from focusing air attacks mainly in Yugoslavia's air 
defense network to targeting the Serb tanks and troops that are 
continuing to pound the Kosovar Albanians. NATO officials said 66 
allied aircraft attacked 17 major targets yesterday, including 
various elements of the Yugoslav air defense network as well as an 
airfield and an ammunition supply facility.

	Yeltsin To Deliver Anti-NATO Speech  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin, deploring the  
use of force in Kosovo and Iraq, will tell the Russian parliament 
on Tuesday that he will not accept ``strong arm decisions'' by NATO 
in Europe, according to portions of his prepared 
state-of-the-nation speech. Despite the rift, Yeltsin renews his 
commitment to slashing nuclear weapons arsenals and reaffirms his 
commitment to market reforms. In his speech, he plans to say 
``defrosting'' of the icy relationship ``depends on how soon the 
alliance will realize the peril of the military option towards 
Yugoslavia.''

the day Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, then Serbian 
Communist Party chief, stripped Kosovo of much of its autonomy,

	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- President Raul Cubas resigned Sunday,  
ending nearly a week of political turmoil that tested the South 
American nation's 10-year-old democracy. Cubas said he lamented the 
fighting in the streets that led to the start of his impeachment 
trial last week on charges of abuse of power. He also asked for the 
forgiveness all Paraguayans who voted for him. Senate leader Luis 
Gonzalez Macchi was set to succeed Cubas.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- In Brooklyn, jury selection was to begin  
tomorrow for the trial of four officers accused of brutalizing a 
Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima, in 1997. The trial -- centering on 
allegations officers sodomized the victim with a stick in a 
precinct stationhouse -- could stretch into summer. The case opens 
against a backdrop of last month's fatal shooting of an unarmed 
West African immigrant, and increased complaints of police 
brutality. More than 1,000 people have been arrested in daily 
protests against city leaders and the police department -- including 
prominent whites as well as blacks.

	U.S. Backs Israel on Troop Pullback

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A U.S. official said today that Israel does not  
have to resume troop withdrawals in the West Bank until the 
Palestinians meet their commitments under the Wye peace agreement. 
U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz stressed that the United 
States still expects Israel to act on other aspects of the 
U.S.-brokered Wye River accords. ``If you read the Wye agreement 
you see that the handover of territory is the last step, and that 
other conditions have to be met first by the Palestinians,'' said 
Schwartz.

cases kept medical workers busy. The Saudi Red Crescent have 
treated at least 8,420 pilgrims, according to the official Saudi

Lakers beat the New York Knicks 99-91 in a physical battle between 
two teams attempting to end their losing ways. The win was just the 
fourth in nine games for the Lakers (20-11), while the Knicks 
(16-14) suffered their fifth loss in seven games. With Lakers 
forward Dennis Rodman often in the middle of things, the game was 
marred by several physical exchanges, and two New York players -- 
Kurt Thomas and Chris Dudley -- were ejected.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American and allied air armada broadened

days of protests against NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia. No one was 
hurt. Police firing pistols drove the attackers away from the

said more than 500,000 ethnic Albanians, a quarter of the 
population of Kosovo, had been driven from their homes, 50,000 of

<HEADLINE> Pa. Fence Feud Splits Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ERIE, Pa. (AP) -- A fence proposed to curb drug sales and help  
police catch criminals is dividing more than the back yards and 
vacant lots of a blighted neighborhood in Pennsylvania's third 
largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say a 6-foot-high, $15,000 chain-link fence running down  
the back yards of a block could reduce crime and help rehabilitate 
the area. But critics argue it's a waste of tax money and a 
misguided effort aimed at young black men who gather in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're discriminating against the blacks in the community,''  
says Gene Toran, 66, a retired lightweight boxer who has lived in 
Erie since 1963. ``The only time (police) come up here is when they 
put on a show. They harass these kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Redmond, executive director of the Redevelopment Authority  
of the City of Erie, said the fence, approved last month by the 
City Council, has nothing to do with race in this blue-collar city 
of 105,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem in this neighborhood is perception and  
reality about drugs and crime,'' Redmond says. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-story houses with generous porches circle the block, which  
is defined by East 22nd and 23rd streets intersecting with Holland 
and German streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are built of sturdy brick and date back to the early part  
of the century. But plenty are vacant, with boarded-up windows and 
graffiti-scarred doors. The Redevelopment Authority owns 17 of the 
block's 36 lots. 
</P>
<P>
	Old folks, young people, married couples and parents with  
children -- most of them black -- live here, surrounded by old 
factories. So do drug dealers, according to neighbors and police, 
who say dope pushers and other criminals cut through the block to 
elude them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's drug selling everywhere,'' says Delmar Moore, 21. ``If  
that's the case, you might as well put fences around the whole of 
Erie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where abandoned houses were demolished, bare lots offer easy  
accessibility for illegal activity. Redmond predicts there will be 
more because some of the houses deeded to the Authority would cost 
more to refurbish than they are worth. He valued most at $5,000 to 
$15,000; the median home value in Erie is $43,300. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago the Redevelopment Authority and a private  
developer built five new houses across from the vacant lots on East 
23rd. Each was valued at about $45,000. Toran recently bought one 
of them, but the house next door remains unsold after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is crime in this area, and they have to do something  
about it,'' Toran says. ``But there are things you can do about it 
other than putting up some fence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Joyce Savocchio and residents first came up with the fence  
idea while brainstorming about ways to clean up the neighborhood, 
says Gary Horton, special assistant to the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Nolan, an Erie police narcotics detective, said authorities  
are targeting crime, not color. 
</P>
<P>
	``We won't lock them up just because they're standing there,''  
Nolan said. ``Any action on our part is a response from neighbors 
who live in the area and have to live with crime out in the open 24 
hours a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some people may find their way through or over the fence,  
Redmond acknowledges, but if it helps residents feel safer and 
makes law enforcement easier, it will be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very tiny piece of a puzzle,'' Redmond says.  
</P>
<P>
	The city already has installed a street light on the corner of  
22nd and German streets, where some of the worst problems occurred, 
Horton says, and the surrounding area has been designated an 
enterprise zone to spur new business. 
</P>
<P>
	``The larger issue of creating jobs and opportunity in that area  
is a much bigger challenge and a much loftier goal,'' Horton says. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents in the area are reluctant to talk. They barely  
peeked their noses out when a reporter rang their doorbells and 
said they didn't want to get on anyone's bad side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't go up in there at all,'' says Mary Boyd, 65, who was  
waiting down the street to catch a bus.

<HEADLINE> NATO, Milosevic Standing Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic fails  
to buckle under NATO air bombardment aimed at weakening his 
military and forcing peace in Kosovo, the Clinton administration 
faces few options for leading NATO out of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The only strategy so far revealed: more bombs and missiles.  
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot predict with certainty how long these operations  
will need to continue,'' President Clinton admitted in his official 
notification of the action, sent to Congress three days into the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the bombing campaign increased over the weekend and the  
risks of NATO action underscored by the loss of an F-117A stealth 
fighter jet Saturday, critics are looking for an end game. 
</P>
<P>
	Airstrike supporters say weakening Milosevic's military will be  
enough to justify the assault and allow an exit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The end state of action here is a substantially diminished  
military capability, a substantially diminished Milosevic, a 
substantially higher cost. I would say that's a better ending,'' 
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said on ABC-TV's ``This 
Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say even an air campaign that hits its targets but  
leaves Milosevic in power raises new dangers that may require 
ground troops -- something neither Clinton nor NATO is publicly 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
	After five days of attack, both Clinton and Milosevic are  
standing firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict has already affected neighboring countries, with  
two Yugoslav planes shot down over Bosnia and 100 Marines 
dispatched to Macedonia to protect the U.S. embassy from violent 
protests by Macedonian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	And democratic leaders of Montenegro -- which, like Serbia, is  
one of two republics of Yugoslavia -- find themselves undermined by 
NATO strikes that are hitting their soil as well as Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the Serbian province of Kosovo, which NATO aims to  
protect, violence continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this portends for the United States is a very nasty,  
counterproductive result from whatever our declared strategy tries 
to achieve,'' said Bruce Johnson, senior fellow at the Hudson 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO boosters in Congress are counting on the pounding to render  
Milosevic too weak militarily to abuse Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dynamic that is hoped for at this stage is that people  
inside Milosevic's administration will start to see the advantage 
of bringing the slaughter of Kosovar Albanians to an end,'' said 
Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the 
House International Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, senior Democrat on the House Armed  
Services Committee, said Milosevic ``is going to wake up one of 
these mornings and find he hasn't got a military. When the Serbs in 
Kosovo see their godfather in shambles, there's not much they can 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic has no defenders on Capitol Hill, but there were  
doubts from the beginning about the legality and efficacy of NATO's 
use of violence to achieve peace. Now, concerns are growing about 
how it will end. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., reluctantly voted to support the  
assault. But now he criticizes Clinton for linking an end to 
attacks not just to a cease-fire but to acceptance by Milosevic of 
the Rambouillet peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a goal is too open-ended, too vague and too open to the  
potential for 'mission creep,'' Wellstone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics doubt that Milosevic will collapse and see little hope  
for success in an operation that does not aim to remove him from 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress want to revert to a nonviolent strategy  
aimed at ousting the Yugoslav strongman. As the attack got under 
way, a group of Republican senators proposed to toughen sanctions, 
increase propaganda broadcasts and provide $100 million to develop 
democracy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Other senators want to arm the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army as a  
way for NATO to hand off protection of Kosovo to the ethnic 
Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, said he finds that proposal appealing,  
to ``let those folks fight it out on their own. You're not going to 
stop the killing without troops on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett wants to know what will follow airstrikes if Milosevic  
fails to yield and expressed dismay at reports that Clinton, when 
asked that just before NATO struck, couldn't answer and turned to 
Berger, who said, ``We will continue the bombing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Bennett asked the same question at closed-door briefings,  
the senator said, ``We got only a muddy kind of discussion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., said he didn't want to say anything to  
encourage Milosevic, but, ``As far as an end game, there is none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If we leave tomorrow, Milosevic wins,'' Smith said. ``If we  
leave next year and we don't bring him down, we still lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best outcome, said John Hillen of the Center for Strategic  
and International Studies, would be for Milosevic to fold and the 
Kosovars not to take advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Democrat Lee Hamilton, who just retired from Congress to  
join the Woodrow Wilson Center foreign policy think tank, said 
administration strategists don't even know how to get the 7,300 
remaining U.S. troops out of Bosnia and are ``not really addressing 
the question of an exit strategy for Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They've stated the objectives in such a way that they probably  
can claim victory in a lot of different circumstances,'' Hamilton 
said. ``But we are way over-committed in the Balkans.''

<HEADLINE> Irabu's Last Outing Looms Large </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hideki Irabu has a lot riding on his final  
spring start. His teammates confidence may be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees right-hander, coming off his third straight  
lackluster outing against major leaguers Saturday, has team 
officials placing greater emphasis on his expected start Thursday 
against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``A bad outing would create doubt -- not for me -- but the team,''  
Yankees pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said. ``No question they're 
a demanding bunch. Hopefully we will see a big turnaround. 
Hopefully it's just a one day setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees are more concerned about Irabu's apparent lack of  
concentration than the six runs and 13 hits allowed over five 
innings in an 11-10 loss to Philadelphia on Saturday. In that game, 
Irabu failed to cover first base on an infield grounder and had 
three runners steal second uncontested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time a pitcher doesn't cover first base, it usually means  
you're not mentally into the game,'' Stottlemyre said. ``Hopefully 
we can get some improvement -- which we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are no current plans to drop Irabu from the starting  
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not happy, but I'm not ready to give up on him,'' Yankees  
owner George Steinbrenner said. ``If the manager or general manager 
can't get the point across, I know who will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irabu has allowed 14 runs -- 13 earned -- and 24 hits in 15 2-3  
innings. If he continues to falter, the Yankees could turn to spot 
starter Ramiro Mendoza, who went 10-2 last season in 41 games -- 
including 14 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to perform better. He has to give a better effort on  
the field,'' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. ``When 
there's a question mark, then there's uncertainty. You still have 
time on the clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre said Irabu has worked hard this spring, but admits  
there are still communication problems with the Japanese-speaking 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York pitchers went through extensive drills Sunday --  
including covering first base -- which Stottlemyre said were 
previously planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully he didn't look at that as punishment,'' Stottlemyre  
said. ``It addressed all the pitchers. It's time to impress on them 
the little things. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre will talk with Irabu before the pitcher's scheduled  
side throwing session Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``My role is very important out there and I know it,'' Irabu  
said through interpreter George Rose. ``I have to think of my 
teammates and coaches who are working very hard. I have to work 
hard when I'm out there.''

<HEADLINE> Rich Hawaii Trust Mired in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- What would Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop think?  
</P>
<P>
	She left an estate now estimated at $10 billion, one of the  
world's richest trusts. Its sole purpose: to educate children of 
native Hawaiian ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the past two years, the trustees of the Bishop estate  
have been embroiled in a public tangle of boardroom intrigue, 
questionable investments, IRS audits and allegations of criminal 
acts. 
</P>
<P>
	It all tumbled into a tawdry mix of sex and suicide in early  
March when an estate attorney killed herself after being caught in 
a tryst with a trustee in a hotel men's room. The trustee then 
attempted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Attorney General Margery Bronster intends to ask a  
judge to remove at least four of the five once untouchable trustees 
from their posts, alleging they withheld $350 million from the 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of trustees is dysfunctional ``and it's not servicing  
the beneficiaries and it cannot in this atmosphere,'' said Gov. Ben 
Cayetano. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot see how the court would ignore the present  
situation,'' Cayetano said. ``It's an unworkable situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop Estate, Hawaii's largest private landowner, was created  
in 1884 by the will of the princess, a descendant of King 
Kamehameha, the man who unified the islands in the late 18th 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	The revenue from 337,000 acres of Hawaii land -- and worldwide  
investments that include 10 percent of the Wall Street firm Goldman 
Sachs &AMP; Co. -- is used solely to finance Kamehameha Schools, a 
600-acre campus for 3,100 Hawaiian students that sits on a wooded 
hillside overlooking downtown Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	It also pays more than $840,000 a year in commissions to each of  
the estate's politically powerful Hawaiian trustees -- Gerard 
Jervis, 50; Henry Peters, 58; Richard ``Dickie'' Wong, 65; Oswald 
Stender, 67; and Lokelani Lindsey, 60. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate became the center of public melodrama in 1997 when  
the school community learned of a private confrontation between 
Lindsey, the lead trustee for education, and student body president 
Kamani Kuala`au, who was bound for Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuala'au said Lindsey lectured him for 2 1/2 hours because he  
supported school president Michael Chun, who was feuding with 
Lindsey. 
</P>
<P>
	``How would you feel if I wrote a letter to Princeton and told  
them that you're a rabble-rouser?'' he said Lindsey told him. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 demonstrators associated with Kamehameha took to the  
streets, demanding that Lindsey quit meddling. 
</P>
<P>
	Five prominent community leaders then wrote an August 1997 essay  
in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. They alleged mismanagement of trust 
assets, conflicts of interests by individual trustees and poor 
selection of trustees, who are named by members of the Hawaii 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronster, ordered to investigate by the governor, accused the  
trustees of using trust assets to create an economic empire, 
engaging in kickback schemes, awarding improper contracts, making 
sweetheart deals for relatives and friends and using improper 
business practices, ``all of which have hurt the trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That investigation led to Peters' indictment in November for  
allegedly receiving a $192,500 kickback in an estate land deal 
involving Wong's brother-in-law. Wong is being investigated in the 
same scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Bronster's investigation also revealed the IRS had been  
reviewing trust operations, including trustee compensation and the 
schools' racial exclusivity policy, for at least three years. After 
preliminary findings were delivered in January, a judge declared 
the trustees in conflict of interest and named a separate panel to 
negotiate with the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
	An internal dispute became public when Stender and Jervis sued  
to oust Lindsey for allegedly mismanaging Kamehameha Schools and 
intimidating teachers and students. A judge's verdict on the 
lawsuit is pending. 
</P>
<P>
	And last year, a court-appointed special master said the estate  
lost $242 million during three fiscal years ending in 1996 and 
could have done better by opening a standard savings account. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, on March 3, Jervis and estate lawyer Rene Ojiri Kitaoka,  
39, were caught having sex in a men's restroom at the Hawaii Prince 
Hotel. Kitaoka was chief legal counsel for estate subsidiary 
Kamehameha Investment Corp. Jervis, as a trustee, is chairman of 
the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Kitaoka died of carbon monoxide poisoning in the  
garage of her home. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, Jervis swallowed an overdose of sleeping pills. He  
was released from a hospital March 22 and promptly apologized for 
``the mistakes I have made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not know what the future may bring,'' Jervis said. ``But  
I have always believed that I should be held accountable for all 
the good and bad that I do.''

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Weiss Confound Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- This was not how it was supposed to go  
for the United States at figure skating's world championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Kwan and Michael Weiss both won medals, but the results  
were a bit confounding: Kwan was supposed to do better than silver; 
Weiss was not supposed to win a medal at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the competition, the path seemed clear for Kwan to  
capture her third world title. Then she caught a cold and faltered 
in the short and long programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Butyrkskaya became the first Russian woman to win a world  
title, and she did so at the expense of Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan was lucky to leave with a silver because she could have  
been marked lower in the short program. She fell on the relatively 
simple double axel while others delivered clean programs with more 
difficult jumps. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long program, she barely got second in the free skating.  
Bronze medalist Julia Soldatova is just 17, part of Russia's deep 
reservoir of young talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss was a long shot for a medal, needing to beat at least one  
of the trio of top Russians or three-time world champion Elvis 
Stojko of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss's first clean quad in the qualifying put him in a position  
to be a contender. Then, although slightly two-footing the jump in 
the final program, he had seven good triples to gain the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Goebel came in 12th but he added his name to the skating  
history books with a quadruple salchow -- a solo one in qualifying 
and in combination with a triple toe loop in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Trifun Zivanovic came in 16th, performing well during qualifying  
but faltering a bit in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel and Zivanovic made their debuts at senior worlds, as did  
Angela Nikodinov, 17th in the women. 
</P>
<P>
	Finishing between Kwan and Nikodinov for the United States was  
13-year-old Sarah Hughes. Her place on the American team came at 
the expense of another 13-year-old skater, Naomi Nari Nam 
</P>
<P>
	Although both were under the 15-year-old age minimum, Hughes was  
picked because of an exception that allows junior worlds medalists 
to participate in the senior worlds. Hughes was second in the world 
junior championships in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes did not disappoint. She nailed six triples, including two  
triple lutzes, to finish sixth in the free skating and seventh 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairs group finishers were Kyoko Ina and new partner John  
Zimmerman, ninth, and national champion Danielle and Steve 
Hartsell, 10th. Laura Handy and J. Paul Binnebose had to withdraw 
when Binnebose had the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	In dance, Naomi Lang and Russian-born Peter Tchernyshev were  
10th in their first worlds. Eve Chalom and British-born Mathew 
Gates were 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the this year's results the United States will have  
three women, two men, pairs and ice dance couples at the world 
championships in Brisbane, Australia, in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan is still a question mark as she debates how much she will  
skate if she decides to go to college. Also, her competition 
schedule could be affected by an International Skating Union 
decision requesting all skaters who finish in the top six in the 
world championships to commit to the Grand Prix series. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan bypassed Grand Prix events this year to concentrate on more  
lucrative events.

<TEXT>
<P>
	IRWINDALE, Calif. (AP) -- A driver was killed on the opening day  
of Irwindale Speedway when his car hit a wall at 100 mph and 
flipped during practice, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Diemert, 23, of Roseburg, Ore., died of head injuries  
shortly before 3 p.m. Saturday at Arcadia Methodist Hospital, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diemert, whose father, Jim, was at the track, crashed about 2  
p.m. while trying to avoid a stalled car on the track, police Agent 
Mark Benavides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diemert's sprint car struck a wall, spun and flipped, he said.  
Emergency crews cut Diemert from the car and he was airlifted to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people were in the stands at the time of the  
crash, which occurred minutes after the gates opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing went on Saturday night after opening ceremonies attended  
by actor James Garner, Olympian Bruce Jenner and Indianapolis 500 
winners Parnelli Jones and Danny Sulllivan.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen early Monday amid  
continued uncertainty over the situation in Yugoslavia. Japanese 
stock prices edged higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.46 yen in early trading, up 1.70 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 120.26 
yen late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 46.77  
points, or 0.29 percent, to 16,063.76 points in the first 30 
minutes of trading. On Friday, the average closed up 30.95 points, 
or 0.19 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar held firm in early Tokyo  
trading, as uncertainty resulting from the U.S.-led NATO bombing in 
Yugoslavia continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Also supporting the U.S. currency was aggressive buying by  
Japanese banks before Japan's fiscal year end on March 31, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There doesn't seem to be any reason for the NATO forces to  
cease attacks (on Yugoslavia) in the near future, and this could 
lead to more safe-haven dollar buying,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu, 
foreign exchange manager at Commerzbank. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar is often considered as a safe haven in times of  
international unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo factor is also hurting the euro, which was pushed to  
a new record low Friday on fears the situation in Yugoslavia 
deteriorates further. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 129.52 yen, up from  
128.78 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices opened higher on continued  
buying by investors from abroad as trading remained quiet with the 
fiscal year drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 2.03 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,269.74 
points. The TOPIX closed up 11.95 points, or 0.94 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.800 percent from Friday's finish of 1.805 percent, 
driving its price up to 100.00 yen from 99.95 yen.

	NATO Enters New Attack Phase  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ordering up more firepower, NATO  
raced against time to smash Serb military units and head off what 
it called ``genocide'' against Kosovo Albanians. The fifth straight 
night of airstrikes began late today, with about 50 warplanes, 
including six F-117A stealth fighters, taking off from the NATO air 
base in Aviano, Italy. Meanwhile, thousands of ethnic Albanian 
refugees, accusing Serbs of systematic brutality, fled into 
neighboring Albania and Macedonia. Officials in both countries 
pleaded for international help to prevent a humanitarian crisis, 
and Albania called for NATO ground troops to enter Kosovo -- 
something NATO says it has no plans to do.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin, deploring the  
use of force in Kosovo and Iraq, will tell the Russian parliament 
on Tuesday that he will not accept ``strong arm decisions'' by NATO 
in Europe, according to portions of his prepared 
state-of-the-nation speech. Despite the rift, Yeltsin renews his 
commitment to slashing nuclear weapons arsenals and reaffirms his 
commitment to market reforms. In his speech, he plans to say 
``defrosting'' of the icy relationship ``depends on how soon the 
alliance will realize the peril of the military option towards 
Yugoslavia.''

	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Senate leader Luis Gonzalez Macchi was  
sworn in as Paraguay's new president tonight after Raul Cubas 
stepped down. Cubas' resignation ended nearly a week of political 
turmoil that tested the South American nation's 10-year-old 
democracy. Macchi had pushed for Cubas' ouster. Cubas said he 
lamented the fighting in the streets that led to the start of his 
impeachment trial last week on charges of abuse of power. He also 
asked for the forgiveness of all Paraguayans who voted for him.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. said in its annual report  
that it plans to eliminate about 4,600 jobs as part of its merger 
with the former Norwest Corp. Since the deal with the Minnesota 
bank was finalized in November, Wells has been reluctant to 
disclose how its plans to slash $650 million in annual expenses 
will translate into lost jobs. A bank spokesman indicated that 
natural attrition could take care of most of the job cuts, which 
will come over this year and next.

	Purdue Beats Duke for Title  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Purdue bounced back after the worst half  
ever in an NCAA championship game and beat Duke 62-45 tonight for 
its first women's national title. It happened because seniors Ukari 
Figgs and Stephanie White-McCarty, who had gone through so many 
tough times early in their career, refused to get down after the 
team's terrible first half. They were the driving force in a 12-1 
second half run that pulled the Boilermakers from behind and put 
them ahead to stay.

<HEADLINE> United States 3, Mexico 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Kristine Lilly scored twice in the final  
six minutes as the United States overcame a strong effort by Mexico 
goalkeeper Linnea Quinones for a 3-0 victory in women's soccer 
Sunday at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had an enormous 42-1 edge in shots and 20-1 in  
shots on goal, but were stymied by Quinones for most of the match. 
Quinones, a 19-year old San Diego resident who plays for San Diego 
State, made 16 saves in her sixth international match. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give Mexico credit,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``They  
defended well and their goalkeeper played a wonderful match. We had 
a lot of good shots, and although two goals came at the end, I 
think it was a deserved result. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've said it before, but we're going to see teams bunker on us  
in the World Cup, and we have to to be effective attacking the 
defense and breaking it down. We did a good job today, but we must 
get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team took a 1-0 lead in the 38th minute when Julie  
Foudy headed Shannon MacMillan's pass past Quinones. The scoring 
sequence began with Lilly's short corner kick to MacMillan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly scored her first goal in the 85th minute, putting a shot  
from the right corner of the penalty area inside the left goalpost. 
She scored her second in the 88th minute, putting in a rebound from 
10 yards after Mexican defender Susie Mora headed out Mia Hamm's 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we were playing one of the best teams in the world,''  
said Quinones. ``But we came out to prove to ourselves and everyone 
else that we deserve to be in the World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American goalkeeper Briana Scurry needed only to make one save  
in posting the 47th shutout of her six-year international career 
and fourth this year. Maribel Dominguez took Mexico's shot, 
receiving a long pass, dribbling past American captain Carla 
Overbeck and shooting from just inside the penalty area. Scurry 
leaped to catch her shot and fell down from its force. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. squad has never lost to Mexico, winning the inaugural  
match 12-0 in 1991, followed by 9-0 victories in 1994 and 1998. 
However, Mexico has been buoyed by the recent addition of several 
current and former U.S. college players -- eligible to play because 
at least one parent was born in Mexico. Seven of its 11 starters 
are current or former U.S. college players, with six listing 
California cities as their hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, before 27,034 fans, increased the Americans'  
team-record domestic unbeaten streak to 49 matches since a 2-1 loss 
to Norway on Feb. 4, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The match, which preceded an MLS game between the Dallas Burn  
and Los Angeles Galaxy. It was the Americans' first of nine in 
preparation for the Women's World Cup later this year. The tour 
resumes April 22 with a match against China in Hershey, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup final will be played July 10 at the Rose  
Bowl.

<HEADLINE> Report: Soccer Execs Given Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Senior FIFA officials were bombarded with lavish  
gifts from Japanese and South Koreans to influence their votes 
during bidding for the 2002 World Cup, a report said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Sunday Times, the gifts, such as laptop  
computers and video cameras, were part of the ``aggressive 
lobbying'' by the two candidates who wound up co-hosting the event 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an attempt to influence us,'' David Will, a Scottish  
lawyer who is a FIFA vice president, was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was small beer compared with the International Olympic  
Committee,'' he said in a reference to the IOC's Salt Lake City 
scandal. ``But it was a clear attempt to influence and for this 
reason we said, `No more.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Sunday Times, Will received a laptop personal  
computer worth about $1,670 from the South Koreans and a video 
camera from the Japanese worth about $1,170. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Blazer, a New Yorker who is the secretary general of the  
Confederation of North and Central American and Caribbean Football 
and joined FIFA's executive committee last year, was reported to 
have said the practice was widespread although he did not receive 
any gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the last executive committee received laptop  
computers, cameras and things of that nature, which were by and 
large products of the countries that were doing the bidding,'' he 
told the Sunday Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was deemed to be excessive from the viewpoint of proper  
hospitality. It wasn't something that was given to one of two 
people, it was given across the board to everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest allegations come after suggestions that a Middle  
Eastern figure bribed 20 FIFA representatives to buy votes in last 
year's presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	It was reported that the payments were intended to help Sepp  
Blatter defeat UEFA president Lennart Johansson. It was not 
suggested that Blatter, who won the election, was involved.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chicago Editor Roy Fisher Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Roy M. Fisher, former dean of the  
University of Missouri School of Journalism and former editor in 
chief of the old Chicago Daily News, has died. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher died Thursday in Evanston, Ill. The university said the  
death followed a lengthy illness but did not give the cause of 
death. He had been a resident of Wilmette, Ill., since retiring 
from the university in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	A graduate of Kansas State University with a degree in  
journalism, Fisher worked at the Hastings (Neb.) Tribune and was 
city editor of the Pratt (Kan.) Daily Tribune before joining the 
Navy in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Chicago Daily News as a reporter after the war,  
later becoming city editor and assistant managing editor. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Fisher's leadership from December 1965 until January 1971,  
the Daily News won several awards, including a 1969 Pulitzer for 
articles exposing a conflict of interest in the stock holdings of 
one of President Richard Nixon's Supreme Court nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the paper during the turbulent era of the civil rights  
movement, the 1968 Democratic Convention and the Chicago Seven 
trial. He also brought national attention to the Daily News by 
giving columnist Mike Royko prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher left the Daily News in 1971 to become journalism dean at  
the University of Missouri's main campus in Columbia, a job he held 
until 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher stepped down as dean in 1983 and moved to Washington to  
run the university's graduate reporting program. He retired in 1989 
and moved back to the Chicago area with his wife, Anne. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides his wife, he is survived by four daughters, two brothers  
and a sister.

<HEADLINE> Spartans Confident About Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Tom Izzo hopes the experience his  
Michigan State team gained this year will be enough to get the 
Spartans back to the Final Four next season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans, as usual, were gritty and determined, but they  
weren't quite good enough to take advantage of top-ranked Duke, 
even when the Blue Devils showed up at the Tropicana Dome without 
their best game. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke won their semifinal matchup 68-62 Saturday night and will  
play Connecticut for the NCAA championship Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to sit here and say we're better than Duke,''  
Izzo said Sunday. ``We're not. I think we proved we belonged in 
that game. But we didn't win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Duke's second this season over No. 2 Michigan  
State (33-5) and both were by six points. This one gave Duke a 
chance at its third title this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo feels that kind of experience was invaluable to Duke. The  
Blue Devils weren't awestruck by the glare of playing in the 
national spotlight. But the Spartans were. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids had never played a game of that magnitude before,''  
Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point during the first half, Izzo called a timeout to  
find out why the team wasn't running plays he had called. Some of 
them told him they didn't know the plays had been called. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `What are we doing?' I knew then that guys didn't hear  
me,'' Izzo said. ``That was the `Deer in the Headlight,' if you 
want to call it that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Spartans didn't fold. It was a trademark of theirs  
all season. They would frequently fall behind. But they never felt 
they were out of a game. As a result, they won six games by margins 
of five points or less. 
</P>
<P>
	They were 14 1/2-point underdogs against Duke, yet the Spartans  
were within three points with 8 1/2 minutes to play and Duke forward 
Elton Brand on the bench with four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
	``This one will gnaw at me,'' Izzo said, ``because you never  
know when you'll ever get back. Look at all the great coaches that 
have never been here. We'll be good next season, and maybe for a 
lot of seasons. But you never know if you'll be back. So many 
things have to fall just right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the game, Izzo and his staff felt that to have a  
chance against Duke the Spartans would have to stop the 3-point 
threat, stop the penetration game, and rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad because of the opportunity we maybe had,'' Izzo  
said. ``They did not play their `A' game. And we had said that when 
they do not play their `A' game, that was the time to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If nobody leaves early for the NBA, the Spartans will only lose  
three players from this squad: Antonio Smith, who was Izzo's first 
recruit, Thomas Kelly and Jason Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	Waiting in the wings are Mike Chappell, who sat out this season  
after transferring from Duke, and Jason Richardson, a 6-foot-5 
All-Stater from Saginaw Arthur Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some good guys coming in,'' Izzo said. ``But, will  
they give us the commitment these guys gave us for 38 games? That 
remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key, of course, will be whether Mateen Cleaves stays in  
school. Cleaves, the Spartans' charismatic leader, said immediately 
after the team clinched the Big Ten regular season championship 
that he was staying. 
</P>
<P>
	But players have a way of changing their minds.  
</P>
<P>
	``Mateen still has not given me any indication that he's  
leaving,'' Izzo said. ``But, I'm going to spend some time talking 
with him later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I personally think Mateen will be back next year and get  
better and maybe be a candidate for national player of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what, Izzo feels the bar has been taken up a notch for  
his team. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal now is to get back to that bar,'' Izzo said. ``We've  
got goals you can see now. It's going to be fun to see if we can 
achieve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His ultimate goal, as it has been all along, is to be compared  
with the great programs like Duke and Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not elite, because we just haven't done it long  
enough,'' Izzo said. ``I'd like to do it five years or so first. 
Then maybe we could look around and say, `You know what? We've got 
ourselves a nice little program here.'''

<HEADLINE> Missouri To Vote on Concealed Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHLAND, Mo. (AP) -- Over breakfast at Susie's Diner, sheriffs  
Ted Boehm and John Hemeyer share jokes and the latest news from 
their wives, who are cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	Boehm is from Boone County, on the north side of the Missouri  
River, and Hemeyer is from Cole County, south of the river. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than that body of water separates the two veteran  
lawmen as an April 6 election nears on Proposition B, which would 
legalize the carrying of concealed guns for the first time since 
1875, when outlaw Jesse James still roamed Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-three states have laws allowing concealed guns, but  
Missouri is the first to put the question to voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Boehm is an outspoken opponent, saying the law has major  
loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would require the sheriff to issue a permit to people who  
have been convicted of violent offenses, and that's bad,'' says 
Boehm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemeyer is a firm supporter, saying it's a matter of self  
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Their disagreement isn't unique. The Missouri Sheriffs'  
Association, which Boehm leads and which Hemeyer formerly served as 
president, has voted to remain neutral because its members' 
opinions are so varied. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Kansas City Star poll found Missourians just as  
divided. Of 600 registered voters, 42 percent were against the 
proposition and 39 percent were in favor. With the poll's margin of 
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, the contest is a 
statistical dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of Proposition B, led by the National Rifle Association,  
have been mounting a heavy barrage of television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	One TV commercial has the voice of a woman who was victimized by  
a serial rapist in St. Louis, urging voters to ``give me the right 
to protect myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both sheriffs pointed out that the rapist's victims were  
attacked in their homes, and that existing Missouri law allows 
people to carry hidden firearms at their homes or businesses for 
self-protection. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hemeyer said Proposition B would allow women to go beyond  
that. ``This is a choice I want my wife and daughter to have,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Missouri sheriffs would be on the front lines of implementing  
the proposed law, which says they ``shall'' issue concealed gun 
permits to applicants meeting certain requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Those include being at least 21, undergoing at least 12 hours of  
firearms instruction and being free of mental problems, and the 
abuse of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also requires applicants to be free of felony convictions in  
the past five years, but it says nothing about violent 
misdemeanors, or of violent felonies that have been pleaded down to 
misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	Boehm says the proposition has loopholes as large as the slab of  
country ham on Hemeyer's breakfast plate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is so poorly written that I would have no choice  
but to issue a permit to someone so long as they had been 
law-abiding for five years,'' Boehm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Time may not change a violent lawbreaker, Hemeyer said. But he  
said law-abiding Missouri residents should be allowed to keep 
criminals guessing by having the right to carry a hidden firearm. 
</P>
<P>
	That notion was applauded by actor Charlton Heston, president of  
the National Rifle Association, during recent visits to St. Louis 
and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It creates a climate of uncertainty for criminal predators,''  
Heston declared.

<HEADLINE> Dummy Satellite Orbiting Earth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- A dummy satellite orbited 23,000 miles  
above Earth Sunday, signaling success for the innovative launch pad 
floating in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The demonstration launch was a critical step for Sea Launch Co.,  
which has put $500 million into the first commercial marine-based 
launch system in hopes of capturing a chunk of the growing business 
of boosting communications satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mission is considered a complete success,'' said Tim  
Dolan, spokesman for U.S. aerospace giant Boeing, which owns part 
of Sea Launch. ``You can indeed launch a rocket of that size from a 
floating platform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ukrainian- and Russian-built Zenit-3SL rocket carried a  
dummy satellite as it lifted off at 8:30 p.m. EST Saturday from the 
Odyssey, a converted oil rig stationed 1,400 miles south of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Fueled by kerosene and liquid oxygen, the three-stage rocket  
ignited and engulfed the platform in a cloud of smoke, then rapidly 
hurtled toward space. About an hour later, the satellite separated 
from the third stage at an altitude of 1,200 miles and continued on 
toward its planned position 23,000 miles above Earth.

<HEADLINE> Parents Battle Gun Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHELDON, N.D. (AP) -- Even with 21 shotgun pellets still under  
his skin and a hole the size of a silver dollar in his back, young 
Frank Wall's energy is enough to make his mother roll her eyes and 
sigh. 
</P>
<P>
	She coaxes and finally orders the 10-year-old to a chair in the  
family's large farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you sit still and answer his questions,'' Bea Wall says,  
pointing her son toward a reporter at the kitchen table. ``Consider 
it part of your punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She snags Frank's 8-year-old brother, Nicholas, by the shirt as  
he tries to sneak through the kitchen. ``You too,'' she demands. 
Nicholas sulks but climbs onto a stool at the counter. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks earlier, Alvin and Bea Wall's two youngest were  
involved in something these strict but loving parents never 
imagined would happen. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mom helped pull a neighbor's tractor from the mud and Dad  
was at a livestock auction, Frank and Nicholas took a hunting rifle 
and shotgun from their father's gun case. 
</P>
<P>
	And as they later admitted they had done at least once  
previously, Frank practiced loading bullets into the hunting rifle 
while his little brother rested the 12-gauge shotgun on a chair. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time, the unthinkable happened. Unaware the shotgun had  
a shell in it, Nicholas pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast struck his older brother in the left shoulder, tearing  
a 4-inch-wide, 8-inch-long canyon halfway across his back and 
splattering flesh and blood around the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the skinny boy with dark, matted hair is mostly  
recovered; enough at least to chase his brother through the house 
again. Doctors stitched up most of his wound, but left one gaping 
hole open, stuffed with gauze, so the flesh will grow back and heal 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Thankful their two boys are alive, Alvin and Bea Wall are also  
stunned by the kids' actions, and they are bent on making the 
incident an example to others. 
</P>
<P>
	The lesson for kids: This is what can happen when you play with  
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	For parents: We trusted our kids as much as you think you can  
trust yours. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never, never imagined they touched the guns when we weren't  
around,'' says Alvin Wall, a farmer near the tiny town of Sheldon, 
about 50 miles southwest of Fargo. ``And then to find out this 
wasn't the first time. It was a shock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In rural areas like this, almost everyone has at least one or  
two guns for bird or deer hunting. They are looked at less as 
weapons than as essential tools. As with any hazardous tool, 
parents try to instill in their children the common sense to stay 
away from them. 
</P>
<P>
	As punishment for having not done so, the Walls have decided  
young Frank -- and maybe even Nicholas eventually -- must share the 
story with other youngsters. Schools, clubs, hunter safety classes. 
Wherever. He must admit to his actions and show the consequences, 
including his scar and the blood-soaked denim shirt. Mom -- only 
half joking -- insists he must also cart around the door to her 
dishwasher, pockmarked from shotgun pellets. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of telling the story doesn't sit well with young Frank.  
It's all so embarrassing, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	His dad steps in with stern words. ``You're going to have to do  
it every year until you're 21, so you might as well start 
practicing,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank lowers his head, recognizing the seriousness in his dad's  
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I have my say, you will go to the schools along with your  
bloody shirt if we have to handcuff you,'' his dad continues. 
``There has to be some good to come out of this, Frank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It started two weeks earlier on a Thursday afternoon when the  
youngest of the Walls' eight children were on spring break from 
school. Alvin Wall was more than 100 miles away at a livestock 
auction. Bea Wall had just received a phone call from a neighbor, 
asking for help freeing his tractor from the mud. 
</P>
<P>
	She left Frank and Nicholas at home with a list of household  
chores. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank says his mom was barely out the door when he turned to his  
little brother and motioned to the gun cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Walls kept ammunition for their guns locked away separately,  
but Frank and Nicholas had found a shotgun shell and two rifle 
bullets elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	As Frank tried to load the rifle, one bullet got jammed in the  
chamber and the second fell to the floor. He bent over to pick it 
up just as Nicholas pulled the trigger on the shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like a bee sting at first,'' Frank says. ``I thought  
I'd gotten hit by just one BB or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frank ran outside and get into the family truck, believing he  
could drive down the road and find his mom. Mom, however, had taken 
the keys. 
</P>
<P>
	He ran back inside and, with the help of his little brother,  
jumped in the shower, still convinced his wound wasn't that bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still thought maybe I had only one BB in me,'' he says.  
``Then I heard `ping, ping, ping, ping.' It was all the BBs falling 
into the shower.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas dialed 911. On another phone line, Frank hit the  
``redial'' button. At the other end, family friend Lynn Wolff heard 
a tiny voice say, ``I'm shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolff raced to the house 10 miles away. About that time, state  
Game and Fish Warden Tim Phalen was headed home from work when he 
heard the call over his radio and headed straight to the Walls' 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	On the kitchen floor, he found Frank lying on his stomach, his  
younger brother pressing a blood-soaked towel to Frank's back. At 
one point, Nicholas actually had stood on his brother's wound, 
trying to apply as much pressure as he could to stop the bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank was conscious, whimpering slightly. Nicholas, Phalen says,  
was obviously scared, but remarkably calm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frank's brother was more worried about making sure Mom knew  
they were going to be at the hospital,'' Phalen says. ``He was 
saying, `We've got to leave Mom a note.' So he grabbed a big pad of 
paper and was asking me, `How do you spell hospital?''' 
</P>
<P>
	As Frank was loaded into an ambulance, Wolff raced off to find  
Bea Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``He drove up to the gate, got out of the car and came trucking  
across the field,'' she says. ``As calmly as he could manage, he 
told me Frank had been shot but was still talking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two raced back to the Wall farm, just missing the ambulance.  
At the house, Bea saw the blood trail leading to the truck and the 
pools of blood on the kitchen floor. In the shower, the drain was 
so clogged with buckshot and her son's flesh that the water had 
backed up. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hospital 30 miles away, doctors removed as much of the shot  
as they could and stitched Frank up. His father, paged in the 
middle of the livestock auction, sped home. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays still show 21 small pellets under the skin on Frank's  
back. Some will be there for years before working their way to the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
	The pellets, along with what will become a large scar, will be  
reminders of what Frank and Nicholas recognize as the stupidest 
thing they ever did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Curiosity,'' Frank says, struggling with the big word,  
``killed the cat, and it almost killed Frank and Nicholas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For their parents, and even Phalen, a game warden for 12 years,  
the shooting was a rude awakening. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got two little kids, too,'' Phalen says. ``The first  
thing I did when I got home that day was to hug them and say, `You 
know never to touch the guns, right?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Phalen keeps most of his firearms, even his boys' BB guns,  
locked in a gun vault with the ammunition stored elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says even that is no guarantee against childhood  
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one ever thinks their kids would do such a thing,'' he  
says. ``As much as you want to believe that, kids are kids and they 
are curious.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Gore: I'd Do It My Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Tipper Gore is a big admirer of  
Hillary Rodham Clinton, but says she would be a different kind of 
first lady should Vice President Al Gore capture the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is a key adviser to her husband; Mrs. Gore  
dispenses her advice when asked, most often at home or during a 
walk. Would she be a fixture in the Oval Office, offering policy 
advice? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done it that way,'' she said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton has one daughter who is away at college, Mrs.  
Gore notes that she has four children (one still at home), a 
grandchild due in June and two elderly parents in the Washington, 
D.C. area. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a difference when you have four children to keep up  
with and all of their activities,'' she said. ``With four children 
and aging parents, I find that I only spend so much time on issues 
that I care about, and I spend a lot of time on keeping the family 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore is most active in mental health care and fighting  
homelessness and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	She is reluctant to compare or contrast her style with that of  
Mrs. Clinton, noting that her husband has only opened a 
presidential exploratory committee and is not officially a 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore, 50, said she is a friend and admirer of Mrs. Clinton,  
a fellow baby boomer who is one year older. But she has her own 
style: ``Anyone who finds herself in the role of first lady 
reflects her individuality and who she is as a person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their differences and similarities are certain to be scrutinized  
as the second lady becomes more visible during the 2000 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	She has appeared recently in New Hampshire and Iowa and she  
substituted for Clinton this weekend when he canceled his scheduled 
appearance at the California Democratic Party convention due to the 
U.S.-led airstrikes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Both women are crowd-pleasers on the stump. Mrs. Gore has  
neither the polish nor the edge of Mrs. Clinton, but her disarming, 
just-folks demeanor charmed delegates Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	When her TelePrompTer didn't immediately flash her speech, she  
cracked a joke, and by the time the laughter died down, the speech 
was ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
	She then whipped up Democratic activists with a speech in which  
she took credit on behalf of the Clinton administration for the 
economic boom of the 1990s. She warned that Republicans are bent on 
using the budget surplus for a tax cut that would require cutting 
federal education and nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The other party's agenda is based on ideas from 1822,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview Saturday, she added: ``This is going to be an  
all-out battle for the direction the country's going to go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore was a news photographer and her husband a reporter in  
Nashville before he was a congressman, yet she lamented the 
scandal-fed shark tank Washington has become at a time when the 
news media is ever more fixated on celebrities and their failings. 
</P>
<P>
	``People both in the media and in public life would welcome a  
return to a more civil discourse on all sides, and more of a 
respect for the fact that these are individuals, human beings in 
extraordinary situations,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes' Future Is Bright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Despite the disappointment of a  
64-58 loss to Connecticut in the NCAA semifinals, it's difficult 
for Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien not to be optimistic about the 
direction his program is taking. 
</P>
<P>
	In a solemn locker room after Saturday's game, O'Brien told his  
team to look beyond the season-ending defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them not to lose sight of the big picture,'' O'Brien  
said. ``I told them I was proud of them, once again. It was a 
disappointing loss, but when you think about the big picture, I 
think that's the thing we need to focus on. I'm very happy about 
the big picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just a year ago, the Buckeyes were coming off a fifth straight  
losing season -- the longest streak of sub-.500 years in school 
history. They were 8-22 in 1997-98, matching the school record for 
losses in a season. Their 1-15 Big Ten record left them in last 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Buckeyes -- with transfer guard Scoonie Penn and  
sophomore Michael Redd leading the way -- put together a remarkable 
27-9 season that led all the way to Ohio State's first trip to the 
Final Four in 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great opportunity, the ride we had,'' Penn said. ``I  
feel we have nothing to hang our heads about. It's a great 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With four starters and nine of the 11 players on the roster  
back, expectations will be high. Ohio State scored 354 points in 
its five NCAA tournament games -- all but 46 by underclassmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're basically the same team,'' Redd said. ``We have that  
confidence that we can do the same thing next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penn and Redd have said they have no intention of leaving school  
early for the NBA. Center Ken Johnson, timid and foul-prone in 
December, became a cunning shot-blocker and adequate scorer. 
Currently a junior, he even discovered that by virtue of a federal 
judge throwing out the NCAA's Proposition 16 academic requirements, 
he might gain another year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a great year,'' Johnson said. ``My attitude is to stay  
positive. We have a great team. Now, we look ahead to next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No longer are the Buckeyes wide-eyed innocents when it comes to  
big games and win-or-go-home tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've learned a lot of lessons from March,'' guard Brian Brown  
said. ``Now we know what it takes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Singleton and Neshaun Coleman will be lost to graduation,  
but O'Brien will add three recruits that should fit into the mix. 
One -- 7-foot-3, 245-pound Aleksandar Radojevic from Montenegro -- 
played this season at Barton County (Kan.) Community College and is 
considered by many to be the top juco player in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Buckeyes can bask in one of the greatest turnarounds  
ever in college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien already knows how far the Buckeyes have come.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping that in some small way we've been able to restore  
some of the respectability to Ohio State's basketball program,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Tournament Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Childhood buddies Ricky Moore and  
William Avery haven't spoken during the NCAA tournament and don't 
plan to start now. 
</P>
<P>
	The former high school teammates will be on opposing sides in  
the national championship game, and friendly conversation is off 
limits until the title is decided. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to speak after the game,'' said Moore,  
Connecticut's defensive stopper. ``We're enemies right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery, Duke's sophomore point guard, is not so sure his one-time  
mentor will be able to keep his mouth shut during the game. He 
expects some good-natured trash-talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's probably going to say some things to me to try to get me  
to do something uncharacteristic of my game,'' Avery said Sunday. 
``But I'm not going to get into a personal duel with him ... I 
don't even know him right now. I think that's the way you have to 
do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore and Avery grew up a block from one another in the Sand  
Hill section of Augusta, Ga., and led Westside High School to a 
33-1 record and a state championship four years ago. With the 
exception of a few pickup games, they haven't faced one another 
much since Moore left for college. 
</P>
<P>
	The Huskies also recruited Avery, who was two years behind  
Moore, but the younger player opted for Duke after spending his 
senior year of high school at Oak Hill Academy in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The coaches asked me about him and what he could do,'' Moore  
recalled. ``At the time, I think William wanted to go away and make 
a name for himself and not follow me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun calls Moore the best defensive  
player he's ever coached. The 6-foot-2 senior held Ohio State's 
Scoonie Penn to 11 points on 3-for-13 shooting in the national 
semifinals, and usually is asked to guard an opponent's best 
perimeter player. 
</P>
<P>
	While Duke is expecting Moore to start out on Trajan Langdon, it  
won't be a surprise if the Huskies' stopper also spends time on 
Avery, who averaged 15 points this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever is hot at the time, whoever is making shots, I am  
going to have to switch up on them,'' Moore said. ``Right now, we 
don't know who we will be guarding. But it doesn't matter who I'm 
guarding. I am just going to go out and cause havoc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avery said Moore was much more of a scoring threat in high  
school than now. The Duke guard's offensive skills have helped 
establish him as a better pro prospect at this stage of their 
college careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably knows that and is going to try to show me up if he  
can,'' Avery said of Moore, who became sort of a mentor to his 
younger friend when Avery was in eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	``He probably thinks he has an advantage,'' the Duke sophomore  
added. ``He knows my moves, and some of my moves came from him. So 
if anybody knows my game, it's him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither has a clue of who folks back home will be rooting for.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really matter,'' Moore said. ``We'll be out on the  
court and have to handle our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DECEIVING LOOKS: Avery, who's 6-foot-2, 180 pounds, has the body  
as well as skills of a prototype point guard. Connecticut's Khalid 
El-Amin -- at 5-10, 203 -- looks more like he should be carrying a 
football than distributing a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, El-Amin has emerged as one of the nation's leading  
playmakers and has a knack for doing whatever is necessary to help 
the Huskies win. 
</P>
<P>
	The sophomore said that while he exercises and tries to watch  
his diet to control his weight, he isn't overly concerned about his 
physique. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looks can be deceiving,'' El-Amin said. ``And that's  
definitely the case with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SHOW SOME RESPECT: After being a favorite all season,  
Connecticut finds itself in an unusual role of underdog. Calhoun, 
however, bristled at a question suggesting the Huskies faced an 
overmatched opponent in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't control what others say and others feel,'' he said.  
``First thing, Ohio State more than belonged here. They beat Auburn 
and St. John's in a matter of 48 hours. And in my neighborhood, 
that's pretty good stuff. As a matter of fact, very, very good 
stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ROOTING FOR YOU: Langdon has followed the success of Duke's  
women's team throughout the season. He and teammates Shane Battier 
and Chris Carrawell made the hour trip from Durham to Greensboro 
last week to watch the women upset Tennessee in the East Regional 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior guard planned to be in front of a television Sunday  
night when Duke faced Purdue for the women's national title in San 
Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been watching them all season, and they're playing the  
best they have all year,'' Langdon said. ``I'm so happy for them 
because nobody thought they could beat Tennessee, and now they get 
to play for the national championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Duke lost 62-45.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	STICK TO LOW POST: Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski constantly  
encourages his players to try to expand their games. Player of the 
Year Elton Brand is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last week, he was in point-guard drills. We allowed him to use  
one of those things (Saturday night against Michigan State),'' 
Krzyzewski said, referring to Brand handling the ball on fast break 
only to wind up with his fourth foul on a charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've eliminated him from point-guard drills,'' the coach  
said. ``Especially when he has three fouls.''

<HEADLINE> Duke Favored by 9 1/2 Over UConn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- This city's oddsmakers don't give Connecticut  
much of a chance against Duke in the national championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke is a 9 1/2-point favorite to beat Connecticut and win the  
national title at most Las Vegas sports books. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bettors love Duke,'' said Pete Korner, who sets the odds  
for Las Vegas Sports Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke failed to cover the spread in Saturday's 68-62 win over  
Michigan State, in which the Blue Devils were 11 1/2-point favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, meanwhile, was a 5 1/2-point favorite over Ohio State,  
and won by six points. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was just luck,'' Korner said of the oddsmaking in that  
game. ``You always remember the ones that are close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the makeup of the Final Four was set, bettors could get  
9-2 odds on Connecticut winning the national championship. But to 
bet Duke, they faced 1-7 odds, meaning they had to bet $7 to win a 
dollar.

<HEADLINE> Five Arrested in Nuke Plant Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Five activists were arrested Sunday as  
they trespassed onto the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating 
Station to mark the 20th anniversary of America's worst commercial 
nuclear accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The five crossed over a set of railroad tracks onto the property  
of GPU Nuclear Corp. to close a pre-dawn rally and were arrested 
without incident. 
</P>
<P>
	The vigil marked the moment about 4 a.m. on March 28, 1979, when  
a pump stopped operating in a non-nuclear part of the plant's Unit 
2. Mechanical problems and human error caused more than one-third 
of the reactor's uranium fuel to melt. 
</P>
<P>
	The company and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said only  
insignificant amounts of radiation escaped the plant during the 
days following the accident, but activists contend monitoring was 
inadequate and the actual amount is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 people -- veterans of the nuclear debate and  
newcomers -- gathered in the rain outside the plant to light candles 
and speak out against continuing reliance on nuclear power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Half the crowd here was not alive when TMI happened,'' said  
Eugene Stilp, a veteran anti-nuclear activist with No Nukes 
Pennsylvania. ``We're turning this over to a new generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speakers described the frustration of unsuccessfully fighting  
the 1985 restart of the Unit 1 reactor and their mistrust of 
industry assurances that the nation's aging nuclear plants will 
remain safe. Women who were pregnant at the time spoke of the fear 
they went through 20 years ago when news of the accident reached 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The vigil culminated with the five activists crossing onto plant  
property in front of a phalanx of state troopers, other police and 
Three Mile Island security officers as the crowd chanted 
antinuclear slogans on public property a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	The five were charged with defiant criminal trespass, a  
misdemeanor. All five were released by late morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lived within five miles of the plant for two years,'' said  
28-year-old Marci Culley, one of those arrested. ``I felt obligated 
to come back.''

<HEADLINE> Reds' Neagle Struggles in Outing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) -- Denny Neagle didn't consider it a setback.  
The results indicated it wasn't much of a step forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle pitched four innings against Cincinnati Reds minor  
leaguers on Sunday and struggled with just about everything. He 
gave up four homers, his fastball topped out at 84 mph and he once 
again had trouble with his control. 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle is on the 15-day disabled list and is hoping to return in  
mid-April. With every errant pitch Sunday, it became obvious he's 
not even close to form. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a major step back,'' pitching coach Don Gullett  
said. ``Overall, his command and his velocity weren't as good as 
last time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a rough spring for Neagle, who came to the Reds from  
Atlanta in the trade involving Bret Boone last November. He pulled 
thigh muscles during the first full-squad workout and has had to go 
slow because of weakness in the back of his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	His first big test came last Tuesday, when he threw 58 pitches  
and allowed only three hits in a ``B'' game against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	His fastball was a few miles per hour slower Sunday and two of  
the first three minor league batters homered off of him. The 
left-hander threw 72 pitches, gave up the four homers and allowed 
eight hits and one walk. His fastball was generally between 80-82 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Velocity is not something I worry about,'' Neagle said. ``When  
I feel like my arm is getting all the way back to where I want it 
to be where I can start cutting loose a little more, I'll do it at 
that point. Now it's a matter of getting the pitches in, getting 
the arm strength up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neagle was encouraged by how well his breaking pitches moved. He  
was mainly disappointed with his lack of control, which was a 
problem in his last appearance as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I tried to put a little extra on it, I got out of  
whack,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds enter the final week of spring training with concerns  
about their top two starters. Pete Harnisch hasn't pitched in a 
week because of back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch, who is scheduled to start on opening day, threw for 12  
minutes in the bullpen on Saturday without problem. His back 
stiffened up later in the day, so he dropped his plans to throw 
again when he got to the training complex on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just felt tight, but there was no pain. That's what we were  
looking out for, so it's better than expected,'' Harnisch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch will throw off the mound again on Monday and if there's  
no pain, he'll start a game on Wednesday. That would leave him on 
track to start the season opener Monday against San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Report: IFC To Set Up Asian Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- International Finance Corp., an affiliate of the  
World Bank, will set up an investment fund to help cash-strapped 
Asian companies, the Japanese economic journal Nihon Keizai Shimbun 
reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nihon Keizai said the fund, to be established in April, is  
expected to have a pool of $750 million-$1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Private financial institutions will also participate, including  
New York-based Chase Manhattan Bank, which will chip in $250 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund will lend to 10-15 companies in South Korea, Thailand,  
Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia whose financial health 
would have been sound but for the regional economic crisis, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nihon Keizai said the IFC will invest in the firms, either by  
buying stock or injecting capital, in exchange for pledges to 
implement drastic restructuring measures, including eliminating 
unprofitable operations and getting rid of bad assets.

<HEADLINE> Magic vs. Bird Marks Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Magic vs. The Birdman.  
</P>
<P>
	This was the showdown everyone in America wanted, and when  
Indiana State defeated DePaul and Michigan State beat Penn in the 
NCAA semifinals 20 years ago, it arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, the two most compelling players in  
the country, would at last go at one another with the national 
title at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	All but ignored was DePaul coach Ray Meyer's first trip to the  
Final Four since 1943 and the unlikely journey to the semifinals by 
Ivy League representative Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	They were nothing more than minor obstacles in the way of the  
Magic-Bird show. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been other fascinating Final Fours -- the UCLA dynasty  
with 10 championships in 12 years, Indiana's undefeated 1976 
champions, Texas Western's all-black team beating Kentucky's 
all-white team in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	But rarely had there been a superstar standoff like this one.  
</P>
<P>
	This was not just the Sycamores vs. the Spartans. This was Bird,  
a 6-foot-9 shaggy-haired forward with a shot scouts dream about, 
vs. Johnson, a 6-foot-8 point guard, whose ball-handling and 
shooting skills seemed nothing less than mystical. 
</P>
<P>
	One was laconic, the other effusive. Bird was all business,  
loathe to talk about himself. Johnson was all smiles, enthusiastic 
all the time. Maybe it was that contrast in personalities that made 
this matchup so intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has said it was like two guys wanting to be the best, a  
couple of gunslingers facing each other down, knowing only one 
could survive. To this day, he loves to talk about the game but 
Bird is tightlipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``Magic has been promoting that because he won the game,'' Bird  
said. ``If I won the game, you would have never heard of it. So I'm 
sick of it. I'm ready to move on with my life. It's been 20 years 
ago. I can't even remember that far back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, they would move together to the NBA and transform  
the league, Bird with the Boston Celtics, Johnson with the Los 
Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	But on March 26, 1979, in the Special Events Center at the  
University of Utah, they had one last college game, the first duel 
in what would become a long-standing rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was such an aura there that the two of them brought to  
the game,'' said Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, who was coaching Army 
then. ``They showcased it in the same way they went on to showcase 
the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana State arrived undefeated, perfect through 33 games -- the  
streak matching both players' uniform number. Bird would keep that 
number in the pros but Johnson had to accept 32 with the Lakers 
because 33 was already assigned to another pretty good player, 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird and Magic had cruised through the season in separate  
spheres, their paths never crossing. And that just increased the 
national hunger for them to meet in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans were curious about Bird, who averaged 28.6 points  
per game and hit 53 percent of his shots. After Johnson and his 
buddies drubbed Penn 101-67 in their semifinal, they hung around to 
watch Bird work on DePaul. Playing with a broken thumb, he merely 
scored 35 points, missing just three of 19 shots, grabbed 16 
rebounds and had nine assists in a 76-74 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sycamores were coached by Bill Hodges, an assistant who  
stepped in at the start of the season after head coach Bob King had 
a heart attack. When Bird, a small-town guy, was overwhelmed by the 
size of Indiana University and left after just two weeks, it was 
Hodges who coaxed him to more intimate Indiana State. The payback 
was 1979 when he carried the Sycamores through their dream season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jud Heathcote was in just his third season of what would become  
a 19-year coaching career with Michigan State and after watching 
Bird take DePaul apart, he devised a matchup zone that would 
collapse on Bird every time he got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	The day before the game, Heathcote prepared the Spartans in  
practice, assigning Johnson to the scout team to play the role of 
Bird. ``You couldn't have a reserve do that,'' the coach explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Magic never missed a shot in the workout and it scared the  
Spartans because if the real Bird performed that way, they figured 
the Sycamores would win. 
</P>
<P>
	The game did not start well for Johnson. On Michigan State's  
first possession, he slipped and was called for traveling. But it 
was only a momentary misstep for the Spartans. After leading early, 
Indiana State fell behind, trailing by 16 points as Michigan State 
kept up the defensive pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sycamores cut the lead to six points at 52-46 with 10  
minutes to play, but Johnson spearheaded another Michigan State 
spurt that opened it to 11 and Indiana State never challenged 
again, losing 75-64. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach gave us a job to do on Larry Bird and we got it done,''  
said Johnson, who made eight of 15 shots and scored 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird was stalked by the zone all night and limited to just  
7-for-21 shooting from the field and 19 points. Indiana State was 
27-for-64 from the field and missed 12 of 22 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end, Bird sat on the bench, his head wrapped in a towel,  
while Johnson and the Spartans cut down the nets. Twenty years 
later, Bird is in the Hall of Fame, Magic is on his way there and 
the game remains etched in their memories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play well,'' Bird said. ``For us to win, I had to  
have an extremely great game and I didn't do that. So that's why we 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just say, `Let's forget it and move on.' We have other  
things to do now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magic has watched tapes of the game frequently and knows it  
almost play by play. Bird says he has never watched a replay 
because he has no interest in it. He still has the memories, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember quite a bit about it,'' he said. ``But I don't sit  
around every day and just because the NCAA is on TV start thinking 
back to when I was in college. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been 20 years and a lot of things have happened.''  
</P>
<P>
	Though it was not a classic game, the showdown did thrust the  
NCAA tournament into a permanent national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly was a special moment. It changed the perception  
of what the tournament meant,'' said Connecticut's Jim Calhoun, who 
was coaching at Northeastern then. ``The game of college basketball 
now has a three-week window to tell all of its great stories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magic and Bird translated into record television ratings of 24.1  
and a 38 share for NBC, which estimated that the game was watched 
by 40 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	As America suspected, it was the beginning of a basketball  
rivalry that energized the NBA for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird's Celtics and Johnson's Lakers won eight NBA championships  
between them. Three times they faced off in the finals, two going 
to the Lakers, one to the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
	They won gold medals on the first Olympic Dream Team in 1992 and  
developed a warm friendship built on respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the first time they clashed, 20 years ago this month,  
remains a defining moment in NCAA tournament history.

<HEADLINE> Disappointment in Kevorkian's Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Youk family disappointed in Kevorkian trial's focus    	
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The wife and brother of the man Dr. Jack  
Kevorkian was convicted of killing say they are disappointed the 
trial focused on definitions of murder rather than on how Kevorkian 
helped end Thomas Youk's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't able to give the jurors any kind of picture of who  
Tom was and what he was going through,'' Youk's brother, Terry, 
told Time magazine in the issue that hits newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was convicted Friday of second-degree murder and  
delivery of a controlled substance in Youk's death. He is scheduled 
to be sentenced April 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian had argued during his trial that Youk's widow, Melody,  
and Youk's brother should be allowed to testify that they wanted 
Kevorkian to end Youk's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Jessica Cooper told Kevorkian, who was acting as his  
own lawyer, that he couldn't use the testimony because Michigan law 
doesn't recognize the consent of the victim as a defense to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Youk told Time that his brother suffered from ``the kind  
of pain that medicine couldn't help.'' He said Thomas Youk, 52, 
told him that he didn't want to die, ``but I don't want to live 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melody Youk said: ``He didn't want to become a prisoner in his  
own body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Youks say they continue to support Kevorkian.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to put yourself in harm's way when you feel there's  
an unjust law,'' Terry Youk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, prison officials say if Kevorkian goes on a hunger  
strike in prison, as he has threatened, they would use intravenous 
tubes to force feed him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There haven't been any (deaths) cases I can recall, and we  
have a very effective policy in place which would stop a prisoner 
from starving himself,'' Matt Davis, a spokesman for the Michigan 
Department of Corrections, told The Detroit News in a story Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian staged a three-day hunger strike when jailed in  
November 1993 for refusing to pay bond. He refused all food and 
accepted only juice and water 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Kevorkian and an associate said they would  
starve themselves to death in prison if ever convicted of assisting 
a suicide.

<HEADLINE> NYC Police Rocked by Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At police headquarters in lower Manhattan, the  
protesters show up each day. In the courts, the biggest criminal 
cases are against cops. And at city hall, the law-and-order record 
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani appears tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
	A dizzying confluence of brutality charges, federal  
investigations and public relations gaffes has thrown the nation's 
largest police department into its worst crisis in years. Police 
and the city's minorities seem increasingly at odds, and morale in 
the department is dropping. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's troubles come just two years after it was  
riding high on news that the city's crime rate was dropping, with 
murders under 1,000 annually for the first time in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
	What's created the most anger is the case of Amadou Diallo, an  
unarmed West African immigrant shot to death by police in a Bronx 
apartment lobby. The police, apparently believing Diallo was 
reaching for a gun, fired 41 bullets at him. He was hit by 19 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
	In daily protests, charges have been hurled against police of  
prejudice against the black men and demanded the four policemen be 
jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a source close to the case, a Bronx grand jury  
indicted the four officers Friday on second-degree murder charges 
in the Diallo case. But the protest leaders say they will keep up 
their daily demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	And the protesters have other cases to site in their charge of  
police misconduct: 
</P>
<P>
	-- In Brooklyn, jury selection was to begin Monday for the trial  
of four other officers accused of brutalizing a Haitian immigrant, 
Abner Louima, in 1997. The trial -- centering on allegations 
officers sodomized the victim with a stick in a precinct 
stationhouse -- could stretch into summer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Despite the Diallo controversy, Police Commissioner Howard  
Safir jetted off on an Academy Awards junket. He returned last week 
to find himself under fire for being insensitive to the anger in 
the Daillo case and possibly violating city conflict-of-interest 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	-- As many as 20 Manhattan cops may soon be indicted in what the  
tabloids have dubbed the ``sex-for-protection scandal.'' The 
officers have already been stripped of the their guns and badges 
based on allegations they were getting free sex in a brothel in 
exchange for shielding it from raids. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The federal Civil Rights Commission, U.S. attorney's offices  
for two districts of New York and state Attorney General Eliot 
Spitzer all have launched investigations of the NYPD and how it 
disciplines its own. The commission will hold hearings in May on 
whether its ``stop-and-frisk'' tactics violate the public's rights, 
especially in minority neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 800 people have been arrested in the daily protests --  
including prominent whites as well as blacks -- and high-ranking 
politicians have criticized the city leaders for not paying more 
attention to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Minorities are humiliated and angered by the indignity of  
being treated all too often as presumptive criminals,'' said Sen. 
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., in a speech calling on the department to 
take steps to close the racial rift. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir, Giuliani and the powerful Patrolmen's Benevolent  
Association have defended the 40,000-officer force, reminding New 
Yorkers that crime rates are at their lowest level in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, off-duty members of the PBA staged a  
counterprotest supporting the officers in the Diallo case. And 
Giuliani scoffed at reports that U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter may 
be preparing to order federal monitoring the department. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would not get my consent to that,'' the mayor said.  
``Before you can start talking about federal micro-managing of this 
police department, there are about 200 police departments you have 
to put ahead of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Daily News poll published Sunday found the mayor's popularity  
at an all-time low, with a 40 percent approval rating, down from 60 
percent in November and 65 percent a year earlier. The margin of 
error in the poll of 807 New Yorkers was plus or minus four 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Teams Help Downed Pilots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When NATO and U.S. military search and rescue  
teams go into combat, often under cover of dark when a warplane 
goes down, they have two main missions in mind: find the pilot and 
don't get caught. It's a race against the clock and the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never really know where the pilot's going to land, so we  
have to be prepared for anything,'' said Master Sgt. Brian 
Stephens, director of training for ``pararescuers'' at Kirtland Air 
Force Base in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	That means a rough environment -- ocean, mountain, desert or  
jungle -- and possibly a warfighting hailstorm of missiles, bombs 
and gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets a little tricky when you're in a combat situation,''  
said Joan Prichard, a spokeswoman at Hurlburt Field, Fla., 
headquarters of the Air Force Special Operations Command, which 
last week sent additional search and rescue helicopter teams to 
Europe in support of NATO operations in Yugoslavia. ``You're 
inserting people into hostile territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon and NATO have released no details about the  
dramatic six-hour rescue of an Air Force F-117A stealth fighter 
pilot near the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade early Sunday. The name 
of the American pilot wasn't released. He was reported in good 
condition at an Air Force base in Aviano, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot search and rescue missions often involve several branches  
of the military -- sometimes from different countries -- working in 
concert. The teams often use high-tech electronic surveillance to 
pick up radio signals from a downed airman before swooping in. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force or Marine helicopters could then rescue the pilot  
while Air Force or Navy fighter jets and radar-jamming planes 
ensure the skies are safe from enemy aircraft and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is to get in and get out without ever seeing the  
enemy,'' Stephens said. ``We've got pistols and rifles, but 
hopefully we never have to use them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A typical rescue by crews from Hurlburt could involve MH-53J  
Pave Low helicopters, which in September 1995 flew into Serb-held 
Bosnia to rescue a pair of French pilots. They came under heavy 
fire, and two Pave Low gunners were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force's Pave Lows and smaller MH-60G Pave Hawk  
helicopters are equipped with special navigation gear, radar and 
other electronics to help them slip behind enemy lines without 
detection. They often fly at treetop level under cover of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force has both types of helicopters at Brindisi, Italy,  
the main staging point for search and rescue missions over 
Yugoslavia. The choppers are flown by crews from bases in Britain 
and Japan in addition to Hurlburt's 16th Special Operations Wing. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the most dramatic U.S. military rescues in the region,  
Marine Corps helicopters picked up Air Force pilot Scott O'Grady 
after his F-16 Fighting Falcon was shot down in 1995 by a Serb 
anti-aircraft missile during the Bosnian War. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Grady hid in a pine forest for six days, hoarding precious  
radio batteries so he could emit a weak ``Brasher 52'' call sign to 
his rescuers. He drank rain water and resorted to eating ants and 
grass, lessons learned during survival training that all pilots 
must go through. 
</P>
<P>
	In O'Grady's case, his radio signal was picked up just after 2  
a.m. by a pilot from his own squadron who, like him, had been 
flying a U.N. monitoring mission. He was picked up about four hours 
later after an AWACS surveillance plane pinpointed his location. 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of Marine Corps CH-53 ``Sea Stallion'' assault  
helicopters swooped in for the rescue with some 40 aircraft in 
support. One helicopter landed and 20 Marines jumped out to secure 
the area. O'Grady came running out of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm OK. Get me out of here,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After only two minutes on the ground, the helicopter took off  
with its precious cargo.

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. Fans Riot After Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- A riotous crowd of about 5,000 people  
threw bottles and started fires around an apartment complex close 
to the Michigan State campus shortly after the Spartans lost to 
Duke Saturday in basketball's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 fires were reported since the end of the game, East  
Lansing deputy fire chief Pete Zamora said shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're starting fires wherever there is anything they can  
burn,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said there were reports of trash bins, sofas and a car being  
set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Zamora said there were numerous injuries, mostly people being  
cut from bottles being thrown. One person was climbing up a traffic 
light pole and fell. WXYZ-TV reported that a student was burned 
while jumping over a burning sofa. 
</P>
<P>
	Campus police Capt. Tony Kliebecker said the department sent its  
riot unit in to quell the crowd that had gathered around an 
apartment complex. He said police sprayed tear gas to try to 
disperse the crowd so firefighters could get to a car that had been 
overturned and set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	A Lansing police car was also set on fire.  
</P>
<P>
	East Lansing Fire Marshal Bob Pratt said firefighters were  
pulling back at Cedar Village because they were being pelted with 
debris. Zamora said one fire truck windshield was broken by thrown 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
	He also reported people having trouble breathing because of the  
tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kliebecker said he's heard of at least four arrests made by  
campus police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, we're just trying to move crowds. We can't keep up  
with it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there were any problems, an East Lansing police  
dispatcher said: ``Major problems. We're under a state of emergency 
right now. That's all we know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelli Benson, 20, sophomore, said police were making the  
situation worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would eventually calm down if they didn't provoke us.  
Before we even did anything, there were cop cars everywhere,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just south of Cedar Village a crowd had started a fire and was  
ripping branches off trees and throwing them on the fire. A door at 
the College of Business had been smashed in, but a second door 
remained intact and it did not appear anyone had tried to go 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 Ingham County sheriff deputies on horseback were on the  
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Police closed Grand River Avenue, the main street in East  
Lansing. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State students have clashed with police before.  
</P>
<P>
	A student protest in May over an alcohol ban at a popular  
tailgating spot on campus turned into a melee. Up to 3,000 people 
were involved and more than 20 were arrested. Students tore through 
downtown East Lansing, setting bonfires and clashing with police 
who used tear gas to break up the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend, two students were arrested for disorderly conduct  
at an off-campus apartment complex after Sunday's Michigan State 
victory over Kentucky. Revelers also set a small bonfire at the 
complex with pizza boxes and furniture.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. said in its annual report  
that it plans to eliminate about 4,600 jobs as part of its merger 
with the former Norwest Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts will come over this year and next as the bank gets  
rid of overlapping operations with Norwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the deal with the Minnesota bank was finalized in  
November, Wells has been reluctant to disclose how its plans to 
slash $650 million in annual expenses will translate into lost 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note in the recently mailed 1998 annual report, Wells says,  
``Accrued severance-related costs relate to the elimination into 
2000 of about 5 percent of the company's positions. The majority of 
these reductions are the result of eliminating redundant 
headquarters, back office and other positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The combined bank had 92,000 full-time jobs at the end of last  
year, suggesting that 4,600 jobs will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank spokesman Larry Haeg said that is only a rough estimate and  
believes the actual number could be much lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeg indicated that natural attrition could take care of most of  
the job cuts, with about 15 percent of employees already leaving on 
their own this year. A hiring freeze imposed since last summer and 
a ``retention initiative'' designed to retrain employees for 
different jobs also should help reduce the need to lay off 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeg said that 700 employees, including executives, have lost  
their jobs since last June. More than 10 percent have been placed 
in other positions. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, most of the cuts have been in Texas and New Mexico,  
where both Norwest and Wells Fargo had branches.

<HEADLINE> Many Cuban Exiles Watch Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Alberto Esquivel may have chosen to leave Cuba to  
live in the United States, but his allegiance to the country's 
national baseball team remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my team,'' said Esquivel, who moved to Miami five  
months ago on a visa and a hope for a better quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Esquivel, 18, could only sneak a peak of his home team playing  
the Baltimore Orioles Sunday in Havana. He waited tables at Latin 
American Restaurant, a Cuban eatery where customers demanded to see 
the game, which the Orioles won 3-2, on every television in the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	For most exiles, the sight of Americans and Cubans taking the  
field together on the communist island was a sign of disrespect for 
those who have fought for democracy on the island -- a fight, they 
say, many continue to pay with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this stinks,'' said Berta Ruiz, lunching on a plate of  
beef and black beans and rice as she watched the game at the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles trip to Cuba is the first in 40 years for a  
professional American team. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Cuban exiles in south Florida objected to the game. Weeks  
before the game, hundreds protested outside the Orioles spring 
training facility in nearby Fort Lauderdale, hoping to convince the 
team to cancel its plans. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike Ruiz and many exiles in Miami, some Cubans supported  
the trip. They said seeing the two teams on the field, each waving 
their own flag and singing their own anthem, was an emotional 
triumph for exiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a great sign. I believe in an exchange between  
the two countries,'' said Bernardo Benes, who worked as an attorney 
for the Cuban Sugar Kings, a pro baseball team in Havana in the 
mid-1950's. ``The more communication we have with people on the 
island the more chances we have that it opens up (to democracy).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benes, 64, was hired in 1954 to work for the Sugar Kings. At the  
time dozens of professional teams played on the same field where 
the Cuban national team faced the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	At Maximo Gomez Park on Eighth Street in the heart of Miami's  
Little Havana neighborhood, the game of dominoes dominated table 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a moment, the players -- mostly Cuban -- offered their  
take on the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a farce,'' said Antonio Llopiz. ``Castro wants to change  
the world. He won't let the world change Cuba.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Women Feted in Morocco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE DUNES OF MERZOUGA, Morocco (AP) -- In the dark chill, Hillary  
and Chelsea Clinton mounted camels and plodded a snaking trail 
toward the Saharan sunrise -- a hushed finale to a clanging Berber 
jamboree of song, dance, fire and beasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady and her daughter retreated to the desert Saturday  
and Sunday as the Muslim hosts of this week's Moroccan leg of a 
North African odyssey slaughtered lambs for one of the religion's 
most holy events, Eid el-Adha, ``Feast of the Sacrifice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King Hassan lavished extravagances on the Clinton women and  
their entourage of 50, erecting specially for them a modern 
``Arabian Nights'' set in the crook of the shifting red dunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Claps, chants and drumbeats of Berber tribal troupes from the  
Middle Atlas Mountains and Ouarzazate province in the south greeted 
the party and kept up a clamor for more than four hours, from 
sunset to bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
	In a giddy, predinner rite reminiscent of a gaggle of  
bridesmaids before the wedding, tribal women wrapped the Americans 
in traditional Berber costume. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton wore that of an honored lady: the ``ahrouy,'' a  
silvered white, elaborately wrapped robe, and ``tahrouyt,'' a black 
silk headscarf and shawl decorated with bangles. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelsea, 19, opted for a shepherd's azure robe and head wrap.  
</P>
<P>
	In green-and-white striped tents, staffed by white-robed  
servants wearing the traditional maroon fez, course after course 
came on gold-edged Bavarian dinner china and French silver. 
</P>
<P>
	Whole quartered lambs, curried chickens, prune-stewed beef,  
rice, fresh fruit, hot green tea, sweet wine and, finally, 
champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout Saturday night's dinner, Mrs. Clinton held court at a  
center table. Under her laughing watch, almost everyone in the 
party took a turn on the sand with the Ahidous and Ahouach troupes, 
whose flailing arms and hopping feet followed neither rules nor 
rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
	Women sat cross-legged on the red Berber carpets to have their  
palms, wrists and ankles elaborately dyed with henna. By midnight, 
the fortunetellers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight White House reporters covering the first lady's 12-day  
tour of North Africa were among the party, on condition that the 
details of Mrs. Clinton's and Chelsea's recreation be kept ``off 
the record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Marsha Berry said they just wanted to relax and  
enjoy the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides who worked with the Moroccan government to plan the  
extravaganza said they had to restrain the king's largesse or else 
ruin the rustic ``camp-out'' feel that Mrs. Clinton wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	They failed.  
</P>
<P>
	Hassan, who remained at his palace 260 miles away to observe  
Eid, ordered electricity and cell phone service installed for the 
encampment. 
</P>
<P>
	Refrigerated Coke machines supplied the sleeping tents and a  
half-dozen heated RV's -- each with a television broadcasting CNN -- 
offered toilets and showers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hassan even bulldozed something of a dirt road to ease the  
Clintons' caravan of more than 40 Land Rovers across 15 miles of 
rutted sand, rocks and dirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Newly painted and planted pistachio-green posts marked the way.  
</P>
<P>
	An American diplomat estimated the spread's cost in the ``upper  
six figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just a handful of miles from the open Algerian border, the  
encampment was widely circled by uniformed sentries from the 
Moroccan military. A lone man stood here and there, ramrod straight 
in the sun, watching an empty horizon that stretched for miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Past midnight, quiet fell too on the camp, as the party awaited  
a 5 a.m. wake-up shout for Sunday's sunrise camel rides. 
</P>
<P>
	Read a memo to the first lady's staff:  
</P>
<P>
	``Try to keep the noise down to a minimum so that people and  
camels can get their rest. Camels are known to be ornery, and we 
would like them to get all the rest they need.''

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm Falters in Dubai Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- With his trainer an ocean  
away, a weakened and bleeding Silver Charm went nowhere Sunday on 
the sandy track at the Dubai World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 Kentucky Derby winner finished sixth in an eight-horse  
field at the $5 million race won by Almutawakel -- a 44-1 shot owned 
by Dubai's ruling family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silver Charm has had a history of bleeding, and without  
medication it just got bad and he got scared,'' said trainer Bob 
Baffert, who was at Turfway Park on Saturday to watch Kentucky 
Derby hopeful Straight Man finish fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs used to control bleeding at many U.S. tracks are not  
allowed in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in mourning because of Silver Charm and Straight Man,'' he  
said by telephone. ``When horses bleed, it just scares them and 
they don't run. That's what happened to Silver Charm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two other U.S. horses in the 1 1-4 mile race fared far  
better. Malek finished second, a half-length short, and Victory 
Gallop was third, 1 1-2 lengths behind the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2-1 favorite Silver Charm hardly resembled the horse that  
won this showcase race last year, finishing 4 1-4 lengths back. 
This loss marked the third time in four races that he has failed to 
win this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some reason today, he just felt flat,'' said jockey Gary  
Stevens, who rode Silver Charm to victory in Dubai a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Silver Charm captured the winner's purse of $3 million, he  
would have moved past Skip Away and into the No. 2 spot in career 
earnings with $9.8 million. The great Cigar, now retired, is No. 1 
at just under $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Almutawakel, timed in 2:00.65, is owned by the famed Godolphin  
stables that belong to the Al Maktoum family. The bay colt came 
into prominence when he won the Prix Jean Prat. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek, who finished fourth in Dubai last year, was ridden by  
Alex Solis and earned $1 million. Victory Gallop, the 1998 Belmont 
Stakes winner ridden by Jerry Bailey, won $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Park was fourth, followed by Daylami, Silver Charm,  
Running Stag and English Derby-winner High Rise. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 5,000 at the Nad Al Sheba course watched the  
horses break evenly at the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm quickly fell behind, trailing Central Park and  
Malek, and then dropped back even further and never threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew after two furlongs that it wasn't going to be his  
day,'' Stevens said. ``He was down on the rail, which was OK, but 
when I started to maneuver him out I did not have any horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With three furlongs to go, jockey Richard Hills sent Almutawakel  
into the lead where he held off Malek's challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was good for me,'' Hill said. ``The pace was not as  
strong as I thought, and I did everything I wanted out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no wagering at the course because betting is not  
allowed in Dubai, in accordance with Islamic teachings. In North 
American simulcast wagering, the winner returned $91.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Almutawakel had lifetime earnings of just $169,721 before  
Sunday. Silver Charm's earnings of more then $6.5 million matched 
the combined winnings of the seven other horses in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm was second in the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 7  
at Churchill Downs and opened 1999 by taking the San Pasqual 
Handicap at Santa Anita. But he was third in the Donn Handicap at 
Gulfstream Park and the Santa Anita Handicap on March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek had raced sparingly since his fourth place in Dubai last  
year. The 6-year-old Chilean-bred is trained by Dick Mandella, who 
has had a horse in all four Dubai World Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll get it right someday,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, a 4-year-old colt, is trained by Elliott Walden  
and owned by brothers Art, Jack and J.R. Preston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory Gallop ran well,'' Walden said. ``I thought in the  
straight that he could win but the others were too strong for 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four Maktoum horses -- High Rise, Daylami, Central Park and  
Almutawakel -- were making their dirt-racing and 1999 debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maktoums, who have won some of the biggest races in Europe,  
had half the horses in the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every race has its own pleasure, but to win in Dubai is  
something special,'' said Sheik Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, 
deputy ruler of Dubai.

<HEADLINE> Philly Exchange May Test Traders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The chairman of the Philadelphia Stock  
Exchange predicts that regulators concerned about the dangers of 
day trading will quickly approve proposed testing to make sure 
investors chasing get-rich-quick dreams know the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange is seeking federal approval to require off-floor  
traders to pass the same comprehensive National Association of 
Securities Dealers exam as professional securities dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman Meyer ``Sandy'' Frucher said he expects approval from  
the Securities and Exchange Commission within 30 days. The exchange 
filed the proposed rule change March 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are concerned that people do not have adequate training,''  
Frucher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Electronic day-trading firms sell training courses and special  
software programs to ordinary investors who want to try the 
lightning-speed practice of day trading, exploiting small price 
movements in stocks to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The dangers of day trading have regulators worried. A February  
survey showed more than 2,300 people are day trading at firms 
registered as Philadelphia exchange members, more than double the 
number six months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASD board of governors voted last week to consider a  
proposal to require day-trading firms to screen investors and warn 
them of the risks in writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Frucher said a lot of firms have been soliciting day traders, in  
part because regional exchanges such as the Philadelphia and 
Pacific stock exchanges and the Chicago Board Options Exchange do 
not required off-floor traders to pass the NASD securities exam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Currently we don't have any test requirements,'' Frucher said.  
``The presumption if you are a trader through a member firm is that 
you are an investment professional, and that has not always been 
the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the exchange's proposed rule change, most of those  
affected are members of ``limited liability companies'' that 
consider them to be professionals, ``not customers protected by the 
usual customer protection rules'' that require making sure a trade 
is not too risky for an investor's financial means. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rule, the proposal said, would ``protect investors and  
the public interest by requiring registered off-floor traders to 
demonstrate their qualifications to trade.''
