<HEADLINE> Iran Releases 275 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Thursday released 275
Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) and they arrived at the
al-Muntheriya border checking point in the evening, the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Fahmi Al-Qaisi, an Iraqi official in charge of the POWs issue,
said in a statement that the Iranian side has informed Iraq of
their readiness to release a new batch of Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Iran will release the remaining 11,000
Iraqi POWs registered in the International Red Crescent and
provide information about 4,000 Iraqis missing in actions (MIAs).
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi side has received an invitation to visit Tehran in
November to continue negotiations on the issue of POWs and MIAs,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced earlier this week that Iran has freed 55,438
Iraqi POWs so far, while Iraq has freed 39,417 Iranian POWs. Iran
said there are still 2,806 Iranian POWs being kept in Iraqi
prisons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran fought an eight-year bloody war from 1980-88, in
which some one million people from both sides were killed or
injured.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has become one of the major obstacles that
impedes improvement of relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Nyerere Starts to Gain Strength Under Medical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The founding father of
Tanzania Julius Nyerere who is seriously ill and admitted at St.
Thomas Hospital in London, has gained more strength following
medication administered to him through nasal gastric tube.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the President's Press Secretary Geoffrey
Nkurlu in Dar es Salaam Thursday said that Nyerere has been able
to open his eyes now and then able to turn sides without
assistance.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, doctors attending the 77-year-old
Nyerere, who is suffering chronic lymphocytic leukemia, have
managed to contain minor breathing problems.
</P>
<P>
It further said that the doctors on Thursday took more blood
tests in order to make further investigations of jaundice that has
developed since Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanzanian High Commissioner to Britain Sharrif
Abdul Kadri, Nyerere's condition is improving steadily.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who was admitted to the hospital last Friday, is under
round- the-clock medical care, while his wife Maria Nyerere and
his two daughters Anna Nyerere and Rose Nyerere are taking turns
in assisting him.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government is trying to get the best treatment
available in Britain for Nyerere and President Benjamin Mkapa is
closely monitoring the elder African statesman's condition.
</P>
<P>
Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru, minister of Administration and Local
Government, left Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam for London
Tuesday to administer issues concerning Nyerere in collaboration
with Tanzanian High Commission in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa has asked the nation to pray for Nyerere, who is highly
respected as Mwalimu or teacher in Kiswahili language.

WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William
Cohen on Thursday ordered the Army to investigate reports about
U.S. soldiers gunning down civilians in the Korean War in 1950.
</P>
<P>
Cohen wrote a letter to Army Secretary Louis Caldera, asking
him to "determine the full scope of the facts surrounding press
reports of civilian deaths" in No Gun Ri village south of Seoul in
the early days of the Korean War.

"These reports are of course very disturbing,"Caldera told a
Pentagon news briefing. He said a new review would be conducted,
which would go beyond looking at historical records and include
interviewing soldiers from the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
The new review was ordered after an Associated Press report

<HEADLINE> 3 Rwandan Cabinet Ministers Involved in Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A parliamentary commission of
Rwanda presented a report Wednesday to investigate a corruption
case in which the government lost one million U.S. dollars,
Rwandan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The three high officials concerned are Minister of Social
Affairs Charles Ntakirutinka, Minister of Commerce Mark Rugenera
and Minister in President's Office in charge of Institutional
Relations Anastase Gasana.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the investigation of the commission are
conclusive," Joseph Sebarenzi, speaker of the National Assembly,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the next move is to summon these ministers to
parliament to explain themselves about their involvement.
</P>
<P>
"If their arguments are not sufficient, a vote of
non-confidence will be made, and the three ministers will be asked
to resign from their posts," one lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
The affair in which the three ministers are involved relates to
the purchase of government vehicles in 1996 by the then Minister
of Public Works Ntakirutinka.
</P>
<P>
The deal was first signed with a local procurement company
before Ntakirutinka illegally passed the deal to another
businessman for a heavy craft with the connivance of the then
Minister of Finance Rugenera.
</P>
<P>
The probe of the three ministers followed that of Emmanuel
Mudidi, minister of Education, into another affair of embezzling
26 million U.S. dollars from a project financed by the World Bank
for the rehabilitation of schools after the genocide.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Mazimhaka, minister in President's Office, will also be
summoned in the near future to explain the mismanagement that
rocked the Ministry of Rehabilitation he was heading.
</P>
<P>
"Our government has a good will to usher in good governance,"
Sebarenzi said, adding that their action will help stem the rising
corruption in government's institutions by inciting ministers to
be accountable in their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that ministers will be more careful when they note
that some of their colleagues are punished politically," Sebarenzi
concluded.

UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A jury in a Manhattan
Federal Court Tuesday found a former U.N. staff member guilty on
all five counts of wire fraud and conspiracy stemming from his
participation in schemes to defraud the United Nations, a U.N.
spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The individual, Charles Kim, submitted fraudulent and inflated
travel charges to the United Nations from 1996 until September
1998 resulting in a loss to the organization of some 800,000 U.S.
dollars," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard told a press conference here that Kim's felony
conviction was made possible following a complex and thorough
investigation by the Investigations Section of the Office of
Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).
</P>
<P>
Investigators from that section worked overtime to gather both
documentary and testimonial evidence against Kim which was then
referred to U.S. and Croatian authorities, he said.

Several U.N. staff members, including one staff of the Bosnian
Mission and one of the OIOS investigators, provided testimony
during Kim's trial, he said.

Kim is scheduled to be sentenced on December 8. He faces a
maximum penalty on each of the five counts of five years in
prison, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Condemns Fresh Turkish Incursion of Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Ministry on
Thursday condemned the fresh Turkish troops incursion of northern
Iraq, urging the Turkish government to withdraw its troops
immediately.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement that on
Tuesday, some 5,000 Turkish troops, supported by tanks, armored
vehicles, helicopters and warplanes, invaded the northern Iraqi
territories.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Iraq vehemently protests against and
condemns Turkey's new military invasion and violation of Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"This invasion is part of repeated series carried out by the
Turkish forces against Iraq since 1991 and is coincided with the
feverish military aggression acts being perpetrated by America
and Britain against Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the Turkish government to withdraw its troops
immediately and desist from repeating such aggressive acts which
are contrary to the United Nations Charter and principles of the
international law.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, the Iraqi government lost its control
of the northern Kurdish autonomous region, and Turkish government
troops often cross the border into northern Iraq to chase rebels
of the outlawed Turkish Kurdish Workers' Party.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman also warned against the Turkish assistance
it offers to the United States and British warplanes to carry out
raids on northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed two no-fly zones in Iraq
following the Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds
in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from possible attacks
by the Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman warned that "the Iraqi government retains
its full right to retaliate this aggressive act in proper time
and venue."

Two people were killed and 41 wounded in a terrorist attack in

"Albanian extremists challenge the international community and
grossly violate resolution No. 1244 of the U.N. Security Council,"

This attack "proves that although the disarmament of the Kosovo
Liberation Army ended on September 19, weapons were concealed,"
Rakhmanin said.

"The Bresje events must be investigated efficiently and
impartially and the culprits punished," the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Jacques Diouf,
director general of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),
Thursday called on developing countries to prepare strategies
against hunger.
</P>
<P>
Before ending his three-day visit to Tanzania, Diouf told a
meeting in the capital Dar es Salaam that developing countries
should build water- control facilities, especially small-scale
ones that can be constructed at affordable cost.
</P>
<P>
He said an irrigation scheme built with 10,000 U.S. dollars in
Mkindo village and a pedal pump in the Hembeti village in the
Morogoro Region in central Tanzania, where he visited Wednesday,
are very impressing.
</P>
<P>
Both of the projects are part of the Special Program for Food
Security (SPFS) launched by FAO in collaboration with relevant
countries and international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched in 1994 with 3.5 million U.S. dollars,
has currently covered 49 countries and gained much greater
strength. The goal of FAO is to make 122 developing countries
benefit from the program.
</P>
<P>
In Morogoro Region, the FAO director general also visited
several groups formed by villagers who have gained income through
raising chicken, goat and sheep or planting maize, pigeon beans
and rice. The groups have got technical or financial assistance
from SPFS.

WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
on Thursday that it was closely monitoring reports about a

"Obviously this is a very serious situation," said David

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Opposition Leader Returns to West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of a major PLO
faction returned to the West Bank town of Jericho Thursday through
the Makramah Checkpoint on the Jordan River from Amman.
</P>
<P>
Mustafa Zibri, Deputy Secretary General of the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) was greeted by Palestinian
Cabinet Secretary Tayeb Abdel Rahim and Minister of Civil Affair
Jamil Tarif as well as other PNA and PFLP supporters.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Rahim described Mustafa's return to the West Bank as a
symbol of unity of the Palestinian people in the final status
talks with Israel, the Voice of Palestine radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mustafa expressed pleasure about his homecoming and
said he is looking forward to the return of all the Palestinian
refugees to their homes.
</P>
<P>
"My return shows the desire of the PFLP to shoulder the
responsibility with the Palestinian people in peace making,"
Mustafa said.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, the PFLP held a second round of talks with the
Fatah Movement, the mainstay of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), in Amman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary General of the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) Nayef Hawatmeh told Israel Radio
that he has no knowledge of any application by the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) to Israel on his return to the self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
Real peace should be based on the U.N. Security Council
Resolution No.194 which provides for the right of the Palestinian
people to self-determination, Hawatmeh said.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of DFLP's involvement in the final status
talks, he said it depends on the results of the consultations by
the DFLP-Fatah joint committee that was formed in Cairo early
August.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was quoted by
Israel Radio as saying that his government is studying a PNA
proposal to allow Hawatmeh back to the West Bank with a view to
strengthening the pro-peace camp.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- A two-day seminar on
problem analysis and synthesis on conservation and sustainable use
of biodiversity in the Eastern Rift Valley lakes opened here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop, General Manager of Environmental
Protection Authority Tewolde G/Egziabher said that the
conservation of biodiversity in the rift valley lakes region
should be given due attention as the area is more vulnerable to
ecosystem degradation and genetic erosion today than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The lakes in the region had also manifested declining water
levels and depletion in biological resources as a result of
environmental degradation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is expected to map out strategies and action plans
for conservation and sustainable utilization of resources in the
rift valley lakes, according to organizers of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian environmental experts recently urged the
government departments concerned to beef up efforts to protect
worsening environment.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that some parts of Ethiopia is being
endangered of desertification which in turn will aggravate soil
erosion and bring about degradation upon the productive lands.

<HEADLINE> Syria Urges True Respect for U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The best framework to
face and address seriously and effectively the challenges and
phenomena facing the international community is a United Nations
truly respected by all its members, Syria said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 54th session of the United Nations General
Assembly, Syria's Minister of Foreign Affairs Farouk Al-Ahara said
the marginalization of the role of the United Nations, or using it
only on occasions, or as a cover for resolutions and initiatives
taken outside the Security Council, will not be in the interest of
anyone.
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the United Nations Security Council, the
Minister said there has been nothing achieved except the
marginalization for the status of the Security Council and
bypassing its central role in keeping international peace and
security whenever the need arises, and sometimes without any need
arising.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the deliberate marginalization of the role of
the Security Council and achieving no progress whatsoever in
restructuring it has provided the pretext awaited by some to
ignore the United Nations Charter and violate the sovereignty of
countries through the use of regional military organizations as
a substitute for the Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should be respected truly, based on joint
work in which countries of the South and North participate, each
according to their abilities and capacities, the Minister
added.

Development."
</P>

But the document "puts the EU on a collision course with the

While the EU talks of a "single undertaking" to ensure the
priorities of WTO members are given equal treatment over the
planned three years of negotiations, Washington is pushing for an
"early harvest" approach whereby issues which can be resolved
swiftly will not be held up by other more complex talks, the
report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the EU-U.S. dispute goes to the heart of the trade
negotiation process, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Massacre of Civilians in Korean War Described </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. soldiers
machine-gunned hundreds of helpless civilians under a railroad
bridge in South Korea early in the Korean War, the Associated
Press said.
</P>
<P>
The terrible episode was reported by the AP Wednesday and
carried by main American newspapers including the New York Times
and the Washington Post Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said when South Korean survivors and victims'
relatives told their story, and sought redress, they met only
rejection and denial, from the U.S. military and their own
government in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The AP spent months tracing American veterans in some 130
interviews by telephone and in person, and a dozen former U.S.
soldiers have spoken out. Although none gave a complete, detailed
account of the events under the bridge near No Gun Ri some 160
kilometers southeast of Seoul in 1950, their memories support the
villagers' accounts.
</P>
<P>
In late July 1950, the American veterans said, their Army
battalion killed a large number of South Korean refugees at a
hamlet near No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. soldiers spoke of 100, 200 or simply hundreds
dead. The Koreans, whose claim for compensation was rejected last
year, said 300 were shot to death after 100 had been killed in an
air attack.
</P>
<P>
American commanders had ordered units in retreat in the Korean
War's first desperate weeks to shoot civilians as a defense
against disguised enemy soldiers, according to once-classified
documents found by the AP in months of researching U.S. military
archives and interviewing veterans across the United States.
</P>
<P>
Six veterans of the 1st Cavalry Division said they fired on the
refugee throng near No Gun Ri, and six others said they witnessed
the mass killing at the South Korean hamlet. More said they knew
or heard about it.
</P>
<P>
Armed with new evidence that former U.S. soldiers had confirmed
much of their account, the Korean claimants called for a U.S.
investigation into the killings.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the U.S. government will meet our demands and console
the wandering souls of those who died an unfair death," the
claimants said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military has said repeatedly it found no basis for the
allegations. On Wednesday, after the AP report was released,
Pentagon spokesman P.J. Crowley said, "We just have no information
in historical files to lend any clarity to what might have
happened in July 1950."

<HEADLINE> India Tests Surface to Air Missile Akash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 30 (Xinhua) -- India Thursday successfully
tested its multi-target surface-to-air missile Akash with a range
of 25 km from the Interim Test Range (ITR) at Chandipur of east
India's Orissa state, defense sources said.
</P>
<P>
Akash hit Nishant, a pilotless training aircraft (PTA) flown
earlier from the ITR, with desired accuracy, according to PTI.
</P>
<P>
The test was exclusively meant to measure the timing and range
of Akash, compared to Patriot missiles, and also its ability to
hit a moving object in different range.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the data collected from Thursday's experiment
would be analyzed and, if necessary, further tests would be
conducted.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Outraged by Violence of Kosovo Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's National Security Adviser Sandy Berger Thursday
expressed his outrage over the violent acts of the ethnic
Albanians against Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Berger told a gathering at the U.S. Institute of Peace that
NATO did not fight in Kosovo for one ethnic group over another.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanians in Kosovo set the Serb houses on flames,
beat the Serbs and drove them out of home after NATO-led
multinational forces took control of the province in June.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that situation in the province has improved a
lot. "All in all, we are on track in rebuilding the physical
structure and in building political structures."
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the war in Kosovo, over 800,000 Kosovo
Albanian refugees have returned to the province while another
100,000 who were internally displaced have gone back to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector and hospitals and clinics have been
revitalized and mail service has been resumed, Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Benefits From Biggest EU Finance for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Starting in the year 2000,
Romania is the country that has obtained most EU funds for
regional development programs, of all the candidates to European
Union membership, said Simon Mordue, coordinator of the Phare-EU
delegation to Romania, in an interview with the local daily
Romania Libera on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mordue said that in August 1999 the largest offer for regional
development was issued for Romania, at 20 million euros. Romania
will contribute 25 percent to this budget, while the rest 75
percent will be funded by the EU. The money is going to be used
for training, retraining and job creation, as areas in which
''non-governmental organizations (NGO) have a worthy experience,''
according to Mordue.
</P>
<P>
He added that the NGO's must ''become involved effectively'' in
the implementation of another program - RICOP - intended to deal
with the consequences of restructuring and reinsertion of the
unemployed; the RICOP program is estimated at around 100 million
euros.
</P>
<P>
The EU Delegation to Romania manages directly such programs
as Phare for Partnership, aimed at financing partnerships between
NGO's or between the NGO's and other society authorities; Phare
for Democracy, which has among its top priorities the development
of the NGO's activity; Phare Lien, which fosters links between the
NGO's dealing with projects for the deprived people. All the above
mentioned programs are currently under way.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Assesses Situation of Displaced People in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported Thursday that there
have been large population displacements in Burundi following
intensified attacks by rebel groups around Bujumbura Rural
province.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference here
Thursday that some 260,000 people are believed to have been forced
by the attacks during the past two weeks into 30 protection sites
in the area.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the total number of internally displaced persons
in the province is now estimated at 318,000 -- three quarters of
the province's population, he said, adding that the total number
of the displaced in Burundi is estimated at 807,000.
</P>
<P>
In response to this development, U.N. agencies and their
partners sent two rapid assessment teams to visit several of the
protection sites on September 27-28.
</P>
<P>
Two additional teams are scheduled to assess conditions at more
sites Friday, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The team's primary findings reveal that the most urgent needs
are for access to safe water and non-food items, particularly
blankets and plastic sheeting," he said. "International
humanitarian organizations have begun to deliver safe water and
some non-food items to affected populations."
</P>
<P>
Since Tutsi paratroopers assassinated the country's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu, in 1993, more than
200,000 people, mainly Hutu civilians, have been killed in the
fighting between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
Burundi's Hutus make up a majority of the country's population,
but Tutsi control the military, judiciary and much of the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo expressed Thursday his worry about the situation after a
strong earthquake, which has killed at least 10.
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned about Oaxaca", Zedillo told television
media when returning to Mexico's capital from Queretaro state,
where he interrupted a working tour upon being told of the quake,
which happened at 11:31 local time (16:31 GMT).
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people dead and 35 were injured so far on Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 7.5 and was centered
in Punta Maldonado, north of Port Angel, some 850 kilometers east
from Mexico City, the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado
said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency organizations mentioned the existence of one dead in
Mexico's capital city and another in Veracruz state.
</P>
<P>
Oaxaca's governor Jose Murat called Televisa TV network to
report about the situation in this state, where at least eight
persons died due to the earthquake, whose epicenter lay in coastal
areas of the same state.
</P>
<P>
Mexico City, one of the world's largest cities with nearly 20
million residents in the metropolitan area, suffered a major quake
on September 19, 1985, when an 8.1-magnitude quake struck, killing
at least 9,500 people.
</P>
<P>
The recent strong earthquake in Mexico occurred in June 15 this
year in a sparsely populated mountain area 265 kilometers
southwest of Mexico City, killing at least 17 people and injuring
nearly 200. More than 7,700 homes were damaged or destroyed,
mostly in Oaxaca and Puebla states.

<HEADLINE> 50th PRC Anniversary Congratulated in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the 50th
birthday of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese embassy in
Berlin invited more than 800 people to its reception Thursday with
traditional Chinese music and the message that German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder would formally visit China.
</P>
<P>
At the well-known Intercontinental Hotel in downtown Berlin,
former Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and other prominent people in
Germany's political life were invited to the reception, at which a
traditional Chinese orchestra from Beijing played traditional
Chinese music.
</P>
<P>
The reception began with an address by Chinese Ambassador Lu
Qiutian, who eulogized the great progress of China and announced
that German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder would pay an official
visit to China next month.
</P>
<P>
"Fifty years ago, on October 1, Mao Zedong announced the birth
of the People's Republic of China and a new chapter of the Chinese
history began," said Lu.
</P>
<P>
"In these 50 years, the Chinese people have, under the
leadership of their government, made great progress both in the
domestic and foreign areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Especially since the beginning of our reform era, the living
quality of the Chinese people has been much bettered, and the
modernization has been propelled in all fields, and China has
become an important factor for the peace and progress of the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu praised the Sino-German relationship, saying, "There are
more cooperation and exchanges between China and Germany in the
fields of politics, economy and culture. The friendly relationship
between China and Germany is in the interests of the people in
both countries."
</P>
<P>
At the end of his speech, Lu said that German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder would officially visit China next month. It
would be the first formal visit to China by Schroeder since he was
elected federal chancellor a year ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
The trip, he said, was expected to upgrade the Sino-German
bilateral friendship and cooperation to a more satisfying level.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Amama Mbabazi , Ugandan state
minister for Regional Cooperation, Thursday spoke highly of the
existing Sino- Ugandan relations.
</P>
<P>
He described such relationship as smooth, adding that there are
 "bright prospects" for the growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi made the remarks here Thursday evening at a grand
function hosted by the Chinese Embassy to Uganda to mark the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Uganda and China enjoy good relations, especially
since the ruling National Resistance Movement came to power in
1986, Uganda has learnt a lot from China's experience in
developing its economy."
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi called for further strengthening of bilateral relations
 although the two countries have already had cooperation covering
a wide range of areas such as economy , trade and culture which
has gained momentum in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Ugandan government has attached great
importance to its relations with China. The exchange of visits by
high-ranking officials from both sides become more frequent than
ever. All these point to the bright prospects of bilateral ties,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Uganda Zhang Xujiang briefed more than
500 guests present at the function on China's recent economic
achievements and the country's foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented economic achievements that China has made
indicate that its leadership has chosen the right political system
and the right economic measures to recover the nation both
economically and politically, he said.

BANGKOK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- All the hostages taken in

<HEADLINE> WHO: Nuclear Accident Poses No Public Threat Outside Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The accident which occurred on
September 30 at a nuclear fuel fabrication plant in Tokai-mura,
Japan, is not a public health concern outside Japanese territory
and is unlikely to have any public health impact beyond the local
population, said the World Health Organization (WHO) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Known technically as a criticality event, the accident involved
the unscheduled fissioning of uranium 235, according to WHO. This
led to the generation of a strong external radiation field
comprising neutrons and gamma-rays and the release of radioactive
materials in the form of fission products which have been detected
off site.
</P>
<P>
However, "such criticality events are self-limiting and,
although the fission reaction was sustained for several hours, the
likely magnitude of fission product release does not constitute a
public health concern outside Japanese territory and is unlikely
to have any public health impact beyond the local location," said
Mike Repacholi, a WHO expert.
</P>
<P>
As far as the local population is concerned, restrictions were
placed on activities out of doors and on drinking rainwater, said
WHO. Locally produced farm produce is being monitored. Such
actions to protect local public health are part of the normal
procedures for operating such facilities.
</P>
<P>
There have been a number of criticality events in the past, the
most notable in the Y12 uranium separation plant at Oak Ridge in
the United States of America some 40 years ago, WHO recalled.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Russia Sign Minute on Economic, Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Russia on Friday
signed a minute on bilateral economic, trade, technology and oil
cooperation, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
The minutes were signed by Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed
Rasheed and visiting Russian Minister of Fuel and Energy Victor
Kalyuzini, who arrived here on Tuesday evening to attend the
third session of the Iraqi-Russian Economic, Trade and Technical
Joint Committee.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing ceremony, Rasheed told reporters that
meetings of the Iraqi-Russian joint committee were successful
and the two countries will work to promote bilateral cooperation
to a new height.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed said Iraq had given priorities in signing contracts
to Russian companies, elaborating that Iraq had signed 400
million U.S. dollars worth of contracts with Russian companies
in the fifth phases of the oil-for-food deal for the purchases
of oil equipment and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
He added that Russia had purchased more than 40 percent
of Iraq's oil exported under the oil-for-food program now in
its sixth phase, which allows Iraq to export limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
For his part, the Russian minister said that there were some
problems in implementing the contract the two countries signed in
1997 on developing southern Iraq's West Qurna Oilfields. He did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
West Qurna Oilfields, 500 kilometers south of Baghdad, have an
estimated oil reserve of 7 to 8 billion barrels. Under the
contract, Russia and Iraq will cooperate to develop the oilfields
over 23 years.
</P>
<P>
Kalyuzini said Iraq's top leaders had discussed those problems
in implementing the contract and tried to find solutions to
existing problems. He said that Russia will implement the
contract.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister also condemned the U.S.-British
bombardment of Iraqi civilian facilities, saying that Russian will
try its best to help lift the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kalyuzini on Thursday conveyed to President Saddam Hussein a
letter from President Boris Yeltsin in which Yeltsin said Russia
will work now and in the future to help lift the U.N. sanctions
off Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Military Parade Held in Cyprus to Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The annual Independence Day
military parade was held Friday in Cyprus to mark the island's
39th anniversary of independence from British colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsochatzopoulos, who arrived here Thursday on a four-day official
visit, and other Cyprus government officials were present to
review the parade.
</P>
<P>
Weapons displayed in the parade included Aspide missiles,
recently acquired Russian TOR-M1 anti-aircraft systems, AMX 30B2
and T-80 tanks, armored personnel carriers and missiles launchers.
</P>
<P>
The TOR-M1 missiles, which can hit two targets at the same time,
have a maximum range of 12 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the medium-range missiles from Russia after it
gave up the deployment of Russian-made S-300 long-range missiles
under international pressure and Turkish threats of preemptive
military actions.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus reached an agreement in November, 1993 that
Greece will offers Cyprus land, sea and air cover in the event of
fresh Turkish attacks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
After the parade, Cyprus Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos told
the press that as long as the occupation forces are here, Cyprus
has an obligation to strengthen its defense.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Faces Water Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Like elsewhere in the world,
water crisis will loom large in Nepal in the 21st century, if the
government fails to formulate effective plans and policies, The
Kathmandu Post quoted experts as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an interaction program organized by Nepal Forum for
Environment Journalists here Thursday, the experts called on the
government to formulate an effective policy to ensure supply of
safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is rich in water resources. But utilization is low
because of poor government management and lack of money to develop
the resources. The country as a whole has not yet faced serious
drinking water shortage problem, but the Kathmandu Valley has been
hit for several years.
</P>
<P>
In Kathmandu, the average daily demand is 150 million liters
and the supply is 120 million liters in the wet season and 70
million liters in the dry season, according to an official from
the Nepal Water Supply Corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning, access
to safe water in Nepal is 67 percent, compared with 82 percent in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the whole world, some 1.2 billion people lack access to safe
water and the figure will increase to 2.3 billion by 2025 unless
action is stepped up, according to a press release issued by the
program.

<HEADLINE> Big Fireworks Display For PRC Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing celebrated the 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China with a spectacular
40-minute fireworks display this evening that lit up much of the
city.
</P>
<P>
The fireworks were mainly set off at sites around Tian'anmen
Square in the city center, where a National Day soiree for some
100,000 people was held, but there were 10 other sites around the
city for people who didn't have access to the square.
</P>
<P>
Each time new fireworks burst over Tian'anmen, cheers erupted
from the crowd of people converged on the square. Luo Zhihong, a
student at Beijing Polytechnic University who was taking part in
the dance shows on the square, said, "I shall never forget this
evening."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tieshan, a member of the preparatory committee for the
event, said that some 200 kinds of fireworks, many of them
recently developed, were used and had impressive and meaningful
names like "Ode to the Motherland," "Star of Macao" and "Dawn of
the New Century."
</P>
<P>
Xue Juntang, a civil servant from the city's Chongwen District,
said that this was the first time he watched a fireworks display
on Tian'anmen Square and that he felt "really great."
</P>
<P>
In a residential compound a block away from Tian'anmen, a
retired teacher and his family stood quietly in the courtyard,
gazing at the beautiful patterns unfolding in the sky, said that
it was the most beautiful and touching scene he had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
The fireworks lit up the Monument to the People's Heroes in the
center of Tian'anmen Square, which was built 41 years ago to honor
those who gave their lives for a new, robust China.
</P>
<P>
The fireworks also illuminated the Macao Countdown Clock on the
east side of Tian'anmen Square, which was put there to greet the
return of Macao to the motherland in December of this year.
</P>
<P>
An old man at the square said that, in the past 50 years, since
the founding of new China, the Chinese have realized their 5,000-
year dream of prosperity and dignity.
</P>
<P>
At 10 p.m., the final burst of fireworks over Tian'anmen Square
came, and the 100,000 people on the square started singing
simultaneously the song "Singing in Praise of the Motherland."

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Opposition Warned Not to Resort to Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Opposition
parties were warned Friday not to resort to violence and disrupt
public order especially with the general election which is
believed not far away.
</P>
<P>
Issuing the warning, Deputy Home Minister Azmi Khalid said that
otherwise the government will take action against them.
</P>
<P>
The government does not want peace in the country to be
jeopardized because it had helped the country to gain the
confidence of foreign investors and intensified economic
development, he said in Taiping, some 290 kilometers north of
here, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
Azmi said the opposition parties were given the opportunity to
hold ceramahs (lectures) and provide public access to their
newspapers and various information posted over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
But, the opposition parties lacked issues that they resorted to
disturbing ceramahs of the ruling United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) by making noises, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to be desperate and it is not surprising if they
resort to violence as the general election approaches," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deputy home minister said the opposition should realize
that the best way to change the government is through the ballot
boxes and not resorting to violence.

speaking to the more than 40,000 spectators at the Hong Kong
Stadium where a grand show was held to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>

the collective effort of Hong Kong people and the total support of
the Central People's Government, we have implemented fully the
policies 'One Country, Two Systems', Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong and a high degree of autonomy. Under the '
Basic Law', the social, economic and legal systems of Hong Kong
have been maintained; our lifestyle has been preserved; Hong Kong
people continue to enjoy the freedoms of speech, of the press and

resolve. We have gone past the most difficult period for the Hong
Kong economy, and I believe that better times lie ahead," he

opportunity of a century to create a civilized and abundant
society, and realizing the ideals of a great nation."

<HEADLINE> Nepal Faces Water Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Like elsewhere in the world,
water crisis will loom large in Nepal in the 21st century, if the
government fails to formulate effective plans and policies, The
Kathmandu Post quoted experts as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an interaction program organized by Nepal Forum for
Environment Journalists here Thursday, the experts called on the
government to formulate an effective policy to ensure supply of
safe drinking water.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is rich in water resources. But utilization is low
because of poor government management and lack of money to develop
the resources. The country as a whole has not yet faced serious
drinking water shortage problem, but the Kathmandu Valley has been
hit for several years.
</P>
<P>
In Kathmandu, the average daily demand is 150 million liters
and the supply is 120 million liters in the wet season and 70
million liters in the dry season, according to an official from
the Nepal Water Supply Corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning, access
to safe water in Nepal is 67 percent, compared with 82 percent in
South Asia.
</P>
<P>
In the whole world, some 1.2 billion people lack access to safe
water and the figure will increase to 2.3 billion by 2025 unless
action is stepped up, according to a press release issued by the
program.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Minister for Civil
Affairs Jamil Tarif on Friday denied the signing of an agreement
with Israel on the opening of a safe passage route on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tarif said the joint Palestinian-Israeli committee had failed,
after several hours of talks until dawn Friday, to reach any
agreement on the opening of the southern safe passage route that
links Gaza strip and Tarkumia near the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
He said that differences between the two sides mainly concern
the free travelling for Palestinians, and the safe passage card.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side demands that Israeli military has the right to
arrest suspected Palestinians travelling along the route, a stance
adamantly rejected by the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Palestinian side rejected the Israeli position
that Palestinian citizens should obtain the safe passage card from
the Israeli liaison offices, asserting that the Palestinian
National Authority is solely responsible for the matter.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said on Thursday that the
safe passage route would be opened on Sunday, in implementation of
the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
Tarif pointed out that the Israeli government would have to
bear the responsibility of postponing the opening of the safe
passage route.

<HEADLINE> Rich, New Fireworks for PRC Anniversary Evening Gala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- About 200 kinds of fireworks
will be set off into the sky over Tian'anmen Square in four
segments during the grand gala celebrating the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) this evening.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 types of fireworks were specially developed for
today's evening gala. The fireworks will be set off from 11 sites
during the evening, including one site at Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
They include time-honored traditional Chinese fireworks brands,
internationally popular fireworks imported from foreign countries,
and newly developed products. The fireworks will demonstrate such
features as greater brightness of colors, lasting longer in the
sky, spreading to a greater extent, and simultaneously changing
color as they are set off.
</P>
<P>
The fireworks range from three inches to 16 inches long, and
will be set off from the height of 200 to 400 meters, with the
diameter of the explosion reaching up to 200 meters, producing a
great number of beautiful scenes in Beijing's evening sky.
</P>
<P>
The ignition of this year's fireworks will be carried out in
carefully planned groups in order to express specially designed
themes, and produce a clear-cut intensity.
</P>
<P>
For instance, after the fireworks called "The Star of Macao" is
set off, a golden cocoa tree symbolizing Macao will change color
from gold to red, which is favored by Chinese as a sign of good
luck, and celebrates happy occasions such as the return of Macao
to China on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Fireworks with music, which has been developed by China for the
first time, will also be set off at this evening's gala. The music
selected for this is titled "Marching Toward the New Era" and this
segment of the pyrotechnics will last four minutes and two seconds.

<HEADLINE> Macao to Return to China 80 Days after Nation's 50th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- When the fireworks lit up the
night sky and the faces of those celebrating the nation's 50th
birthday in Tian'anmen Square, a huge digital countdown clock on
the east side of the square showed that Macao will return to the
embrace of the motherland in 80 days.
</P>
<P>
Chinese call 1999 a year of double happiness: the people's
republic's 50th anniversary and Macao's return to the motherland.
And each of the hundreds of thousands of people in Tian'anmen
Square tonight could not help but turn their eyes toward the
countdown clock.
</P>
<P>
When the clock was erected on May 5 last year, Ho Hau Wah, at
the time vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR), said the countdown clock not
only reminds the public of the time Macao will return to the
motherland, December 20, 1999, but also urges us to expedite the
preparatory work for the establishment of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
Ho, who has been elected as the first chief executive of the
Macao SAR, came to participate in the celebration today and said
the preparatory work for establishing the Macao SAR is well under
way.
</P>
<P>
A large exhibition on the history of Macao opened several days
ago in the Museum of Chinese History behind the countdown clock.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Na, dressed in splendid attire and dancing in Tian'anmen
Square tonight, visited the exhibition several days ago. "I'm
looking forward to Macao's return to China," she said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who works for the Chongwen District government in
Beijing, said she took part in a contest on knowledge of Macao and
got to know a middle school student in Macao.
</P>
<P>
"We wrote letters to each other and decided to visit the
Tian'anmen Rostrum, the Palace Museum, and the Great Wall together
after the return of Macao," she said.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiang, a sophomore from the Beijing Business School, waved
his school flag with all his might in front of the countdown clock.
</P>
<P>
"My classmates and I watched the grand parade on TV this
morning and we feel that our country is becoming strong and
prosperous. The history of infringing on Chinese territory and
sovereignty by others has gone forever," said the 20-year-old
student.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Opposition Warned Not to Resort to Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Opposition
parties were warned Friday not to resort to violence and disrupt
public order especially with the general election which is
believed not far away.
</P>
<P>
Issuing the warning, Deputy Home Minister Azmi Khalid said that
otherwise the government will take action against them.
</P>
<P>
The government does not want peace in the country to be
jeopardized because it had helped the country to gain the
confidence of foreign investors and intensified economic
development, he said in Taiping, some 290 kilometers north of
here, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
Azmi said the opposition parties were given the opportunity to
hold ceramahs (lectures) and provide public access to their
newspapers and various information posted over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
But, the opposition parties lacked issues that they resorted to
disturbing ceramahs of the ruling United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) by making noises, he said.
</P>
<P>
"They seemed to be desperate and it is not surprising if they
resort to violence as the general election approaches," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deputy home minister said the opposition should realize
that the best way to change the government is through the ballot
boxes and not resorting to violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday launched
the National Senior Citizens' Action Plan focusing on health care,
housing, social and recreational facilities for the old folks.
</P>
<P>
The plan which covered more than 60 programs including
development and education programs for senior citizens was the
result of the cooperation of various sectors, National Unity and
Social Development Minister Zaleha Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
"The government is serious in taking care of the old folk's
welfare as well as to improve their potential," the minister said
after the launch of the Senior Citizens Day 1999 celebration here
by the country's Supreme Head of State Sultan Salahuddin Abdul
Aziz Shah.
</P>
<P>
The old folk population is expected to increase by 11 percent
by the year 2020 from the present 1.2 million senior citizens out
of the country's 22 million population.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to set up the Senior Citizens Foundation
aimed to improve the standard of living of the group through
financial contributions, she said.
</P>
<P>
The task of planning for the group's future should not be
shouldered by the government alone, the minister said, adding the
cooperation of all parties is needed.

BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Kan Yuesai cast her image in the
hearts of millions of Chinese in 1984 as an anchorperson of the
PBS of the United States which helped China televise live the
celebrations marking the 35th anniversary of the founding of new
China on October 1 of that year.
</P>
<P>
Today, however, she came to Tian'anmen Square again but as a
viewer on the visitors' stands adjacent the Tian'anmen Rostrum.
</P>
<P>
"China no longer needs foreign newsmen's help. She has her own
communications satellite," she said. "Ping! The signal goes around
worldwide," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that there have been great changes over the past 15
years, which have transformed China into a mighty country, and the
nation is able to see its future clearly.
</P>
<P>
Like Kan, some 6,000 overseas people, and representatives of
the compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, have watched
today's grand celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China, together with 500,000
elated Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Some of them arrived at the visitors' stands two hours ahead of
the beginning of the celebrations scheduled at 10:00 this morning.
Wearing badges of China's national emblem, lots of them were
waving China's miniature national flags. They applaused warmly
while enjoying the colorful procession.
</P>
<P>
What they were interested in most was the military parade, the
largest and the most advanced to show China's latest weapons.
</P>
<P>
"I am intrested in the military parade. China's military force
is progressing rapidly, and it has developed some advanced
technologies," said Paul Southwell, military attache of the New

</P>
<P>
Chong King Liong, an overseas Chinese from Malaysia, said that
the military parade was a real splendor, and all the latest

</P>
<P>
Abu Roshde Rokonuddawla, military attache of the Bangladeshi

<HEADLINE> Tian'anmen Square Becomes Sea of Lights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- While the first part of the
National Day soiree was concluded with a 10-minute fireworks
display, a harp-shape float shining with colorful lights and
carrying performers in various costumes of Chinese folk operas
slowly slid across the Tiananmen Rostrum, launching the second
part of the soiree.
</P>
<P>
Today is the 50th birthday of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
What the performers sang were arias from the famous Peking
Opera, which is reputed as the most precious legacy of the Chinese
culture, as well as from other popular Chinese folk operas, such
as the Shaoxing Opera, Henan Opera and Huangmei (Anhui) Opera.
</P>
<P>
Dancing around the float were 100 students from the Chinese
Opera Academy dressed up as various characters in folk operas and
dozens of kids brandishing colorful lanterns in the shape of carps
and lotus.
</P>
<P>
The opera float was followed by a float carrying several young
pop singers, who were singing songs eulogizing China's great
achievements over the past two decades of reform and opening-up.
The float was surrounded by nearly 1,000 teenagers holding silver-
colored electronic lights and dancing in brisk paces.
</P>
<P>
The second part of the soiree reached its climax when two
golden dragon lanterns, each 54 meters in length, and two more
than 10-meter-long phoenix lanterns emerged below the Tian'anmen
Rostrum. These lanterns were from Tongliang County of Chongqing
Municipality, which enjoys a nationwide fame as "the hometown of
lanterns." There were also 160 young girls holding large "peony
flowers" and dancing around the dragons and phoenixes.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people regard dragon and phoenix as symbols of good
luck, and bill the peony as "king of all flowers" for its natural
grace and elegance.
</P>
<P>
All performers in the phoenix lantern dancing, which allegedly
was introduced in major celebration occasions for the first time,
were female amateurs from the Tongliang County.
</P>
<P>
Various traditional lanterns and lights of modern science and
technology, such as spotlights, searchlights and laser lights,
have turned the vast Tiananmen Square into a sea of colorful
lights tonight.

-- Workers accidentally set off a nuclear-fission chain
reaction at a uranium procession plant about 120 kilometers

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The fourth ordinary session of the
fourth legislature of Lao National Assembly (NA) was opened in
Vientiane on Thursday, Lao official news agency KPL reported
Friday.
One of the main tasks of the session, which will last to October
15, is to adopt the state budget for fiscal year 1999-2000 and
socio-economic development plans.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, President of the NA Samane Viyaket urged
all NA members to make amendments to socio-economic development
plans when they are thought necessary in order to fulfill targets.
</P>
<P>
During this session NA members will receive reports on the
1998-1999 socio-economic development and hear about the
implementation of the Constitution and laws passed in the past
years.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the members of the national legislation on
implementation of the 1998-1999 social economic plan, Lao Prime
Minister Sisavath Keobounphanh said that although Laos has
achieved several of its objectives, such as political stability,
construction of the infrastructure, solidarity among people and
the extension of dry-season rice cultivation areas, it still faces
problems.

"Laos still faces some difficult situations: the economic
growth rate has slowed down; the inflation rate is still too high;
the price of goods and the exchange rate fluctuate strongly and
the standard of living among state employees and the general
public is still low," he said.
</P>

The immediate task in preparation for the 21st century,
Sisavath stressed, is to improve macroeconomic planning and
control inflation and exchange rates.

The government will intensively promote and control investments
in domestic production, infrastructure construction projects and
government priority programs.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Parade Features China's Military Strength (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Unified strides of the paraders,
shining rifles, rumbling tanks, missiles of different sizes, and
whistling jet fighters at today's National Day military parade
were among the most spectacular scenes attracting those at
Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
The half million people attending the celebrations bursted into
thunderous applauses many times during the 40-minute parade,
marvelling at the august appearances of officers and soldiers of
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) as well as their advanced
weapons.
</P>
<P>
At about 10:30, march-past began amidst the music played by a
military band. A guard of honor in three colors: green, white and
blue, representing the PLA three services, marched before the
Tian'anmen Rostrum to solute the Party and state leaders present
on the rostrum.
</P>
<P>
It was the very honor guard that have splashed over 2,000
reception ceremonies for visiting heads of state and raised
China's national flag at the ceremony for China's resumption of
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong about two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Following were square formations representing military
academies, led by a formation composed of cadets from the
University of National Defense, China's equivalent of West Point
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
This university has been called "cradle of generals" since most
high-ranking officers of the PLA are its graduates.
</P>
<P>
And today, a notebook computer is just as necessary as a
handgun for a cadet here. "China's new generation of generals are
trained to deal with hi-tech warfare in the future," said the head
of the formation, Lu Guangxin, in an interview before the parade.
</P>
<P>
The 17 ground formations taking part in the parade also
included those composed of Marine Corps, special armed police,
pilots, military reserves and militia. Those sun-tanned young men
and women all looked radiant and in good shape.
</P>
<P>
Of the army units marching past the Tian'anmen Rostrum, some
had the glorious and victorious history of taking part in the War
of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945), and others were commended
for protecting people's lives and property in the fight against
the Yangtze River flood last summer.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Parade Features China's Military Strength (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 10:42, 25 armored formations of more than 400 tanks,
carriers, artillery, missiles began rumbling through Tian'anmen
Square. The state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles, tracked
and wheeled, armored personnel carriers, drawn or self-propelled
howitzers, self-propelled guns, smoothbore guns, multiple rocket
launchers, anti-aircraft guns and cannons were sporting their
skyward barrels and scatter guns.
</P>
<P>
At sight of the tanks with only two soldiers visible and
equipped with smoothbore guns, some weaponry zealots yelled, "they
are new tanks." According to military experts, they are a new
generation of battle tanks made in China, featuring light weight,
thick shell, strong fire power and enduring viability in battle
fields. The helmets of tank soldiers indicate that the tanks are
equipped with an advanced communications system.
</P>
<P>
According to military sources, more than 90 percent of the new
weapons and equipment making their appearance in today's parade,
including rifles in the first 17 formations, were developed and
produced by China itself.
</P>
<P>
Then came the family of missiles, including surface-to-air,
ship-to-air, ship-to-ship missiles and intercontinental missiles
of the Second Artillery Corps.
</P>
<P>
Missiles on display were arranged in the order of their sizes,
from small to large as the parade proceeded, and culminated in the
12 missiles that are about 20 meters long and nearly three meters
in diameter. The appearance of the intercontinental surface-to-
surface missile phalanx attracted the VIPs on the Tian'anmen
Rostrum, the media and the rest of the half million people on the
square.
</P>
<P>
Even before the last few armored vehicles passed the Tian'anmen
Rostrum, ten echelons of 132 warplanes emerged at the east end of
the sky. Just in minutes, bombers, aerial tankers, fighters,
strike fighters, ground attack fighters skimmed over the
Tian'anmen Square. Some looked like over-sized birds, others like
swift rockets; some sweeping at the height of 800 meters,
helicopters flying just 250 meters high, with pilots silhouette
visible.
</P>
<P>
One of the most notable aircraft was a China-made strike
fighter named "Feibao," literally meaning "flying leopard."
</P>
<P>
The bulky echelons of advanced aircraft drew more waves of
applauses and cheers from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
During the 40-minute parade, over 100,000 primary and high
school pupils on the square successively formed five phrases
consisting of 20 gigantic bold Chinese characters: "politically
qualified, militarily competent, having a fine style of work,
strict discipline and adequate logistic support."
</P>
<P>
The principles, set for the PLA by President Jiang Zemin, were
also vivid depiction of the armed forces on display, according to
military observers.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the policy of building fewer but better troops, China
has been cutting down the muster roll by an average 100,000
annually since 1986 and reducing the proportion of military
expenditure to the gross national product. Analysts say that
judging from today's parade, the PLA can live up to the
expectations of the Chinese people to realize the country's
reunification and safeguard China's territorial integrity and help

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A grand soiree marking the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
started on the Tian'anmen Square in downtown Beijing at 8 o'clock
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other top Communist Party and
state leaders Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei
Jianxing and Li Lanqing are present on the Tian'anmen Rostrum
opposite to the square to share this jubilant occasion with the
100,000 soiree participants from all ethnic groups across China.
</P>
<P>
Splendid fireworks were set off to the sky over the Tian'anmen
Square as Beijing's Party Secretary Jia Qinglin declared open the
soiree from the Rostrum. At the same time, a large entertainment
show began on the Chang'an Avenue (Avenue of Eternal Peace) at the
foot of the Rostrum.
</P>
<P>
The show, at which outstanding singers and dancers from all
parts of the country will contribute an excellent combination of
traditional and modern performances, started with dragon and lion
dancing, a repertoire in Chinese traditional festivities.
</P>
<P>
Dancing below the Tian'anmen Rostrum are two "mighty dragons"
and nearly 100 cute "lions." The lion dancers wear two different
kinds of costumes, which represent two different styles of lion
dancing from north and south China.
</P>
<P>
The "dragons" and "lions" are followed by 14 teams of drum
dancers, who perform 14 different kinds of Chinese folk drum
dances, including those from Tibet and Xinjiang, two autonomous
regions in west China.
</P>
<P>
According to a director of the show, all performing teams in
the show will march through the Tian'anmen section of the Chang'an
Avenue from east to west, performing all the way. The entire show

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The opening performance of the
grand National Day soiree which just opened on the Tian'anmen
Square in downtown Beijing was dragon and lion dancing, a
repertoire in Chinese traditional festivities.
</P>
<P>
Amidst the deafening sound of gongs and drums, two "mighty
dragons" and nearly 100 "lions" ran from both sides into the "
central performance zone" below the Tian'anmen Rostrum. They
started performance to the rhythm of a huge drum, which, 1.8
meters in diameter and dubbed "Drum King," is placed on a float.
</P>
<P>
The lion dancers wear two different kinds of costumes, which
represent two different styles of lion dancing in China. The "
northern lion" costumes, which are very popular in areas north of
the Yangtze River, give the "lions" a very powerful and elegant
appearance. The "southern lions" costumes, however, look pretty,
cute and flexible, and thus have always been a favorite with south
China residents, especially those in Guangdong province, Hong Kong
and Macao.
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of many Chinese, dragon and lion dancing is not
only a folk performance for holiday celebrations, but also a
solemn way to pray for good luck and happiness.
</P>
<P>
The lion and dragon dancers are followed by 14 drum dancing
teams from all over the country, each with some 100 performers.
They are from a dozen provinces and autonomous regions, including
Gansu, Henan, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Xinjiang, Shandong, Yunnan
and Tibet, and all the drums they carry are different, ranging
from waist drums, hand drums to flower drums and Taiping (Peace)
drums.
</P>
<P>
The drum dancing teams passed through the Tian'anmen section of
the Chang'an Avenue from east to west in an orderly manner, while
different drum music mixed to form an amazingly exciting melody.
The soiree came to a climax shortly after its opening.
</P>
<P>
With 100,000 people singing, dancing and cheering, the Chang'an
Avenue and the Tian'anmen Square became the largest stage in the
world.

<HEADLINE> China Capable of Developing Advanced Missiles: Expert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Facts have demonstrated that
China is capable of developing internationally advanced missiles,
renowned expert Liang Shoupan said today after watching on TV the
display of missiles in the National Day military parade in central
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The tactical and strategic missiles featured today are
comparable to those made by developed countries, said Liang at his
office.
</P>
<P>
"I can confidently tell you that Chinese missiles are, at the
very least, not as backward as what some Westerners say. As for
whether China's missiles are advanced or not, we know the answer,
so do the Western expert,"
</P>
<P>
In a blue jacket, Liang is easily taken as a common retired
worker. Yet, he is one of the four most respected figures in
Chinese missile and aerospace circles. The others are Ren Xinmin,
Tu Shou'e and Huang Weilu.
</P>
<P>
Liang, 83, is a graduate of the prestigious Qinghua University
and received his master's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology of the United States in 1939. He returned to China in
the early 1940s.
</P>
<P>
The expert has been involved in China's missile and aerospace
technology development starting from the 1950s and led the design
team of China's first ground-to-ground missile.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proved and will continue to be proved that you can
not expect to get the most advanced military technologies from
others. You must develop it on your own. China has succeeded
thanks to its cherished spirit of self-reliance and hard-working,"
Liang said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that China decided to develop missile technology in
April, 1956. In September of the same year, the Fifth Institute of
the Ministry of Defense was set up, with Qian Xuesen as the
director. More than 30 experts and 100 university graduates were
called in.
</P>
<P>
The then Soviet Union had promised to help China develop
missile technology. But with the souring of bilateral relations
between the two countries, the Soviet Union said they could only
sell two missile samples to China.
</P>
<P>
At that point, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, who was in charge of the
mission, held that China should develop the missile technology by
itself.
</P>
<P>
"At that conference, I told Marshal Nie that China can do it on
its own. It's true that we even didn't know what a missile looked
like. But no one in the world had seen a missile before it was
developed. If other people can do it, why we Chinese can not,"
Liang said.

<P>
Chairman Mao Zedong soon approved the report, adding that they
should not only be the principles in developing China's defense
technology, but also the principles in developing the whole
industry of new China.
</P>
<P>
Liang said from then to the early 1960s, China established its
own missile development bases and laboratories.
</P>
<P>
In April 1960, the group headed by Liang manufactured China's
first ground-to-ground tactical missile.
</P>
<P>
On November 5, 1960, three months after the withdrawal of the
Soviet Union experts, China successfully launched its first short-
range missile, marking a turning point in the history of China's
military armament, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, China also developed ballistic missiles,
anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and reported
breakthrough in preliminary research of various missiles and in
the fields of some single technologies, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
By 1964, China had established a research team for liquid-fuel
ballistic missiles and another for solid-fuel ballistic missiles,
paving the way for the development of new generations of strategic
missiles in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
Liang pointed out China developed its missile and other
advanced military technologies independently, as Western nations
had been imposing an economic and military blockage on the country
from the 1950s until China's reform and opening-up in the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
After 40 years of development, China has reported a remarkable
progress in its missile technology and has developed a whole
series of missiles, including medium-range, long-range and
ballistic missiles, as well as anti-ship, anti-air, air-to-air,
air-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people can be proud of the advanced missiles on
show in the military parade.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Asks Washington to Look into Alleged Civilian Massacre by US Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea Friday asked the
United States to investigate the allegation by the Associated
Press that U.S. troops killed hundreds of innocent South Korean
civilians during the Korean War in 1950.
</P>
<P>
"We have started contacting the U.S. State and Defense
Departments through diplomatic channels to confirm facts related
to the issue," said South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang
Chul-kyoon.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean ministry will collect information on the
massacre, including declassified documents from the United States
and documents from the suit filed in 1997 by scores of the
massacre survivors, Chang added.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press, quoting declassified U.S. documents and
testimonies from U.S. veterans who witnessed or participated in
the killings and from South Korean survivors, reported that U.S.
troops shot some 400 South Koreans, many of them women and
children, as a defense measure against disguised enemy soldiers in
Nogunri of North Chungchong Province, South Korea in 1950.
</P>
<P>
The probe by South Korea came one day after U.S. President Bill
Clinton said Thursday his government will investigate the incident,
the second of its kind by U.S. troops after the My Lai massacre in
1968 during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
South Korean opposition Grand National Party President Lee Hoi-
chang called Friday for an immediate fact-finding mission on the
reported mass killing of South Korean civilians by the U.S army.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military should make an apology for the killings and
compensate the victims if the AP report is confirmed as true, Lee
said.

<HEADLINE> 19 Taken Hostage in Myanmar Embassy in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen people were taken
hostage in Myanmar embassy in Thailand on Friday by 12 gunmen, one
of whom was later taken into custody by Thai police after stepping
outside the embassy, a well-informed source said.
</P>
<P>
The gunman was seen stepping out of the embassy at about 3 p.m.
local time (0800 GMT) and was immediately taken into custody by
the Thai policemen surrounding the embassy for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen dashed into the Myanmar Embassy in Thailand at about
11:45 a.m. local time (0445 GMT). Soon after that shots of guns
were heard and residents living nearby reported to the police.
</P>
<P>
At first, some 22 people were taken hostage but later two Thai
policemen and the daughter of the Myanmar ambassador to Thailand
were released.
</P>
<P>
A counselor of the Myanmar embassy is among the hostages. But
it is still unclear whether the ambassador is also detained.
</P>
<P>
Chatchawal Suksumjit, spokesman of Royal Thai Police, told
Xinhua that the number of the gunmen was 12, but he declined to
confirm the exact number of hostages.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, believed to be Myanmar students living in Thailand,
were reportedly carrying eight Germany-made SK machine guns and 20
grenades.
</P>
<P>
Thai police has blocked the roads leading to the Myanmar
embassy in downtown Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Sanan Kachornprasart, Thailand's Interior Minister, said after
inspecting the scene that it is still unknown whether there is any
casualty in the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Thai police is conducting a negotiation with the gunmen.
However, the demand of the gunmen and the result of the
negotiation are yet to be made clear.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Dermatology Conference Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The first South Asian Regional
Conference on Dermatology (SARCD) began here Friday with the
participation of about 500 delegates from South Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The main theme of the conference is "regional collaboration in
Dermatology, Venereology and Leprology (DVL)", said Dr. Anil Kumar
Jha, organizing secretary of SARCD, in his key notes address to
the conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conference is to emphasize the importance of
interaction and cooperation in DVL, both within the region and
also with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from countries outside the region including the
United States, Japan, Switzerland, Poland and Britain are also
invited to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jha said the first SARCD is one of the steps to achieve the
goal to "intensify and expand our advocacy" for the study of DVL
and get its due place and recognition at national and
international level.
</P>
<P>
Skin diseases, leprosy and sexually transmitted diseases are
prevalent in South Asia. Poverty, ignorance and lack of proper
hygiene are the main factors for the spread of most of the
communicable diseases in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, the study and treatment of the diseases has not been
given the attention it deserves in the region.

<HEADLINE> China's Special Economic Zones Going Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- One float with a model of a
high-speed train loaded with the products of China's special
economic zones is part of today's National Day procession.
</P>
<P>
China began its opening up policy in 1979 by establishing the
four special economic zones (SEZ) in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou,
and Xiamen along the southeastern and southern coast. In 1988,
Hainan, China's second largest island, was made the country's
fifth and largest SEZ.
</P>
<P>
Numerous economic and technological development zones have also
been established in the suburbs of coastal cities. There are now
32 state-level economic and technological development zones, all
of which have become industrial production and high-tech
development centers with overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Following the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's study tour
of south China in 1992, the Chinese Government declared the
opening up of the Yangtze River Valley, the economically vibrant
heartland of China. At the head of the move was the opening of
Shanghai's Pudong New Area. By March of this year, Pudong had 5,
581 direct overseas-funded projects worth 28 billion U.S. dollars
in all.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the SEZs began restructuring their industries and
by now have largely relocated the old labor-intensive operations
and put technology- and capital-intensive enterprises in their
place.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen SEZ had 9.027 billion U.S. dollars worth of
turnover in the first five months of this year, up 12.6 percent, 4.
549 billion U.S. dollars worth of exports, down 1.8 percent, and
imports worth 4.479 billion U.S. dollars, up 32.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Zhuhai SEZ in Guangdong Province had economic growth of 9.4
percent in the first five months of this year and the Xiamen SEZ
in Fujian Province had a GDP of 19.12 billion yuan from January to
June, up 15.9 percent on a year-on-year basis, and double the
national average of 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Shantou SEZ, which is also in Guangdong Province, has
introduced a policy to promote high-tech development and sharpen
its competitive edge that calls for the city to provide 10 million
yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars) in special funding annually over
the next three years to support high-tech development. Shantou
currently has 41 high-tech enterprises with a combined annual
output of 3.2 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Beach Volleyball Stadium Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The New South Wales state
government approved Friday the construction of a Olympic beach
volleyball stadium at Bondi that will seat about 10,000 people,
according to reports reaching here..
</P>
<P>
State Urban Affairs and Planning Minister Andrew Refshauge said
that as negotiated with the local Waverley council in east Sydney,
the Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA) will provide 1 million
Australian dollars (about 650,000 U.S. dollars) to refurbish and
upgrade a pavilion at the world-famous Bondi beach.
</P>
<P>
Local residents complained about the proposal and one homeowner
took the OCA to court to try to have the stadium location changed.
The residents claim that the facility will ruin the beach for a
six-month period and should never have been considered for such a
popular area.
</P>
<P>
Construction will begin in early May, with a main court and
five practice courts also to be constructed.
</P>
<P>
Public access along the promenade in front of the pavilion will
be maintained for as long as possible but will be closed during
August and September 2000.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Cholera Kills 4 People in N. Zambia </HEADLINE>

<P>
LUSAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- At least four people died in
Kaputa district, northern Zambia, following a fresh outbreak of
cholera while nine others are still battling for their lives, the
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian Ministry of Health has dispatched officials to the
area and expressed the government's optimism that the situation
will be controled.
</P>
<P>
Garvin Silwamba, Director General of the Central Board of
Health said the ministry is worried about the refugees entering
Zambia from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for there
is no control mechanism for them.
</P>
<P>
The disease is being brought in each time refugees enter Zambia
and the hopes of finding a lasting solution are shrinking, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba said a number of DRC refugees are having access to
some homes in Kaputa before they could finally go to the refugee
camp.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects Dialog out of U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said Friday night Cyprus will not participate in any
dialog on a Cyprus settlement which is not within the parameters
of relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a message on the occasion of Cyprus' 39th anniversary of
independence on October 1, Clerides said "we are fed up with
seeing the Turkish side defying and violating U.N. resolutions
... as well as the constant efforts of some countries to
intervene so as to help Turkey not to suffer the consequences of
its negative stance."
</P>
<P>
Clerides returned to Cyprus in the early hours on Friday after
seeing a disappointing round of contacts over the Cyprus issue in
New York which culminated in a meeting between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting that had been expected to boost hopes for the
renewal of talks, ended up with another round of contacts by
Clinton's Cyprus envoy, Alfred Moses, who is due in the region
next week.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying for decades to
reunite the island through a bicommunal federation formula.
</P>
<P>
But the Turkish Cypriots and their staunch supporter Turkey
have conditioned the resumption of peace talks, that have been
stalled since 1997, on the international recognition of the
breakaway Turkish republic in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said if Moses' forthcoming visit to the region fails,
the international community should take other decisions and
measures.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the Greek Cypriot side's readiness "to enter
into talks without preconditions and to negotiate with flexibility
and courage," within the framework of the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Clerides pointed out that the fate of any talks on Cyprus
depends mainly on the Turkish side as well as the stand of the
international community vis-a-vis Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Referring to recent developments on Cyprus, Clerides said
that "unfortunately, this time too Turkey's stand is negative."
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's Clinton-Ecevit meeting, Ecevit repeated the view
that the Cyprus peace talks would take place only until the
breakaway state is internationally recognized.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian founding
president Julius Nyerere, admitted in a London hospital for
leukemia last week, has been in critical condition since Thursday
night, an official press release said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"His condition became worse last night and the doctors are

Press Secretary to Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mkapa urged his people again to pray for Nyerere's
recovery, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, 77, was admitted to St. Thomas Hospital on September
23 when he was not able to speak with a bit consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Medical tests showed that he has been steadily improved since
then but on September 29 he developed jaundice, a condition which
has been described as normal by doctors treating him.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa confirmed at an emergency news conference in the State
House last Sunday that Nyerere is suffering from chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, or blood cancer.
</P>
<P>
Since Mkapa's confirmation, many Tanzanians have answered his
call to pray for the recovery of their Father of the Nation.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister for Regional Administration and Local
Governments Kingunge Ngombale-Mwiru Tuesday was dispatched to
London to join Nyerere's wife and two daughters to monitor his
condition.
</P>
<P>
Born in the town of Butiama, Tanganyika in 1922, Nyerere led
the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) to win independence
from British colonial rule in 1961.
</P>
<P>
He also united Tanganyika and Zanzibar as one republic in 1964
and became its first president until he retired in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who preferred to be called Mwalimu in Kiswahili or
teacher in English, has been a prominent leader on many
pan-African issues.
</P>
<P>
He has successfully assembled the warring factions of Burundi
to start a tortuous peace process.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Newspapers Praise China's Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese Communist Party's
daily and the Vietnamese Army's daily Friday praised China's great
achievements in their editorials marking the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The party's daily Nhan Dan (People) said that the achievements
China gained over the past half century have testified to the
appropriate path chosen by the Chinese people for building
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The handover of Hong Kong and the scheduled return of Macau to
China later this year prove an irreversible trend and desire on
the part of the Chinese people to fulfill the national
reunification, said Nhan Dan's editorial titled "Celebrate the
Great National Day of Fraternal Chinese People."
</P>
<P>
The paper affirmed that the Communist Party, the State and the
people of Vietnam support that legitimate desire and hold that
there is only one China, with Taiwan being it's inseparable part.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper highlights the time-honored Sino-Vietnamese
friendship as neighbors with common mountains and rivers.
</P>
<P>
In celebration of the glorious historical day of the fraternal
people of all nationalities in China, the Vietnamese people, once
again, express their sincere and profound gratitude towards the
Chinese people for their strong support and valuable assistance to
Vietnam in the past struggle for national liberation as well as in
the on-going process of renovation, industrialization and
modernization for the goal of a rich people, a strong country and
a just and civilized society, said the Nhan Dan.
</P>
<P>
The friendship and cooperation between the parties and states
of Vietnam and China have seen encouraging steps of development in
many fields in recent years, said the editorial, adding that the
two peoples are doing their utmost to develop the fraternal
friendship and multi-form cooperation in the next century.
</P>
<P>
On this occasion, Quan Doi Nhan Dan (People's Army) daily on
Friday also carried an editorial titled "The Glorious
Semicentennial of the People's Republic of China," describing the
great success of China's revolution, the birth of the People's
Republic of China and the great achievements of the Communist
Party, the Government and the people of China over the past half
century as one of the most outstanding events in the 20th century.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Anniversary Parade Ushers in New Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of colorful
balloons and homing pigeons flew up to the sky. More than 100,000
children surged toward Tian'anmen or the Gate of Heavenly Peace,
capering and cheering to the Chinese leaders on the Tian'anmen
Rostrum, who waved to them in acknowledgement energetically from
time to time.
</P>
<P>
This scene brought the celebrations for the 50th founding
anniversary of new China to a climax when it came to an end at
around 12:00 at noon.
</P>
<P>
About 500,000 armymen and civilians took part in the grand
celebrations today. The youngest participator is Zhang Wenzhe, a
two-year-old kid. The girl got restless in the parade and kept
looking around from her father's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
Liu Baoqin, 70, strode past the Tian'anmen Square, drawing
himself up as he did 50 years ago in the parade marking the birth
of new China.
</P>
<P>
"My stamina and patriotism are enough to put me through all the
parade process." Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The anniversary paraders represented people of various
backgrounds, ranging from civil servants, religious people,
workers to scientists. Most are eager to tell the reporters how
honored they feel to join the last anniversary parade of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Some paraders said they feel a bit nervous because of the
unusual significance of the celebrations. "A total of 1,000 people
have to hold aloft a huge National Flag. We have to do this very
cautiously because it will be such a shame if a ripple appears on
the flag," Liu Yawei, an armed police officer, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The civilian parade was held right after the military parade.
Although it lasted only about 50 minutes, it represented the five-
decade course of the People's Republic and its promising future.
Featuring a long queue of floats, a myriad of banners, and
formation after formation of dancing and singing paraders, the
procession ended with a float modeled after a manned spacecraft
ready for take-off, which represents the real destination of the
paraders in the future.
</P>
<P>
Portraits of Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin
appeared in the parade, who are the respective cores of the three
generations of China's central collective leadership. The Chinese
Communist Party was founded in 1921.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Not to Be Harmed by Japan Nuclear Fallout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will be spared
from any radiation as a result of nuclear disaster in Japan,
because of the weak northeasterly monsoon prevailing at this time
of the year, an expert said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guillermo Dulay, chief of the Philippine Atmospheric,
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) was
quoted by the Philippine News Agency as saying that the
probability that the nuclear fallout from Japan will reach the
Philippines is nil.
</P>
<P>
It was reported there were a number of recorded deaths in the
incident in Tokai, Japan, Thursday and about 300,000 people near
the disaster area were advised to stay indoors.
</P>
<P>
"The probability that the fallout will reach the Philippines is
low, because of the weak northeasterly winds at this time," Dulay
said.
</P>
<P>
Dulay said the coming of a typhoon would further reduce the
risk that radioactive elements will hit the Philippines.

</P>
<P>
A float in front carrying Jiang Zemin's picture was flocked by
5,000 representatives of 56 ethnic groups in the country. I also

Following the floats of portraits are farmers, fashion models,
ballet dancers, private entrepreneurs, and intellectuals. Although
their experiences have been so different during the past 50 years,
now they are marching together to the same goal of turning China
into a democratic, prosperous, and strong socialist country with a
high level of civilization.
</P>
<P>
Some touches of vivacity were added to the usually solemn
anniversary parade this year: cartoons of fruits and domestic
animals and poultry were used to show the joy and happiness of the
people for a better life; groups of children roller-skaters also
appeared in the parade.
</P>
<P>
A 1,200-member military band played the latest popular music on
the square, to accompany the marching of the paraders.
</P>
<P>
Viewers were busy posing for pictures, taking the marching
paraders as the backdrop.
</P>
<P>
Added to the spectacle of the parade was a group of local
floats, representing the 31 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions, and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions.
</P>
<P>
Perfect orderliness continues to be a prominent characteristic
of the anniversary parade, which is obviously seen from the

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen Friday called for more commitment from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries in the
East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
If "the instability and terror" that took place in East Timor
go unaddressed, it will have the potential for having a very large
consequences that go beyond East Timor itself," Cohen said at a
press conference held here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"So I think ASEAN countries should take a reasonable response
to trying to bring peace and stability (to East Timor) in the
situation," Cohen said at the press conference after meeting Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Thai Supreme Commander Mongkon
Ampornpisit earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries, all of which Cohen believed have interests in
the peace and stability in East Timor, will have to decide for
themselves what contribution they will make to the peacekeeping
mission in terms of troops and financial contributions, the U.S.
Defense Secretary said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said that he has pointed out to the Indonesian
government that the international community is watching closely
what role Indonesia will play in the East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
"It's beneficial to Indonesia to play a constructive and
positive role in bringing peace and stability to East Timor," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for disarmament of pro-Indonesian militia both
in East and West Timor.
</P>
<P>
As for Thailand, Cohen said the country is playing a leading
role by sending some 1,500 military personnel to the United
Nations peacekeeping force in East Timor (INTERFET).
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Major General Songkitti Chakkabart has been
appointed Deputy Commander of INTERFET.
</P>

<P>
LUSAKA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian official has accused
multinational companies of flouting his country's trade mark laws
by transferring their trade marks without providing necessary
technology to local agents.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Registrar of the Patents and Companies, Wilbroad
Mulenga, urged the government to enact measures to protect local
companies against business malpractices of the multinational
companies in the use of trade marks, according Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The official was quoted as saying that a recent study shows
that the multinational companies are terminating trade mark
contracts at will when the local companies pay huge royalties.
</P>
<P>
"We feel Zambian companies need more protection against abusive
 tendencies by multinationals and government has the means to
apply pressure to force them to abide through the enactment of
stiffer laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said few companies know the use of the patent office and
attributed this to lack of information.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of commerce, trade and industry has recently
constituted a committee that will spearhead the speedy compliance
of provision, Mulenga said.

BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- In the National Day processions,
one float has a huge number one.
</P>
<P>
It means that China's fifty-year growth has made it the world's
largest steel producer. Its output last year was 114 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China has complete steel production system and 10 key steel
enterprises that account for 50 percent of the country's steel.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 to 1998, fixed assets spending in the steel industry
totaled 478.7 billion yuan. During that period, the sector had 553
billion yuan in pre-tax profits. But, in the early 1950s, China
could only produce 100 types of low-grade rolled steel and had an
annual steel output of 158,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
To improve the quality of steel and efficiency in the sector
this year, China decided to cut steel production by 10 percent and
it will push for the renovation of older enterprises, develop hi-
tech value-added products, and improve the proportion of high-
quality steel to make China a real iron and steel power.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Cut 60,000 Jobs in Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- About 60,000 civil servants will
be sacked between next year and the year 2001, a senior Kenyan
official has announced.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard daily Friday quoted Permanent
Secretary of the Presidential Office Zachayo Cheruiyot as saying
that the move would help cut expenditure and improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Ministries, provinces and districts have been directed to
establish civil service reform committees, performance
improvement teams and payroll audit units, Cheruiyot said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said such organizations would identify the posts that need
to be abolished, privatized, commercialized, contracted or
transferred elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Cheruiyot revealed that Kenya had sacked 44,000 public servants
between 1992 and 1998 but failed to reduce government
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government aimed to reduce staff by 30 percent
and consequently cut expenditure 20 percent by 2001.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment is part of the economic recovery plan
initiated by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi. Kenya has
witnessed a recession in the last several years.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN, CER to Explore Common Free Trade Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and the countries of the Australia-New Zealand
Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER) have agreed to
into the feasibility of establishing an AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade
AREA)-CER free trade area by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on establishing a high-level joint task force for
this purpose was reached at the Fourth Informal Consultation
meeting between ASEAN economic ministers and ministers from the
CER countries.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held at the end of the consultation
meeting, Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo said
the ministers unanimously nominated Cesar Virata, former prime
minister of the Philippines as the leader of the task force.
</P>
<P>
A press statement released after the consultation meeting said
this proposed free trade area should be WTO-consistent and the
study would examine the potential of an AFTA-CER free trade area
and the adjustments required, including the flexibility needed by
the four new members of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the study will be completed within
12 months and will be submitted to the 32nd ASEAN Economic
Ministers (AEM) meeting for consideration in October 2000 in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said statistics show that ASEAN's exports to
the CER increased by 16.6 percent to 9.7 billion U.S. dollars in
1998 from 8.3 billion U.S. dollars while imports from the CER fell
24.4 percent from 9.3 billion U.S. dollars to 6.7 billion U.S.
dollars in the year.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the proportion of ASEAN trade
with CER increased to 2.8 percent of the total in 1998 from 2.5
percent in 1997. ASEAN's previous trade deficit with the CER of
960.7 million U.S. dollars turned into a surplus of 2.98 billion
U.S. dollars in 1998.

BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A large number of young people
dressed in flowery garments accompanying a float with the image of
a globe are part of the National Day procession.
</P>
<P>
They reflects the love of the Chinese people for the globe and
their attempts to protect the environment and contribute to
mankind.  The Chinese government has paid a great deal of
attention to environmental issues arising from population growth
and economic development, and has made protecting the environment
an important part of the improvement of the standard of living and
quality of life.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 30 administrative decrees on environmental
protection and had 500 water pollution control projects for a
number of major coastal cities and lakes during the Ninth Five-
Year Plan (1996-2000), which called for 56 billion yuan in
spending.
</P>
<P>
China spent more than 80 billion yuan (about 9.6 billion U.S.
dollars) last year on the environment, more than one percent of
the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, the Chinese government has had large-scale
tree planting and in the past 20 years there has been an annual
increase of four million hectares of afforested land, with 2.4
billion trees planted by volunteers each year. China has preserved
34.3 million ha. of afforested land.
</P>
<P>
China plans to cut the amount of sulfur dioxide emissions by 14
percent before the end of 2000 and 42 percent by 2010. A plan has
been drawn up to control acid rain and sulfur dioxide in 11.4
percent of the country, in 175 prefectures and cities, mostly in
the southern and central parts of the country.

China has built three launch sites and a global satellite
telemetering and tracking network. This satellite technology has
brought tremendous social and economic benefits to industry,
agriculture, communications, finance, and other areas.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt Urged to Cut Expenditure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries has urged the government to make drastic cuts on its
non-essential expenditure as the financial situation of the
country continues to worsen.
</P>
<P>
A solution must be found for the crippling debt which has
reached some 3. 47 billion U.S. dollars, president of the
confederation Kumbirai Katsande said in Harare Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's foreign debt stands at 2.37 billion dollars) while
the domestic at 1.1 billion dollars, according to the industrial
leader.
</P>
<P>
"The increase of debt is a result of an inequitable balance
between expenditure and revenue," the Herald newspaper Friday
quoted Katsande as saying.
</P>
<P>
"A major rethink, a culture of change on such things as the
size of government itself is called for," he said.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming recent statements by President Robert Mugabe
reaffirming his government's commitment to economic reform,
Katsande said such commitment needed to be speedily translated
into resolute actions by all arms of the government.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in a most desperate situation and the government
must at last make and implement the unavoidable decisions," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the government to be decisive in dealing with
inflation which clearly cannot be allowed to continue to increase.
 The longer government delays to act, the more difficult, if not
hopeless, our situation becomes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation rate in August this year
reached 68.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Non-Public Sector Helping China's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The National Day processions has
a float with a rainbow, flying seagulls, colored ribbon, and
breaking waves.
</P>
<P>
The rainbow stands for China's rapid economic development of
various forms of ownership. The seagulls reflect non-public
enterprises, while the colored ribbon symbolizes the free
operation of that sector, which has become an important part of
China's socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
The government is encouraging the participation of such
essential factors of production as capital and technology.
</P>
<P>
The non-public sector includes not only private businesses, but
also collectively-owned enterprises and joint stock companies
without State capital. By the end of last year, China had 699
million people employed in the sector, a 3.57 million increase
from 1997. The urban private sector accounted for 32.32 million
people, an increase of 5.63 million from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
These figures indicate that the non-public sector is assuming
an increasingly important role in providing employment in China at
a time when the State-owned sector, which is undergoing profound
reforms, can no longer provide so many job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Almost half of China's annual tax revenues now comes from the
non-public sector, the main growth area for tax revenues. The
private sector maintained its momentum this year. The State
Administration for Industry and Commerce reports that China had 67,
100 new private companies during the January-March period this
year, with an average registered capital of 616,500 yuan for each.
</P>
<P>
China re-defined the status and role of the private sector in
March of this year by adding the non-public sector as "an
important component of the country's socialist market economy" to
its Constitution. This has given a strong boost to the private
sector.

time around,
</P>
<P>
the treaty would be finally signed despite the rifts touching on
custom union visa a vis common market, saying there would be no
more negotiations on the subject.

followed with the establishment of a common market," the
secretariat boss said, adding that the common market is at a more
advanced stage of the regional integration
</P>

attended the two-day meeting, said the main issue of discussion
was the adoption of the proposed treaty with the aim to create a
big market for the region.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Reducing Service to Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has denied a United
Nations body's accusations that the government had unjustifiably
reduced its health care services to needy Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The Health Ministry is obliged to secure free health care for
needy Lebanese citizens. It helps needy Palestinians when it can,"
Health Minister Karam Karam said in an interview with the Voice of
Lebanon radio Friday.
</P>
<P>
His comments came in response to charges published in a report
by the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) responsible for
handling Palestinian refugee affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister explained that his "government is
suffering from a difficult economic crisis. The ministry can
barely cover the needs of Lebanese."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, scores of Palestinian refugees staged a sit-in in
the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp in the country's
southern port city of Sidon, the biggest among a total of 12 camps
across Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They wanted to send a message to representatives of donor
countries who are expected to gather in Amman, Jordan, to discuss
further financial contributions to UNRWA, according to sources at
the refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
After the Palestinian self-rule authority was created in 1993,
donor countries, mainly Western countries, cut their funding for
the agency, arguing the Palestinian refugee problem would soon be
solved.
</P>
<P>
The cuts, coupled with accused rampant corruption in UNRWA
ranks, have reduced the agency's ability to provide services to
some 2 million refugees still living in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan,
the West Bank and Gaza.

<HEADLINE> China's Information Industry Showing Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- One National Day float decorated
with a satellite, integrated circuits, large-screen terminals, and
a computer keyboard reflects China's information industry
development of the past 50 years and its role in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Information Industry has had especially rapid development
in recent years and has become an important part of the nation's
economy. Since 1994, China has given special support to research
and development in information technology for multi-media and
Internet uses and the market has attracted a number of foreign
companies, which fund or operate more than 6,500 enterprises in
China.
</P>
<P>
China has one of the world's leading information technology
industries, with sales reaching 310 billion yuan (37 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998, up 14.1 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sales of personal computers will reach 5.1 million in China
this year, up 25 percent from 1998. China's largest PC
manufacturer, the Legend Group, was one of the world's top 15
companies in this area in terms of market share in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has developed a framework for the
fledgling electronic commerce industry this year to help the
digital economy grow.
</P>
<P>
It has an extensive, high capacity, high speed optical fiber
network supported by satellites and microwave stations. The
optical fiber network is an estimated one million kilometers long
and reaches all provincial capitals and over 90 percent of China's
cities and counties. All provinces have satellite
telecommunications ground stations and more than 20,000 satellite
telecommunications lines.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka, U.S. Sign New Extradition Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka and the United States
Thursday signed a new extradition treaty, the first ever fully
comprehensive one signed by the tropical island country, the
Government's Information Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement that the treaty, replacing a
1931 treaty signed by Britain as the colonial power, was signed by
Sri Lankan Minister of Foreign Affairs Lakshman Kadirgamar and
U.S. Acting Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in Washington.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Kadirgamar as saying the new treaty, which was
concluded early this year after a single round of talks, reflected
"current developments and advances in international state
practice, paying particularly attention to the problem of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the treaty would mean that if a member of
the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) tried to
hide in the United States after committing a crime, he or she
could be sent back to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The need for a new extradition treaty between the two countries
was first raised by Kadirgamar during his official visit to
Washington in October 1997 as some provisions under the old one
were outdated and clumsy.
</P>
<P>
Talbott said, "The joint interest... in combating the scourge
of international crime and particularly the ever present threat of
terrorism is another reason for this to be a very timely
occasion."
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, fighting for an independent Tamil homeland in Sri
Lanka's north and east since 1983, has been designated by the U.S.
State Department as a terrorist organization and was banned at
home as well as in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Launches New Primary Education Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo has launched an "ambitious and costly" new education
scheme for teenagers as part of a government initiative to revive
the country's crumbling education system.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the universal basic education (UBE) program, the new
scheme is designed to provide "compulsory, free and universal
education for teens between the ages of six and 15," the president
said in Sokoto, northeast Nigeria, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new scheme would help "restore interest and dignity in
learning and scholarship" after years of decline in primary school
enrolment," information reaching here Friday quoted Obasanjo as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The president said the scheme would also incorporate a program
for " producing trained teachers, a comprehensive adult literacy
program and be adequately funded."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Education Minister Tunde Adeniran said that the new
scheme would replace the previous universal primary education
program (UPE), launched by Obasanjo as military leader in 1976.
With the scheme in operation, education would be compulsory for
the first nine years of education.
</P>
<P>
The old scheme was abandoned as "unsustainable" by subsequent
governments because of an explosion in the number of school age
children, the lack of funding, dearth of teachers and the decay in
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The new scheme was "ambitious and expensive," Obasanjo said,
adding that the cost would be borne by "everybody" as a
"legitimate investment in the children to enable them to cope with
the challenges of the future."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's education system ran into crisis in the past 15 years
of military rule, which ended in May this year, when a combination
of poor funding and staffing and decay of infrastructure affected
the quality of graduates, creating a confidence crisis in the
education system.
</P>
<P>
When coming into power on May 29 this year, Obasanjo pledged to
address the malaise in this sector so as to provide a "solid
foundation for the country's development."

<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- One colorful float with the
slogan: "Promote the modernization of agriculture" can be seen in
the National Day procession today.
</P>
<P>
The boat-shaped float represents China's agricultural march
toward modernization. Its four colors -- blue, green, white, and
gold -- symbolize aquatic agriculture, organic products, high-tech
farming, and good harvests, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China's agricultural sector has had steady growth over the past
50 years and China has created a miracle by feeding 22 percent of
the world's population on 10 percent of its arable land.
</P>
<P>
In those 50 years since the e founding of new China, it has
increased grain output from 100 million tons in 1949 to 490
million tons in 1998, with an average annual increase of 8 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
China's cotton output was 4.4 million tons in 1998 and China
ranks first in the world in cereal grain, cotton, peanut, rape-
seed, and fruit output.
</P>
<P>
Its annual pork, mutton, and beef output totaled 40 million
tons in 1997, a 12-fold increase from the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
Its aquatic product output was up 8.5 percent to 39 million
tons last year and industry sources predict continued output
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
China planted 5.2 million ha. of trees last year to increase
the country's total forested area to 130 million ha. It is trying
to increase its forest coverage to 19 percent and its urban
vegetation to 35 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The average annual per capita net income of Chinese farmers
increased from 44 yuan in 1949 to 2,162 in 1998, a 48-fold
increase in 50 years.

BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 100,000 people from all
ethnic groups across China will gather at Tian'anmen Square in

000 people from all walks of life will stage a "very impressive"
group dance, he added.
</P>

soiree, the show will feature almost all best performing arts of
the Chinese nation, such as lion and dragon dancing, acrobatics,
Beijing opera, Yangge dancing and drum dances, and will run in
three parts with fireworks displays filling the intervals.
</P>
<P>
" A section of the Chang'an Avenue between the Tian'anmen
Square and the Rostrum will be the central performance zone," said

perform all the way."
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Tian'anmen Square, 10 other sites have been

Military analysts say that such additions showed the
development of China's armed forces and the strengthening of
China's military strength during the past five decades since the
founding of the People's Republic in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The marine corps, initiated in the early 1980s, are capable of

</P>
<P>
The army reserve was set up at the proposal of Deng Xiaoping,
architect of China's reform and opening in 1986, when China
announced its decision to reduce one million of its People's
Liberation Army (PLA) servicemen. China pledged to cut another 500,
000 from its muster roll last year and the military reserve are
being beefed up.
</P>

specially-trained, specially-armed, quick-action task force
targeted at special missions.
</P>
<P>
China's ground forces established their first anti-aircraft

<HEADLINE> Philippine Sectors Urged to Beat Y2K Bug Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Y2K Commission
Friday appealed to those concerned corporations and government
agencies to speed up the submission of their readiness disclosures
and beat the deadline.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here, Y2K Commission Executive Director Karim
Bangcola made the appeal in light of reports that only some 200
companies, including government agencies, have complied with the
Y2K requirements.
</P>
<P>
The commission is now closely monitoring the activities of
these companies, particularly the sensitive ones which might
create chaos in case a problem crops up in their computer systems
and disrupt the efficient service they provide to the public,
Bangcola said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the banking sector is already 100 percent
Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
According to Bangcola, important government agencies, such as
the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) and the Social
Security System (SSS), the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR,
Department of Finance, the Central Bank of the Philippines, are
also Y2K ready.
</P>
<P>
The official deadline for the Y2K compliance by some
corporations and government agencies was set on September 30,
while others have requested for extension up to the end of the
year.

<HEADLINE> Air Echelons Embraces Airmen of All Three Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The huge contingent of more than 100 aircraft that constitute
the 10 air echelons for the military parade today involve airmen
from the army, navy and air force, a composition that has never
appeared in the history of National Day military parade.
</P>
<P>
The scale of the air review is the largest in the history of
China's military parade, ranging from bombers, fighters, ground-
attack aircraft, to strike fighters of the navy air unit and
helicopters of the army air unit.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-made aerial refuel tank which makes debut today
attracts special attention. When a refuel tanker dragging a long
pipe flies over the square along with oil-receiving planes, no one
would cast suspicion over the marked improvement in long-range
combat capability of the Chinese air force.
</P>
<P>
Also unveiled is the "Fei Bao", or flying leopard which belongs
to the navy air unit. Despite a short flying performance during
the Aerospace Exposition last year, few have had the opportunity
to observe the aircraft, China's first generation of fighter-
bomber.
</P>
<P>
Made in China, the helicopter of the army air unit is the very
type used in the air unit of the People's Liberation Army
stationed in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Surplus Increases in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a 7.4
percent increase in its trade surplus in August this year over
that in the same month last year, the Statistics Department
announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in the month under review amounted to 6.66
billion ringgit (1.752 billion U.S. dollars) against 6.2 billion
ringgit (1.631 billion U.S. dollars) in the same month of last
year, according to the preliminary external trade statistics for
August released here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The August surplus was the 22nd consecutive monthly surplus
since November 1997 and was the second highest since December 1998
when a surplus of 6.7 billion ringgit (1.763 billion U.S. dollars)
was recorded.
</P>
<P>
A higher growth in exports of 2.8 billion ringgit (736.842
million U.S. dollars) to 27.1 billion ringgit (7.131 billion U.S.
dollars) against a growth of 2.3 billion ringgit (605.263 million
U.S. dollars) in imports to 20.4 billion ringgit (5.368 billion
U.S. dollars) led to the surplus for the month under review.
</P>
<P>
The higher exports were mainly driven by the 20.6 percent
increase in electrical and electronic products while import
growth was due to a growth of 16.2 percent in the purchase of
intermediate goods, it said.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months of this year, Malaysia's trade
surplus rose 42.2 percent to 46.2 billion ringgit (11.105 billion
U.S. dollars) from 32.5 billion ringgit (8.552 billion U.S.
dollars) in the corresponding period of last year, the statistics
department said.
</P>
<P>
The higher surplus in the first eight months of this year was
largely due to the higher growth in exports, the department said.

<P>
YANGON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Associations of Overseas Chinese
and Chinese-Myanmar residing in Myanmar's capital of Yangon
jointly held a grand meeting here Friday to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Lu Zhenbin, deputy director-general of the Overseas Chinese
Chamber of Commerce, said in his speech that China underwent an
earth-shaking change in 50 years since its founding, especially in
20 years since its reform and opening of its doors to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who is also chairman of the Fujian Native Association,
stressed that during the period, China's economy grew at a fast
pace with the society developing all-sidedly, people's living
standard continuously improving and the comprehensive national
strength continuing to grow.
</P>
<P>
The broad masses of the overseas Chinese in Myanmar take this
as their pride, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of China's reunification, Lu said, "Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China and this will always remain a
unchangeable fact. Chinese all over the world strongly anticipate
an early reunification of their motherland."
</P>
<P>
He warned that Lee Teng-hui's "two-country concept" is doomed
to fail, adding that Lee himself will lose his standing and
reputation and will become a culprit of history.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Chinese Ambassador Liang Dong said in half a
century, China has turned from a backward old China to a basically
prosperous new China full of vigor and hope.
</P>
<P>
He added that "we have every reason to believe that in the
forthcoming new century, Chinese nationalities are sure to
overcome the difficulties and obstacles in the course of advance,
and would contribute its part to world peace and development with
its more brilliant achievements."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting were also Wang Yueying, vice-chairman
of the Overseas Chinese Women's Association, and Chen Wanchang,
chairman of the Overseas Chinese Arts and Culture Association.
</P>
<P>
Present on the occasion were nearly 300 representatives of
different associations of overseas Chinese and Chinese-Myanmar in
Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, different associations of overseas Chinese and
Chinese-Myanmar will stage grand arts and cultural performances
here on Sunday in celebration of the Chinese National Day with
varied programs in praise of New China.

<HEADLINE> Fiscal Deficit Rises 26 Percent in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The fiscal deficit rose by 26
percent to 481.26 billion rupees (11.19 billion U.S. dollars) in
the first five months (April-August) of 1999-2000 fiscal year as
against 381.49 billion rupees (8.87 billion U.S. dollars) in the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Finance Ministry, the government has pegged
the fiscal target for 1999-2000 fiscal at 799.95 billion rupees
(18.60 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was only 7 percent higher than the 747.37 billion rupees
(17.38 billion U.S. dollars) reported in the revised estimates for
1998-1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The higher fiscal deficit was caused by continued sluggishness
of revenue receipts to the Exchequer, which failed to contain the
spurt in expenditure witnessed right through the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The government's total expenditure in the first five months of
the current fiscal year shot up nearly 17 percent to 1,017.54
billion rupees (23.66 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, net revenue receipts rose only by 9 percent to 506.11
billion rupees (11.77 billion U.S. dollars).

<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has been
saturated with a festive mood, though a grand ceremony to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China has just ended.
</P>
<P>
The grand military and civilian parade has impressed the
Beijing residents very much and they can not help talking about it
with whoever and whenever and wherever they meet.
</P>
<P>
"I saw all the weapons in the parade and feel very much
encouraged," said Ms. Li Xiulian who lives in the Dongcheng
District of Beijing, "Our country is now really powerful and the
life of the Chinese people has improved remarkably."
</P>
<P>
Shoppers watched the parade on TV in department stores,
shopping malls and supermarkets, which still open today. "Just
look at the new products and achievements we have made, very
exciting!" said one shopper who gave only his surname Liu.
</P>
<P>
He added that beginning this year, we have three days more for
the holidays and this also shows the growth of the country's
economy and the improvement of our life quality."
</P>

At the Beijing Railway Station, passengers were watching the

so happy to see so many state-of-the-art weapons China now is able

<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- In the accompaniment of the tune
"Good Life", a folk song, Beijing residents today joined the
parade in a square formation, moving past the Tian'anmen Square to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
They included a couple in their 60s who could hardly conceal
their excitement while talking to Xinhua. "It's been a dream all
our lives to take part in the 50th anniversary celebrations," the
woman, Sun Yunyou, said.
</P>
<P>
Sun broke her leg this March, but recovered with the help of
her husband, Peng Junzhou, who is a doctor. In the past they would
have been too busy to join such activities, but this time they
were able to get free.
</P>
<P>
The couple became involved in the Communist Party-led
revolutionary activities at a young age and shared a profound love
for new China. In 1949, when the People's Republic was founded,
they went to Dalian separately to look for work.
</P>
<P>
In Dalian, people were dancing to the music of folk songs to
celebrate the founding of the People's Republic. "It was like
someone catching sight of the brightness after a long journey in
the darkness," Peng recalls, "dancing and singing with incredible
delight."
</P>
<P>
In Dalian, they met, fell in love, got married, and eventually
had three daughters.
</P>
<P>
They are natives of Beijing and returned to the capital in the
mid-1980s after retirement and they are now leading a happy life.
She spends her time singing, painting, and reading, and he loves
swimming, listening to music, and collecting odd stones. They are
both members of a local choir group for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
Travel has become another hobby of theirs and they say that it
is making up for missed lessons. They have visited Sichuan and
Yunnan provinces and the city of Shenzhen, not to mention one
foreign country -- Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"We have spent our best years together in the motherland," Peng
says, "We can work for the motherland for another 20 years, even
if we are becoming older."

<HEADLINE> Veteran Soldier Cherishes Memory of New China's Founding Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- At the age of 70, Liu Baoqin
retained his bearing of a soldier in the National Day parade here
today, as a member of a square formation of local residents in the
Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago he was a soldier and had taken part in the
parade to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China
(PRC), as one of the military paraders.
</P>
<P>
"I was standing in front of the Tian'anmen Rostrum and the
Tian'anmen Square was a sea of people," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
The founding ceremony started at 3:00 pm, on October 1, 1949. "
I could not see what happened on the rostrum as I was standing
with my back against it, but I tried hard to listen," he said.
</P>
<P>
When Chairman Mao Zedong declared the founding of the PRC, the
crowds began to shout, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the
Communist Party of China (CPC)!", Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"The people's government is hard-won and numerous martyrs had
sacrificed their lives for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu joined the Eighth Route Army, a CPC-led anti-Japanese armed
force, at 15 and since 1949, he worked as a bodyguard for central
leaders. He has retired from the local housing management bureau
in the city's Dongcheng District and has a big family of 14,
including his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
When Liu applied to participate in this year's parader, someone
doubted his ability to walk a long way in the procession.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in good health," he said, "I must take part in this year's
National Day parade, it is a rare chance for me now."
</P>
<P>
"I represent 190 million aged people in China," he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the People's Republic of China, especially the
reform and opening drive, have brought about great changes in the
country, he said, adding, "The people's life is improving day by
day."

<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese give great priority to
wedding by holding grand banquets or more luxury activities, but
some newly-weds have made another option by taking part in the
National Day parade.
</P>
<P>
Among today's civilian paraders marching past the Tian'anmen
Rostrum on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic, there were dozens of newly-married couples
who formed an individual square formation.
</P>
<P>
The young couples walked to the strain of a well-known Chinese
music piece "Good Life", hand in hand and shoulder to shoulder.
</P>
<P>
The couple leading the formation were Wu Yang, the bridegroom,
and his bride Wang Hongmei, who both work for the Beijing Hepingli
Hospital. They got married on September 9.
</P>
<P>
The group of newly-weds was formed last month. Since then, they
received extensive training and joined in three large-scale
rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yang told Xinhua that it is of great significance for them
to participate in the National Day parade as part of their wedding
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Chinese Woman Joins In National Day Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Jia Xiulin, 71, joined today's
hundreds of thousands of paraders marching past Beijing's
Tian'anmen Rostrum on National Day and she is perhaps the most
experienced parader.
</P>
<P>
Jia has taken part in the National Day celebrations for 12
years in the past five decades. "I'm strong enough to beat my
granddaughter in a long walk," she said, crediting the army for
her phenomenal walking ability. During the war, she sometimes had
to walk all night for 120 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
However, her participation in the original ceremony was just a
matter of luck. On October 1, 1949, Jia and her husband, who lived
in the neighboring Hebei Province, were headed elsewhere via
Beijing, but they were taken to Tian'anmen Square by friends, not
knowing that there would be a large ceremony for the founding of
the People's Republic of China. Telecommunications were not so
great in those days, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
It was too late to join the parade but they did hear Chairman
Mao Zedong announcing the founding of the People's Republic. They
were so excited hearing Mao's voice for the first time, she said,
because they had fought bloody battles for that day.
</P>
<P>
This year, Jia did well in the training and rehearsals for the
parade, in fact, the entire team of elderly surprised other people
this year, according to the organizers.
</P>
<P>
"I'll let you in on a secret," Jia said confidentially, "I
climbed mountains several times before this parade."

<HEADLINE> Japan Manages to Halt Nuclear Chain Reaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A nuclear chain reaction was
averted at a uranium processing plant in Tokaimura, Ibaraki
Prefecture, after a major nuclear accident occurred there Thursday,
Japanese government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government's task force said the neutron monitor at the
plant site registered zero as of 6:15 a.m., signifying that a
chain reaction had been prevented.
</P>
<P>
The volume of neutrons being emitted at 4 a.m. was 0.7
millisievert per hour, about one-fifth that observed at midnight
Thursday, the Science and Technology agency said.
</P>
<P>
Instructions to evacuate remained in effect within a radius of
350 meters around the plant Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
High levels of radiation leaked from the uranium processing
plant at around 10:35 a.m. Thursday. Three workers were exposed to
the radiation, two of them were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The victims were all employees of Tokyo-based JCO Co.,
previously called Japan Nuclear Fuel Conversion Co., which runs
the facility.
</P>
<P>
Employees of JCO Co. began removing water coolant at the plant
at 2:58 a.m. and later had to destroy the coolant-water pipes
because drainage valves were not functioning properly, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Just after 9 a.m., the workers began preparations to inject
boron chemicals, usually used in control rods in nuclear reactors,
into the facility in an attempt to control and restrain the
nuclear fission reaction.
</P>
<P>
Three firefighters, 16 JCO employees and seven people around
the plant were later confirmed to have been exposed, bringing the
total number of people affected to 36.
</P>
<P>
The leak, which was believed to be Japan's worst-ever nuclear
accident, prompted Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to
postpone a cabinet reshuffle, originally scheduled for Friday, to
deal with the crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 500,000 elated armymen and
civilians held a grand military and civilian parade at the
Tian'anmen Square this morning to celebrate the 50th founding
anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The parade featured 90 floats and 38 square formations of
people of various backgrounds, 42 formations of troops and latest
weaponry including tanks, armored vehicles, missiles and a fly-
over display of 132 warplanes.
</P>
<P>
China's top leader Jiang Zemin and other senior Chinese Party
and State leaders reviewed the 2-hour parade from the Tian'anmen
Rostrum where the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong proclaimed the
birth of new China on October 1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
At about 10:00, the celebrations began with a 50-gun salute,
followed by the playing of the national anthem by a 1,200-member
military band and the raising of the five-star national flag on
Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
To the strains of a military music piece played by the brass
band, Chairman Jiang Zemin of the Central Military Commission
started reviewing the troops in square formations which extend
about three kilometers. After that he delivered an important
speech on the Tian'anmen Rostrum.
</P>
<P>
From the mid-19th century to mid-20th century, the Chinese
people fought bloody battles for 100 years and finally won the
national independence and people's liberation, thus changing their
destiny once and for all, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"From the middle of this century to that of the next, the
Chinese people, with hard and enterprising work of 100 years, will
by and large bring about socialist modernization. The Chinese
nation will stand rock-firm in the family of nations," the Chinese
leader said.
</P>
<P>
"The complete reunification of the motherland and the
maintenance of its security are the very foundation for the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the unshakable will of all
the Chinese people," he stressed.

A rumbling roar broke out on the square when one after another
square formations of troops of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army, armed police, local armed forces and militia marched past
the Tian'anmen Rostrum, followed by columns of tanks, infantry
fighting vehicles and self-propelled guns. After that was a fly-
over display, featuring 132 warplanes roaring over the sky.
</P>
<P>
Holding their breath, the celebration participants watched the
spectacular scene in silence and burst into thunderous applauses
from time to time. This military parade is claimed to have
displayed the latest and the most advanced weaponry of the country,
and long-range ground-to-ground missiles and aerial tanker also
made their debut in today's parade.
</P>
<P>
Teams of singing and dancing civilian paraders, accompanied by
various music pieces played the military band, marched past the
Tian'anmen Rostrum, holding high huge banners expressing their
support for the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Lines of colorful floats showing China's economic achievements
and social progress during the last five decades added to the
spectacle of the parade.
</P>
<P>
Workers from the State-owned enterprises led the formations of
paraders and shouted their support to continued reforms.
Representatives from non-public sectors, an "important component
of socialist market economy", also took part in the parade.
</P>
<P>
The common aspiration for an early reunification of the
motherland was highlighted in the parade. "The issue of Taiwan can
not be delayed indefinitely," the banner on the float featuring
Taiwan scenery drew enthusiastic applauses from the spectators.
</P>
<P>
At the rear of the parade, a float with a model of a manned
spacecraft glided past the square, expressing the idea that China
has entered a countdown for the take-off in the 21st century. The
children on the square formed a new background pattern of Chinese
characters at that moment, which reads: "peace, and development."
</P>
<P>
By noon, tens of thousands of colorful balloons and white
homing pigeons were released into the sky, and over 10,000
cheering children on the square surged toward the Golden Water
Bridge right below the Tian'anmen Rostrum, pushing the
celebrations to a climax.

developed into a major force in defending the national sovereignty
and maintaining world peace.
</P>

<P>
JAKARTA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- New members of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), Indonesia's highest decision-making
body, were sworn in here on Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The 700 members of the MPR comprise 462 House of
Representatives (DPR) members elected in the June 7 polls, 38
representatives of the Indonesian Military and National Police,
135 regional representatives and 65 representatives of various
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
However, not all the 700 members turned up for the induction
ceremony. General Elections Commission Secretary Samad Thahir said
a number of regional representatives from East Timor, Aceh and
Southeast Sulawesi and other provinces missed the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The oath-taking was led by Chief Justice Sarwata and witnessed
by President B.J. Habibie.
</P>

occupying their posts within and near the MPR/DPR building.
Hundreds of military tents have been set up in several areas in
the vicinity of the building.
</P>
<P>
The General Session of MPR consists of two phases. Following
the oath taking ceremony, the new members will form a working
group and factions, deliberate on outlining the state's broad
guidelines (GBHN) and amending the constitution, and then
determine the specific dates for the next phase, which will
include electing a new president and endorsing the national
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
The current schedule puts the presidential election in
November. However, most major political parties have demanded that
the MPR session be held ahead of the original schedule in order to
end the present uncertainty.

" from the past definition of being "a complement to the socialist
public economy".

The huge contingent of more than 100 aircraft that constitute
the 10 air echelons for the military parade today involve airmen
from the army, navy and air force, a composition that has never
appeared in the history of National Day military parade.
</P>

attack aircraft, to strike fighters of the navy air unit and
helicopters of the army air unit.

combat capability of the Chinese air force.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government to Set up Labor Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
working to form a bank for laborers, the Kathmandu Post quoted a
government official as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Labor Bal Bahadur K.C. said Thursday that the
government will set up the bank for laborers in partnership with
the foreign employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
"The government is preparing to from a Foreign Employment Bank
for the welfare of the laborers," said Bahadur K.C. "The bank will
grant loans at a low interest rate to the poor laborers who seek
foreign employment."
</P>
<P>
Bahadur also said the government is developing a new system to
make the licensing process for foreign employment easy and smooth
and to discourage incidents of swindling.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a steady decline in cases of swindling in the
foreign employment since the past few months because of the
government's new system," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister cited Foreign Employment Regulation 1999 which was
passed in the recently concluded 16th session of the House of
Representatives as an example of the government's commitment
towards solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
"If the provisions of the regulation are implemented
effectively, it will prevent people from being duped while seeking
foreign employment," he said.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the pressure of unemployment in the country, the
Nepali government encourages foreign employment of Nepalese
people. According to Labor Ministry, around 20,000 Nepalese are
working in the Gulf region, and 10,000 in Malaysia who entered the
country illegally.
</P>
<P>
Many Nepalese going abroad to seek fortune are cheated by
employment agencies because of lack of sound regulations and
ignorance of the people.

<HEADLINE> 2,000-Year-Old Bamboo Records Found In Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 bamboo strips that
were used before paper was invented and that have beautifully
written Chinese characters on them have been found in a Western
Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D. 24 ) tomb in China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The tomb is that of Wu Yang, a high-ranking official of
Yuanling Prefecture in the western part of the province. The
bamboo records are for household registration, taxes, historical
events, and imperial recipes, according to Hu Pingsheng, of the
Chinese Relics Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
He says that the household record is from an earlier period
than that found in Gansu Province's Dunhuang and Juyan early this
century, which was the first bamboo strip found in China.
</P>
<P>
The number of households, individuals, and weapons, the size of
fields, and the amount of taxes in Yuanling Prefecture in early
Western Han Dynasty is given in great detail, Hu says. Even the
roads and posthouses on the way to Chang'an, the capital of the
Western Han, in present-day Shaanxi Province, are recorded.
</P>
<P>
More can be discovered from the strips but it takes time and
money, Guo Weimin, an archeologist with the Hunan Relics Research
Institute, points out.
</P>
<P>
He says that a large number of bamboo strips found early this
century were smuggled out of the country. The largest find so far
has been in Changsha, Hunan's capital, in 1996, where some 170,000
records dating back to the Three Kingdoms (220-280) were unearthed.

and beating drums and blowing their trumpets, are marching past
the Tian'anmen Rostrum along with a float carrying a model torch,
symbolizing that the Chinese people are yearning for world peace.

the square formation of pupils, symbolizing the country's bright
future.

<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Now approaching the Tian'anmen
Rostrum are three floats expressing the strong aspiration for a
peaceful reunification of the motherland of the entire Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
On the three floats at the rear of the regional float group are
pictures of high-rises of Hong Kong, a countdown clock showing the
coming return of Macao to the motherland, and sculptures and
charts showing the natural scenery of Taiwan island.
</P>
<P>
The three floats express the complete success of the policy of
"one country, two systems" and the fact that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
The floats, thus depicting a returned Hong Kong, a returning
Macao and the Taiwan Island expected to return to the motherland,
speak out the common aspiration of the 1.2-odd billion Chinese
people for an early reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
The most conspicuous on the float of Macao is a count-down
clock, reminding people of the imminent return of Macao to the
embrace of the motherland after 400 years' Portuguese colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Taiwan can not be put off indefinitely," says a

NEW DELHI, October 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indian economy has shown
signs of recovery with gross national product (GDP) growing by 5.5
percent in the first quarter (April-June) of the 1999-2000 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Statistical Organization, year-on-year

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Many of Hong Kong newspapers
Friday carry stories and editorials to celebrate China's National
Day, hailing the great achievements China has made over the past
half century and looking into the country's bright future.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China, Ta Kung Po says that on the occasion
of celebration, China showed the whole world not only the
brilliant history of the past but also the bright future of the
nation in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po says in an article that over the past 50 years,
China's comprehensive national strength and the standards of
living of millions of Chinese have been greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper says that after bidding farewell to the history
of backwardness and semi-feudalism, China has entered a stage of
rejuvenating the great Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" concept is a feasible and
correct principle of fulfilling China's reunification, the
newspaper says, adding that Hong Kong's former social and economic
systems and its lifestyle all remain unchanged and the rights and
freedoms of Hong Kong people prescribed in the HK Special
Administrative Region Basic Law are fully guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
With the concerted efforts of the Chinese people at home and
overseas, the complete reunification of the motherland and the
overall invigoration of the Chinese nation will surely come true,
the newspaper says.
</P>
<P>
Other major newspapers in Hong Kong Friday also carry reports
to highlight the important event.

South China Morning Post says in a report that China has
changed beyond all recognition over the past half century. A
backward and semi-feudal nation has been transformed into the
world's fastest-growing economy, it says.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao daily also carries a piece marking China's National
Day, saying that China has made major achievements in the
development of its economy over the past 20 years since it
implemented the policy of reforms and opening up, and it will

<HEADLINE> Jimmy Carter: One-China Policy Must Be Carried on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter has reiterated the importance of the one-China policy
decided upon when Washington and Beijing established diplomatic
relations 20 years ago, hoping the stance will be carried on.
</P>
<P>
In a recent telephone interview with Xinhua, Carter said he
noticed that after Lee Teng-hui announced the "state-to-state
relations" with the Chinese mainland, the Clinton administration
reaffirmed its policy "on the fact that there is only one China
and Taiwan is a part of China."
</P>
<P>
This is "the same policy I enunciated 20 years ago," which has
since remained unchanged, added Carter, who saw the normalization
of the U.S.-China relationship during his term.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this (policy) will continue," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Carter believed that the U.S. and other nations
would do everything they can to protect the one-China principle
and avoid any conflict in that region.
</P>
<P>
The former president expressed the hope that Taiwan's leaders
would "never contradict the basic promise on which the American
and Chinese diplomatic relations are grounded."
</P>
<P>
Carter also voiced his hope that China would soon be admitted
into the World Trade Organization so that it could become "a much
more active player" in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. president said he is "optimistic" about the
future U.S.-China relations, because the people and leaders of the
two countries have come to see the greatest advantages if they
communicate, understand and cooperate with each other.
</P>
<P>
And the whole world would like to see the United States and
China stand side by side for global economic progress, world peace
and regional stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carter, who first came to China as a submarine serviceman in
the spring of 1949, said he found "remarkable changes in many ways
" when visiting China again in 1981 at the invitation of the then
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Carter traveled to China for the second time in July 1997 for
cooperation in improving elections in China's rural areas under
the China Village Elections Program sponsored by the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
"We got excited to observe elections in many of the villages,"
he said. "In some cases, it's a very successful experiment, and in
some cases there still needs some uniformity about the process,"
Carter commented.
</P>
<P>
Carter, whose birthday happens to fall on October 1, the
National Day of the People's Republic of China, said that the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once joked to him: "You are brought
together with China because we have the same birthday."
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud to associate my own celebration with that of
your country," Carter told Xinhua in the interview.

Sofia, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of
Bulgaria, Albania and Macedonia have expressed concern over the
delay in the implementation of the Stability Pact in the Balkans,
the finance ministry in Sofia said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
We are interested in the development of the region, and we are
concerned over the measures that have been taken after the war in
Kosovo, said the ministers, who are meeting in Washington, DC.
</P>
<P>
"The speed with which the Stability Pact is developing is not
satisfactory," said Macedonian Finance Minister Boris Stoimenov.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the three finance ministers agreed to draft a
joint report stating their countries' priority infrastructure
projects and the funds necessary for their implementation. The
final report will be approved at a special meeting in early
November in Sofia and sent to international institutions.
</P>
<P>
"We will invite the finance ministers of Romania, Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Croatia to join our initiative and take part in
the Sofia meeting," Bulgarian Finance Minister Muravei Radev said.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers met for the first time in Ohrid, Macedonia,
in July this year. They defined priorities where funds were
desperately needed, and they included transportation,
communications and the energy sector.

France in a work-study program in 1919.

years. In 1998, the city's had a GDP of 11.7 billion yuan (1.4

<P>
Fifty years ago today, Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed here to
the world the birth of New China. Hence the Chinese people stood
up and the Chinese nation entered a brand new era of development.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen years ago today, Comrade Deng Xiaoping declared here to
the world that the Chinese people would continue their march on
the road of reform and opening-up, and that China would stride
forward in building socialism, like a ship braving the wind and
waves, towards the glorious destination of modernization.
</P>
<P>
Arduous struggle and strenuous efforts of fifty years,
particularly the past twenty years since reform and the opening-up,
have brought about earth-shaking changes to the erstwhile poor and
weak old China. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the
hard-working, courageous and talented people of China have worked
wonders on this ancient Chinese land to the admiration of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Practice has fully proved that socialism is the only way to
save and develop China. It has also proved that building socialism
with Chinese characteristics is a broad road to economic
prosperity and all-round social progress in China.

<P>
Mankind now again stands at a critical juncture -- the turn of
the century and the dawn of a new millennium. It is a good moment
for the people to review the past journey and accomplishments and
look ahead into future development and prospects.
</P>
<P>
From the middle of the last century to that of this century, we
Chinese people fought with blood and life for 100 years and
finally attained national independence and liberation, thus
changing our own destiny once and for all. From the middle of this
century to that of the next, the Chinese people, with hard and
enterprising work of 100 years, will by and large bring about
socialist modernization. The Chinese nation will stand rock-firm
in the family of nations.
</P>
<P>
Our great motherland has traversed a course of five thousand
years. In this long history, the Chinese nation has, with its own
wisdom, ingenuity and outstanding creativeness, made indelible
contribution to world civilization. In the new millennium, it will
contribute even more to world civilization with splendid new
achievements.

We will continue to pursue the policy of "peaceful

</P>
<P>
We will continue to pursue the independent foreign policy of

other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence. The Chinese people will, as always, side with the
vast number of developing countries and the people throughout the
world, oppose hegemonism, promote global multipolarity, push for
the establishment of a just and equitable new international
political and economic order and work unremittingly for the lofty

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Five-Star Red Flag Flying Over China Forever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- A grand rally is being held in
the Chinese capital this morning to mark the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations began with a national flag-raising ceremony at
around 10 o'clock in Tian'anmen Square. Accompanied by a 50-gun
salute, 200 flag guards in olive green suits marched across a red
carpet stretching north of the platform of the Monument to the
Memory of the People's Heroes through the square.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese national anthem was playing as the five-star red
flag rose up the 30-meter flagpole, and has remained fluttering in
the gentle autumn breeze.
</P>
<P>
Han Ruqi, chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK), watched
the flag-raising ceremony from a reviewing stand adjacent to the
Tian'anmen Rostrum.
</P>
<P>
"The ideals of the Three People's Principles (nationalism,
democracy and the people's livelihood) put forward by Dr. Sun Yat-
sen have been materialized by the Chinese Communist Party members
and never before in history has China been so prosperous and
strong," he said.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing middle school student Qin Haiyan, who joined the
crowd at the square, said: "This is an exciting moment. Seeing the
hoisting of the national flag, I feel my sense of responsibility
to the motherland is also growing. A reunified and prosperous
China depends on our efforts and contributions."
</P>
<P>
Wu Qi, 69, an automation professor with the prestigious Qinghua
University, said: "With the implementation of the strategy of
vitalizing the country through science and education, I believe
China will achieve miracles and become one of the world's economic
powers in the next century."
</P>
<P>
Jackson Leung S.M., a Hong Kong businessman, said the raising
of the national flag made him feel proud. "A strong China will
play an important role in safeguarding world peace."
</P>
<P>
William Ho, brother of Edmund Ho Hau Wah, first chief executive-
designate of the future Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR),
said this was the first time he had watched the flag-raising at
Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
"I am counting the days before the arrival of December 20, when
Macao will be returned to China and pray for an early realization
of the reunification of the motherland," Ho added.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years ago, Mao Zedong, founder of the people's republic,
raised the first national flag of New China by pressing a button.
The five-star national flag of New China was raised for the first
time at the United Nations headquarters in 1971 and later at
numerous other international events.
</P>
<P>
The lifting and lowering of the national flag, which is done at
dawn and dusk every day in Beijing, was previously handled by two
civilians. In 1976, soldiers took over the task.
</P>
<P>
By now, well over three million people watch the national flag-
raising ceremony at Tian'anmen Square each year, said sources from
the Tian'anmen Administrative Committee.

The origin of the military parade -- a centuries-old ceremony
in China and many other countries -- can be traced back to ancient
China, ancient Egypt, Persia and Rome. Over 4,000 years ago, Yu,
chief of a Chinese tribe in northern China, hosted a gathering in
central China of tribes from southern China, during which soldiers
danced to music and songs to welcome the guests. This is the
earliest recorded military parade.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in the 18th century, lavish military processionals
became popular in western Europe. Now, the events are held to
honor major festivals and large-scale military maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
The PRC has conducted 13 National Day military parades since
its founding in 1949.

<P>
SANTIAGO, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Labor ministers from the
governments of Chile and Argentina signed an accord on Thursday
creating a social security system that assures equality of
treatment for Chileans and Argentineans living in each other's
countries.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral social security treaty was signed in 1996 to
replace an agreement signed in 1971, which benefited only those
individuals who contributed to the social security systems in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The present treaty will provide modifications within both
countries' social security systems.
</P>
<P>
The new accord, which will benefit 300,000 Chileans living in
Argentina (and Argentineans living in Chile), stipulates that the
two countries social security systems will recognize and honor
payments made into their systems by Chilean or Argentine workers.
</P>
<P>
Thus, people living and working in either Chile or Argentina
will be able to make the requisite payments in either country in
order to have access to old age, disability and survival pensions,
in addition to having access to health benefits.

MEXICO CITY, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Mexico City's subway
system ranks third in the world due in part to the number of daily
passengers and its size, second only to subway systems in Moscow

<P>
In Mexico, only the three most important cities have subway
systems: the capital, Guadalajara, in the west and Monterey,
located in the north.

<HEADLINE> Nepali King Praises China's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Nepalese people admire China's success in sustaining
growth, thereby improving the quality of life for her people in a
short span of time," said the king on the eve of Friday's 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra said he had visited China several times and the
visits "afforded me the opportunity to acquire firsthand knowledge
on the remarkable progress China has made in the economic and
social sectors."
</P>
<P>
He first visited China 11 years after diplomatic relations were
established between Nepal and China in 1955. Since then, besides
paying state visits in 1973 and 1993 and an official visit in 1987,
he has been to China on several other occasions.
</P>
<P>
The king, who has visited Tibet three times, said he is also
deeply impressed by the social and economic progress and
achievements in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China.
</P>
<P>
"During my visits in 1976, 1982 and 1996, I have seen the
impressive economic and social transformation made by Tibet," he
said.
</P>
<P>
King Birendra expressed his satisfaction with the cordial and
friendly relations between Nepal and China. He said that China has
remained an invaluable partner in Nepal's development endeavors.
</P>
<P>
"As close neighbors, the traditional bonds of friendship
existing between our two countries are based on mutual trust,
respect, goodwill and understanding of each other's aspirations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The king said Nepal attaches great importance to its relations
with China, as "the constant nurturing of our bilateral relations
is essential in the changing world scenario to ensure that cordial
ties existing between Nepal and China are further consolidated" in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He especially noted the economic and social contacts between
Nepal and Tibet, which are connected by the same mountains and
rivers.
</P>
<P>
"We feel Tibet's economic progress can supplement Nepal's
efforts at economic development," said the king. "There is scope
for further cooperation in various fields such as trade, tourism
and investment."
</P>
<P>
King Birendra conveyed his congratulations to the leaders,
government and people of China on the occasion of the 50th
anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
"The Nepalese people join me in wishing the Chinese people
continued happiness, peace and prosperity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Guenter Grass: Boehl Must Have Been Pleased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The German author Guenter
Grass said Thursday after being informed that he had won the 1999
Nobel Prize for Literature that he was always trying to succeed
the tradition of German literature.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his office in Luebecker, a harbor city in northern
Germany, Grass said, "Heinrich Boehl must have been pleased with
the choice. I have always tried to succeed his tradition."
</P>
<P>
Boehl, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972, was the
latest German writer to be recognized internationally. Following
him, Grass was the 11th German author to have won the prize since
1901 when the prize was founded.
</P>
<P>
Grass, 71, has achieved worldwide fame by his novels such as
"The Tin Drum," "The Cat And Mouse," and "The Dog Years."
</P>
<P>
"It (the Nobel prize) might help calm my nerves.... This prize
gave me great satisfaction," he said, referring to the fact that
he had been the candidate for the prize for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Born in Danzig (now named Gdansk in Poland), Grass began his
career in the city of Duesseldorf beside the Rhine River as a
student for sculpture.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s and 1960s, Grass lived in Paris where he made his
living as a writer and graphic artist. It was in these years that
Grass wrote "The Tin Drum," his most famous novel that depicted a
boy who refused to grow up.
</P>
<P>
An audacious spokesman for Germany's national affairs and a
supporter of the left-wing Social Democratic Party (SPD), Grass
regularly weighs in on German public debates. He stridently voiced
his opinion from reunification to citizenship laws.
</P>
<P>
German leaders, all Grass' friends in the SPD, congratulated
the writer with warm words.
</P>
<P>
"I am so pleased that my long-year friend, Guenter Grass,
really deserves the prizes," said German President Johannes Rau.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder also praised Grass in a
telegram, saying: "I think the prize was given to one of our
greatest writers in this century."
</P>
<P>
"No other German writers has achieved so much international
fame than this fantastic author from Danzig," said Michael
Naumann, German culture minister.
</P>
<P>
And in the German parliament, all the lawmakers, including
those of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
applauded for Grass.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
said Thursday that sales of new single-family homes unexpectedly
jumped 2.9 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 983,000 units, the second-highest level on record.
</P>
<P>
August's increase occurred despite rising mortgage rates and
surprised analysts expecting a decline. In July, 955,000 units
were sold, reflecting a sharp downward revision from the
department's previous estimate.
</P>
<P>
Sales were up in all parts of the country except the South. The
median price for a new home in August was 150,800 dollars, down
from 157,000 dollars in July. But the average home price hit a
record high of 198,300 last month.
</P>
<P>
Through August of this year, there were 659,000 houses sold
compared with 618,000 sold during the same period last year, the
department said.

Jeanette Antolin and Jamie Dantzscher.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jazz Re-Sign Free Guards Stockton And Hornacek </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The Utah Jazz Thursday re-
signed free agent guards John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
Stockton received a two-year deal worth 22 million U.S. dollars
and Hornacek signed a one-year, 5.2 million U.S. dollars contract.
The negotiations went smoothly since both players said they had no
intention of leaving Utah.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of faith has grown over the years with the Jazz," said
the 37-year-old Stockton at Thursday's news conference. "I really
had a restful summer, although I was unemployed all the time."
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Hornacek said: "We just figured out a fair
number and it takes about 20 minutes to do it when you're
realistic about things."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this offseason, the Jazz re-signed NBA Most Valuable
Player Karl Malone to a four-year, 67 million U.S. dollars
contract. However, the team did lose forward Shandon Anderson, who
signed a free agent contract with the Houston Rockets on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the aging nucleus of Malone, Stockton and Hornacek, the
Jazz will attempt to return to the NBA Finals after losing in the
second round of the playoffs to the Portland Trail Blazers last
year.
</P>
<P>
Utah won the Western Conference title in 1997 and 1998, but
lost in the Finals both years to the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Stockton is the NBA's all-time leader in assists and steals and
has been Utah's floor leader since the Jazz selected him in the
first round of the 1984 draft.
</P>
<P>
A nine-time All-Star, Stockton averaged 11.1 points and 7.5
rebounds during the lockout-shortened 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
Stockton's best season was 1989-90, when he averaged 17.2
points and a career-high 14.5 assists. He played in 609
consecutive games, third longest streak in league history, before
missing the beginning of last season with a knee injury and was co-
MVP with Malone at the 1993 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
Hornacek will be entering his sixth full season in Utah and is
coming off his least-productive campaign since averaging 9.5
points in his second year with the Phoenix Suns in 1987-88. He
battled through chronic knee problems and averaged 12.2 points, 4.
0 assists and 3.3 rebounds last season.
</P>
<P>
Hornacek is one of the league's top free throw and 3-point
shooters and was Utah's second-leading scorer for five straight
seasons after coming over in a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers
midway through the 1993-94 campaign.

<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Tian'anmen Square, the world's
largest urban square, looks even more magnificent and solemn today
as it awaits the grand celebrations marking the 50th anniversary
of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of potted flowers have turned the square into
a mammoth garden in the center of the Chinese capital. Meanwhile,
the whole city is decorated with millions of potted flowers. The
national flags can be seen all over the city.
</P>
<P>
Some 500,000 people, including servicemen and civilians, are
gathered at the square and its adjacent streets, waiting for the
exciting moment.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Southeast Asian Currencies Fall Again? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 1 (Xinhua) -- There has been seemingly a
contradictory phenomenon in Asia's foreign exchange markets in
recent weeks: While the Japanese yen has climbed to its 40-month
high to the greenback, Southeast Asian currencies dropped to their
lowest levels in six or 10 months.
</P>
<P>
As Southeast Asia's major trading partner and creditor, Japan's
currency strength always has a direct impact on other East Asian
currencies. In August last year, when the Japanese yen fell to 147
to the dollar, East Asian currencies all depreciated to their
lowest in years.
</P>
<P>
And when the yen started to rebound later last year, the
regional currencies also began to gain strengthen. In the first
half of this year, Southeast Asian currencies have gained around
10 to 50 percent, partly due to the faster-than-expected regional
economic recovery, and partly due to the strong yen.
</P>
<P>
But recently, the situation is quite different. when the yen
maintained its 106 level against the dollar Thursday, other East
Asian currencies remained weak.
</P>
<P>
The Thai baht plunged to a year low of around 41 against the
greenback Thursday, and the Philippine peso also closed near the
41 to the dollar level, the lowest in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Why did the regional currencies fail to respond to the yen's
upward trend?
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the slide in Southeast Asian currencies,
which started as early as in June, was caused mainly by different
domestic factors and problems within the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
For instance, they said, the baht's recent decline was blamed
on foreign currency purchase to fund Thai companies' repayment of
yen-denominated debt, due at the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the narrowing differential between
Philippine and U.S. interest rates has triggered dollar buying on
the spot market recently as investors shifted out of peso assets.
</P>
<P>
In addition to domestic factors, Southeast Asian countries'
currencies have been weakened by a problem at their doorstep --
the political situation in Indonesia rocked by unrest in Jakarta
and the East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"If the situation in Indonesia does not improve and the rupiah
falls through the 9,500 (level against the dollar) and extends its
weakness beyond 10,000, there will be a psychological negative
impact on the rest of the currencies," said Philip Wee, a regional
economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
As domestic issues are the major cause of weak currencies in
the region, the strong yen, which rose to 103 in mid-September to
the dollar, has not had any significant impact on them.
</P>
<P>
But as Southeast Asian nations are rivals in trade, one
currency's sharp fall will force other currencies in the region to
maintain their weakness in order to achieve competitiveness in the
regional and international markets.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, once one Southeast Asian country's currency
falls, other regional currencies will be dragged down.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, authorities in the region are not worried about
the sharp fall in their currencies, since almost all these
countries are trying to maintain export competitiveness with weak
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has recently shown themselves readier to
accept a weaker baht in the interest of trade competitiveness.
Thai Deputy Finance Minister Pisit Leeahtam said last Thursday
that the government was unconcerned at the prospect of baht
depreciation beyond 40 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The central banks have all stood aside and let the market take
the currencies weaker. They are not unhappy with the situation,"
said Vincent Low, a regional economist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, the central bank pushed for higher interest
rates to curb the peso's fall in the past. But now, despite the
peso's slide, the government said that it will cut further
interest rates to match levels in the United States and its Asian
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that since Southeast Asian countries have no plan
to intervene in foreign exchange markets, the regional currencies
are expected to maintain their weakness in the weeks ahead.

<HEADLINE> Parade to Review China's Achievements in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- China's achievements in the past
five decades will be demonstrated in today's grand military and
civilian parade marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of
new China.
</P>
<P>
The achievements will show how the Chinese people have gone all
out to build a socialist State with burgeoning prosperity after
they became masters of their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
Floats and sculptures in the first part of the parade
formations will show how China relied on its own for development
in such aspects as oil exploration, steel-making and construction
of water control projects, development of atomic bombs, hydrogen
bombs, missiles and satellites.
</P>
<P>
China's rapid economic growth and improvement of people's life
quality and earth-shaking changes in other sectors in the past 20
years since the beginning of reform and opening up will be
illustrated in 12 floats in a large formation.
</P>
<P>
Sculptures and models will also be used to show the Three
Gorges Hydroelectric Power Project, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge,
nuclear power stations, robots and wide use of computers in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
One square formation will also show that China feeds about one
fifth of the world's population with about ten percent of the
world's total arable land. China is the largest steel producer in
the world and is also in the forefront in terms of life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
A huge newly-wed cartoon couple demonstrates China's success in
implementing the family planning policy, which has helped save 7.
40 trillion yuan (about 890 billion U.S. dollars) in child-raising
costs during the past three decades, because 300 million fewer
babies were born in China in the period.
</P>
<P>
The parade will also show China's improvements in cultural life
and the country's successes in education, science, culture and
sports.
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous will be the 2,000-year-old chime bells, one of
China's most precious treasures.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of China's world champions will also pass by the
Tian'anmen Rostrum in a float. By now, China has over 1,200 world
championships and Beijing is now bidding for the right to hold the
Olympic Games in 2008.
</P>
<P>
China's achievements in such fields as astronomy, mathematics,
and bio-engineering will also be shown in the parade. The
education square formation will tell the fact that China's all
school-age children has by and large gone to school and illiteracy
has dropped drastically since the founding of new China.
</P>
<P>
The China's efforts to fight the 1998 devastating flooding will
also be told in a float.
</P>
<P>
Special floats also be used to display China's economic
development objectives by the year of 2050, and to feature Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan, suggesting China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
The last float carries a model of spacecraft, indicating that
top priority is given to science and technology in China's
socialist modernization construction.

<HEADLINE> Holders Parma Advance in UEFA Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Holders Parma came back from
their domestic dismal performances to lead the Italian charge into
the second round of the UEFA Cup on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They were joined by regular league rivals Juventus, Bologna,
Roma and Udinese on an evening which produced rare surprises.
</P>
<P>
Without a win in serie A this season and with just four goals
from their four league matches, Parma overcame newcomers Kryvbas
Kryviy Rih 3-0 in a second leg clash in Ukraine to canter through
6-2 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
France's Alain Boghossian opened the scoring for Parma with a
header in the 36th minute and Crespo made it 2-0 five minutes
before the break. Marco di Vaio, scorer of two goals in the first
leg, hit the final goal in the 67th.
</P>
<P>
Their Serie A rivals Juventus thrashed Omonia Nicosia of Cyprus
10-2 on aggregate after scoring five goals in each leg. Yugoslav
Darko Kovacevic made a rare start and seized a hat-trick in the
match in Palermo.
</P>
<P>
Bologna conceded the first goal and allowed the Russians a late
equaliser for a 2-2 tie, but Bologna still cruised through 5-2 on
aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Roma lost 1-0 to Vitoria Setubal in front of a crowd of 5,000
in Portugal but went through 7-1 on aggregate after the first leg
thrashing at the Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Former European champions Benfica, seemingly heading for an
early exit after losing 1-0 to Dinamo Bucharest in Portugal,
escaped with a goal in each half of their 2-0 second leg victory
in Romania.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Celta Vigo, who lost their first leg 3-2 away at
Switzerland's Lausanne, also survived with a 4-0 home win, thanks
to a hat-trick by South African Benni McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Club Bruges lost to Israel's Hapoel Haifa on away
goals after drawing 5-5 on aggregate while Denmark's Brondby were
also casualties, winning 4-3 on the night but losing 5-4 on
aggregate to Poland's Amica Wronki.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Helsingborg overcame Ukraine's Karpaty Lviv 4-2 on
penalties after having an 89th minute goal cancelled out by
Karpaty's 90th minute equaliser.

legislative body proper -- House of Representatives or DPR which
is incorporated in the MPR.
</P>
<P>
The MPR has a total of 700 members who serve for five years,
including 500 members of the DPR and 200 presidential appointees
(135 regional representatives and 65 functional representatives).
</P>
<P>
The MPR is required to meet once every 5 years, and its duties
include electing the president and vice president, amending the
Constitution and approving the broad policy aims of the
government.
</P>
<P>
The 500-member DPR exercises legislative authority, with 462
directly elected and 38 reserved for the Armed Forces whose
members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
The DPR meets at least once a year. All laws must have the
approval of the DPR, but the president has absolute veto. Members
of the DPR have the right to submit draft bills which require
ratification by the president. The president may enact ordinance
in times of emergency, which however must be either ratified or
revoked by the DPR at its following session.

<HEADLINE> Fifty Years Of Changes In Chinese Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese clothing, food, housing,
and travel have all seen great changes in the past 50 years,
Workers Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Chinese clothes have gone from gray and blue uniforms to more
individual expressions and from keeping up with the Joneses and
copycat dressing and hiding brightly-colored shirts under a gray
exterior to choosing one's own clothes according to one's own
taste.
</P>
<P>
The food and methods of eating have gone from bran to
restaurants, from just having a meal of rice, noodles, or steamed
bread to frequently going out to restaurants of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
Housing has gone from newspaper decorations on the walls to
consulting professional design specialists. Chinese apartments and
houses used to have three generations of people crammed into a
narrow space, with walls decorated by paper cutouts. Now 68.3
percent of the families have their own apartments. They also have
televisions, refrigerators, telephones, and other appliances and
live in their own place.
</P>
<P>
Chinese have gone from always staying at home to traveling
around the country and even going abroad. It was very hard for
Chinese even to leave of their hometown in the '50s but more of
them now have the chance to travel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. 2nd Quarter Growth Slows More Sharply Than  Previously Estimated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic growth
slowed to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter,
worse than previously estimated and the smallest gain in four
years, according to the Commerce Department's revised report
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe the slowdown reported Thursday by the
department was only a brief pause.
</P>
<P>
The 1.6 percent gain in the gross domestic product, the total
output of goods and services, from April through June marked the
slowest growth since the spring of 1995 when the economy grew at a
0.4 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter GDP increase was weaker than the 1.8 percent
rate the department reported one month ago and the 2.3 percent it
had initially estimated in July.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to keep the economy from overheating and prevent
an outbreak of inflation, the Federal Reserve has raised interest
rates twice this summer.
</P>
<P>
Fed policy-makers next meet Oct. 5, and many economists do not
expect another interest-rate increase at that time.
</P>
<P>
An inflation gauge tied to the second-quarter GDP rose 1.9
percent, less than the 2.1 percent the government estimated one
month ago. In the first quarter of this year, that inflation
measure rose 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said economic growth was reduced by 1.36 percentage
points by a second-quarter trade deficit. That was a bigger
reduction than the estimated loss of 1.34 percentage points in
growth reported by the government last month.
</P>
<P>
During the second quarter the trade deficit swelled to 34.4
billion dollars, a little wider than previously thought, as a 15.1
percent jump in imports overwhelmed a 4.9 percent increase in
exports.
</P>
<P>
The surging trade imbalance reflects the impact of the global
financial crisis, which has cut into U.S. export sales while
increasing competition on U.S. manufacturers from a flood of
cheaper imports. However, with economies in Asia and Latin America
on the mend, foreign demand for U.S. products is picking up.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's report, the department also said the profits of
U.S. companies decreased at an annual rate of 9.5 billion dollars
in the second quarter, a bigger decline than the 9.2 billion
dollars previously estimated. In the first quarter of the year,
profits rose at a 47.1 billion dollar rate.
</P>
<P>
In addition to facing stiff price competition from imports,
U.S. companies are being pinched by increasing labor costs
resulting from the lowest unemployment rate in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
In another report Thursday, the Labor Department said the
number of people filing for unemployment benefits last week rose
by 25,000 to 299,000.
</P>
<P>
The booming U.S. economy has been powered by robust consumer
spending, which, the department said, rose at an annual rate of
4.8 percent in the second quarter. That compares with an estimated
4.6 percent rate a month ago and with a torrid 6.7 percent pace in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
U.S. consumers continue to spend more than they earn, pulling
the nation's personal savings rate to a record low of negative 1.3
percent in the second quarter, the same as previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business investment rose at an annual rate of 10.8
percent in the second quarter. Spending for new homes and
apartments was up at a 7.1 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
All the changes show the economy growing at an annual rate of
31 billion dollars in the second quarter of the year, pushing the
country's total output of goods and services to 7.8 trillion
dollars, after adjusting for inflation.

NEW YORK, September 30 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rebounded
strongly Thursday as a government report on slower economy eased
fears of the interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 123.47 at 10,336.95,
its second gain in eight tradings.
</P>
<P>

quarter. The second-quarter growth increase was weaker than the
1.8 percent rate reported earlier.
</P>
<P>

the Federal Reserve would leave the interest rates alone at a
meeting in Washington on October 5. Concerns with the rate hike
for the third time this year have dragged stocks much lower.
