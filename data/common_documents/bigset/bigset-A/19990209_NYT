   OBIT-MURDOCH (Undated) _ Iris Murdoch, one of the most
prodigiously inventive and idiosyncratic of modern British writers,
whose 26 novels offered a blend of lively plots; complex, wayward
characters and intellectual speculation, died after only three
weeks in a nursing home in Oxford, England. She was 79 and had been
suffering from the effects of Alzheimer's disease. Her struggle was
documented recently in ``Elegy for Iris,'' an acclaimed memoir by
her husband, John Bayley, who was at her bedside when she died.

   WIDEMAN-RETRIAL (Pittsburgh) _ Robert Wideman's part in a
killing a generation ago might have been forgotten by now, except
by the family of a 24 year old man who was shot in the back on a
November night in 1975. Instead, the crime has become one of the
enduring literary images of black America. It was the subject of an
acclaimed 1984 book, ``Brothers &AMP; Keepers'' by Robert Wideman's
brother, John Edgar Wideman. One brother in the non-fiction work
was the noted author who had escaped the ghetto. The other was the
street tough who embodied the cycle that claims many young black
males. At 25, Robert Wideman was imprisoned for life with no
possibility of parole after an accomplice fired a fatal shot in a
robbery that went wrong. Now, Robert Wideman's case is no longer
alive only in literature. A judge has ordered a new trial, angry
prosecutors are appealing, and a debate has broken out over the
effect of race and fame on justice. By William Glaberson.

   Y2K-PANIC (Undated) _ The early fears about the Year 2000
computer problem featured all sorts of machines driven haywire by
their inability to read dates. That was before tens of billions of
dollars were spent on computer repairs and upgrades. Now a chorus
of regulators and authorities warn that Americans fearing for the
worst may end up inflicting more serious damage on themselves,
their neighbors and the economy than anything the computers do.
Some of the concerns are almost humorous. But planning experts are
taking seriously a wide range of Year 2000 disaster scenarios
starring humans, including bank runs, hoarding of food and
gasoline, fires caused by misuse of newly acquired wood stoves and
generators, and a rise in gun violence stemming from the surge in
firearm sales to those fearing civil unrest. By Barnaby J. Feder.

   SCI-HERBS (Undated) _ Herbal medicine, the mainstay of
therapeutics for centuries before modern purified drugs relegated
it to the status of near-quackery, has in the last five years
emerged from the fringes of health care with an astonishing
flourish and now shows clear signs of joining the medical
mainstream. Despite many cautionary tales about adulterated and
even dangerous products, herbs formulated as capsules, tinctures,
extracts and teas _ and increasingly as additions to common foods
like potato chips and fruit drinks _ are now routinely used by a
third of American adults seeking to enhance their health or
alleviate their illnesses. By Jane E. Brody.

<P>
   SCI-HERBS-DRUGS (Undated) _ Patients often lose out when a
prescription drug also is available as a supplement. Insurance
companies frequently refuse to pay for such prescriptions because
the same thing is available for sometimes a tenth of the cost. The
problem for consumers is that because supplements are unregulated,
there's no way short of chemical analysis to determine if the
substance actually contains what the label says it does. And,
that's a serious problem for people who rely on the treatment for
potentially lethal diseases. By Gina Kolata.

   SCI-HERBS-FOOD (Undated) _ Dozens of foods are landing on the
market to capitalize on America's soaring enthusiasm for herbal
remedies. No longer content with fortifying products with vitamins
or minerals, food companies are starting to add herb-based
substances that purport to offer particular health benefits,
benefits that in some cases have not yet been proven. At the same
time, companies are reaching to redefine existing foods _ oatmeal
is one _ in terms of their health benefits. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COSMOS (Chicago) _ In a kind of summit conference on the
universe, the world's leading cosmologists have assessed their
theories and pronounced them healthy, saying that a wealth of new
research that at first seemed puzzling turns out to strengthen the
intellectual framework that has shaped decades of cosmological
debate. The astonishing discovery last year that the universe's
expansion is not slowing down, as assumed, but seems to be speeding
up jolted theorists of the Big Bang, whose theory for the explosive
beginning and expanding evolution of the universe had ``lived
dangerously for 30 years,'' as Sir Martin Rees of Cambridge
University in England put it. By John Noble Wilford.

   SCI-MATH-CRANKS (Undated) _ With nothing more than a pencil and
paper, and maybe a compass and straight edge, even an amateur can
explore the mathematical netherworld, stumbling across important
new truths. That, anyway, is the dream or obsession that drives
would-be Ramanujans all over the world to send mathematicians
letter after letter crammed full of diagrams and equations
promising answers to unsolved problems ranging from squaring the
circle or proving (in a simpler way) Fermat's Last Theorem to
revealing, through the wonders of mathematics, the meaning of life.
And some of these cranks, on first impression, turn out to be
geniuses. By George Johnson.

<P>
   SCI-EMBRYO-CELLS (Undated) _ Six years ago, scientists in Canada
published a remarkable paper. In it, they reported that they had
grown entire mice from individual cells that they had plucked from
an mouse embryo. At the time, it was seen by those in the small
world of mouse researchers as a technological tour de force. But
now, as scientists are eyeing human embryo cells as material for
research, the experiment is giving rise to a thorny philosophical
question. If you can grow a mouse from a single embryo cell, you
should, in theory, be able to grow a human from a single human
embryo cell. And if you can grow a human from a single embryo cell,
is that cell the moral equivalent of an entire embryo? Where, in
other words, does the potential for human life lie? By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEPAL-LOVE (Undated) _ In an isolated village in Nepal
ancient traditions are changing, foremost among them, the ritual of
courtship. Young people now are writing love letters _ for a
reason. The practice of parental matchmaking is being abandoned,
and in its place come love letter that reach out to grab the
future. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PLANET-PLUTO (Undated) _ A rose by any other name would
smell as sweet, and Pluto by any other name (``Minor Planet No.
10,000,'' for instance,) would still be a no-account little dot in
the sky you can't see without a good telescope. But in recent weeks
astronomers have been partially agog over rumors that planetary
cataloguers were plotting to send Pluto back down to the minor
leagues. By Malcolm Browne.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FITNESS-PLAY (Undated) _ The concept of exercise as recess
for adults is coming to fitness clubs, which are now are organized
classes at which participants do jumping jacks while playing
``Simon Says,'' jump on a mini-trampoline or go hopscotching
through hula hoops. By Malia McKinnon.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-READING (Undated) _ The best approaches to teaching children
reading vary based on the needs and level of the child, according
to recent studies. Children whose vocabulary skills are already
fairly advanced benefit more when an adult reads the pages and
poses questions afterward. Less advanced children benefit more when
the narrative is interrupted for discussion. By Erica Goode.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-STROKE-TREATMENT (Undated) _ The window of opportunity for
treating stroke patients with clot-busting drugs has been doubled,
from three hours to six hours, without significantly raising the
risk of hemorrhage, according to a Cleveland Clinic study of the
enzyme prourokinase. By John O'Neil.

   ``They had me a list of things to say,'' Darryl Strawberry
began, but he had his own points to make. Soon the 70 recovering
addicts in the audience at the National Council on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence were applauding and shouting, ``That's right'' and
``We love you, Darryl.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said he had started drinking beer and using marijuana
when he was in junior high school _ ``normal things kids do that we
think are fine.'' As a major league ballplayer, he said, ``there's
more pressure to perform, more pressure to be somebody everybody
else wants you to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he sounded optimistic. ``I have a lot of hope after
suffering through cancer and recovering from cancer and alcohol and
drugs,'' he said. ``What more can a man go through?''
</P>
<P>
   Questions from the audience, it turned out. One man started
crying as he described the breakup on Sunday of a long-term
relationship. ``Right now,'' the man said, adding that he had not
used drugs in four months, ``I want to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry was sympathetic. ``The best thing for you today is
what you're doing, talking about it,'' he said. ``Recovery's
painful. That's what you're realizing right now at this point.
That's what I had to realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring training? Joe Torre's opening-day lineup?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never concerned about baseball,'' Strawberry said. ``I can
play baseball. Spring training, I've been doing that for 16 years.
Whatever happened is what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving His All for (a) Baseball
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The $2.7 million star of the show arrived at the
Plaza Hotel in a clear plastic case, like a museum piece. Then the
baseball that Mark McGwire blasted into history with his record
70th home run was placed on a pedestal by an armed guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a baseball psycho,'' said the baseball's owner, Todd
McFarlane, a Canadian who publishes comic books and heavy-metal
magazines and is an owner of the Edmonton Oilers (yes, a hockey
team).
</P>
<P>
   The baseball from homer No. 70 was flanked by some of
McFarlane's other acquisitions _ eight baseballs from last season's
home-run duel (McGwire's 1st, 67th, 68th and 69th, and Sammy Sosa's
33rd, 61st and 66th).
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, McFarlane had not identified himself as the person
who bought the home-run baseball at auction last month. He
attributed the delay to tax and security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew my wallet,'' he quipped. ``I've got nothing left in the
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   What if McGwire (or some other player) has a 71-homer season,
which could hurt the value of McFarlane's newest purchase?
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the biggest bet in America that the record wouldn't
fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Enough to Make Your Head Spin
</P>
<P>
   Bart Schoudel, an assistant production coordinator on the ABC-TV
situation comedy ``Spin City,'' worried that he might be in big
trouble when Bill Lawrence, an executive producer, called him.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it. Lawrence offered Schoudel and the Churchills, the
rock band Schoudel plays in on the side, a chance to appear in the
episode that will be broadcast Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The band's compact disk had been making the rounds of the show's
writers. Lawrence had heard it, and wanted the Churchills for a
scene that is something of a takeoff on the 1998 film ``There's
Something About Mary.'' (The main action involves Michael J. Fox
and Connie Britton and a kiss.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting to have them running around for me,''
Schoudel said. ``Star for a day. People thought, `The Churchills
are shooting a video and Michael J. Fox is watching them.' It
happened so fast, we didn't know what hit us.''

FISHER THE STARTER, HARPER THE CLOSER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ His minutes don't reflect it, but point guard
Derek Fisher is still the Los Angeles Lakers' starter. Derek
Harper, however, is clearly the finisher.
</P>
<P>
   And that, coach Del Harris said, is by design.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fisher closed out last season as the starter and was
named the No.1 point man in training camp, Harris wants a veteran
playing in crunch time. So Harper has played virtually the entire
fourth quarter in all three games.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Harp' has been playing well, and of course Harp is a 16-year
veteran. If you're not going to take advantage of experience at the
end of a game, I don't know when you do that,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   And Fisher has struggled so far. He went scoreless Monday and is
now 2 for 14 from the field this season.
</P>
<P>
   Harris told both Dereks last Thursday that he would have Harper
finish games for now, and Fisher said he's trying to adjust his
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having to change back to basically what my role was last
year (when Nick Van Exel played more minutes),'' he said. ``That
takes some time.... It's not something I'm going to complain about
over time or moan about because in a sense it's out of my
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Call me Pipp: Kobe Bryant started his third straight game in
place of injured Rick Fox, and the 20-year-old phenom continued to
make the case for becoming the permanent starter, even once Fox
returns _ a possibility not ruled out by coach Del Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant posted his third straight double-double, 19 points and 10
rebounds, and again played impressive defense, getting two blocks
and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   Joked Fox, of the prospect of ceding his starting role to
Bryant: ``As long as they don't take my money and start giving it
to him too.''
</P>
<P>
   Where's the Worm?: The Dennis Rodman Watch is more than a week
old, and still no word from the tattooed one's camp on his
intentions. The Lakers have quietly set an unspecified deadline,
having grown weary of the wait _ and the constant questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see the whole thing settled, because it's clear
it has become a distraction,'' Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak
said. ``We'd like to have it settled as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, who was extended an offer by Lakers owner Jerry Buss, is
mulling whether to play for the veterans' minimum salary of $1
million _ or $610,000 prorated for the shortened season. His agency
said Monday that no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal said he's spoken with the Worm by phone, but
offered no insight into his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Forwards Travis Knight (flu) and Fox (sore right
foot) were again scratches.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who missed his second straight game, did not travel with
the team but might join the Lakers in Denver today; the Lakers play
the Nuggets on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who has not played or practiced for a week, continues to
improve but his status remains day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Marie Bertka, mother of longtime Lakers assistant coach
Bill Bertka, died of natural causes early Monday morning in Santa
Barbara. She was 97. Bill Bertka will remain with the team for the
road trip, which ends Thursday night in Minneapolis.... When four
Lakers fouled out of Sunday's game against Utah, it was the first
time that had happened since Jan. 29, 1980. The foursome that day,
in a quadruple-overtime game at Cleveland, was Jamaal Wilkes, Jim
Chones, Michael Cooper and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.... O'Neal's 22
free-throw attempts Sunday tied a career high.

INQUIRY INTO POLICE SHOOTING DRAWS THE GAZE OF GUINEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting in 5th-10th grafs) (mk) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As friends and family made funeral arrangements on
Monday for an unarmed street peddler shot dead by New York City
police, a diplomat from the victim's homeland of Guinea in West
Africa said his countrymen were concerned that the four officers
involved had not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Aboubacar Dione, the first consul of Guinea's permanent mission
to the United Nations, said the police shooting of Amadou Diallo,
who was killed Thursday in a barrage of 41 bullets, has drawn
considerable attention in his country, a nation beset by desperate
poverty and convulsed by eight months of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``People back home _ the entire African continent _ is following
this case. They don't understand why these four are still free,''
Dione said at the mission's four-story town house on East 39th
Street. As he spoke, he received a call from Guinea's minister of
foreign affairs, one of many he said he gets about the case each
morning from officials in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Dione said Guinean officials hope that justice will be done in
the case, which has led critics of the Police Department to
question whether New York's much-lauded crackdown on crime has
created a climate that fosters police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   While the police have said that there were no witnesses to the
shooting, WCBS-TV news ran an interview on Monday night with a man
who said he lived across the street from Diallo and had seen part
of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The man, whose identity was not revealed, said he heard shots
and went to his window. There was a brief pause, he said, and then
the shooting resumed. ``By the time I got to the window, now
they're shooting again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The man said that after the shooting stopped, he went down to
the street and tried to give information to investigators at the
scene, but that he and several other witnesses were told to leave
and some were cursed at by the police.
</P>
<P>
   The news broadcast also said that the man had told his story to
the Bronx district attorney's office, but a spokesman for the
district attorney would not comment on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials declined to comment Monday night on the man's
claims.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, the Bronx district attorney, Robert T.
Johnson, met for 30 minutes with six of the dead man's relatives
and friends, including his uncle, Mamadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good meeting,'' said Kyle B. Watters, a lawyer
for the Diallo family. ``The District Attorney assured us he was
doing everything he can to see that justice is done. He told us
that an investigation was going forward and that they were
interviewing potential witnesses today.''
</P>
<P>
   To reassure Diallo's family, the Bronx district attorney, Robert
Johnson, met Monday afternoon for 30 minutes with six of the dead
man's relatives and friends, including his uncle, Mamadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good meeting,'' said Kyle Watters, a lawyer for
the Diallo family. ``The district attorney assured us he was doing
everything he can to see that justice is done. He told us that an
investigation was going forward and that they were interviewing
potential witnesses today.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's office is expected to begin presenting evidence and
witnesses to a grand jury later this week. Since there were
apparently no eyewitnesses, aside from the four officers,
prosecutors are likely to begin any presentation with a series of
witnesses who would establish the broad circumstances of Diallo's
death, such as the fact that he was hit by 19 of the bullets fired
at him as he stood unarmed in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, who were searching for a rape suspect, have not
spoken to investigators. But their lawyer, Stephen Worth, has said
they thought Diallo had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Worth has said he will probably allow the officers _ Edward
McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35, Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard
Murphy, 26 _ to testify without immunity before a grand jury if
certain conditions are met. As of Monday, he said, he had not begun
those negotiations with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's father and mother were scheduled to arrive in New York
on Tuesday, and the family is planning to hold a memorial prayer
service on Friday at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York on
East 96th Street. The family is then expected to arrange to fly the
body of Diallo home to Guinea, which he left for New York two years
ago. Before leaving, the family is expected to meet with Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, according to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to lose a child,'' Giuliani said at a news
conference Monday, ``and the idea of even talking to the father and
talking to him about his losing his son in a foreign country is a
terrible, terrible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparations were also being made for a rally at noon Tuesday
outside U.S. District Court in Manhattan. A rally was held Sunday
outside the Wheeler Avenue apartment building where Diallo, 22, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers involved in the case have been removed from
patrol but three returned to administrative assignments Monday,
according to their lawyer. The fourth called in sick, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor spent two hours at City Hall Monday with members of
the United African Congress, his second meeting in as many days
with representatives of New York's West Africans. Giuliani told
reporters later that he had tried to explain the slow pace of
careful justice. ``Investigations, as you know, take longer than
anybody expects,'' he said. The mayor urged all parties to await
the outcome of the investigation, although he said it would not
support the contention of some critics that the force routinely
brutalized citizens.
</P>
<P>
   `I feel terrible about what happened,'' he said. ``We're working
very, very hard to assist the family and everyone in the community
to understand it. But I am not going to subscribe to a notion that
the police officers in New York City as some general matter are
acting improperly.''

MARIUS SCHOON, 61, FOE OF APARTHEID 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Marius Schoon, an opponent of
apartheid who had been fighting an amnesty application by the
police spy who killed Schoon's wife and daughter with a mail bomb,
died here on Sunday. He was 61.
 &UR;  &LR;  The cause was lung cancer, said Hugh Lewin, a friend who spent
seven years in prison with Schoon, both of them on sabotage
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Schoon was one of a rare breed for whom police and prison guards
reserved special contempt, a fellow Afrikaner who, in their eyes,
had turned his back on his own white people to campaign for equal
rights for the black majority.
</P>
<P>
   Although he tried to blow up a police station in 1964 and served
12 years in prison for the crime, Schoon was not famous as a
saboteur or political prisoner, but as a particularly sad and
bitter victim of the apartheid government. In 1984, his wife,
Jeannette, and their 6-year-old daughter, Katryn, were blown up in
front of Fritz, his 3-year-old son, in the kitchen of their house
in exile in Angola. The man who sent the bomb, Craig Williamson,
had pretended to be a family friend and had once stayed with them.
But he was spying for the security police.
</P>
<P>
   The Schoons, who had known Williamson from his days as a student
activist, suspected that he was a spy and helped lay a trap,
Schoon's lawyer, George Bizos, said Monday. Williamson fell into
it.
 &UR;  &LR;  In the suit that tried to deny Williamson amnesty, which can be
granted just for political crimes, Bizos contended that Williamson
had killed Jeannette and Katryn Schoon for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson, who became an officer in the security police, has
also admitted preparing the fatal mail bomb for Ruth First, wife of
Joe Slovo, leader of the Communist Party, and bombing the African
National Congress office in London in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In September, on a break in the amnesty hearing, Schoon found
himself sharing a tiny courtyard with his family's killer. Stalking
back and forth furiously, Schoon avoided speaking to him all week.
``On the whole, I'm in favor of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission,'' Schoon said during the hearing. ``I think it's going
to bring about national reconciliation. In my case, it's not going
to bring about personal reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Williamson testified in a quavering voice that he felt as if he
had been ``hit with a bucket of cold water'' when he learned that
his bomb had killed the girl. To kill unknown targets was one
thing, he said, ``but to know that an attack is to be carried out
on people you know is a great difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoon dismissed that as ``crocodile tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoon attended the University of Stellenbosch, considered the
best Afrikaans university. Then he went to the English-speaking
University of the Witwatersrand here, where he joined the Congress
of Democrats, a white student organization that united with the
ANC.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sort of a hippie-leftie in the '60s,'' Lewin said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he helped plant a bomb at the Johannesburg police
station. ``It was an attempt to show the authorities there was
still resistance'' despite the treason trial, which put many
anti-apartheid leaders, including Nelson Mandela, behind bars, said
Lewin, who was blowing up power pylons at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Schoon's group had been infiltrated, and the police agent
provocateur supplied the bomb, which went off harmlessly. Schoon
served 12 years in Pretoria Local Prison, where white political
prisoners were isolated far from the nonwhite prisoners on Robben
Island.
</P>
<P>
   As one of three Afrikaner prisoners, Schoon was singled out for
extra humiliations by the warden, Lewin said. When Schoon's first
wife, Diana, committed suicide while he was in prison, he was not
permitted to attend the funeral or to see their daughter, Jane.
</P>
<P>
   On his release in 1976, he met Jeannette Curtis, who was also
``banned'' for her union activities, so they could not legally
associate with each other. They moved to Botswana, working for the
ANC underground. Then, learning of plans to kill them, they moved
to Lubango, Angola, where Williamson's team mailed the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Since his return in 1990 after the ``unbanning'' of
anti-apartheid groups, Schoon had worked for the Development Bank,
which was working to remake its image. It was created by the
apartheid government to underwrite the so-called homelands in which
black South Africans had to take citizenship. The bank now lends to
help black neighborhoods, and Schoon oversaw many projects. ``He
was useful to them,'' Lewin said. ``But I'd hate to describe him as
a banker. He was far too much of a poet.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Jane and Fritz, Schoon, who did write poetry, is
survived by his third wife, Sherry. The suit against Williamson
also survives. It will depend on the commission's amnesty decision,
due next month.

COLUMN: LIFE AFTER POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First, a political trivia question that some may find
a curiosity:
</P>
<P>
   Which winning citywide candidate got the fewest votes in the
1997 municipal elections?
</P>
<P>
   If you guessed Rudolph Giuliani, give yourself a gold star. The
mayor's 783,815 votes on the Republican and Liberal lines, a 16
percent drop from his 1993 total, put him well behind Public
Advocate Mark Green, who had the most with 871,305, and Comptroller
Alan Hevesi (866,572).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all this means nothing. (That's why it is called
trivia.) As you know, Giuliani still finished far ahead of his
Democratic opponent, Ruth Messinger, who after two decades as a
city councilwoman and Manhattan borough president found herself
through with electoral politics _ and vice versa, in all
probability.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she lost big, it did not seem like an affront to
democracy to call on Messinger Monday to find out what she had been
up to.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that, unlike so many former politicians, who
concentrate on doing well for themselves, she has been doing good.
Since last summer, she has been president of the American Jewish
World Service, a group based in New York that supports development
programs in Third World countries, along with promoting Jewish
education in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   One aim is to teach the poorest of the poor how to fend for
themselves, not just wait for the next plane carrying relief
supplies. That point was underscored two weeks ago when Messinger,
freshly inoculated against typhoid, tetanus and hepatitis, visited
Nicaragua and Honduras to examine reconstruction operations in the
aftermath of the devastating Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman who runs a community-building project said to me,
`Nicaragua es un huracan permanente' _ Nicaragua is a permanent
hurricane,'' she said. ``This is a country with fierce poverty,
with large numbers of people without adequate housing or decent
health care. And in many parts of the country, those were the
people hit the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet as much as we would love to help them raise money to build
houses,'' she said, ``we're also going to work with them on doing
sustainable agriculture: giving families the technology and the
funds they need to change the way they use the land. If there was
any arable soil, it's not there now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not often in this city that you run into an ex-politician
who feels that life after government can include something other
than a big bank, a high-fee law firm or a connected real-estate
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics would say that none of those businesses were about to
hire Messinger, whose politics fall squarely on the left, and they
might be right. Her job search did not go smoothly at first.
</P>
<P>
   But Messinger, 58, is by training a teacher and a social worker,
not a lawyer, and her new work _ which includes part-time teaching
posts at Hunter and Queens Colleges _ suits her fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I sorry I didn't win the election? Sure,'' she said in her
organization's office off Herald Square. ``Am I very satisfied that
I found another place to make a difference and continue to pursue
justice? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the conversation turned to local politics. You will
be shocked _ shocked! _ to learn that Messinger thinks Giuliani
could be doing better, that he has unfairly pummeled the City
University, that he has ``squandered'' opportunities created by his
budget surpluses, focusing instead on items like ``imaginary
stadium plans.''
</P>
<P>
   But she referred to the mayor with respect. If anything, she was
tougher on senior figures in her own party _ especially the men _
who will never get a chapter in any update of ``Profiles in
Courage.'' These are men who sat out the tough races, letting
others be pounded by Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki while waiting
for easier pickings in the next go-round.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about the general lack of success among
New York women seeking citywide and statewide office. But Messinger
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 10 or 15 years, several women who have run and
lost have been women who were ready to give up the offices they
held in order to pursue offices from which they thought they could
make more of a difference.'' She cited Bella Abzug, Elizabeth
Holtzman, Carol Bellamy _ and herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a lot of men in politics who do that,'' she
said. ``That's what I call rolling the dice. I knew that was the
gamble I was taking.''

HUSKY HOOPLA: UCONN FANS AMONG THE MOST FERVENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ If Norman Rockwell had been a developer instead
of a painter, he would have designed the University of Connecticut
campus. Picturesque is inadequate to describe the red-brick
buildings on rolling hills dusted with snow.
</P>
<P>
   Storrs, population: 12,198. UConn, enrollment: 21,753. Without
the university, Storrs would be nothing more than a dot on the map.
Storrs has no hotels, no movie theaters _ good gracious, not even a
McDonald's. It is not where you expect to find the center of
anything.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the intersection of basketball. This is the place
where men's coach Jim Calhoun and women's coach Geno Auriemma have
made their programs national contenders. This is a state consumed
by the two teams, where those teams' players are celebrities.
Welcome to Husky Mania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basketball heaven,'' said Huskies forward Kevin
Freeman. ``It's not like at a school where there's also (big-time)
football. For the fans, UConn basketball is what they live and
breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nutmeg State is nutty in its support for men's and women's
basketball. For five weeks this season, both teams were ranked No.
1. The last time that happened was 1995, and the Connecticut women
won the national championship. This year, the fans are expecting _
at least _ Final Four trips from both and are hoping for matching
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave the state and nobody cares about you,'' Kara
Wolters, starting center for the '95 national champions, said while
signing autographs. ``You cross the border and it's like this
magical transformation: You're ``it''.'' LIKE FOOTBALL IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Jake Voskuhl is from Strake Jesuit High School in Houston. He
grew up in the middle of a sport that causes year-round frenzy and
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is huge down in Texas, but the way basketball is up
here is like it was in Texas back during the Darrell Royal days,''
Voskuhl said. ``I came up on my recruiting visit, everybody knew
who I was, and I had people wanting to talk to me, ask me if I was
coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe a transplanted Texan? Here are some facts.
</P>
<P>
   All home games for the men's and women's teams were sellouts
before the season. On-campus, 9-year-old Gampel Pavilion seats
10,027; the Hartford Civic Center seats 16,294. For the fourth
consecutive year, both programs are projecting profits ($8 million
for the men, $1.5 million for the women).
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut 2000, a $1 billion state-funded construction and
renovation project (classrooms, dormitories, a new library), is
under way. President emeritus Harry Hartley credits the basketball
success with persuading the governor and Legislature to approve the
funding in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are covered, home and away, by The Horde _ reporters
from more than a dozen newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had done two interviews before I got here: one when
we won the state championship and one when I signed to come here,''
said Paige Sauer, a 6-foot-5 junior from Midwest City, Okla.
``Here, we've got people interviewing us after practices, and
there's a bunch more at all our games.''
</P>
<P>
   On Super Bowl Sunday, the UConn women held their annual alumni
game and honored the school's first NCAA Tournament team. The game
was televised on local public television and approximately 750 fans
attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some women's programs, you don't get this turnout for a
regular game,'' Wolters said. ``It's not like they have to be here.
The fans are so loyal to us, the best in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 2,500 fans have season tickets for both teams.
Crowds for the women's games (tickets: $12) are dominated by senior
citizens and children. The men's games (tickets: $23) tend to be
younger, with more students and corporate ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Labonte lives 20 miles away in Manchester. She has been
a women's season-ticket holder for seven years and later this month
plans on making a daily four-hour round trip to Rutgers for the Big
East Conference women's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worth it,'' she said, wearing a custom-made ``Svet
Shirt'' in honor of Huskies sophomore Svetlana Abrosimova of
Russia. ``Husky basketball is the only thing I do for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut wants to move up from Division I-AA to I-A in
football, and the NFL's New England Patriots are making plans to
move to Hartford in 2001, but basketball's reign should continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that will have any impact on basketball,''
Hartley said. ``Basketball is so deep-rooted now, nothing is going
to change that.'' UNADULTERATED ADORATION
</P>
<P>
   The players on the women's championship team still get chills
when they recall the celebration in Gampel when they returned to
Storrs. And Calhoun still gets emotional when he thinks of a
similar scene when his 1990 East Regional men's finalists were met
by fans after their buzzer-beating loss to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   There are an estimated 90,000 UConn graduates living in the
state; that in part accounts for the fan base. But it is the fans'
unadulterated adoration that is difficult to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Husky Mania is something you really can't understand or
explain,'' said Stacy Hansmeyer, a 6-1 junior from Norman, Okla.
``You have to be in the middle of it. The outsiders see the big
crowds and all the winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people just go absolutely crazy. They get all the
shirts, caps, pins, bumper sticks. They know us by name, by number.
They're so obsessed that it seems they know more about you than
your teammates do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that obsession can be a little too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no pro sports, and no matter where you go in
Connecticut, everybody knows who you are,'' Voskuhl said. ``The
downside is that if you're doing something you shouldn't, everybody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people here are pretty nice, and most of them just
want an autograph. If you're too busy to give them an autograph,
you've got problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find fans like this anywhere else in the country,''
said Carla Berube, a member of the 1995 national championship team.
``It's amazing the support we get.''
</P>
<P>
   And give.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had instances where senior citizens in nursing homes who
hadn't talked in years got so excited during a UConn game they
started screaming and talking,'' Hartley said. ``We've had doctors
tell us that the teams have played a role in the recovery of
children with illnesses. It's amazing the impact this has on
people's lives.'' `DYNAMIC TENSION'
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the women beat Tennessee in Storrs during the regular
season, starting the statewide frenzy that peaked with the national
championship. That's also when the perception of a men vs. women
rivalry started, particularly between Calhoun and Auriemma.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley, the former president who hired both, calls it ``dynamic
tension.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They both come out of competitive environments,'' said
Hartley, who regularly jogs with Calhoun. ``It drove both of them
to excel within their programs. There's some tension, some
competition, some egos. I think it's all for the good of UConn.''
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches were hired 13 seasons ago. Auriemma has a national
title and two Final Four trips. Calhoun has the most victories in
school history and three Final Four near misses (losses in regional
finals). Players on both teams downplay the jealousy aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants them to win more than me,'' said Auriemma, whose
team is trying to overcome injuries to two starters. ``It's like
General Motors and the rivalry between Chevrolet and Buick. Same
company, just two people trying to do the best they can at what
they do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Storrs, this postcard-perfect New England town, plays the
role of Hoop City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often say that the No. 1 thing taking you away from goals is
distractions. There aren't many of those here,'' Calhoun said.
``We're not Chapel Hill or Ann Arbor. But this whole state believes
in basketball. It's incredible.''

FORD GIVES LESSON ON HARD KNOCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chris Ford, sounding more like a
community-outreach lecturer than the first-year coach of the Los
Angeles Clippers, had this message for the class:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some guys in this league who will abuse you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was referring to the NBA's expanding lineup of rebounding
thugs. Unfortunately, such abusive behavior has yet to be exhibited
by an employee of his team. No, the above reference was intended to
school his young players, who learned a lesson in back-alley
rebounding during Sunday's loss to the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   And the coach said the test was flunked by everyone wearing a
Clippers jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta be physical in this league,'' said Ford, whose team
allowed 23 offensive rebounds by the Bulls and lost the overall
board battle, 50-37.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to push and shove, but all legal and clean. If you're
just going to stand side-by-side with these guys, they're going to
manhandle you. But this shouldn't be a problem for us ... how many
teams are bigger than we are?''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of girth, not many.
</P>
<P>
   So, with inspiration gathered from watching the gruesome footage
of Sunday's game, Monday's workout at Veterans Park SportsComplex
in Carson had much in common with hand-to-hand combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were banging each other out here today,'' Ford said,
``but they have to bang the other team. I don't care how they
respond in practice; it's how they respond in the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   The next game happens to be Wednesday in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers still out: Forward Rodney Rogers, who didn't play against
Chicago, was a spectator during Monday's practice. Rogers has a
strained medial collateral ligament in his right knee and his
availability is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   He's a few muffins on the wrong side of his optimal playing
weight of 255, but he did have 11 rebounds in the Clippers' opening
loss to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Filling Sherman's tank: Point guard Sherman Douglas arrived for
duty just one day before the Clippers' first game. It was apparent
that the nine-year veteran had rounded out of shape during the
lockout, but he did provide a spark in Sunday's rally against the
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, who was on the floor just four minutes against Phoenix
on Friday, scored eight crucial points in 18 minutes in Sunday's
outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherman will push himself to get in condition,'' Ford said.
``But he still has a little journey ahead of him. He really helped
us Sunday. He's just so cagey when he's on the court.''

MAVERICKS EARLY SUCCESS STIRS EXCITEMENT

<P>
   The loud shrieking from the den caused great concern for family
members, who came rushing in from other parts of the house,
checking out the commotion.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only me, sitting there alone, yelling at a big-screen
TV late Sunday night. Something about, ``get Pack outta there,
Nelson.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Robert Pack, flighty backup point guard for the
Dallas Mavericks. And Don Nelson, the coach who had left him on the
floor too long, at least in one opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it was an outburst that caused some personal
evaluation. Is a normal human supposed to be talking _ you had
better make that ``yelling'' _ at a TV screen? The operative word
here is normal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, however, who actually cares enough anymore about
the Mavericks to raise such a ruckus? Ten years ago, yes. But that
was before the Dark Decade of NBA basketball descended upon local
precincts.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the strangest part. I actually missed the Mavericks
during the lockout, and then looked forward with great anticipation
to the beginning of a short-stuff 50-game season. Don't ask me why.
Don't know why. It just happened.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the first two games from the West Coast _ an overtime
loss in Seattle and a double-overtime win at Golden State. While
neither ranked high in artistic value, I was more than adequately
entertained. Actually, I was absorbed, via TV, in both contests.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it is not exactly something you'd want spread around
the neighborhood. No one wants to be thought of as your street's
weirdo. But after many basketball seasons of not caring enough to
care ...
</P>
<P>
   Hey, this is good. I just found out Monday that I'm apparently
not alone. Tuesday's home opener at Reunion Arena against the Utah
Jazz has the possibility of being a sellout. A house of 16,000-plus
is also expected for Houston on Thursday night, but again, a
sellout is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime team staffers are saying the box-office phones haven't
been this busy since Jason Kidd's rookie season. And after three
consecutive years of season-ticket sales decline, that figure is up
14 percent to 9,200.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's a long way from yesteryear, when for six consecutive
seasons ('85-'91), season-ticket sales were cut off at 14,000 due
to club policy. For three consecutive years in the '80s, the
Mavericks finished second in NBA attendance, and second only
because the arena wasn't big enough.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to the area, who know nothing about the Mavericks
except the Dark Decade, are always amazed at what once was.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, flash back to the late '80s, and the Mavericks, it can
be said, owned all hearts from Denton to Duncanville, Rockwall to
Weatherford. Bigger than the Dallas Cowboys? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mavericks owner Don Carter once made an innocent
statement in 1988 about regretting the ``long faces of Cowboys
players'' he saw around town. Talk about hacked _ Texas E. Schramm
was. But Carter and the Mavericks were riding high, and the Cowboys
were in a severe downward slide.
</P>
<P>
   This is when you know you're going good _ former Mavericks
general manager Norm Sonju did a game-by-game check of empty seats
belonging to season ticket holders. With every game a sellout, and
with a waiting list for season tickets, very few seats went unused.
But if that did happen two consecutive games, Sonju ran a check on
seat ownership, personally called the season ticket holder, and
suggested selling the tickets back to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Sonju wanted to put those seats in the hands of people who would
use them. I'd never heard of that, nor have since then. But it's a
darn good idea.
</P>
<P>
   And for all the criticism Sonju endured _ I was never exactly
light in that department myself _ he was the first member of the
local pro sports fraternity who honestly addressed the nature of
doing business in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With sellout after sellout at Reunion, Sonju still fretted,
calling it ``a soft house.'' That meant a segment of the crowd
arrived late, departed early and spent an ample amount of time
strutting around the arena. Mavericks' games were a social event
for the social set.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have always had that. And look out, Dallas Stars _
this is now your crowd. But as Sonju repeatedly said, the soft
house is with you only in the good times. The Mavericks would learn
it the hard way, as have the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   But the current upward trend for the Mavericks, which is partly
due to Don Nelson's shameless promotion and upbeat attitude, proves
one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Given a reason to come back, the fans will. And then there's the
other segment, like those who yell mindlessly at a TV screen. But
if nothing else, at least it means they care again.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Just when it seemed Charles Barkley was going to carry so much of a
load he would develop another hernia, the Rockets added another
scorer. You might have heard of him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets made plenty of noise when they signed Scottie Pippen
a few weeks ago. Pippen made more noise Monday, regaining the
shooting touch that had been missing over the weekend and helping
the Rockets rout the Denver Nuggets 99-80 in their home opener at
Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the way we're supposed to play basketball,'' said
Barkley, who had 15 points and 19 rebounds. ``We had the better
team. We went out and played and got to rest our guys and win the
game. It was fun for the fans and fun for the players.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite all he has accomplished in his career, it was a
relief for Pippen, who seemed by far his most comfortable and
effective in the Rockets' offense. He had 24 points on 10-of-17
shooting and also grabbed 13 rebounds to go with five assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shooting the ball well, and that opened up opportunities
to go to the basket,'' Pippen said. ``It's just one game. I'm still
figuring out where my opportunities will be. If we can get the
transition game going, we'll have more opportunities for me to
score and open the game up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets got the running game going but did not convert as
often as they expect to. They did, however, completely dominate on
the boards, on defense and on the front line.
</P>
<P>
   Nuggets forward Antonio McDyess, who flirted with the Rockets
and almost walked down the aisle with the Suns before signing with
the Nuggets, had 14 points and 14 rebounds but made just six of 17
shots. And he was by far the Nuggets' most productive player.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's perimeter starters _ Eric Williams, Bryant Stith and
Nick Van Exel _ combined to make just five of 26 shots, helping the
Rockets grab a 58-39 rebounding advantage. And when in the
halfcourt, the Rockets were able to ride their front line of
Barkley, Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon. The three combined for 53
points (on 23-of-36 shooting) to go with 45 rebounds, easily more
boards than the entire Nuggets team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a very good job defensively and a great job on the
boards,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``Again, Charles had
a big rebounding game. We had real nice passing, moving the ball
around and creating open shots. It's coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had 25 assists, almost twice as many as in
Saturday's win at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have guys that can really pass the ball and create
opportunities,'' Rockets guard Cuttino Mobley said. ``And with
Scottie, Charles and Hakeem, what more can we ask from them? The
rest of us, all we have to do is come in and play defense and make
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of it came together in the first half, but it was hard to
take too much from the Rockets' play because Denver was so awful.
There were Nuggets at McDonald's that had a better night.
</P>
<P>
   Denver went the last eight minutes of the first half without a
field goal. Van Exel, showing shot selection that wouldn't have
been tolerated in the Westside lockout league, made one of 10 shots
in the first half and took the last as shamelessly as the first.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel, Williams and Stith were a combined 2-of-17 in the
first half, accounting for the Nuggets' 1-of-11 3-point shooting.
</P>
<P>
   All told in the first half, the Nuggets made 12 of 47 shots
(25.5 percent) and had to get a run to improve to that. They spent
much of the first half hovering at about 18 percent as the Rockets
rolled to a 53-31 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The game turned ugly in the second quarter when Tomjanovich went
with a three-guard lineup and Barkley had his so-far-nightly
stretch of domination.
</P>
<P>
   In a mix the Rockets had not shown over the weekend of guards
Brent Price, Bryce Drew and Mobley, with Barkley and either Pig
Miller or Othella Harrington, Barkley scored 11 points in six
minutes and controlled the boards.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Barkley had made all seven shots he attempted for
14 points. He also had grabbed 12 rebounds and in those six minutes
had pushed the Rockets from a 28-23 lead to a 49-30 mugging.
</P>
<P>
   And once Barkley got rolling, everything else seemed to follow.
As awkward as the Rockets' offense had seemed at Los Angeles and
Golden State, it was clicking in Monday's first half. Of the
Rockets' 22 field goals, 14 were off assists.
</P>
<P>
   Outscoring the Nuggets 14-1 to end the second quarter, the
Rockets did more than put the game away with a half still to play.
They got Pippen's offense in gear, saved some legs to be needed
later _ Barkley was able to finish the game with ice packs on his
knees _ and showed what could be when it all falls together.

ROD SORGE, 30, PROMOTED SERVICES FOR DRUG USERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rod Sorge, a former executive of the Harm Reduction
Coalition, a private organization that promotes services for drug
users and other people on the fringes of society, was found dead in
his upper Manhattan apartment on Jan. 28. He was 30.
</P>
<P>
   He died of AIDS-related causes, the coalition said in announcing
his death.
</P>
<P>
   Sorge was the coalition's development director, in charge of
fund raising until October 1997, when he stopped working because of
his illness. He joined the staff in 1995 after having worked for
other organizations with goals similar to those of the Harm
Reduction Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Springer, senior trainer at the Harm Reduction Coalition's
training institute in Manhattan, said Sorge was a writer who
``wrote grant proposals that brought tears to your eyes.'' The
coalition gets most of its support from foundations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorge was born in Texas and grew up in Chicago. He attended
Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago he moved to New York and became a founder of an
underground needle exchange program operated in the Bronx and
Harlem by Act Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power. The
program's goal was to reduce the spread of the human
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, among addicts who
injected drugs intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Harm Reduction Coalition, Sorge worked for
Health-PAC, a Manhattan-based health policy group, and for the
American Civil Liberties Union. He and a colleague there, Ruth
Harlow, jointly edited a book, ``ACLU Briefing Book on Needle
Exchange, Harm Reduction and HIV Prevention in the Second Decade''
(1994).
</P>
<P>
   He then became the first administrative director of the New York
Peer AIDS Education Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he received the Drug Policy Foundation's Robert C.
Randall Award for Achievement in the Field of Citizen Action.

ARMAND SCHWERNER, 71, POET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armand Schwerner, a poet whose work inspired an
extraordinary range of dance, performance and theatrical
presentations, died last Thursday at his home on Staten Island. He
was 71.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Adam, said the cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In more than three decades Schwerner published about a dozen
volumes of poetry, some in multiple editions. Two works will be
issued this spring, ``Selected Shorter Poems'' and the complete
edition of his major work ``The Tablets,'' which he developed in 27
long sections published over 25 years and which critics have
compared to Ezra Pound's ``Cantos.''
</P>
<P>
   Because much of his poetry is nonlinear, it may be less familiar
in print to most readers than the work of some of his
contemporaries, but in performance and in recordings of his
readings, it attracted large audiences. Schwerner had an
inexhaustible enthusiasm for the hidden expressions in daily
language, and in his verse dozens of different voices are heard,
from those recorded on ancient Mesopotamian clay tablets to
American Indian and native Hawaiian verse to European drama and
Tibetan Buddhist chants.
</P>
<P>
   The playful, challenging or even threatening dialogues below the
surface of his poems were best realized in performance. For several
years in the late 1980s the Living Theater presented versions of
``The Tablets'' to audiences that responded almost raucously in the
United States and in Western Europe. But most Schwerner aficionados
agreed that the best experience was to catch a presentation in
which he performed.
</P>
<P>
   The energy was prodigious. He could produce many distinct voices
from one breath to the next. He could also use his mastery of
rhythm (he was an accomplished clarinetist) to create an audible
stir in an audience, which at times made it seem that his poems
were speaking from the floor, the balcony and the rafters all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   He was gregarious, and his friends, family and students often
found themselves experiencing theatrical eruptions when, as Adam
Schwerner put it, his father would spontaneously ``go into
character.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwerner was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1927 and moved to New
York with his father in 1935; his mother and two siblings came the
next year. He did undergraduate work at Cornell and Columbia
Universities, earning a degree in French, followed by several years
of graduate work at Columbia in anthropology and English
literature. He taught English at Long Island University from 1963
to '64 and then joined the faculty of Staten Island Community
College for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 until his retirement last summer he taught English at
the College of Staten Island of the City University of New York. He
was active in writers associations like American PEN, but his
greatest commitment was to the Tibetan Museum in Staten Island,
where he was a board member. He and Dolores Holmes Schwerner, to
whom he was married in 1961, had two sons, Adam and Ari. The couple
divorced in 1975, and Ari died in a railroad accident three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides poetry, Schwerner wrote criticism and commentary and
translated ancient and contemporary languages, the most notable
project being a version of Sophocles' play ``Philoctetes,'' which
some classicists frown on but which is popular with theater
directors for the force and resonance of its language. The scholar
and critic Hugh Kenner called it ``a speakable version,'' seeing it
as a sequel to Pound's translation of ``The Women of Trachis'' by
Sophocles, but, Kenner maintained, ``Pound did not have Schwerner's
sure feel for the demotic.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, he is survived his mother, Savette; a
brother, William B.; a sister, Jeanine Klein, and two
grandchildren.

USA NETWORKS AND LYCOS IN A COMPLEX MERGER DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 3rd graf; subs 8th graf to eliminate first references
to Diller and Davis.)  (nk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SAUL HANSELL 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   USA Networks Inc. has agreed to exchange its home-shopping
operations for control of Lycos Inc., the fourth most popular
network of Internet sites, people close to the deal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The complex deal, which is expected to be announced Tuesday,
would create a company valued at $18 billion called USA Lycos. It
would combine Lycos, which offers Internet search services,
information and online communities, with USA Networks' companies
that sell goods on line, on television and over the telephone.
These include the Home Shopping Network, Ticketmaster Online,
Citysearch and ISN First Auction.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Diller, the chairman of USA Networks, would be chairman of
the new company, and Robert J. Davis, the chief executive of Lycos,
would be president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is a bet that the best way to profit from the
huge audience that sites like Lycos have built is not by selling
advertising, as they have done so far, but to sell goods directly
to Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   As users of Lycos search for information about fashion, they
will see cubic zirconium offered by the Home Shopping Network,
local news will be accompanied by nearby concert ticket offerings
from Ticketmaster, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new convergence of entertainment, information and
direct selling,'' said a person close to the deal. For USA, the
deal moves its shopping properties that mostly do business over the
telephone rapidly into the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Electronic commerce has enormous wind at its back,'' this
person said. ``And notwithstanding what people say about the crazy
valuations, over the next two or five years, we will find something
that has a very real base.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late last week, Lycos had been in negotiations to sell a
stake to NBC in return for on-air promotion. However several people
close to the discussions said that the talks had begun to falter.
Talks between Davis and Diller began in earnest last week, and
Lycos was negotiating with both companies for a while before
striking the deal with USA.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is unusually complex because USA has spun off a partial
interest in its Ticketmaster/Citysearch unit to the public. Thus
Lycos will acquire the part of Ticketmaster that USA does not own
for 8.5 percent of the shares of the combined company. And Lycos
will trade a 61.5 interest in return for the Home Shopping Network,
ISN First Auction, and USA's stake in Ticketmaster. USA will have
about 96 percent of the voting rights in the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos and Ticketmaster shareholders will also receive warrants
that would give them the right to increase their stake in the
company by 6.25 percent, but only if its stock market value soars
to the astronomical level of $45 billion. Based on Lycos' closing
share price of $127.25 on Monday, the new company would have a
market value of $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Seagram Corp. owns 45 percent of USA and could have
blocked the deal, its three board members voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   One of several sites that started by helping people search the
Internet, Lycos has moved to keep its audience from surfing away by
offering ever more services from news to chat rooms to electronic
mail. Now known as portal sites _ because they serve as gateways to
all sorts of Internet activities _ Lycos and its competitors Yahoo,
Excite, Infoseek and others have become attractive to big media
companies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last year, the Walt Disney Co. bought half of Infoseek and
incorporated it into its new Go portal. NBC bought a stake in Snap,
a small portal. And so far this year, Excite was bought by At Home,
a service that offers high speed Internet access over cable
television wires. And Yahoo, the leading portal, bought Geocities,
the largest collection of personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos has been on an aggressive acquisition spree, buying a
series of smaller Internet sites to expand its audience. In
December, Lycos was the fourth most popular network of Internet
sites, reaching 26 million people, according to Media Metrix. The
most visited was America Online, followed by Microsoft and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Davis, the chief executive of Lycos, has said that the
company wanted to sell a partial interest to a media company in
order to receive the sort of promotion that Disney is providing to
Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   USA has also been on an aggressive acquisition binge over the
last two years, merging with Ticketmaster in 1997 in a deal valued
at $800 million. It subsequently merged online operations with
Citysearch, an online city guide, and sold 40 percent to the
public. The Ticketmaster online business has a market
capitalization of $4 billion. Last year, the company also swapped
45 percent of its equity for Seagram's Universal Television, USA
Networks and the Sci-fi Channel in a deal valued at $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   USA is effectively spinning off assets that represent 62 percent
of its sales and retaining in the existing company USA Network, the
Sci-fi Channel, Universal Television and the company's 16
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   The businesses contributed by USA represent sales of $1.5
billion and cash flow of $562 million. Lycos had 1998 sales of $56
million. In general, media companies have moderate to high debt
levels, while Internet companies have no debt. The newly combined
entity is a hybrid in that it will have earnings, unlike may
Internet companies, but will carry no debt.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davis will give up effective control of the company, he
will have a new five year contract and the company will keep its
headquarters in Boston.

SASSY SHAQ POWERS LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ First he insulted the city's No. 1 citizen. Then
he threatened to move in next door to him. And if that didn't send
shudders through David Robinson's neighborhood, then Shaquille
O'Neal's nonverbal assault Monday night certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, raising a ruckus as he always does when traveling
through his former hometown, stopped his smack-talking long enough
to engage in his other talent, dunking. He dropped a game-high 26
points on the Spurs to lead an 80-75 Los Angeles Lakers victory at
the Alamodome ... and then, of course, went back to talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known for backing up what I say,'' said O'Neal, who added
13 rebounds. ``We realized that they were going to come out strong
after reading my statement. I do that on purpose to get pumped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But after belittling Robinson and his twin tower, Tim Duncan
(``He's too light''), last month, O'Neal was in a more gracious
mood after the victory, the Lakers' second in three games this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are probably one of the best big-man tandems ever
to play the game,'' O'Neal said. ``And when I go against the best,
it always brings out the best in me.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to have a trickle-down effect on his teammates too.
Eddie Jones snapped out of a two-game funk to score 21 points, and
Kobe Bryant added 19 as O'Neal's Lakers topped Robinson's Spurs for
the fifth straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did Shaq mention he's retiring here? In the same
exclusive, gated community in which Robinson resides?
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother wants to come back here,'' said O'Neal, who lived in
San Antonio for two years and attended Cole High School. ``I'm
buying a house for (my parents). I'm getting one built (for myself)
down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what the 33,788 at the Alamodome, who booed O'Neal lustily
as always, wanted to hear. They were hoping for a preemptive
eviction, but the Spurs failed to get the job done, despite 21
points and 15 rebounds from Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs never led in the final two quarters, but the Lakers
never put them away either. A 3-foot jumper from Mario Elie cut the
lead to 74-73 with 1:56 left in the game, and after an O'Neal
jumper, Robinson made it a two-point game again when he hit one of
two free throws to make it 76-74 with 57.8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Four free throws from Robert Horry and Bryant provided the final
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to work on,'' Robinson said after the Spurs shot
39.7 percent and were crushed in the rebounding battle 51-38.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal wasn't San Antonio's only headache. Jones, who came
into the game having hit 3 of 22 shots, kept his what-me-worry pose
intact and promptly made good on his promise to regain his rhythm.
He hit 3 of 6 in the first quarter and finished 8 for 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everybody it's gonna come,'' said Jones, who came to
the arena early to shoot. But it was a few transition layups that
got his confidence back. ``You got one in the basket, now you feel
like you're gonna get another one.''
</P>
<P>
   His timing couldn't have been better, the Lakers in need of a
win to heal the wounds suffered in Sunday's loss to rival Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big win,'' coach Del Harris said. ``I looked at those
first three games and I said realistically, if we can get two out
of the three, we've done a pretty good job playing these three
monsters in the opening four nights of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' deadly serious Admiral Robinson never directly
addressed O'Neal's antics. O'Neal picked up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   So the fans hate him? Fine. They do everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the only player in the league with many different
rivalries,'' he said. ``It's good to be hated. But when you're
hated, you're respected. They gotta respect my game, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for becoming Mr. Robinson's neighbor?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' O'Neal said, offering one final dig, ``he's gonna be my
neighbor.''

STOIC TYSON A FEARSOME SIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most frightening look I've ever seen on Mike Tyson's face
fell into place Friday as a bailiff put him in handcuffs to lead
him off to jail.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't rage. It wasn't indignation. It wasn't sneering
disdain. It wasn't even fear.
</P>
<P>
   It was none of the above. It was nothing.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reaction at all.
</P>
<P>
   He blinked his eyes once, and a calm, unexpected acceptance
settled over his features. He was totally impassive as a bailiff
slipped the handcuffs on his wrists.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, you see, wears handcuffs like you or I might wear an ID
bracelet. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't wink. He didn't leer at the TV cameras or mug for the
still photographers.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly wouldn't let the Maryland judge who had just
shockingly sentenced him to a year in jail, or the prosecutors who
had argued that he should be imprisoned for punching and kicking
two motorists after a traffic accident, or even his friends or his
weeping wife, know how deeply he had been wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, some way, the system _ boxing, the prison system,
society _ has failed Mike Tyson, and he has certainly failed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing, you can be sure, hasn't seen the last of him, but it had
best start figuring out how to survive without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a part of me that says Mike Tyson seeks a safe place,
that he's afraid of his own violence, to the point that he creates
a situation where he can get back where he feels safe,'' said Don
Beck of the National Values Center in Denton, Texas. ``He may be
saying, `Lock me up before I really do something bad.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The system, or lack of one, is the problem, of course. Boxing is
a dark, deeply troubled sport laced with cancerous corruption and
controlled by larcenous, slimy promoters like Don King.
</P>
<P>
   Until there is some sort of overall governing body that can sort
out and unite all the alphabet organizations, clean up the
corruption, protect the fighters and throw out the unethical,
greedy promoters, boxing will be, at best, a second-rate sport,
dancing in the shadows of its colorful history.
</P>
<P>
   Two rows of seats were reserved for the defendant at Tyson's
trial, and they were jammed with his bodyguards and entourage.
Sadly, there was no one sitting there who didn't have a financial
stake in what was about to transpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that Tyson has never accepted responsibility for
his own actions and that he's been exploited by any number of
people throughout his life's journey,'' Beck said. ``Yet, if he
hadn't been picked up by boxing, he'd probably be dead by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxing can be brutal and it is often peopled with low-income,
wrong-side-of-the-tracks individuals, looking to literally fight
their way to a better life. But it can also be a way out, a haven
from the streets, like it was for Jay Strickland, the former state
Golden Gloves champion and later Texas light heavyweight title
holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 6 years old, I joined the Panther Boys Club,'' said
Strickland, 39, who teaches boxing as an aerobic exercise program
at Cowtown Gym. ``I got picked on all the time because I was a
little skinny kid, and whoever picked on me, I fought 'em. I
figured if I was going to be fighting all the time, I might as well
do it in the ring, with gloves on.''
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't fighting, Strickland was under foot constantly at
the Boys Club, shooting pool, playing pingpong and basketball. He
literally grew up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too busy to get into trouble,'' Strickland said. ``I was
raised right, taught to be polite, and I'm a Christian. When I
walked into the ring, I knew who to talk to, and when I walked out,
I knew who to thank, and it wasn't my trainers or my coach. It was
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson came to boxing off the mean streets of Brooklyn, where, by
the time he was 13, he had been arrested 38 times. He made a
specialty of mugging women, whose packages he offered to carry from
the grocery store to their apartment elevators.
</P>
<P>
   A good boy he was not.
</P>
<P>
   Cus D'Amato, the old boxing trainer who had managed and trained
Floyd Patterson, literally took Tyson to raise, strapped on the
gloves and tried to harness the rage inside a canvas ring bound by
velvet ropes. By the time he was 19, Tyson was 10-0 with 10
knockouts and on his way to becoming perhaps the most feared
heavyweight fighter of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I knew, myself included, loved Tyson when he first
started showing up on TV and winning,'' Strickland said. ``He
didn't say anything. He just got in the ring and fought.''
</P>
<P>
   For a generation raised on MTV and violent, R-rated movies,
Tyson was A Nightmare on Elm Street come to life, a flesh and blood
Freddie Kruger.
</P>
<P>
   He would stalk into the ring with no formalities, no robe, just
black shorts, black shoes without socks, his skin oiled and
glistening, his muscles bulging. With his hulking shoulders, his
arms dangling, he was primordial man, a throwback to another world,
and we shivered as we watched him destroy opponent after opponent.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who loved him there, in the ring, who
worshipped the power and violence he represented. What we didn't
especially like was when he climbed through those ropes and back
into our world, because we could never be sure he knew the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned him into a mercenary, almost a killer-type,'' Beck
said.
</P>
<P>
   We couldn't control him, though, and obviously he couldn't
control himself.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has often aroused our emotions: excitement, apprehension,
anger, dismay, repugnance, all those and more.
</P>
<P>
   But when the handcuffs came out and that impassive veil fell
across Tyson's face Friday _ a look we've seen before because it's
the one he's always worn as he climbed into the ring _ the only
thing left was an unexpected sadness at the waste of it all.

RANGERS, SELE MEET IN MIDDLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander Aaron Sele, who Monday became
the highest-paid starting pitcher in Texas Rangers history, could
become a free agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers avoided Thursday's scheduled arbitration hearing in
Tampa, Fla., after the two parties reached agreement on a one-year
contract worth $5,525,000.
</P>
<P>
   The figure represents the midpoint of the salaries exchanged for
the hearing. Sele's representative, Adam Katz, submitted a figure
of $6.25 million. The Rangers countered with an offer of $4.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who enters this season with five years and 104 days of
major-league service time, could become eligible for free agency
after this season. The two parties discussed a multiyear contract
briefly, but the focus of the negotiations were on a contract for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Adam about it, but we wanted to get the one year
done first,'' said Rangers general manager Doug Melvin, who
acknowledged that discussions regarding an extension could occur.
``There's always the possibility of it. We're always open to
long-term negotiations. If they want to make a proposal, I'll be
more than glad to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who ranked fifth in victories among major-league pitchers
for 1998, went 19-11 with a 4.23 earned-run average. That propelled
him toward Monday's financial bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of guys who are making more than him,'' Melvin
said. ``I guess it's just the way the game is going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' agreement with Sele leaves right-hander Danny
Patterson as their only unsigned player of major significance.
Signing Patterson will not be difficult because he lacks the
necessary playing time to be eligible for arbitration or free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's comforting to know that you're going to camp with all of
your players under contract,'' Melvin said.

HELLS ANGEL `LEGEND' RUNS MOTORCYCLE SHOP NEAR PHOENIX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BRENT WHITING  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Ralph ``Sonny'' Barger, the legendary leader of the
notorious Hells Angels motorcycle gang, looked out from federal
prison north of Phoenix and liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   That was a few years ago. Now, Sonny Barger's back, this time
moving to New River and opening a Harley-Davidson motorcycle shop
and garage in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Barger, 60, founder of the Oakland chapter of the Hells Angels
in 1957, said he joined the Cave Creek chapter of the gang but has
not assumed any leadership roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still active in the Angels,'' he said. ``I hope to be
until I die.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and polite as he sat in his Glendale office, Barger
spoke in soft tones as he pushed a patch on his throat that covers
a hole from 1983 surgery to remove a cancerous larynx.
</P>
<P>
   A sign in the office offers what Barger described as one of his
basic philosophies: ``If they treat me good, I treat them better.
If they treat me bad, I treat 'em worse.''
</P>
<P>
   A plaque shows Barger on a motorcycle, with the inscription:
``Sonny Barger _ American Legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Barger, who is small in stature compared with his king-size
reputation, is still regarded by police as a worldwide leader of
the famous biker group, though Barger disputes the extent of his
current role.
</P>
<P>
   He was released from custody in November 1992, after serving
four years for conspiring to blow up the clubhouse of the Outlaws,
a rival motorcycle group in Oakland. He says it was a bum rap.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said it took him a few years to wind up his business
affairs in Oakland and set up his Glendale shop, Sonny Barger
Motors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I had to wait until we (the Angels) had a club here, and
then I transferred,'' Barger said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is fertile ground for expansion by the Hells Angels,
just as California was 25 years ago, Barger said. Besides Cave
Creek, there are Arizona chapters in Phoenix, Mesa, Flagstaff and
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there are more than three dozen chapters in 18
states. There are also chapters in Canada, 11 European countries,
Australia, Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said he was attracted to the Hells Angels because of the
1954 movie ``The Wild One.'' It was the Lee Marvin character as a
cruel biker, not the starring role by Marlon Brando as a cool
rebel, that caught his fancy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale and Phoenix police said they are aware of Barger's
presence, but gang detectives were cautious in discussing Barger or
the Hells Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no problems coming from his business,'' said
Chris Briggs, a Glendale detective. ``And nothing at this time
leads us to believe there will be any problems in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Gary Myers, another Glendale gang detective, said he
was greeted by groans when he announced at a meeting of the
Glendale Mayor's Alliance Against Gangs and Drugs that Barger was
moving his business to Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless him,'' said Sgt. D.P. Davis, a member of the Phoenix
police organized-crime bureau. ``We wish him well in his business,
as we would any businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson portrayed Barger in the 1967
book ``Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the
Motorcycle Outlaws,'' with this description:
</P>
<P>
   ``In any gathering of Hell's Angels . . . there is no doubt who
is running the show: Ralph `Sonny' Barger, the maximum leader, a
6-foot, 170-pound warehouseman from east Oakland, the coolest head
in the lot, and a tough, quick-thinking dealer when any action
starts. By turns he is a fanatic, a philosopher, a brawler, a
shrewd compromiser and a final arbitrator.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the self-effacing Barger said that he was less than
impressed by the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely a joke,'' he said. ``It was terrible. The
writer, he's a good writer, but he just doesn't stick too much to
the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Barger said, he's 5 feet 9 inches tall, not 6
feet, and weighed about 145 pounds when Thompson wrote the book.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said Hells Angels often gets an unfair rap in the media,
especially because of tales by paid government informants such as
Anthony Tait, a former infiltrator.
</P>
<P>
   Tait, who is in a federal witness-protection program, was the
subject of an April 1997 story by the Associated Press in which he
claimed that Hells Angels was about to open a new chapter in
Arizona and gain access to the state's methamphetamine market.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said he's acquainted with Tait but the man lacks
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember Anthony Tait will say anything the
government wants him to say,'' Barger said. ``They pay him. He
works for them now. He's no longer with Hells Angels. He's a rat.''
</P>
<P>
   Barger said that Tait's allegations are unfair and that Hells
Angels members are not involved with methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   He also blamed government chicanery for a conviction that in
1988 sent him to the federal prison near Interstate 17 and the
Carefree Highway.
</P>
<P>
   After his release from custody, hundreds of people showed up in
Oakland for a parole party, including U.S. Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, D-Colo., described by Barger as a personal friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken an awful lot of heat for being my friend,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said that during his life, he has spent more than a dozen
years in prison, but he described the experience as part of growing
up, just like going to school or joining the Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all helps you to have a well-rounded life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that at the urging of friends in Hells Angels, he is
working with two Oakland writers on a book about his life that he
expects to go to press next year.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said he hopes to parlay the book into a lucrative movie
deal that will allow him to retire. He said he hasn't given much
thought to what actor would portray him in the film. &QL;

TICKETS REASONABLE AT STAPLES CENTER, KINGS EXEC SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Staples Center is being billed as, ``The
Entertainment Capitol of the Entertainment Capital.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tim Leiweke, president of both the Los Angeles Kings
and the $350-million arena in downtown Los Angeles scheduled to
open in October, doesn't want that to scare people off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will guarantee you flat out that season-ticket holders are
not going to get priced out of this building,'' Leiweke said.
``Some areas of the Staples Center will be lower-priced than in the
Forum, not all but some. We're going to be very aggressive to make
sure a family of four can walk into the Staples Center on a nightly
basis and get in for less than $100, and that's for everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will some areas go up? Probably. But that will be tied to
payroll and the performance of the team. But our season-ticket
holders will be very, very happy with the way we price out the new
arena. This building is not going to be for the corporate elite.
It's going to be for everybody, and we better price ourselves
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't take long to find out for certain whether the Kings'
actions will match Leiweke's promising words. The Kings _ whose
average ticket price this season is $37.62 _ are expected to
announce their 1999-2000 ticket prices sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   It is in large part because of the revenue generated by the
suites and the arena's Premier seating plan (the Forum's equivalent
is its Senate seats) that Leiweke can make promises about flat
ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the real fan who can't spend bezillions of dollars for
front-row seats,'' Staples Center general manager Bobby Goldwater
said, ``this building will be open to them, and we want them to
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' average announced home attendance this season at the
Forum is just above 12,000, and in terms of actual bodies in the
Forum on most nights, it is below that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the new building cannot be used as an illusion that
suddenly all our ills go away and we'll be sold out every night,''
Leiweke said. ``The lesson is, eventually the building wears off.
If you think a building is enough to sell out a hockey game, then I
think we underestimate the shrewdness of the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways to spend money here. Clearly, the new
building will boost attendance. It will be phenomenal. Still, if we
don't put a competitive team on the ice, we're going to struggle.
If we can put a competitive team on the ice combined with the new
arena, I think you'll see a majority of our games sold out next
year.'' &UR; !end! &QL;

NORTHRIDGE'S INTERIM COACH LEARNING ALONG WITH PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The season hadn't even started and the Cal State
Northridge women's basketball team had already gone through two
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a team vote, assistant coach Frozena Jerro _ two years
removed from coaching junior high _ became the interim coach.
</P>
<P>
   So Jerro, inheriting a less-than-stellar situation, steps in and
leads CSUN to second place in the Big Sky Conference, putting the
Matadors on track to record their best season since moving to
Division I.
</P>
<P>
   Interim athletic director Sam Jankovich _ who's said he'll
conduct a national search for a full-time coach _ will be forced to
make a tough decision should the team continue to win. Hire a new
coach or keep Jerro on permanently?
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a great barometer,'' Jankovich said. ``We're going to
get the best basketball coach we can get, but yet, they're going to
have to compare to her, and that's a pretty good comparison. We're
going to have her as the person everyone has to measure up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Jerro's accomplishments weigh in her favor. The team
is playing well and Jerro has brought a strong, positive presence
to a program in need of good public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, I hope it would be done for the team,''
Jerro, 27, said. ``But I definitely would like to be here next
year. It's weird because I know the season is coming to an end, and
there's a whole lot of uncertainty once it gets there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I'm happy because I know where we can be toward the
end of the season, but at the same time it's a little ...
unnerving.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of season.
</P>
<P>
   To recap, Matadors coach Michael Abraham was arrested in late
October and charged with cocaine trafficking. It was later learned
that athletic director Paul Bubb was approached nearly two years
before by players concerned there was a link between Abraham and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb, who found nothing to support the players' concerns, shared
the speculation only with Judy Brame, his top assistant. That was
discovered after Brame spent a week as CSUN's interim head coach.
She was forced to resign and accepted reassignment to the
kinesiology department.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Jerro took over. Players have warmed to her and
aren't sure if they would want to stick with the program after
another coaching change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'd do,'' said All-American sophomore guard
Edneisha Curry. ``We like her, and that's why I had so much
confidence when we voted for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's changed a little on the court. We were used to the shy
Coach Fro. Then one day she comes in and she's blowing the whistle
and yelling and telling us what to do. But off the court she's
still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   As Curry put it, Jerro even has the ``head coach stance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She stomps her feet, puts her hands over her head and gives a
look like, `Why did you do that?''' Curry said. ``It was a whole
change within one day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not only the personality that's attracted the players to
Jerro, but also the results.
</P>
<P>
   While holding the team together during an ugly time, she's
allowed them to prosper. At 14-6 (8-2 Big Sky), the Matadors are a
victory away from setting the school's season record at the
Division I level.
</P>
<P>
   When the season was teetering on collapse after three
consecutive losses left CSUN 4-4, Jerro rallied the Matadors to
nine wins in their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   And she's done it with a staff that consists of USC graduate
Karon Howell and former Stanford guard Tara Harrington, both of
whom are in their first year of college coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took us up on this offer, and I knew she had a lot to
learn, just like we had a lot to learn,'' junior guard Jamilah
Jones said. ``She's learned stuff. You can see it. We'd be up by a
lot and then things would change. She's learned a lot about
subbing, and how to deal with each one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the inexperience is always questioned, and it's kept
her from being named CSUN's coach permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago she was coaching at King Junior High in Berkeley.
Before that she was a graduate assistant at the University of
Houston after playing at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the head coaching job is recruiting, and Jerro hasn't
done much of it. She was in charge of recruiting under Abraham, but
it was widely recognized Abraham brought in most of the players.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, which has two scholarships available, had two players
ready to sign national letters of intent. They pulled back when
Abraham was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was going to be my year to prove I could do that job,''
Jerro said. ``If you can't get players, you can't win. That's what
this business is about, being able to get players.''
</P>
<P>
   She's shown that so far this season. Now, will she get the
chance in seasons to come?

MULAN CHARGES INTO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The great wall between Beijing and Hollywood has
been breached as the Chinese government announced it will allow The
Walt Disney Co.'s ``Mulan'' to be shown in theaters later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Disney said on Monday that a Mandarin-dubbed version of the
animated hit, which has grossed about $300 million worldwide, will
begin showings Feb. 23 after the weeklong lunar new year holiday
ends. Martial arts star Jackie Chan will be the voice of Shan-Yu,
the film's chief villain, and other prominent Asian actors also are
participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan,'' based on a Chinese folk story of a young woman who
disguises herself as a man to fight off Hun invaders, had been
blocked from the world's most populous nation since its release
last summer due to China's anger over Disney's 1997 release of
``Kundun.'' The Martin Scorsese film, which did poorly at the
domestic box office, detailed the life of the Dalai Lama and
China's occupation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Mulan' will be well-received in China because the
story is really ingrained in their culture,'' said Dennis Speigel,
a theme park consultant who has worked on Chinese projects for more
than a decade. ``The movie takes some artistic license but I think
they'll enjoy it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government currently allows 10 American films in per
year on a revenue-sharing basis but Disney has not been in the
market since 1996's ``The Rock.'' Its animated movies have not been
seen there since ``Toy Story'' and ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   China has offered little comment on its policy toward ``Mulan,''
which was based on a 12th century poem. A spokesman for Disney said
the length of the movie's stay in China will be decided by the
state-run China Film monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to relent on ``Mulan'' could represent a thawing of
resistance to American movies in China. The Motion Picture
Association of America recently said China's system included heavy
taxes and an ``unwritten system of quotas'' for movies, home video
and TV programs.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney does not stand to make much money initially
from ``Mulan'' since the company's after-tax share of revenues is
estimated to be 25 percent of box office receipts. Admission prices
may be as high as $3 in China's major cities but elsewhere are
likely to be 5 or 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is also widely believed to be exploring the possibility
of creating a theme park near Hong Kong. No timetable has been set,
but analysts say it would take at least a decade.

GOLAY EAGER TO SHOW HER TALENTS AT USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She sits anonymously on the bench during USC
women's basketball games, a lanky blonde in street clothes, lost
amid the ever-growing list of players sidelined with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But Danielle Golay is not injured. And she is not crazy,
although that is what practically every one of her friends thought
last year when the highly regarded 6-foot-2 forward decided to
leave Seton Hall and play her senior season at USC.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer with only one year of eligibility remaining usually
makes little sense, especially when that transfer was the Big East
Conference's second-leading rebounder (8.2 per game) and
fourth-leading scorer (17.2 points) last season.
</P>
<P>
   And those attributes aren't even what has impressed her
teammates most in practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's like a Larry Bird, but at the post,'' USC point guard
Kristin Clark said. ``She makes great passes. Danielle is a
big-time player.''
</P>
<P>
   No one outside of practices at USC's North Gym has gotten a
glimpse of Golay yet, as she spends this season redshirting. She
has no second thoughts, however, or worries about getting a little
rusty, as she waits for her lone season with the Women of Troy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost like 25 pounds my last semester at Seton Hall,'' Golay
said. ``I never knew stress would make you lose weight. It was real
dirty when I left.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no sinister reason Golay departed Seton Hall. With two
women's professional basketball leagues just starting, she decided
that she needed to transfer to a bigger program to try to improve
her game against superior competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to regret not playing at a better school,''
Golay said. ``My game did improve at Seton Hall, but for future
growth, I wouldn't have felt positive trying to play
(professionally). Skills I needed to have I wouldn't have had. I
wanted to be able to go to a tryout and feel confident when I tried
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Things became messy once Golay decided to leave. She was one of
five players who left Seton Hall for various reason. But none hurt
as much as the star player's exodus, and Golay feels like she
barely survived her final months at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like they were blaming us for leaving. It was a real
stressful, unneeded situation,'' Golay said. ``I got kicked out of
the weight room, the gym. We couldn't use any of the athletic
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The wounds over Golay's departure have not yet healed. Seton
Hall coach Phyllis Mangina declined to be interviewed for this
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope five, six years from now, she can admit this was the
best situation for me,'' Golay said.
</P>
<P>
   How Golay ended up at USC is almost a fluke. She wanted to
transfer to a school in California, and played against the Trojans
and UCLA last year in the Pac-10/Big East Challenge Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Golay was named to the all-tournament team, along with Clark.
The pair struck up a conversation out on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know her. She didn't know me,'' Golay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she was unhappy. And I told her we needed post
players,'' Clark added.
</P>
<P>
   The two eventually became friends and began speaking on the
phone. Golay quickly decided she wanted to play at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even come here to see the campus,'' Golay said. ``If
we hadn't played SC, I probably wouldn't have really known about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Golay eventually wrote a letter to Gobrecht, asking for a
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Golay scored a career-high 29 points and
grabbed eight rebounds against USC. But what impressed Gobrecht
more was the way Golay acted when she struggled the following night
against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never stopped coaching her teammates,'' Gobrecht said.
``She's a terrific leader out there. That's what I really liked
about her. It turned out to be one of the best decisions I made.
She has the best demeanor I've ever witnessed on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership is a quality sorely missing from recent USC
basketball teams. Injuries have decimated the Women of Troy, who
are 6-14 this season, but Gobrecht also craves a player willing to
be a vocal leader, which USC hasn't had since Tina Thompson
graduated two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk a lot. I say what's on my mind. I'm not afraid to tell
my teammates if she is messing up,'' Golay said. ``I don't really
consider myself a leader. I was always a class clown.''
</P>
<P>
   Golay's ease to speak her mind isn't restricted to her
teammates. Ask her any question, and she'll say the first thing
that pops into her head.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding her major, computer science, she says, ``I have no
clue about it. But I want to have a job where I can make a lot of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Golay, who intends to become the first member of her family to
graduate from college, isn't spending too much time worrying about
being a computer programmer or playing pro basketball right now.
Her immediate goal is to have a successful senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely anxious. But if I let it overcome what I'm
trying to work on, it's a waste of a year,'' she said. ``I mentally
prepared myself before I came out here. Now, I'm taking it as a
year to work on a lot of things.''

BARRIO RESIDENTS SEE 2 SETS OF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``To conclude that perjury and obstruction of justice are
acceptable if committed by a popular president . . . sets America
on the road back to an imperial presidency above the law.'' &QL; 
_ Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, during closing arguments Monday in
the impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Ariz. _ Unlike in the nation's Capitol, in the barrio
of Glendale, Ariz., there is little peace, little prosperity and
Louie Valenzuela says almost no one is above the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one gets breaks like President Clinton,'' Valenzuela says
in Spanish, standing in front of a colorful mural of farm labor
activist Cesar Chavez. ``It seems like there's two sets of laws.
One for people with money and one for people like us.''
</P>
<P>
   People in Glendale (here it's pronounced Glan-del) know about
dual justice. Day and night. Year after year. Nothing changes.
Justice doesn't come here very often, they say, because they are
poor, Hispanic and immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president does not suffer the legal and constitutional
consequences of his actions, the impact . . . will be felt for
generations to come.'' &QL; 
_ Sensenbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Jimmy Morales is part of that coming generation.
He says he got busted last week for violating curfew after his mom
sent him to buy milk for the next morning's breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' family says they can't pay the fine. But when Rosa
Martinez's car tires were slashed, the police never showed up. ``It
seems like people in the barrio don't matter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To proceed in a manner that will be trusted and viewed as
legitimate by the American people. . . . You must do this with an
obvious commitment to your oath to do justice impartially according
to the Constitution and the law.'' &QL; 
_ Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about justice,'' Valenzuela said. ``They talk about
doing the right thing. But they always look the other way when
someone rich, famous or powerful does something wrong. Look at O.J.
Simpson. Clinton will be next. `Asi es.' (That's just the way it
is).''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Valenzuela's neighbors have now gathered before the
mural _ all eager to talk about barrio justice and the Washington
scandal. Raymond Chavez told about the hassles he gets when he
drives his lowrider car around town on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm driving too slow. I didn't use my turn signal. It's always
something,'' he says. ``I haven't broken any laws like the
president did. But I'm just a construction worker and he's the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``When this trial began four long weeks ago, we said that what was
on trial was the truth and the rule of law. . . . The truth is
still the truth, and a lie is still a lie, and the rule of law
should apply to everyone.'' &QL; 
_ Sensenbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Flores, 17, is working to get his GED. His mother had been
dreaming of him graduating with the rest of his class, but he got
kicked out of school.
</P>
<P>
   Flores said someone tagged the bathroom walls with graffiti
minutes before he walked in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I was in there, they think I did it. But they
didn't find any spray cans on me or in the restroom,'' says Flores,
wearing crisp, baggy chino pants and a white T-shirt. ``People
don't care about the truth. They just care about the easy way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators today will begin deliberating the charges against
Clinton. A vote is expected by week's end, but people in Glendale
say they already know the outcome. And it will be the easy way
out. &QL; 
As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie Amparano
will be taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care
about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers. &QL;

HIGH-PROFILE JASPER TRIAL CONTINUES AMID BISCUITS-AND-GRAVY
TRADITION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ One prospective juror taught the defendant high
school English. Another hired him to help install a metal roof.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the would-be jurors being interviewed in the Jasper
trial of John William ``Bill'' King greet the trial judge, Joe Bob
Golden, by name like old friends as they climb into the witness
stand to be questioned. That's because they are old friends. Others
greet lawyers, court assistants, guards or clerks as friends,
fellow church members or neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to high-profile criminal court action in a small town.
</P>
<P>
   King, 24, another hometown boy, is on trial for his life. He is
the first of three white men to go on trial for capital murder in
the June 7 dragging death of a black man, James Byrd Jr., 49,
another well-known local.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, King could face execution by injection.
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness of what's at stake doesn't keep his
court-appointed attorneys from sitting down in a courthouse
basement kitchen with the judge and a few reporters and prosecutors
for biscuits and gravy cooked by county Treasurer Mary Jane
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of making sausage gravy and biscuits in the
kitchen in the courthouse basement began with Phil Denny, an
investigator for the district attorney's office, Hancock said.
``Now we do it once a month or every six weeks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When biscuit day came last week, the kitchen _ or at least the
informal meeting room attached to it _ had become a press room for
the media covering King's trial, with a speaker offering an audio
feed from the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the biscuits and gravy tradition and the few
newspeople who were around that morning were invited to join in.
</P>
<P>
   When Sheriff Billy Rowles sat down to enjoy his plate, he was
asked if he was going to take some to King, who was waiting two
floors above for court to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already had his breakfast,'' Rowles said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitality doesn't keep Beaumont attorneys C. Haden
``Sonny'' Cribbs Jr. and Brack Jones from grousing about having to
make the 72-mile trip from Beaumont and back again every day or
putting their regular practices aside while they represent King.
But they admit there are a few perks.
</P>
<P>
   Take the killer bread pudding from the county jail, where King
is being held during the trial. ``This is the best bread pudding I
have ever had,'' Cribbs beamed as he held a big chunk of the gummy,
raisin-rich delicacy wrapped in aluminum foil.
</P>
<P>
   Rowles brags that the chef in his jail used to be the head chef
at one of the town's better restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The jail is in the Aubrey E. Cole Law Enforcement Center, which
also houses the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   The real Aubrey E. Cole, 72, who was sheriff from 1973-91, has
also been in the courtroom during jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers use high-priced psychologists as experts to help
pick ideal jurors. Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray
asked folks like Cole to volunteer to help him pick a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's daughter, Novie Hammock, is Gray's administrative
assistant and she said when she started noticing that a lot of
prospective jurors were from the southern part of the long, thin
county, she asked her dad to come and see if he knew any of them.
He lives near Buna, in the southern end of the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I know everybody in this county,'' the former sheriff
drawled, ``or I know their mommas and poppas or at least some of
their cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers have spent the past two weeks winnowing a group of 125
jurors into a panel of 50, including seven blacks. Each side _
prosecution and defense _ on Wednesday will have the opportunity to
strike people from that list until 12 jurors and two alternates are
left. Testimony is to begin Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the prospects are enigmas, but others are much more
known.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Texas Department of Public Safety trooper who spent 13
years as a patrol partner with Sheriff Rowles when Rowles was also
a state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, such a law-and-order professional might be
expected to side with the prosecution if he got on the jury. But
Rowles said that might not be so.
</P>
<P>
   He said his former partner is such a stickler for detail, so
demanding that everything be done just so, that he would never vote
to find somebody guilty of anything unless prosecutors absolutely
proved their case.
</P>
<P>
   And Cribbs said that knowing a juror isn't always an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one case in Beaumont that had one of my personal friends
on the jury panel,'' he said. ``The prosecutor didn't ask if he
knew me and I didn't ask and he got put on the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked to killed me,'' Cribbs said. ``He wanted to be so
sure that he was fair and that our friendship didn't sway him that
he went the other way just to make sure he was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The 110-year-old First Judicial District courtroom is fairly
informal. Golden, who has been on the bench for 10 years, said he
feels no need to wear judicial robes. ``I just wear a suit,'' he
said. ``The people here know to take these issues serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden often answers his own phone, since he doesn't have a
secretary. The judge, who was a champion golfer during his days at
the University of Texas, came here 28 years ago. (His daughter,
Kate, is a professional golfer).
</P>
<P>
   Golden was the first law clerk of U.S. District Judge Joe
Fisher, then a law partner of Joe Tonahill, a high-profile Jasper
lawyer, now semi-retired, who defended the likes of Jack Ruby.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor toward would-be jurors _ who are, after all,
would-be voters _ is friendly and almost courtly.
</P>
<P>
   Most prospective jurors were solemn, some even frightened, when
they took the witness stand for questioning. One young woman was an
exception. Although she confessed she was nervous, she also laughed
and said she just wanted to do what was right. She said she didn't
think she could give anybody the death penalty _ an automatic
reason to be excused in a capital murder case.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to start her jury service with a less critical case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me an easy one,'' she said, ``an insurance case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a delightful young lady,'' Golden said, almost
fatherly. ``You're very refreshing. You're also excused.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman took the witness stand and announced that the district
attorney's father had been her teacher in the town of Bleakwood a
good many years earlier. Although she clearly remembered that and
going to school with Gray's sister, she said that these days her
short-term memory wasn't so good. She felt that she just couldn't
be a juror. She won't be.
</P>
<P>
   King's father, 68-year-old retired sawmill worker Ronald King,
has attended most sessions of the trial so far. Most of the time he
drives himself there, although he goes to and from the courtroom in
a wheelchair and usually breathes oxygen from a bottle to ease the
effects of emphysema. At least once, sheriff's deputies gave him a
ride, and deputies and sometimes news media help him get to and
from his car.
</P>
<P>
   He said he feels like he needs to support his son. ``He tells me
he wasn't there (at Byrd's murder) and I have to believe him,'' the
older man said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terrible thing,'' he said of Byrd's murder. ``I can
see how his family was hurt too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't representative of the people of Jasper,'' the elder
King said. ``This is a good town. People get along together here.
This town doesn't have that kind of hate.''

MULAN CHARGES INTO CHINA

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The great wall between Beijing and Hollywood has
been breached as the Chinese government announced it will allow The
Walt Disney Co.'s ``Mulan'' to be shown in theaters later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Disney said on Monday that a Mandarin-dubbed version of the
animated hit, which has grossed about $300 million worldwide, will
begin showings Feb. 23 after the weeklong lunar new year holiday
ends. Martial arts star Jackie Chan will be the voice of Shan-Yu,
the film's chief villain, and other prominent Asian actors also are
participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan,'' based on a Chinese folk story of a young woman who
disguises herself as a man to fight off Hun invaders, had been
blocked from the world's most populous nation since its release
last summer due to China's anger over Disney's 1997 release of
``Kundun.'' The Martin Scorsese film, which did poorly at the
domestic box office, detailed the life of the Dalai Lama and
China's occupation of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think `Mulan' will be well-received in China because the
story is really ingrained in their culture,'' said Dennis Speigel,
a theme park consultant who has worked on Chinese projects for more
than a decade. ``The movie takes some artistic license but I think
they'll enjoy it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government currently allows 10 American films in per
year on a revenue-sharing basis but Disney has not been in the
market since 1996's ``The Rock.'' Its animated movies have not been
seen there since ``Toy Story'' and ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   China has offered little comment on its policy toward ``Mulan,''
which was based on a 12th century poem. A spokesman for Disney said
the length of the movie's stay in China will be decided by the
state-run China Film monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to relent on ``Mulan'' could represent a thawing of
resistance to American movies in China. The Motion Picture
Association of America recently said China's system included heavy
taxes and an ``unwritten system of quotas'' for movies, home video
and TV programs.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney does not stand to make much money initially
from ``Mulan'' since the company's after-tax share of revenues is
estimated to be 25 percent of box office receipts. Admission prices
may be as high as $3 in China's major cities but elsewhere are
likely to be 5 or 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Disney is also widely believed to be exploring the possibility
of creating a theme park near Hong Kong. No timetable has been set,
but analysts say it would take at least a decade.

 SENATE HEARS FINAL PLEAS IN CLINTON TRIAL  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Culminating a months-long quest to remove President
Clinton from office, House Republicans urged the Senate Monday to
convict him ``for the sake of justice and for the sake of the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe he's a victim, you ought to acquit him,'' said
Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., summing up the case against Clinton.
``If you believe he is lying, he ought not to be our president.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final day for arguments, White House lawyers countered
that the 13 House prosecutors have failed to establish any criminal
wrongdoing or present compelling evidence that the president's
conduct constitutes a ``danger to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Would it put at risk the liberties of the people to retain the
president in office?'' asked White House counsel Charles Ruff.
``Putting aside partisan animus, if you can honestly say that it
would not _ that those liberties are safe in his hands _ then you
must vote to acquit.''
</P>
<P>
   The now-familiar positions were delivered as the impeachment
trial entered its fifth and _ barring any surprising developments _
final week. All that remains is for senators to deliberate _ a
process that will begin today _ and cast votes on the two articles
of impeachment. The final vote has been scheduled for no later than
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As 98 senators watched the final arguments from their seats _
two were excused to attend the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein _
no one doubted the final outcome. Sixty-seven votes are required to
remove the president from office, and some Republicans acknowledged
that neither article is likely to attract much more than 50 votes;
the perjury count may not even muster a 51-vote majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might not even get a majority,'' on that count said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Less certain is the outcome of a procedural vote Tuesday on
whether the Senate will open its final deliberations to the public.
Senate rules call for deliberations _ 15 minutes of speaking time
are allotted to each senator _ to be conducted in private.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and a small band of Republicans support a motion to
open the procedures to the public, which will be the first order of
business when the trial convenes Tuesday at 1 p.m. EST. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., indicated that he opposes that
effort, and last night it appeared that advocates of an open debate
lacked the 67 votes needed to amend the Senate's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's closing arguments tread over familiar ground. After six
days of opening arguments and many hours in debate over motions,
most of the points made Monday _ and much of the rhetoric _ had
already been covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us may have a sense that we've gone well beyond Yogi
Berra-land to deja vu all over again and all over again and all
over again,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   All 13 managers delivered final statements, which consumed
nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that Clinton's efforts to conceal his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky turned criminal once
it became an issue in Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trial is not about the president's affair with Monica
Lewinsky,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. ``It is about the
perjury and obstruction of justice he committed during the course
of the civil rights lawsuit filed against him and the subsequent
independent counsel investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``lies to the grand jury were not to protect his
family or the dignity of his office,'' Sensenbrenner added, ``but
to protect himself from criminal liability for his perjury and
obstruction of justice in the Jones case.''
</P>
<P>
   Peppered with emotional oratory and sometimes shrill insults,
the Republicans portrayed Clinton as a habitual liar who would have
demonized Lewinsky and denied the relationship altogether had it
not been for the discovery of his DNA on one of her dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House is the bully pulpit, but it should never be
occupied by a bully,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The managers also confronted the widely held belief that
Clinton's lack of candor and misleading testimony are less
significant because of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you accept the argument that, `It's just about sex,' you
will render the law of sexual harassment virtually meaningless. Any
defendant guilty of sexual harassment would obviously have an
incentive to lie about any sexual misconduct that may have
occurred,'' said Charles Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sake of justice and for the sake of the Constitution,
this president should be convicted and removed,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In his conclusion, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the
House Judiciary Committee, acknowledged that the push for Clinton's
removal has not been politically popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media condemnations, the patronizing editorials, the hate
mail, the insults hurled in public, the attempts at intimidation,
the death threats and even the disapproval of our colleagues, which
cuts the worst,'' he said, ticking off some rewards of the GOP
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have risked that for a principle, for our duty as we have
seen it,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, in an uninterrupted almost two-hour summation of the White
House defense, tried to poke holes in the specific allegations
against Clinton and said the entire case amounted to ``moving
targets and empty pots.''
</P>
<P>
   He mocked the prosecutor's claims of ``seven pillars of
obstruction,'' renaming them ``shifting sand-castles of
speculation,'' and played video clips of Lewinsky's testimony in
which she says the president never encouraged her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff ridiculed the GOP assertion that Clinton masterminded a
conspiracy to conceal the relationship, saying at one point: ``With
all due respect, somebody's been watching too many reruns of `The
X-Files.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You must decide whether, on these facts, arising out of these
circumstances, this president has so endangered the state that we
can no longer countenance his remaining in office,'' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   In a final bid to present more evidence, Hyde asked Senate
leaders to approve three subpoenas for additional witnesses who
have cast doubt on sworn testimony given by White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal. Daschle said Democrats were prepared to object if any
GOP senator sought approval for the request. ``We don't need
additional witnesses,'' he said at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal has denied repeating to reporters a story that he
says Clinton told him the day the Lewinsky story became public _
that she was known as a ``stalker'' and made a sexual demand on the
president.
</P>
<P>
   In sworn affidavits in recent days, free-lance journalist
Christopher Hitchens and his wife, Carol Blue, said that Blumenthal
had told them at a lunch in March 1998 that Lewinsky was known as a
stalker.

 FEINSTEIN PUTS HER POWERS TO THE TEST  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has long relished
her role as an independent negotiator who can forge common ground _
on matters ranging from the Headwaters to health care _ and rescue
public policy from a bitter stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Never have the stakes been higher than now, as the prospect of
President Clinton's acquittal on perjury and obstruction of justice
charges lies just days away.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since it became clear that the Senate would not remove
Clinton from office, Feinstein has labored over a censure
resolution that would, as she put it, ``go down in history, that
will also become part of the legacy of this president, that in
essence will say we find these acts to be egregious.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she herself will vote for acquittal on the two
articles of impeachment, but she does not want Clinton to walk away
free from the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do most of her colleagues. The crucial element of
success for her censure motion is in hand: a strong sense among
Democrats and Republicans alike that although Clinton will be
acquitted, the Senate should make clear that it is not exonerating
the president or allowing him to claim vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's tremendous support, bipartisan support, for this
censure resolution,'' said Rhode Island Republican John Chafee.
``It isn't just Democrats. It's not just Republicans. It's both.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet seldom have the political, procedural and historical cross
currents working against compromise been more treacherous.
</P>
<P>
   Time, wording of the resolution, and the urge by hard-core
Clinton opponents and supporters to force politicians to stand by a
simple yes or no vote all conspire against a censure.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing problem is time. The impeachment trial will
end as early as Thursday, and almost certainly no later than
Friday. Feinstein's censure resolution would have its best chance
of passage immediately after the trial ends, before the Senate
recesses for a weeklong holiday.
</P>
<P>
   A delay until after the recess could undercut the momentum for a
censure. For weeks, senators have sat silently at their desks
listening to arguments from the House prosecutors and White House
lawyers, unable to do anything else except watch their poll numbers
sink.
</P>
<P>
   After a weeklong break, politicians on both sides may have
little appetite to revisit an unpopular issue and will doubtless be
restless to take up other business.
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein has pledged to press forward no matter how long it
takes. ``If we have to put it on every single piece of legislation
that comes down the pike,'' Feinstein said Sunday, ``the president
of the United States will come out of this with no less than a
major censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he wants
to offer the censure right after the trial ends _ but that brings
up yet another problem.
</P>
<P>
   Procedural hurdles, including a filibuster threat from Texas
Republican Phil Gramm, could prevent censure from even reaching a
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming a Gramm filibuster will require 60 votes. Bringing up
a freestanding resolution also requires the unanimous consent of
all 100 senators, which is clearly not possible with any censure
proposal. It would therefore have to be attached to another piece
of legislation _ what exactly, no one knows.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said only that he would ``be looking for ways in which
to do that by the end of the week.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans worry that censure would set a bad
constitutional precedent, allowing Congress to condemn future
presidents without taking the hard path of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., used his
closing argument Monday to blast censure as an ``air wick'' that
would fail to ``really cleanse the office, as provided in the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Censure, Hyde insisted, is ``a way of avoiding the harsh
constitutional option, and it's the only one you have, the up or
down on impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein refused any comment on her efforts Monday, but she did
file a motion to counter the procedural blocks to a vote later this
week. Whether she has the votes to succeed is another question.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's position will be critical.
So far, the Mississippi Republican has been cool to a censure,
calling any such move ``premature'' until the trial ends. Lott's
support could lure many GOP allies; without it, a censure will be
all that much harder to push through.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle predicted as many as five Democrats will vote against a
censure, meaning that at least 20 Republicans will be needed to
break the Gramm filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle, however, is the wording of the censure
itself. In the last several days of the trial, Feinstein has
reworked the resolution in an attempt to find language that is
strong enough to woo Republicans and soft enough to keep Democrats
on board.
</P>
<P>
   During breaks, she has exchanged papers with her chief
Republican collaborator, Utah's Robert Bennett, going through
progressively stronger drafts.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's initial wording would have charged Clinton with
``wrongful and willful misconduct'' and condemned him for
misleading the public, Congress and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   More recent drafts charge that Clinton ``deliberately misled and
deceived the American people and officials in all branches of the
United States government'' and ``gave false or misleading testimony
and impeded discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Such wording comes close to the perjury and obstruction of
justice charges in the articles of impeachment. The censure also
offers a litany of condemnations, calling Clinton's actions
``shameless, reckless and indefensible'' and declaring that such
conduct demeans the presidency and ``creates disrespect for the
laws of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   But the exact language remains in flux; ironically, the more
momentum the censure gains, the more senators want to add their
suggestions, greatly complicating matters. ``It's very, very hard
to have a whole series of people trying to come up with language,''
Chafee said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he is giving Feinstein ``great latitude to work
with colleagues to come up with the right language,'' saying there
are ``at least a dozen, if not more, iterations'' so far. He said
Feinstein and Republican allies are ``working in good faith to come
up with a draft that people can support. We're not there yet, but
that progress will continue this week, I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   California Sen. Barbara Boxer, a strong Democratic ally of
Clinton, said she has seen some censure drafts that she could
support, and others that she would not.

   John P.Lopez
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THIS new guy beat that new guy. Hands down.
</P>
<P>
   While Denver's Antonio McDyess seemed to celebrate returning to
his offseason home by bringing his offseason game (6-of-17
shooting, three turnovers and foul trouble throughout), the
Rockets' Scottie Pippen made himself at home in his Compaq Center
debut Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess missed long jumpers early and driving one-handers late.
In between, the talented kid who probably could jump and knock the
U-bolts off the Compaq Center rafters if he wanted _ and only
beaned Rockets assistant Jim Boylen would not be impressed by that
_ made various mistakes that lived down to his Denver teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He forced some shots and missed. He had a breakaway dunk attempt
swatted away by Pippen. He couldn't make the big shots when things
were close and made a lot of meaningless, if impressive, finger
rolls when things were out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The Pippen block late in the second quarter probably was the
perfect clip for the highlight reels, especially considering
Pippen's smooth game included all the numbers that have danced in
Rockets fans' heads since his much-heralded arrival.
</P>
<P>
   There were 24 points, leading the team. There were 13 rebounds,
mostly sweeping one-handed grabs that led to some sort of fast
break and jam. There were five assists and 10-of-17 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night that did nothing but show the world how much the
Rockets made the right choice in signing Pippen over McDyess _
their two most coveted free-agent targets in the offseason. Pippen
was everything McDyess someday could be. Pippen here was better
than McDyess over there.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Barkley, again, was the best player on the floor.
And, again, he showed how much a player of his caliber could have
made either Pippen or McDyess a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he turns it on,'' McDyess said, ``he's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   How much more can Barkley do? How many more games can he have
like the first three of this young NBA season, when he has been not
the old Barkley but the Barkley who chases down Most Valuable
Player votes like he does a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Barkley was the biggest reason the Rockets won this game,
which wound up 99-80 but was decided when he was 7-of-7 from the
field with 14 rebounds as the Rockets rolled to a 22-point halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
   After 15- and 20-rebound efforts in the first two games, Barkley
finished with 15 points, 19 rebounds and four assists Monday,
showing McDyess and Pippen what they have been missing in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   A low-post player with game.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it was difficult for Pippen to feel shortchanged in
Chicago when he was playing alongside Michael Jordan. Pippen got
six rings out of the deal. But with Barkley, Pippen realizes he has
something on the low post he never had before.
</P>
<P>
   It's like having Dennis Rodman but adding spin moves, fadeaways,
finger rolls and putbacks to a new set of frisky legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in the half-court game,'' Pippen said, ``you have
to double-team him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets didn't and paid for it dearly. Specifically, it was
McDyess bearing the burden of having to stop Barkley and never
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the much-talked-about free-agent targets, Barkley said
it never mattered to him whether it was Pippen or McDyess who came
to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both great,'' he said. ``And good guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And Barkley likely would have made either better.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's game, Barkley raved about McDyess' 42-inch
jumping ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be illegal,'' he said. ``He's like I used to be _
just throw it up there, and I'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley then made McDyess often look foolish with his array
of moves and fakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to pump-fake him to death,'' Barkley said. ``If
he jumps up, he's going to get it. It's just beautiful to watch. As
a basketball fan, when he goes up, he's one of those guys that just
gets up there. He drops out of the sky. It's beautiful to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But what truly was beautiful to watch was not McDyess. And as
pretty a game as Pippen showed the crowd in his home debut, it
wasn't him, either. It was Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just feeling great,'' he said. ``Things are going well,
and if I stay healthy, I'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pippen will be even better.
</P>

ANTITRUST OFFICIALS LOOK INTO FILM DEALS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The federal government's antitrust arm has
decided to investigate whether top Hollywood studios and theater
chains are operating fairly in how they reach distribution
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice confirmed Monday it has launched a
civil probe into ``possibly anti-competitive practices'' in movie
distribution. Officials recently sent a 10-page document to major
studios and the nation's two biggest chains, Loews Cineplex and
Regal, asking for information on sales and booking policies going
back to January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Specific practices questioned include theaters asking for
``clearances,'' or exclusive distribution rights within an area,
and ``block booking,'' in which a chain obtains a film in exchange
for agreeing to show another film, usually with less box office
potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a great big smoking gun,'' said Steve
Cesinger, an investment banker with Grief &AMP; Co. ``This is likely to
be one of the periodic reviews of the industry. There's nothing
that I'm aware of that has people shaking in their boots.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1948 consent decree requires studios to book films on a
theater-by-theater and film-by-film basis. The decree's ban on
studio ownership of theaters was lifted in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Laguna Research Partners consultant Kevin Skislock said the
probe could stem from complaints by small chain operators that they
are not being treated fairly as large chains expand. Or, he added,
the probe could have come from large chains who believe studios are
not acting equitably in the split of box office revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst noted studios' percentage of box office receipts has
improved in recent years because films increasingly take in most of
their gross within the first few weeks, when revenue-split
agreements are most favorable to studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chains could be using this to say, We need the split to
change because we're making a huge dollar investment in plant and
equipment,'' Skislock. ``The industry dynamics are going to be
moving against the studios, and they're going to be facing a
tougher and tougher negotiator at the table.''

 FRANCE'S UGLY CASE OVER TAINTED BLOOD  &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ With a cast and plot that might have been inspired by
Shakespearean tragedy, a former Socialist prime minister of France
and two of his Cabinet members go on trial Tuesday, charged with
involuntary homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Like the trial of President Clinton, the case will be heard in a
special court drawn from the national legislature. But the
life-and-death moral issues at stake, involving hundreds of people
who contracted AIDS from HIV-contaminated blood transfusions, are
far removed from the tawdry preoccupations of Monica-gate.
</P>
<P>
   The three are charged with complicity in the deaths of people
who died of AIDS-related diseases as a result of blood
transfusions. They face up to five years in prison and $130,000 in
fines if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's brooding Hamlet is Laurent Fabius, 52, who became
the golden boy of French politics when President Francois
Mitterrand appointed him the nation's youngest head of government
in history at the age of 38 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius, now president of the National Assembly, France's
counterpart to the U.S. House of Representatives, has become
obsessed with the case, reportedly speaking of virtually nothing
else in his conversations with friends and other legislators.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Socialist deputies tried to block publication of
the evidence against him in the Assembly, Fabius himself sponsored
the bill lifting his legislative immunity, and called for a ``trial
of honor'' to clear his name. ``I have just asked you to accuse me
of crimes which I have not committed,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being heard before the Court of Justice of the
Republic, composed of six deputies from the Assembly, six members
of the French Senate and three full-time judges. The court was
created in 1993 to rule on the contaminated blood charges and to
hear future cases of alleged crimes by government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Fabius in the dock is former Minister of Health Edmond
Herve, 55, an embittered provincial ``outsider'' who regards
himself as a victim of sinister intrigue in the political backrooms
of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``No communications adviser instructs me in what to say,'' he
told the French daily Le Monde. ``I don't have a strategy up my
sleeve. I am neither a network man nor a courtier.''
</P>
<P>
   The third defendant is former Minister of Social Services
Georgina Dufoix, 55, whose own tortured response to the accusations
led her to become a born-again Christian and withdraw completely
from the public arena in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real turning point in my life was when I experienced
conversion to Jesus Christ,'' she said in a 1994 videotape produced
by a Swiss Pentecostal group.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which has taken 10 years to reach trial, focuses on a
mysterious five-month delay in the onset of mandatory testing for
blood bank donations in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The delay proved fatal for an estimated 300 blood transfusion
recipients in 1985 alone.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation, prosecutors maintain, lies in a high-level
government conspiracy against an American pharmaceutical firm.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1985, U.S.-based Abbott Laboratories and France's
Diagnostics Pasteur had both sought preliminary government approval
for experimental tests that could identify HIV in blood samples.
</P>
<P>
   In early March, Abbott announced that its test had been
perfected and was ready for immediate application.
</P>
<P>
   But French officials are alleged to have blocked the U.S. firm's
application until Pasteur _ which had lobbied fiercely for the
contract under a corporate director with extensive ties to the
Socialists _ was able to develop its own test.
</P>
<P>
   Memorandums leaked to journalists indicate that a secret meeting
on the Abbott bid was held at the Matignon Palace, the prime
minister's residence, on May 9, 1985. No evidence has yet been
presented that Fabius was in attendance or that he read the
memorandums.
</P>
<P>
   In excerpts from the meeting's notes, Fabius's &LR;  medical adviser
voiced fears that ``a large part of (the French market) would be
captured by the American test'' and that ``a decision was required
if we want to reserve the future for a French product.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was to delay the implementation of testing, which
did not begin until the end of August _ ``a government policy line
dictated solely by the industrial imperatives of the Diagnostics
Pasteur corporation,'' in the words of the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   By that point, say many experts, Paris' entire blood supply
carried HIV, as a result of the pooling of supplies by the city's
medical authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The former director of the national blood bank, Dr. Michel
Garreta, has already been convicted of criminal fraud for his part
in the deaths of 250 hemophiliacs who contracted AIDS from
transfusions. In 1992, he was sentenced to four years in prison and
a $90,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, according to public health records, 2,381 people have
contracted AIDS in France as a result of blood transfusions, 75
percent of whom have since died. An additional 2,000 are
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of HIV transmission through contaminated blood here is
the highest in Europe, six times the figure for Germany and 13
times that in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the three former ministers say the trial is a witch
hunt, in search of scapegoats for widespread government inaction in
France and elsewhere during the early years of the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that Fabius was ahead of other Western
politicians in calling for mandatory public testing of blood bank
donations in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said Anne Pietrasik, a French nurse who has written
extensively on medical issues, ``if officials knew there was an
American test that worked, but chose not to authorize it for five
months, their behavior was absolutely criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, she adds, ``is whether these three really were
aware, or whether someone else was out to destroy them. Fabius is
the sort of man a lot of people hate.''
</P>
<P>
   The animosity, rooted in jealousy of someone who was born
wealthy, went to all the right schools, made all the right contacts
_ and whose good looks earned magazine cover stories describing him
as the ``sexiest politician in France'' _ has grown increasingly
ugly with the case finally coming to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius's &LR;  apartment building on the fashionable Place du
Pantheon is guarded round-the-clock by police. His children have
been confronted by the parents of classmates at school and told
that their father is ``an assassin.''
</P>
<P>
   In the newspaper of the anti-Semitic National Front, the Jewish
former prime minister has been pictured in cartoons as a vampire,
his mouth dripping with the blood of ``innocents'' _ an allusion to
the medieval folk tale that Jews conducted ritual murders of
Christian children.
</P>
<P>
   The lives of former Cabinet ministers Dufoix and Herve are also
haunted by the events of 1985, although both insist on their
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial opened this morning, court representatives were
unsure whether the reclusive Dufoix would even appear to defend
herself. ``In my soul and conscience, at the deepest level of my
self and before the Lord, I have no sentiment of guilt,'' she said
in the Swiss videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the mayor of Rennes, in western France, Herve has been
the subject of endless rumors of suicide attempts since the
indictments were issued in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous portrait of Fabius' successor as prime minister,
Pierre Beregovoy _ who himself committed suicide in 1993, allegedly
in despair over Socialist election setbacks _ stares directly at
Herve's desk at City Hall.

CRITICS SAY IMPORTS COULD CARRY PESTS, DISEASE

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Citrus growers in Ventura County north of Los
Angeles, hit by the winter freeze, arrived by the hundreds at a
hearing in Thousand Oaks, a community northwest of Los Angeles, to
fight a plan to allow importation of Argentine citrus, which they
say could cause the next disaster for top local crops.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying placards reading ``First the Freeze, Now Disease,'' and
``We like the Tango, But We Don't Like Black Spot,'' citrus growers
turned out Monday to protest the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
proposal that they claim could bring pests and crop disease along
with the Argentine citrus. The ranchers were backed by elected
officials from throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will be the deadline for public comment on the USDA
proposal to let Argentina send in fresh lemons, oranges and
grapefruit from areas known to have two diseases not found locally,
citrus black spot and sweet orange scab, as well as the
Mediterranean fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   A decision will not be reached for several months, USDA
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Imports from Argentina are solidly opposed by growers in Ventura
County, where lemons are a $217 million-a-year crop, making the
area the nation's largest lemon producer. Oranges rank fifth among
county crops.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives from Argentina urged the federal agency to
open U.S. markets. They said five years of talks have led to strict
terms that would ensure safety of local agriculture from Argentine
crop pests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed rule is based on . . . sound science,'' said
Gustavo Muslara, general manager of Argentina's Northwestern
Phytosanitary Association.

MUSIC, TV, MOVIES AND MILLENNIUM BENEFIT FROM QUINCY JONES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News Music Writer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An impresario in the broadest sense, Quincy Jones'
career has encompassed the roles of composer, record producer,
artist, film producer, arranger, conductor, TV producer, executive,
magazine founder and multimedia entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he's a pretty good cook, too. And, boy, can he throw a
party. He's planning a special one for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The mild-mannered Q, as he's known, is music's No. 1 renaissance
man. Now marking his 50th year in the entertainment industry,
Jones' influence begins with the sounds of the post-swing era and
continues through today's high-tech music delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'50s, Q was the first popular conductor-arranger to
record with an electric Fender bass. His theme for the hit TV
series ``Ironside'' was the first synthesizer-based pop song. As
the first African-American composer to be embraced by the Hollywood
establishment in the '60s, Q helped refresh movie music with
infusions of jazz and soul.
</P>
<P>
   His landmark 1989 disc ``Back on the Block'' _ named album of
the year at the 1990 Grammy Awards _ brought such jazz legends as
Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Miles Davis
together with rappers Ice T, Big Daddy Kane and Melle Mel to create
the first fusion of be-bop and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonnie Raitt said when Q was honored with the recording
academy's MusiCare Award a few years ago: ``The guy spans every
kind of music. He's still got his authentic jazz chops, (and) he's
got a great reputation for helping people. I mean, anybody that can
work with Michael Jackson and, you know, live to tell about it has
got to have some stories.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jackson referred to Q's warm demeanor in the
recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so fatherlike and so helpful, we built a camaraderie
that was like a father-son type of friendship,'' Jackson once said.
``He was always to the rescue and very loving. He has a very
fatherlike charm. That's the main thing that's unique to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As producer and conductor of the historic ``We Are the World''
recording (the largest-selling single of the modern era) and
Jackson's multiplatinum mega-albums ``Off the Wall,'' ``Thriller''
(the top-selling album of all time at 45 million copies) and
``Bad,'' Q stands as one of the most successful and admired
artist/executives in the entertainment world.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON 2ND TAKE) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who also owns 50 percent of Vibe magazine, got his start
in his native Seattle as trumpeter, arranger and sometime pianist
with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra in 1950 and worked as a music
director for Mercury Records in 1961, becoming vice president of
the label three years later.
</P>
<P>
   He has scored countless films and TV shows, including ``The
Pawnbroker'' in 1963 and ``Roots'' in 1977, and has worked as
arranger-producer for hundreds of successful singers and bands. He
was the line producer for ``The Color Purple,'' which won 11 Oscar
nominations, and he established his own Qwest label in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he helped launch the hit NBC-TV series ``The Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air,'' for which he acted as executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been married three times, most recently to actress
Peggy Lipton (of TV's ``The Mod Squad'') from 1974-89. He has six
daughters and one son.
</P>
<P>
   He's currently working on the score for a Broadway musical based
on the life of Sammy Davis Jr. and is also the executive producer
of the TNT movie ``Passing Glory,'' which airs Feb. 24 and stars
Andre Braugher in the story of two schools _ one black and one
white _ in Louisiana during the '50s who play each other for the
state's first integrated basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
   We met with Q at his cozy Bel-Air home on the eve of Tuesday's
release of his new album, ``From Q, With Love'' (Qwest), a 26-song
double-CD set that contains tracks he produced for such superstars
as the late Frank Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, Jackson and Patti
Austin and James Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   As the music industry prepares for its biggest night out Feb. 24
at the Grammys, we asked Jones about his career and his view of the
turmoil in the industry in the wake of the recent Seagram-Polygram
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   DAILY NEWS: You've been in the music business for 50 years, and
your guru was the visionary late Time Warner chairman Steve Ross.
What do you think of the mega-mergers in the industry today, and
did you expect them?
</P>
<P>
   QUINCY: It's much bigger than that _ it's Exxon, AT&AMP;T and TCI.
It's a mindset for the millennium. I've never seen anything like it
in my life. Executives are just flying in and out of windows,
playing musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON 3RD TAKE) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   DN: Are events like Seagram's Polygram purchase healthy for
music in general?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: I haven't had time to make that kind of an analysis. I
like (Seagram chief executive officer) Edgar Bronfman Jr. a lot.
I've known him as a friend and a songwriter, and I know he loves
the music industry. But I don't know. It hasn't been done before.
He now controls a lot of companies over there _ Island, Motown,
Geffen, A&AMP;M, Universal _ it's a lot of stuff. I'm not in a position
to evaluate yet. Everything's changing so fast, it's amazing. I've
never seen anything like this before, and I don't think anyone else
has either. But I'm always optimistic _ criminally optimistic that
the good will always prevail. I hope there's some kind of balance
in the universe and a voice of reason that will put it all where
it's supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   DN: What do you think of electronic distribution of music over
the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: We're facing a serious transition into electronic
distribution, without a doubt. We can put our head in the sand all
we want, but things like MP3 will just shove it right in our face.
And it should change because our current system of music
distribution is so archaic. I've always felt the Avon approach has
been the best for records. When computers can document what your
taste is all about, and they come to your house every Saturday
knowing what you like, they'll own you. They'll get all your money.
They really will.
</P>
<P>
   I know as for me, I'll say, ``I don't know anything about it,
but I'll take some of that, some classical music, the Mysterious
Voices of Bulgaria, all of that.'' These are amazing times, and
every day you're almost afraid to pick up the trades to see what's
going on now. I don't know what it all means, but the changes are
certainly here. It's not just the music business, it's everything.
Insurance companies, car companies, airlines _ it's all over the
world. The players are real busy.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUES ON 4th TAKE) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   JONES: I think sampling is great, 'cause we get 36 samples from
different records a week. One of Tupac's biggest hits was based on
``Body Heat.'' The Fugees' hit ``Killing Me Softly With His Song''
is Roberta Flack's record from 1972 that I worked on. Sampling is
translating things to today's terms. If it works for whoever's
there, great. I'm from the old school, man, where we go in there
with the blank page and carve it from beginning to end. Getting
involved in sampling is much less difficult than trying to create
from scratch. But there are imaginative uses you can make of it. A
lot of pop artists like Warhol did it, too. It's the same thing. I
don't criticize anything because it's all valid expression and it's
all good.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever makes you feel good, whatever works. If the people like
it, great. If the creator is happy and the people are happy, who's
going to complain? ``I'll be Missing You'' was great for Sting and
great for Puff Daddy, too. Everybody's happy. That's win-win.
</P>
<P>
   DN: With all the copyrights you hold, what's your most
frequently sampled track?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: We must have 14 or 15 of the intro to ``Velas'' (which is
on the new album). Oh, and the Brothers Johnson stuff. I have one
song I wrote 39 years ago, ``Soul Bossa Nova,'' which I wrote in 20
minutes for an album called ``Big Band Bossa Nova.'' In the past
five years, we had a worldwide smash with the Dream Warriors using
the same track but rapping right over it. Nike just bought it. It's
used at the beginning of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,''
produced by the Dust Brothers. That's unbelievable. It's great to
be alive in this time when we're going to take the leap into those
three zeros (2000) and make that step across.
</P>
<P>
   DN: How did you go about choosing the tunes on the new
retrospective?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: It was very difficult, because we're talking about going
all the way back to 1966, and I'm telling you, there's been a lot
of records made since then. At first, this was kind of a personal
thing where I was trying to create a mood without any up-tempo
tunes to interrupt it. It was something I put together for a
birthday party we held here for Oprah Winfrey. I made this
collection of 34 songs as a very warm personal present for her and
her guests _ 40 people, including Steven Spielberg. And everyone
kept saying they needed 10 more copies.
</P>
<P>
   I've always worked on the basis that if it moves me, it's got to
move somebody else. I had to make the choice of paring it down and
making it balanced so it's not six tracks from one person. More and
more, there was the pressure to put it out, and we decided we
needed some new songs to include. And we got real lucky with new
tracks from Diane Warren and David Foster _ all these great songs.
Plus, there's this 24-year-old kid named Catero that my daughter
Kidada found, and I put him right between Ingram and Austin's ``How
Do You Keep the Music Playing'' and Michael's ``Human Nature.'' And
he held it. The album is dedicated to my brother, who left us July
13, and Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUES ON FIFTH TAKE) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   DN: What do you look for in a song?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: Something that gives me goosebumps. That's it. I know
it's there whenever the goosebumps come up. Anytime I've been
touched by music and really love something, that's what happens. I
could listen to the lyrics and melody and vocal interpretation of
``How Do You Keep the Music Playing'' forever. Everything's in the
right place.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Has this made you want to look back and perhaps compile some
of the jazz sides you've done?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: Absolutely. It's time to do that now. I'd like to do an
album like this with all the singers I've worked with. I made a
list the other day for a book I'm working on, and it's ridiculous.
From Tony Bennett to Andy Williams to Ray Charles to Aretha to Paul
Simon.
</P>
<P>
   DN: Regarding the millennium, I know you're planning something
special for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   JONES: Spielberg, George Stevens and I will be producing the
millennium party for the White House. We've had four meetings
already, and it's going to be huge, probably the biggest party
ever. I did the inauguration, too, but this is different. This is
big.
</P>
<P>
   DN: What's the guest list look like?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: I don't even want to think about it.

 DOUBLE SLAYER EXECUTED AT CALIFORNIA'S SAN QUENTIN PRISON  &HT;     By PETER FIMRITE, PAMELA J. PODGER and HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN QUENTIN, Calif. _ A quiet former Buddhist monk was executed
at San Quentin State Prison early Tuesday morning 16 years after he
was sentenced for the murders of two people during a bloody robbery
in Southern California.
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, a lethal cocktail of drugs was injected
into Jaturun (Jay) Siripongs as he lay strapped to a gurney inside
the prison's converted gas chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs, who was trained as a monk in his native Thailand, was
the sixth man and the first member of a minority group to be put to
death in California since capital punishment was reinstated in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   His death sentence was carried out despite an eleventh-hour plea
by Pope John Paul II for Governor Gray Davis to spare the condemned
man's life.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs, 43, was the fourth inmate of the six to die by lethal
injection. The other two were gassed.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Siripongs of the 1981 murders of Garden Grove
market manager Packawan (Pat) Wattanaporn, who was strangled, and
store clerk Quach Nguyen, who was stabbed repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In his fight to stay alive, the condemned man received an
outpouring of support from the Thai government, the husband of one
of the victims, two jurors and a former warden of San Quentin.
</P>
<P>
   He was scheduled to be executed in November, but a federal judge
stayed the execution with just six hours to spare.
</P>
<P>
   This time there was no reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   After the California Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal on
Thursday, Siripongs' lawyers turned to Governor Davis, hoping that
he would be swayed by Siripongs' exemplary conduct in prison as
well as his remorse for taking part in the robbery. The inmate
repeatedly insisted that he had killed no one and that the murders
were committed by an accomplice, whom Siripongs refused to name.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Davis, whose support of the death penalty was a
crucial part of his successful gubernatorial campaign, turned down
Siripongs' request for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   The governor refused to reconsider his decision despite John
Paul II's plea Monday for mercy. In a letter sent on behalf of the
pope, Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, the Vatican's representative in
Washington D.C., asked Davis to make ``a gesture of mercy that
would certainly contribute to the promotion of nonviolence in
today's society.''
</P>
<P>
   After the pope's plea, the governor's press secretary, Michael
Bustamante, said that ``the governor made his decision on
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the governor of Missouri commuted the death sentence
of a condemned inmate at the request of the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs' remaining hope was with the federal courts. But
Monday evening, both the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco and
the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear his appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The convicted double murderer was led into San Quentin's death
chamber by prison guards, who strapped him onto a gurney. Moments
later, poisons began flowing into his bloodstream. The fatal
concoction began with a dose of sodium Pentothal that rendered
Siripongs unconscious. That was followed by 50 cubic centimeters of
pancuronium bromide to paralyze his diaphragm and stop his
breathing. The final poison was potassium chloride to paralyze his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   The process, which began at 12:04 a.m., was somber and eerily
quiet. The witnesses included Siripongs' sister, who stood between
the inmate's two lawyers, holding their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The son of one of the victims, Vitoon Harusadangkul, appeared to
be holding back tears. At one point he looked up toward the sky,
and then dropped his head.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs was declared dead at 12:19 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He had no last words.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive Siripongs spent Monday afternoon with his lawyers
and his spiritual adviser. His attorney, Linda Schilling, said
Siripongs believed in the afterlife and expected to continue
atoning for the crimes after death.
</P>
<P>
   There was silence at the prison Monday as 6,000 inmates remained
in their cells under lockdown, waiting for the fateful hour.
Outside, demonstrators gathered with signs protesting the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs' humble manner and spiritualism won the admiration of
several prison officials who sent heartfelt letters to the governor
in support of clemency. An accomplished artist, Siripongs also
inspired deep affection among his fellow inmates, who cheered when
his last execution date was delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who supported clemency was Packawan Wattanaporn's
husband, Surachai, who found his wife and the clerk dead Dec. 15,
1981, inside the Pantai Market, which he owned and his wife
managed.
</P>
<P>
   In appeals that were rejected by the higher courts, Schilling
argued, among other things, that Siripongs' trial lawyer, James
Spellman, did not call any witnesses during the trial and was too
busy running for Congress to devote time to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   There was, nonetheless, a mountain of evidence against
Siripongs, who had worked part time at the Pantai Market and knew
both victims.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Wattanaporn, 36, and Quach, 52, were found in a
storage room in the back of the market. Wattanaporn had been
strangled with a cord. Quach, an immigrant from Vietnam, had been
stabbed at least 10 times in the head and neck with a serrated
knife as he struggled to free himself from his ties and ward off
the fatal thrusts. About $25,000 worth of jewelry was stolen, along
with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs was arrested two days after the murders when he tried
to purchase a television set from a Sears store by using a credit
card belonging to Wattanaporn's husband. Five other credit cards
and a gold necklace belonging to the Wattanaporns were found in his
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Stolen items were also found in his home.
</P>
<P>
   When Siripongs was arrested, he had cuts on his hands. Traces of
blood were found in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in accordance with prison guidelines, Siripongs was
moved at 6 p.m. to a cell near the death row office. The execution
handbook required him to be strip-searched and then scanned with a
metal detector.
</P>
<P>
   Prison guards then escorted him to a ``death watch'' cell a few
feet away from the execution chamber. There, he was offered his
last meal _ two cups of canned peaches and iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he was taken to the execution chamber, he received a
new outfit _ a blue shirt, blue jeans, an undershirt, shorts, socks
and hospital slippers.
</P>
<P>
   As the final minutes ticked away, Siripongs awaited the signal
from Warden Arthur Calderon that the execution should begin.

 NEW PLAN FOR LISTENING TO SPACE  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ Astronomers searching for signs of
intelligent life far off in the Milky Way galaxy revealed plans
Monday for a huge array of 1,000 radio telescopes to intensify
their quest.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious effort links the University of California at
Berkeley and the SETI Institute of Mountain View in a $25 million
joint venture that would sow the ground with detectors covering
nearly 21/2 acres in one of three remote California areas.
</P>
<P>
   And that plan, in turn, could be the forerunner of an even more
exotic concept that is already being discussed among astronomers in
six countries, who hope to build a signal-seeking network of
100,000 telescopes spread over 250 acres somewhere in the world,
according to Frank D. Drake of the University of California at
Santa Cruz, who launched the first search for signals from distant
space nearly 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That quest, which Drake whimsically called Project Ozma, has
ever since inspired astronomers who are convinced that human beings
on Earth are by no means the only intelligent beings in the
universe.
</P>
<P>
   The telescopes that the Bay Area scientists plan to use in their
new search would merely be improved versions of the small
commercial antennas that now populate thousands of back yards for
television owners who live beyond the range of clear broadcast
reception or who want to bypass cable TV. Unlike optical
telescopes, radio telescopes use no lenses.
</P>
<P>
   For scores of astronomers uninvolved in the search for far-out
intelligent life, the project would offer a second benefit: The
array will be able to process many sets of radio signals at a time,
so while the SETI seekers pursue their Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence, other scientists will be analyzing signals that come
from other objects such as supernovae, exploding stars that are
only as partially understood, as well as even more mysterious
objects known as pulsars, quasars and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Although some skeptics in science argue that seeking signals
from far-off civilizations across the galaxy is a fool's errand,
most serious astronomers maintain that the quest is by no means
unrealistic. And many believe that life might well be abundant _
inevitable, in fact _ on any planet that is much like Earth and
circling a star much like the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of the new SETI plan was coupled Monday with a
Berkeley announcement that astronomer William ``Jack'' Welch,
former director of UC's Radio Astronomy Laboratory at Hat Creek
near Redding, has been named to a new academic chair ``In the
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.'' The chair was created
by a $500,000 endowment from Watson and Marilyn Alberts, two UC
graduates who have had a long personal interest in the SETI
program.
</P>
<P>
   Welch is an astronomy professor at Berkeley and also vice
president of the privately financed SETI Institute in Mountain
View. He is married to Jill Tarter, the institute's science team
leader, whose role inspired the character portrayed by Jodie Foster
in the hit film ``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   The new radio telescope array in metric terms will cover
precisely one hectare, or 2.47 acres, and has thus been named the
One Hectare Telescope, or 1hT. Each of its dishes, costing only
about $600 on the commercial market, will be linked to a highly
sophisticated digital signal processing system capable of
scrutinizing millions of radio channels simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Said Drake at the SETI Institute, ``This will let us conduct a
much more powerful and comprehensive search with lots more
observing time than we can ever get on the big radio telescopes
like the ones at Arecibo in Puerto Rico or in Australia. Besides,
when we have to ship our equipment to those distant places, it gets
very expensive and very inefficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Under current plans, UC's Hat Creek radio observatory is the
leading candidate for the new array, but other locations are under
consideration at Greenfield, in the Salinas valley of Monterey
County, and New Idria, site of a defunct mercury mine in San Benito
County.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for a far larger array, covering some 250 acres, has
been developed by astronomers from the Netherlands, China, India,
Canada, Australia and America. The SETI Institute, together with
astronomers at Berkeley and MIT, form the American team exploring
the venture, which would be called the Square Kilometer Array and
would also be devoted primarily to the search for evidence of
intelligent extraterrestrial life.  &LR;

IRIS MURDOCH, 79; INTELLECT INFUSED HER FICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iris Murdoch, the author of such acclaimed novels as ``The Sea,
the Sea'' and ``A Severed Head,'' died Monday at a nursing home in
Oxford, England. She was 79 and had suffered from Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, her husband, critic John Bayley, published
``Elegy for Iris,'' a meditation on her illness and an account of
their 43-year marriage. ``She is not sailing into the dark,'' he
wrote of his wife's decline: ``the voyage is over, and under the
dark escort of Alzheimer's she seems to have arrived somewhere. So
have I.'' Bayley was with her when she died.
</P>
<P>
   There was a particularly grim irony attached to the fact that it
should be an affliction of the brain that Ms. Murdoch suffered
from. Few if any 20th-century novelists have so consistently placed
intellection and ideas at the forefront of their fiction. In
addition to writing, she taught philosophy for 15 years at Oxford
University, and the intersection between her two careers did not go
unnoticed _ least of all by Ms. Murdoch herself. ``A moral
philosophy should be inhabited,'' she once said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable thing about her career was its
output. Ms. Murdoch published 27 novels. Many were of great length
(she made it a point of pride to reject all editing), and that fact
became a sore point with critics in her later years. Ms. Murdoch
also wrote several plays and a number of philosophical works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invent the whole thing before I start writing,'' she once
explained of how she wrote her fiction. ``Even the conversations
are in my head. I don't start writing the thing until I've got the
whole of it absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murdoch's novels often managed to seem simultaneously
old-fashioned and contemporary. Their frequently being of
door-stopper size, as well as her books' having, as she proudly put
it, ``a beginning, a middle, and an end,'' gave many of Ms.
Murdoch's volumes an almost-Victorian feel. Yet in their intricate
symbolism, psychological sophistication, and taste for the macabre
_ she once described her novels as being ``erotic mysteries and
deep, dark struggles between good and evil'' _ her fiction was
unmistakably of this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``She belongs amongst the four or five great novelists of the
second half of this century to come out of Britain,'' English
novelist and critic Malcolm Bradbury said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   She was a winner of Britain's two most prestigious literary
prizes: the Whitbread, for ``The Sacred and Profane Love Machine,''
in 1974; and the Booker, for ``The Sea, the Sea,'' in 1978. In
1987, she was made a Dame of the Order of the British Empire, the
equivalent of a knighthood.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Anglo-Irish parents, Jean Iris Murdoch was born
in Dublin on June 15, 1919. She studied classical languages and
philosophy while an undergraduate at Oxford. Also while an
undergraduate, she was briefly a member of the communist party.
After graduating in 1942, she worked for the British Treasury and
then in refugee camps in Austria and Belgium. She spent a
postgraduate year studying with the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein
at Cambridge University and became a fellow and tutor at St. Anne's
College, Oxford, in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, she published her first book, a study of the French
existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre. She published her first novel,
``Under the Net,'' a year later. In 1956, she married Bayley.
</P>
<P>
   She made her reputation as a novelist with ``A Severed Head'' in
1961 (it was later produced as a play and film). Among her
best-known novels are ``An Accidental Man'' (1971) and ``The Black
Prince'' (1973). ``Jackson's Dilemma,'' her last novel, was
published in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murdoch and her husband had no children. She requested that
there be no funeral or memorial service.

 &HT;    Whatever she is, Lewinsky is neither baby nor bimbo
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fate arranged a cruel irony for the U.S. Senate on the day it
allowed Monica Lewinsky's videotaped image and voice into its
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative clerk Scott Bates, who conducted most Senate roll
call votes, including those during the impeachment trial, was
killed in an accident Friday night. So as the Senate gathered to at
last hear from Lewinsky, the voice with which the institution
itself has come to be identified was silent.
</P>
<P>
   The moment of silence for Bates set a somber mood for a session
that many senators have for months worried would upset the Senate's
dignity. Those concerns appear to have been overwrought. Whatever
momentary fascination may have come with the opportunity to study
someone who has been silent through so much speculation, Lewinsky's
excerpted testimony did nothing to lower this process further than
it has sunk.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone's dignity was insulted by these concluding arguments
in the impeachment trial, it was Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have been conflicted over the Lewinsky case from the
beginning _ a subject explored in countless op-ed pieces. Still, it
was striking how much feminists have been struggling over for
decades now went by the board during this session without protest.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reference to ``Vernon'' or ``Sidney'' when the
videotaped excerpts of Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal were
introduced. And yet, when House managers repeatedly referred to
Lewinsky as ``Monica,'' no one, including the women senators of
both parties, rose to object.
</P>
<P>
   This diminution of the case's central witness to her first name
fit into a larger effort to portray Lewinsky as young and
vulnerable, a sympathetic figure victimized by a powerful man. To
that end, the managers, who days ago were fighting to have her
hauled onto the floor for eight hours of grilling, made much of how
her youthful hopes have been ``drastically altered.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the sympathetic treatment, this grandfatherly approach
is just as belittling as the White House effort to portray her as
some kind of ditzy femme fatale. Neither characterization grants to
Lewinsky true responsibility for her actions.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any impression of the former White House intern to
be derived from the excerpts that were shown Saturday, it is that
of a young woman with a very clear idea _ whether wise or unwise,
right or wrong _ of what she was doing. The opposing sides may
belittle her as a bimbo or a baby, but Lewinsky emerges in the
testimony as the adult with the best understanding of her own
impulses.
</P>
<P>
   But judging from the initial response to the House managers'
closing arguments Saturday morning, the video image of Lewinsky,
accompanied by her juvenilization on the part of the managers, had
an impact, even if it will not overturn the outcome of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The impact seems to have been entirely based on the somewhat
shocked response _ even after all the stories and all the endlessly
looped videoclips _ to the obvious difference in age between
Lewinsky and the president. It certainly did not come from the
substance of her testimony, which was as cautious and unexciting as
one would expect from a client of Plato Cacheris.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, somebody ought to point out that fooling
around with an older woman would have been adultery also. And it
hardly does credit to women in their mid-20s to leave the
impression they are less capable of making judgments about how to
conduct themselves than are gray-haired men.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde has alluded
to those who lie in graves near foreign battlefields, their lives
sacrificed for the principles he said are at stake in this trial.
It's worth mentioning _ even this late in the trial _ that a lot of
them gave their lives before they reached the age of Monica
Lewinsky.

 &HT;    HEALTH: Inhalants a cheap, available high
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ She was a troubled teen-ager living in Warren
County, Ohio when an older boyfriend introduced her to a cheap, and
potentially deadly, thrill.
</P>
<P>
   All she needed was a can of gold spray paint and a plastic bag
and she could huff her way into oblivion, a minute or two at a
time. Often she would black out.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day, she was caught sneaking back into school after
huffing with a friend in the parking lot _ her mouth still
drooling, her face and index finger stained with telltale paint.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being suspended and ordered into a drug-treatment
program, she continued the destructive habit for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a good buzz. It was cheap, and it was readily
available,'' she says, now a 22-year-old college student in
Kentucky. What turned her around was a psychotherapist ``who really
loved me and cared for me. I needed that from someone outside my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she considers herself ``one of the lucky ones.''
Thousands of other inhalant abusers, many of them adolescents and
teen-agers, have died or suffered permanent brain or liver damage
from huffing.
</P>
<P>
   Inhalants are everyday items that contain toxic gas or liquid,
anything from aerosol air fresheners and typewriter correction
fluid to paint thinner and Freon stolen from air-conditioning
units.
</P>
<P>
   The dizzying buzz from inhalants lasts only a minute or so, but
the side effects can be lasting and extremely severe even for
first-time users. Youngsters sometimes suffer permanent damage to
their brain, bone marrow, liver and kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, huffing also can cause violent behavior,
hallucinations, convulsions, drowsiness, unconsciousness _ even
cardiac arrest and suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   Inhalant use has been a problem for decades but declined after
inhalants were targeted by anti-drug campaigns in the late 1980s.
But now they are coming back, and the users are younger than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, there were about 805,000 new inhalant users, up from
382,000 in 1991, according to the National Household Survey on
Drugs. Nearly one in five teen-agers has used inhalants to get
high, says the National Institute on Drug Abuse. That number is
almost identical to the percentage of eighth-graders who have
smoked marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dayton area, inhalant use among teen-agers has remained
fairly consistent over the past decade, but somewhat higher than
the national average, says Harvey Siegal, who directs Wright State
University's Substance Abuse Intervention Program.
</P>
<P>
   While about 16 percent of high school seniors nationwide report
having tried inhalants at some point, the percentage tion programs
for South Community Inc., says kids ages 10, 11 or 12 are most
likely to experiment with inhalants. ``They're very curious at that
age, and they don't realize how deadly it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   While many children will try inhalants, very few will go on to
be habitual abusers, experts say. WSU's annual surveys, for
instance, found that only one in every 500 high school seniors
regularly uses inhalants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids will try it one time and say, `Hey, who needs this
stuff? This stinks,' '' Siegal said. The buzz from inhalants is far
shorter, and the physical effects far more damaging, than those of
other substances, he notes.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a few youngsters will go on to develop a physical and
psychological dependency on inhalants, he says. ``Who knows why?
That's one of the questions that hasn't been answered.''
</P>
<P>
   But Melton says huffers _ like all substance abusers _ may have
a genetic predisposition to addiction or ``other issues in their
life'' that can lead to self-destructive habits.
</P>
<P>
   Federle says inhalants are more often a beginner or gateway
drug. ``I think as (children) grow older they become more aware of
substances that give them a longer-lasting high,'' she said.
``Those who continue to use inhalants perhaps can't afford anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Inhalant abuse is one of the most difficult addictions to treat
because it severely impairs a person's reasoning capacity, Melton
says. ``They lose the ability to recognize that this is bad for
them. When you work with drug addicts and alcoholics, they at least
know this is damaging to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old college student who grew up in Warren County
says she knew how bad huffing was for her, ``but back then I didn't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't blame her parents or her teachers, only herself. ``I
come from a very loving family. That was never a problem. It was
just my age, that time in my life and all those raging hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I look back now and I realize how totally stupid I was.''

 &HT;    The pain of (chocolate) addiction
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Much like Blanche DuBois _ Tennessee
Williams's faded belle in ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' who ``...
always depended on the kindness of strangers'' _ my old friend Gail
has relied on the benevolence of science to explain away her
addiction to chocolate. ``It's hereditary,'' she'd remind me as she
munched away. ``Flawed genes. My grandmother was a bon-bon
popper.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Gail gained considerable comfort from the
knowledge that her dependency was inevitable. That her lust for
anything resembling a Reese's peanut butter cup was determined by
her DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, it was only a matter of time before the unthinkable
happened. Somebody did a study of known choco-holics and blew that
theory right out of the water. A passion for chocolate, the experts
determined, is an acquired rather than an inherited taste. They
cite Spanish women as an example _ no access, no addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Gail's not happy with the findings _ says she's been suckered
into dependency and then hung out to dry. Just to needle her, I ask
if she thinks maybe the Democrats are responsible since she already
blames them for El Nino and an epidemic resurgence of athlete's
foot. She says it wouldn't surprise her a bit because nothing's
been going right since ``that man'' moved into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25 years we've been friends, Gail has never quite
believed me when I swear that I have no politics. She insists I'm a
closet liberal. That's when I mention my upstanding membership in
the conservative, northwestern Ohio village where I live, teach,
and write, and remind her that (SET ITAL)she's(END ITAL) the one
who moved to the Oregon coast and took up naked flute lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't understand my pain,'' she wails in mock despair.
``You don't know how lucky you are that chocolate makes you sick.''
She's right. Even the smell of someone else eating the stuff can
cost me my lunch. But it's not luck, I remind her. It was baptism
by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Back in my toddler days, so I'm told, a doting grandfather
turned me loose with a giant Hershey bar, insisting my mother leave
me alone to enjoy all I wanted of it instead of the picayune little
bites she was pinching off for me. ``It'll make her sick,'' my
mother said. ``No it won't,'' my grandfather said. He was wrong.
And I never got over it.
</P>
<P>
   Motion sickness has always been a part of my life too _ cars,
trains, airplanes, boats _ if it moves, I've been sick on it. Add
to that the smell of chocolate, and I'm an unlovely sight _ but
somehow my mother, a hopeless choco-holic, never seemed to catch
on. Traveling with her was like touring with Fannie Farmer. Before
the train ever left the station, she would dig out her
</P>
<P>
   latest Kathleen Norris novel and a box of chocolate-covered
anything (except raisins) and settle in for a thousand-mile read,
interrupted only by my retching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chocolate,'' Gail rants, ``was a lot more fun when I thought
my cravings were genetic and there was little I could do but
satisfy them.'' She wonders aloud if there's a local chapter of
Choco-holics Anonymous. I ask if she's ever tried giving it up cold
turkey. She says just the thought of it causes hives and sends her
racing to the freezer for something to put under a great gob of
Hershey's syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years I've watched the suffering of folks fighting
the good fight only to ultimately succumb to the siren call of
anything made from cacao seeds. I've stood by as Gail, in a
standoff with a Neiman-Marcus candy counter, chanted her resistance
mantra: ``If I don't buy it, I can't eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   And now it's come down to this.
</P>
<P>
   ``What now?'' I ask. ``A condo in Spain?''
</P>
<P>
   She admits she's torn. ``Do I put myself to the test? Or do I
just slip on my old sweatshirt (the one that reads: Man cannot live
by chocolate alone ... but woman can) and head for the nearest
Godiva store?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck and Godspeed,'' I wish my friend.
</P>
<P>
   And try to forget about Valentine's day.

 &HT;    If TAAS is going to be almighty, it ought be be more meaty
 &HT;    (EDS: A Series: Part 2 of 4)
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ See the politician. See the politician run. Run,
politician, run.
</P>
<P>
   See the politician talk. See him talk from both sides of his
mouth as he runs.
</P>
<P>
   Out of one side, the politician talks about ``local control of
schools.'' Out of the other he talks about ``accountability.'' That
means state control through TAAS _ the Texas Assessment of Academic
Skills.
</P>
<P>
   TAAS is a criterion-based test _ testing on specific objectives
every child is supposed to learn. So doing, what's in TAAS dictates
what goes on in classrooms across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Texas Education Agency sets out to expand on TAAS,
testing more students and on more subjects, it's no pebble in the
pond. It's an asteroid.
</P>
<P>
   So far attention given to legislation to expand TAAS has focused
on the fact that it would add an 11th-grade exit test. Currently
that's in 10th grade. But maybe the attention needs to be as much
on what's in the test as when it's given.
</P>
<P>
   TAAS is the ``keystone of the essential learnings that must be
mastered by children in Texas schools,'' said Keith Cruse, senior
director of the Texas Education Agency Division of Student
Assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Cruse said that not only is the agency looking at adding an
11th-grade exit test but also making the whole thing more rigorous,
making Texas' graduation requirement harder and ``redoing the
system'' from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Qualitative changes in the statewide test would be welcome for
no other reason than this: Since schools will scrunch down and
emphasize _ in many cases overemphasize _ whatever is on the test,
a more rigorous test means more kids learn more.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, a state test would be referenced to national norms,
meaning it would challenge everyone, not just the middle to low
achievers. But when you've got a test tied to specific elements
every child, advanced or academically behind, must learn to meet a
minimum standard, you'll have everyone focused on that minimum
standard. Does that sound enlightening? Only to those who are below
that standard.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, make the test tougher, even if you have to give a little on
what ``mastery'' means in later grades where children haven't had a
chance from kindergarten to grow into to new, higher standards.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, for instance, should put in place a goal of ``algebra by
eighth grade'' for all students, a standard common in other
developed nations. This would require changes in the state set of
essential skills already adopted by the State Board of Education.
And what we're talking about isn't something that would be a bolt
from the blue in middle school, but something to which students
built up from kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   This ultimately would close the gap between what graduates know
and what Texas colleges say they need to know, resulting in much
remediation.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed expansion of state assessment also would include
for the first time a state social studies test in grades 4 and 10
and science tests in grades 5, 7 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   One approaches any additional state testing with trepidation,
knowing how TAAS skews teaching. But that skewing is the reason why
it would be worthwhile to add tests on social studies and science.
Teachers on some elementary campuses have been chained to the
teaching of math and language arts to the exclusion often of
science and social studies. These tests would guarantee that in
those grades science and social studies would get taught. It's not
the best way to run an educational system, but if tests are going
to run it, let's broaden Texas' definition of ``the basics'' beyond
the 3Rs.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the issue is no longer the need for education to get
``back to basics.'' The need is to get back to education.

 &HT;    Investment clubs can be family affairs
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Waymon Moore had a fairly common aspiration: to teach
his younger relatives the discipline and rewards of investing.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old has succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, he formed an investment club made up entirely of
kinfolk. Some 24 eligible relatives _ nieces, nephews and their
older children _ joined the club right away. All are still members.
Their annual returns have been close to 20 percent, and their
portfolio is now worth $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's story is not uncommon. Family investment clubs have
become increasingly popular in recent years. Readers frequently ask
me for advice on how to start a club. Across the country, the
National Association of Investors Corp. reports that the total
number of clubs, including family ones, continues to increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are hearing about family clubs,'' said Betty
Taylor, a frequent NAIC lecturer on family clubs. ``Or they have
been in an investment club. They see that clubs are very
profitable, and they say, `Why not do it with the family?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Making money is not the only goal. Taylor and Moore both cited
an even more attractive goal _ teaching young people how to save
and invest for their futures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another benefit can be family unity. Moore, childless
himself, noted that his siblings' children had scattered from one
end of the country to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first motivation was to get them acquainted,'' he said.
``They had never had any reason to get together.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore was able to offer an extra incentive to those relatives.
After a successful career in the insurance industry, he had the
wherewithal to match the initial investments of every club member.
When a relative put in his or her $500 annual contribution, Moore
matched it with $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my nephews said, `If they're not smart enough to take
your $500 and join, we don't want to claim them as kin,' '' Moore
recalled jovially.
</P>
<P>
   There is the potential for trouble, of course, in any
organization that commingles kinship and money. But Taylor and
Moore have developed ways to prevent or at least dampen any
conflicts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Carefully draw up rules. Any club will have its bylaws, Taylor
noted. But family clubs may want to include some extra items.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce, for example, may be one issue in which rules are
needed. Taylor said she knows of one club in which the spouse
leaving the family solved the problem by giving the shares to the
couple's children.
</P>
<P>
   A better plan is to work out the preferred response and write it
into the club's bylaws, she said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Follow the rules. ``You have to be strict,'' Taylor said.
``You must demand that the money comes in on time and that votes
(on buying or selling stocks) are submitted on time.'' In her club,
voting often is by mail or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spread the load. All members should participate in researching
and making recommendations on new investment ideas. ``If they
don't, they're not really learning,'' Taylor said. ``There will
come a day when they'll wish they had paid attention. And it could
cause resentments.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Overcome distance. Some clubs use the Internet to stay in
touch, in addition to e-mail or regular mail. Many have an
executive committee that is authorized to make buy and sell
decisions between meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's club has another rule to keep things orderly:
Nominations of new stock selections must be circulated to all
members at least 30 days before the club's annual meeting. ``That
way the others can research them before the meeting,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of resources for those interested in forming a
family investment club. On the Internet, the NAIC's Web page is
http://www.better-investing.org. It contains membership
information, investing ideas, contacts with local organizations and
details about NAIC publications.
</P>
<P>
   Rewards can be great. The Moore Money club has added one that
may be highly unusual _ tithing. The club gives 10 percent of its
gains each year to charities, many of them church-related. ``There
are many good things you can do if you've got money,'' Moore
observed.

 &HT;    FICTION : `Southern Cross' becomes a cross to bear
 &HT;    By Dave Gulliver
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patricia Cornwell writes a good story when she's being Patricia
Cornwell. She has an eye for detail and a stomach for the gruesome
aspects of crime, embodied in her regular heroine, coroner Kay
Scarpetta.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, in Southern Cross, Cornwell's apparently trying
to be Virginia's answer to Carl Hiaasen, the wickedly funny writer
who mocks all things modern Florida. And Hiaasen she isn't.
</P>
<P>
   According to its cover notes and press material, Southern Cross
aims to be a satirical novel about a Southern police department.
But that's the only way you'd know.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the story is a female police chief and two of
her cops, Virginia and Andy, on loan from Charlotte, N.C., to
Richmond, Va., Cornwell's personal home turf. The chief is older,
superficially confident but full of self-doubt; the other two are
young, model-pretty and star-crossed lovers. And though they're
your good guys, they come off as incredibly dumb .
</P>
<P>
   Their job, apparently, is to get the unhospitable host
department to adopt policies and a computer program that worked so
well in Charlotte. Then there's a rash of ATM thefts, the computer
program is hacked, a Jefferson Davis statue is vandalized and the
Azalea Festival parade pulls together all the supporting characters
in a farcical finale.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, those characters. What would a Southern humor book be
without a Bubba? Yep, there's one of those. He owns lots of guns
and power tools, incompetent with all of them, and calls himself
Bubba because he doesn't like the vulgar nicknames spun from his
real name, Butner Fluck. And yes, Cornwell lists all the nicknames.
Not realistically, as they might be tossed off by his not-so-good
buddies Smudge and Muskrat (yes, really, one each of those, too) in
conversation. Nope, she actually lists them, dumping them all out
in one paragraph and moving on to other caricatures.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's Lelia Ehrhardt, the man-hungry society
matron who can't get through a sentence without garbling a cliche
or butchering grammar _ literally, every single line of dialogue
she speaks.
</P>
<P>
   It's overkill, and it's unfunny, and Cornwell knows it: She
tries to prop up the humor by showing other characters laughing
hysterically at Ehrhardt's gaffes. But the reader won't. Sadly, it
might have half-worked were Ehrhardt some ditzy trophy wife, but
Cornwell attributes it to Ehrhardt's being raised in Austria and
having English as a third language.
</P>
<P>
   Dialogue has been Cornwell's Achilles heel, even in the
Scarpetta books, and it's all the more apparent here. Take Smoke, a
teen-age would-be gangsta, whose actions are cruel even by
crime-fiction standards. But he sounds like a 6-year-old when he
talks tough: ``Hey, retard, cut it out.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's Weed, the unwilling new gang recruit (Smoke, Weed,
get it?). He's the most likable and believable character but still
comes off phony: He's a gifted artist, but can't read or write, and
yet somehow uses America Online to crash the cops' computer
network.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Cornwell also tries playing a fat female cop and and old
male cop for laughs. Mocking fat people, old people and foreigners
isn't very funny, and it's by no means satire. In the end, Bubba,
Lelia &AMP; Co. simply seem like straw men for Cornwell to skewer,
literary stand-ins for the sort of people Cornwell just doesn't
like.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few great passages, like when Cornwell describes the
competition between Bubba and his co-workers at a cigarette
factory, apparently the result of good, traditional research, the
kind that makes her Scarpetta books stand out. But in Southern
Cross she usually relies on imagination, and it fails her.
</P>
<P>
   So these characters that aren't particularly original plod
through the book doing things that also aren't particularly
original and definitely aren't funny. And though the story
supposedly unfolds in a few days, it reads like a month and you
actually can set it down for the night with eight pages to go.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, set it back down on the bookstore shelf and wait for
Cornwell to be Cornwell again.

 &HT;    REVIEW: The rise and fall of a king
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Was anyone surprised in 1992 when U.S. Postal
Service customers overwhelmingly voted to put the image of a young,
lean Elvis Presley on a commemorative stamp instead of the older,
bloated version?
</P>
<P>
   It was the young Elvis who turned the world on its ear, who led
a rock 'n' roll revolution, who fairly radiated the joy and passion
he felt for his music.
</P>
<P>
   The older Elvis was the rhinestone-studded ``sensuous clown''
(in the words of one critic) who destroyed his reputation while
lining his pockets (and those of his infamous manager) by starring
in dozens of bad movies, recording scores of lackluster songs and
giving ridiculously ultra-glitzy performances in Las Vegas and
across the United States. He was also the living chemistry set
whose prodigious drug intake resulted in an ignominious death on a
toilet in his Memphis mansion, Graceland.
</P>
<P>
   It's the older Elvis who's the focus of Careless Love , Peter
Guralnick's follow-up to 1994's acclaimed Last Train to Memphis. In
Last Train, Guralnick painted such a vivid picture of the ascendant
young Presley it was impossible not to be charmed by his
personality and awed by his musical achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Careless Love is necessarily a much less attractive story
because it chronicles, in horrifying detail, the King's long,
painful decline. In its way, though, it's every bit as compelling
as the story of his rise.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick's accomplishment is particularly remarkable
considering that we already know the basic facts: Upon returning in
1960 from the Army service that cut short his phenomenal first
burst of success, Presley quits live performances in favor of
formulaic film roles and all but ceases making music other than
lame movie soundtracks. He makes a spectacular comeback in 1968,
but soon veers into schmaltz and self-parody. Despite being named a
federal drug agent by President Nixon, Presley is hopelessly
addicted to pharmaceuticals. He gives away Cadillacs and shoots out
television sets until the drugs finally end his life at 42.
</P>
<P>
   In Guralnick's hands, this often-told story unfolds with a
chilling sense of inevitability. As the book opens, Elvis is in the
Army in Germany, but the seeds of his doom are already sewn. His
Svengali-like manager, Col. Tom Parker, is busy making plans to
crassly exploit Presley's fame upon his discharge, Elvis has
surrounded himself with the yes-men of the ``Memphis Mafia,'' and,
most significantly, Elvis has discovered ``harmless'' amphetamines,
acquiring huge jars of them from eager-to-please doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return stateside, Presley recorded some music that
rivaled his early Sun Records triumphs. But when it didn't sell as
well as the soundtracks, Parker set Presley on a treadmill of
lightweight movies and Elvis, with maddening docility, went along
with the program.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1960s rolled on (it's unspoken but obvious here that
Presley was almost totally insulated from the tumult of the '60s),
Elvis became increasingly irrelevant. His movies and albums began
to flop, and Parker was forced to come up with a new marketing
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The new direction _ a return to live performance _ came after
the surprise success of a 1968 NBC-TV special. His subsequent Vegas
shows broke attendance records.
</P>
<P>
   The freefall began in 1973, when long-term drug abuse took a
toll on his health, and his spirit seemed to fail, too. His
nice-guy personality darkened, he rarely recorded and his
performances became embarrassments, with Elvis delivering
incoherent, slurred monologues between songs. By his last tours in
1977, Guralnick reports, ``there was no longer any pretense of
keeping up appearances. The idea was simply to get Elvis out on
stage and keep him upright for the hour he was scheduled to
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   His death on Aug. 16, 1977, came as no great surprise to
insiders, but there was intense grieving by nearly everyone _
except the Colonel, who approached Vernon Presley even before his
son's viewing to propose a new agreement for posthumous product
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick, a noted music writer who spent 11 years researching
and writing the two books, lays out the facts with a minimum of
speculation, interpretation and pop psychologizing. Neither a
hatchet job or a puff piece, the biography flinches from nothing
but maintains respect for its subject.
</P>
<P>
   The author doesn't offer a pat explanation for Presley's
``unmaking,'' but Careless Love is ultimately the story of a man
increasingly trapped by his own celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He constructed a shell to hide his aloneness, and it hardened
on his back,'' Guralnick writes. ``I know of no sadder story.''
</P>
<P>
   NONFICTION: Careless Love: The Unmaking of Elvis Presley
</P>
<P>
   In this followup to a 1994 book, Peter Guralnick focuses on
Elvis' decline.

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Routine drug-resistance tests suggested for some
with HIV
 &HT;    (EDS: This is a compilation of health stories which moved to the
wires this week.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Drug-resistant forms of the AIDS virus are showing up
more and more often, worrying doctors and patients who fear they'll
run out of treatment options before new drugs become available.
</P>
<P>
   Testing viral strains for resistance to HIV drugs still is an
imprecise science, but AIDS researchers appear to be leaning in
favor of it to plan patients' drug therapy, especially for pregnant
women and their infants, some newly infected people and health care
workers exposed to HIV-infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is clear that resistance tests will be widely
available over this year, and I would clearly approve of them,''
said Dr. Brian Gazzard of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in
London. Gazzard spoke recently about resistance testing at the
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Chicago,
a scientific meeting on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot study of 153 patients completed in December showed
roughly three in four people with HIV whose drug therapy had
stopped working were infected with resistant viral strains. Another
study among HIV-positive, active-duty U.S. military concluded that
about one in five recently infected people had resistant virus.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies presented at the Chicago conference concluded
that resistance testing might be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of resistance tests, neither of which has
federal approval. Phenotypic tests measure the performance of HIV
drugs _ of which 14 are approved _ against an HIV strain. Genotypic
tests genetically map part of the virus, then search for key
mutations associated with resistance to certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But interpreting tests results isn't as simple as looking at the
gene map and checking off drugs. Some HIV drugs are more
susceptible to resistance than others; for instance, the widely
used drug 3TC is rendered useless by a single, common mutation.
Some mutations cause cross-resistance among drugs, eliminating
several options at once.
</P>
<P>
   The tests may also be well-suited for pregnant women and
newborns, since cases have been recorded of mothers passing
resistant virus to babies. Also, health care workers exposed to
infected blood through needle sticks or other accidents should be
tested, said Robert Lloyd of Applied Sciences, a resistance testing
lab in Norcross, Ga., owned by Visible Genetics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Medicinal treasures from the tropics
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Several University of Georgia researchers will become
the latest cadre of specialists scouring the tropics for
therapeutic plant species. Under a new $2.5 million, five-year
federal grant, the UGA scientists will focus on the homeland of the
Highland Maya people in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. Five
research teams from other institutions are conducting searches in
eight other countries in Latin America, Africa and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The new research greatly expands previous efforts to find
medicinal plants. Although pharmaceutical firms have trekked for
decades through the tropics for plants with therapeutic value, the
forays picked up steam in the 1980s when the National Cancer
Institute contracted with the Missouri Botanical Garden in St.
Louis, the University of Illinois in Chicago and the New York
Botanical Garden to gather thousands of plant specimens in the rain
forests of South America, Asia and Africa. Extracts from the
leaves, stems, flowers, bark and other parts of the plants were
screened for anti-cancer properties.
</P>
<P>
   Out of about 14,000 plant specimens collected so far, extracts
from about 2 percent have been found to have anti-cancer potential,
and may be candidates for more rigorous testing and possible drug
development.
</P>
<P>
   But under a new federal program that began in 1992, the
international search for therapeutic plants _ a process called
``bioprospecting'' _ has been greatly widened to look for
treatments for other ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential rewards (from bioprospecting) should provide
benefits to the source country and local communities that are the
stewards of these resources,'' says Joshua Rosenthal of the
National Institutes of Health's Fogarty International Center.
</P>
<P>
   The program means that much of the rain forest land _ now being
lost at a rate of 50 million acres a year _ may not be cut for wood
products and agriculture; rare plants and animals won't lose their
habitats; and residents won't resort to environment-damaging
activities to escape crushing poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia team ``will discover, isolate and evaluate plants
that might have medicinal value and then use them to help develop
the local economy of the Highland Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya through
sustainable production,'' says Brent Berlin, an anthropologist who
directs UGA's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies.
</P>
<P>
   This time, native people and host countries will participate in
the projects and command a large share of any economic benefits
from the medicinal plants.
</P>
<P>
   Drink up: Cures may be in your tea leaves
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ Sometimes there's hardly a better tonic for what ails
you _ whether it's a stuffy head or achy joints _ than a nice cup
of hot tea. Maybe a touch of honey. Or a splash of brandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, tea really does have a soothing effect,''
said Kathleen Zelman, Marietta, Ga. nutritionist and spokeswoman
for the American Dietetic Association. ``It feels so good to wrap
your hands around a warm cup and inhale the steam.''
</P>
<P>
   That effect, though comforting, is not a cure. But emerging
research is suggesting while tea may not cure, it might help
prevent many serious diseases, such as cancer and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   As with many health studies, evidence suggests potential
benefits, with a great deal more research needed to provide
conclusive evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what we are hearing about the health benefits of tea is
coming from the general buzz about antioxidants. Antioxidants,
found in many fruits and vegetables and red wine, are believed to
protect the body against agents of disease known as free radicals,
molecules that cause chemical reactions and damage tissues.
Antioxidants are thought to be particularly effective in fighting
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Teas made from tea leaves, Camellia sinensis, are rich in
antioxidants, specifically flavonoids.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a little more strength in green tea than
with black, but all kinds are effective,'' Zelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cancer-fighting potential, some studies suggest tea _
especially green tea _ may inhibit oxidation of LDL, the so-called
bad cholesterol, thus helping to prevent heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tea also is rich in fluoride, essential for healthy teeth and
bones. And tea is a good source of zinc, an essential mineral that
boosts immune systems and also fights cancers.
</P>
<P>
   It probably would take four to five cups a day to get the full
preventive effects of tea.

 &HT;    Ecologist and sparrow go under the spotlight
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Even its staunchest champion admits that
the Everglades' most bitterly debated bird can be hard for some to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Invisible to most visitors, camouflaged in colors as drab as the
flat grasslands it calls home, the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is
anything but majestic. It feeds and nests at ground level and flies
so slowly that researchers have sometimes caught it by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the spring mating season do the males begin to sing _ a
chip-chip-bzzzzzzz _ that few would confuse with the nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to write soppy poetry, an ode to the Cape Sable
sparrow,'' admits Stuart Pimm, a University of Tennessee ecologist
who has devoted much of his career to the endangered bird. ``I sort
of wish it was a more charismatic bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, much of the future of the Everglades may hang on this
nondescript sparrow, which last year helped trigger a
water-management bottleneck ranging from fish kills on the St.
Lucie River to flood-stricken tree islands in Miami-Dade County.
And much of that debate will hang on Pimm, whose research for
Everglades National Park is set to go under the microscope today at
a science symposium near Miami.
</P>
<P>
   To the Oxford-educated Pimm, the fight to save the remaining
3,000 or so sparrows is also the fight to save the park and the
rest of the Everglades
</P>
<P>
   The entire park, he said, suffers from the same flawed drainage
system that routinely drowns some sparrow nesting grounds while
leaving others parched and fire-prone. And, he argues, neither the
sparrow nor the Everglades will see real relief from the $7.8
billion restoration proposal by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   That stance has attracted a barrage of criticism, especially
from Miccosukee Indians who have seen their land flooded by the
corps' attempts to help the sparrow. The tribe's scientists argue
that the bird may be longer-lived and more mobile than Pimm
believes, not a helpless creature that needs drastic action.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that Pimm, despite a history of research ranging
from the Pacific to Brazil to Afghanistan, is no expert on a
sparrow found only in the southern Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten in too deep,'' tribal attorney Dexter Lehtinen
said. ``Environmentalists have fallen for his story that he's going
to save the sparrow.'' Pimm has described some of the criticism as
``biologically incredible'' and ``absolutely bloody ridiculous.''
He said people who try to make him or the sparrow the center of the
debate are missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about an obscure little bird,'' said Pimm, 49, a
naturalized U.S. citizen who speaks in the accent of his native
Derbyshire, England. ``It's just inexcusable for the richest
country in the world with a rich national park to let the park go
to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Pimm's research helped inspire today's workshop
at Florida International University, in which experts assembled by
the American Ornithological Union will hear reports from all sides.
They'll later make recommendations for improving the research.
</P>
<P>
   The sparrow plays such a prime role because it's in a prime
location: Its scattered nesting grounds include prairies just south
of Tamiami Trail and the corps floodgates that drain the central
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   That sparrow population in that part of the park has plummeted
90 percent in recent years because of flooding by the corps, Pimm
says. Meanwhile, the rest of the sparrows are in danger of being
wiped out by fire because the drainage system has left the eastern
half of the park abnormally dry.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those limits, Pimm says water managers and the corps
could have prevented last year's debacle had they started draining
the Everglades in the fall of 1997, heeding warnings about El Nino.
Instead, El Nino-driven rains triggered a crisis as the corps kept
the Tamiami Trail floodgates closed to spare the sparrow. That
forced water to build up in the central Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   As water levels in Lake Okeechobee mounted, the corps poured
water into the St. Lucie estuary, which suffered a plague of
lesion-covered fish and a loss of tourism. Water managers said they
couldn't move the water south because the Everglades was so full.
</P>
<P>
   This year, despite predictions of a drier-than-average winter,
the lake and the central Everglades are again full, although the
water is lower than a year ago. So far, the corps has held back
from releasing water into the St. Lucie or the sparrow grounds.
Pimm, an author of two books on ecology, has his share of
ammunition in the credential war. He has testified before
congressional committees, spoken at national conferences and
appeared in New York Times articles on biodiversity. He is also on
boards of six scientific journals, including Science .
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the very, very top people in conservation
biology,'' said Stanford University ecologist Paul Ehrlich, who
gained fame in the 1960s and 1970s with his predictions of global
doom from overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists say Pimm's defensiveness has worked against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so arrogant, you want to see him wrong,'' said Ron Jones,
an FIU biologist who works for the Miccosukees.
</P>
<P>
   Pimm said he tries his best to be patient with questions. ``Do I
lose my temper sometimes? Yes. If you're going to try to defend
this issue, you have to do it enthusiastically, passionately.''

 &HT;    Hibel exhibit explores relationship of mother, child
 &HT;    (EDS: Art available _ call CoxNet at (404) 526-5456.)
 &HT;    By Sue Schultz

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With one child in her arms, and her eyes minding
another four, she can't look directly at you. Her white gown is
surrounded by children of various races. They appear as pure as the
gold leaf which frames their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's melting pot boils over onto Edna Hibel's canvas in
``America the Beautiful.'' One of many, it welcomes visitors to the
B'nai B'rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum's exhibit,
``Compassion Around the World: The Art of Edna Hibel'' which runs
through March 26. A year ago, B'nai B'rith International named
Hibel its Artist of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit spans 50 years of Hibel's work, including many
pieces from the Hibel Museum of Art in Palm Beach, Fla. Hibel's
paintings, sketches and lithographs explore her interest in the
loving relationship between a mother and child, and the tranquility
of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``To her, the close feeling between a mother and child sets a
child off in life as a stable, wholesome person,'' said Andy
Plotkin, Hibel's son and executive trustee of the Hibel Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   The display also includes sketches of a painting commissioned by
the White House to commemorate its 200th anniversary in July. On a
drawing of Dolly Madison, Hibel jotted notes describing the early
first lady's charm and grace. Other possible subjects for the
painting included Abigail Adams, eagles, and a landscape of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Hibel's works are centered around her travels. At age
22, Hibel visited Mexico to study and paint. In a painting titled
``Mexican Beggar,'' Hibel focuses on the detail in a beggar's face
amid a village drawn faintly in the background.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection of her works called ``Out of the Desert:
Celebrating 50 years of Israeli Statehood,'' Hibel follows the life
of David from shepherd to king.
</P>
<P>
   ``David to me is a person from the Bible who is typical of the
great humanness capable of people, both the bad and the good, the
weak and the strong,'' Hibel wrote below one of her works.
</P>
<P>
   The B'nai B'rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum has a large
collection of art and artifacts highlighting Jewish contributions
to American society. Hibel was chosen as the B'nai B'rith
International Artist of the Year in 1998. She will be honored at a
reception at the museum on March 9th and will also receive the
Funds for Advancement of Music Educators (FAME) Award from the
Music Educators National Conference at the National Museum of Women
in the Arts in Washington on March 11.

 &HT;    `Gasoline in their blood'
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ed Levy set out to study design and
ended up learning magic. He learned how to leave an imprint that is
indelible but invisible.
</P>
<P>
   He learned from two men who gave the world some of the most
distinctive shapes of the 20th century. Although they were starkly
different, the brilliance of Harley Earl and Raymond Loewy
overlapped across the field of young Levy's fascination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earl was an automotive designer who could also design other
things,'' said Levy. ``Loewy was an industrial designer who could
also do automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy, 68, who now lives in Florida's Martin County, traces his
excitement about cars to the day in 1935 when his father came home
from the golf course, still wearing his knickers, in an Auburn
Speedster. The 5-year-old's ride through Springfield, Mass., in a
car that looked like an upside-down speedboat set his imagination
roaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to sit in school sketching cars, filling my
notebooks,'' said Levy. ``I didn't realize I was teaching myself
design.''
</P>
<P>
   His sketches were good enough to gain him entrance to New York's
Pratt Institute, and his initial course work there was good enough
to win him a full scholarship from General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Graduation in 1955 brought a designer's dream offer, a job at
GM's styling studio under Harley Earl. It was at the height of GM's
influence in the car world, before most Americans had ever ridden
in a Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Motors set the style for the industry,'' Levy said.
``And Harley Earl set the style for General Motors.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd been doing that since the late 1920s, when GM boss Alfred
Sloan discovered that Earl's custom bodies for Cadillacs were a
sensation among Hollywood stars.
</P>
<P>
   Earl drafted his stylists by intuition because there was no
precedent. ``He wanted people with gasoline in their blood, and he
could tell right away whether you had it,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Most cars of the day looked like black boxes on wheels. Earl was
among the first to use bold colors and dramatic curves. At Sloan's
urging, Earl perfected the annual model change, a
cheap-but-dazzling makeover that made last year's car seem
hopelessly outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, automobile advertising was about battery voltage
and other things people didn't care about,'' Levy said. ``Earl gave
them something to be excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Levy was assigned to work on Buicks, Earl was a
legend whose most creative days were past. Levy and other young
designers were excited by light and trim Italian models, but Earl
wanted his cars to look heavier and more ornate.
</P>
<P>
   When Levy saw how the '58 Buick was shaping up, he decided to
leave. (The car is now considered one of the most garish of the
'50s.)
</P>
<P>
   But Levy felt no animosity toward Earl, who hired Levy to work
at his own industrial design studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't do much car work, because Earl agreed not to
compete with GM,'' Levy said. But there was plenty of work
designing earth-moving equipment, bathroom fixtures and aircraft
interiors.
</P>
<P>
   When the challenge of new designs was slowed by a recession,
Levy got an offer to work for Loewy's studio in France. ``We'd just
had twins, but we sold everything and moved,'' said Levy, who lives
on Hutchinson Island with his wife, Ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Earl was a legend in the auto industry, but Loewy was a legend
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been featured on the cover of Time magazine and was later
named one of the 100 most influential people of the century by
Life.
</P>
<P>
   There was very little of modern, commercial life that Lowey
hadn't influenced, from toothpaste tubes to railroad trains. His
designs are as varied as the Shell Oil logo, the Oreo cookie
package and the classic soda-fountain Coke dispenser.
</P>
<P>
   Like Earl, Loewy was confident, a great salesman of ideas and an
instinctive judge of talent. Unlike Earl, he showed warmth toward
his employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You worked for Earl, you worked with Loewy,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Levy worked on designs for French trucks and British
sports cars. He also gave a distinctive look to gas stations across
the continent.
</P>
<P>
   His years with Loewy were filled with travel, always in a style
befitting a man who was constantly redefining the word. Loewy,
known for his silver-blue pompadour and impeccable taste in
clothes, insisted they drive the finest cars and eat only at
first-class restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Loewy, who was born in France but emigrated to America in the
1930s, kept homes in New York, California, Paris and the French
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd buy four suits at a time, one for each home,'' Levy said.
``He was the original jet-setter.''
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday in 1960, Loewy called Levy to the country estate. He
introduced the young designer to the new president of Studebaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me Studebaker wanted to produce a sports car,'' Levy
said. Levy sketched as they talked over coffee. Loewy assigned a
team to develop the idea and had Levy supervise construction of a
prototype. It turned out to be the Studebaker Avanti.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was having enormous fun in France, but as the twins grew he
wanted to bring them back to America. He left in 1963 and worked
for Loewy's New York office for a short time. He wasn't nearly as
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't working with Raymond Loewy anymore,'' he said. ``I
was working with subordinates.''
</P>
<P>
   He left and started his own design company in New Jersey,
bringing everything he learned about design to hundreds of hand
tools, garden sprayers and motor homes. He never got the chance to
design another car.
</P>
<P>
   Levy retired in 1987, moved to Florida and devoted his time to a
collection of antique automobiles. He has mostly Cadillacs now,
including a 1941 that is considered one of Harley Earl's most
influential designs.
</P>
<P>
   He lavishes as much praise on Earl as on the Cadillac's flowing
fenders, even though he concedes Earl didn't draw his cars.
``Harley Earl and Raymond Loewy understood design, but you wouldn't
give either of them a pencil,'' he said. ``That's why they hired
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction comes in knowing the design was right and
useful, not in taking credit, Levy said. He learned to accept
invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you work for someone, whatever you do for them is
theirs,'' he said. ``You understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avanti went on to become one of the most enduring designs
ever, produced by several companies long after Studebaker quit, but
Levy was never part of the official design team and isn't credited
in any article or book about the car.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled when he recalled seeing his original, coffee-stained
sketches at an exposition years later bearing the signature Raymond
Loewy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't possibly be upset about that,'' Levy said. ``He was
such a wonderful man.''

 &HT;    Blind man tackles welding job
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It may sound like the beginning of a bad joke:
Did you hear about the blind welder? But it's no joke to Justin
Pierce _ it's a job.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, 22, of Meridian, Miss., is legally blind but recently
spent five days at Motoman headquarters in West Carrollton, Ohio,
learning how to program and use a $70,000 robotic arc welding
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most blind people . . . are not dumb, they just can't see. You
don't have to actually see (the welding) to do it. That's the only
way I can explain it,'' Pierce said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce works for the Mississippi Industries for the Blind, which
uses the robotic welder to make blank keys for the postal service,
tree planting rakes for the state forestry service and other metal
pieces. He said he got interested in robotic arc welding because it
involves computer programming, which he is studying at a community
college back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was computerized and involved programming so I figured I'd
try it,'' he said. How does a blind man learn to weld? ``Learn
where (the welding tip) is at, where the keys are at and be very
careful with it. If you get into a hurry it'll end up a big mess,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, who has worked for Mississippi Industries for the Blind
for about four months, held other jobs such as a McDonald's cook
and a grocery store cashier. ``That wasn't hard but it blew
people's minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce uses a closed circuit TV camera and monitor that
magnifies things so he can see them. Born premature, Pierce's
retinas were damaged while under an oxygen tent. He sees nothing
out of his right eye and only shapes, shadows and sometimes colors
out of his left eye. The vision in his left eye varies day to day,
depending on swelling in the blood vessels, Pierce said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce said the Mississippi Department of Vocation and
Rehabilitation is developing binoculars for him to use so he can
see the welding torch tip from an arm's length away and another
magnifying tool. Motoman's arc welding system also has safety
features to prevent anyone from wandering near the welder while it
is operating.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989, Motoman makes 25 different robot models that
have payloads varying from 6.6 pounds to 880 pounds. Motoman
employs about 450 people in West Carrollton and Troy and had
approximately $150 million in sales in the last fiscal year,
Motoman spokesman Nicholas Trick said.
</P>
<P>
   Trick said training classes are held every week on how to use,
program and maintain the various robotic products made by Motoman
but Pierce is the first blind welder to take the training.

 &HT;    Ecologist and sparrow go under the spotlight
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Even its staunchest champion admits that
the Everglades' most bitterly debated bird can be hard for some to
appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Invisible to most visitors, camouflaged in colors as drab as the
flat grasslands it calls home, the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is
anything but majestic. It feeds and nests at ground level and flies
so slowly that researchers have sometimes caught it by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the spring mating season do the males begin to sing _ a
chip-chip-bzzzzzzz _ that few would confuse with the nightingale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to write soppy poetry, an ode to the Cape Sable
sparrow,'' admits Stuart Pimm, a University of Tennessee ecologist
who has devoted much of his career to the endangered bird. ``I sort
of wish it was a more charismatic bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, much of the future of the Everglades may hang on this
nondescript sparrow, which last year helped trigger a
water-management bottleneck ranging from fish kills on the St.
Lucie River to flood-stricken tree islands in Miami-Dade County.
And much of that debate will hang on Pimm, whose research for
Everglades National Park is set to go under the microscope today at
a science symposium near Miami.
</P>
<P>
   To the Oxford-educated Pimm, the fight to save the remaining
3,000 or so sparrows is also the fight to save the park and the
rest of the Everglades
</P>
<P>
   The entire park, he said, suffers from the same flawed drainage
system that routinely drowns some sparrow nesting grounds while
leaving others parched and fire-prone. And, he argues, neither the
sparrow nor the Everglades will see real relief from the $7.8
billion restoration proposal by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   That stance has attracted a barrage of criticism, especially
from Miccosukee Indians who have seen their land flooded by the
corps' attempts to help the sparrow. The tribe's scientists argue
that the bird may be longer-lived and more mobile than Pimm
believes, not a helpless creature that needs drastic action.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that Pimm, despite a history of research ranging
from the Pacific to Brazil to Afghanistan, is no expert on a
sparrow found only in the southern Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten in too deep,'' tribal attorney Dexter Lehtinen
said. ``Environmentalists have fallen for his story that he's going
to save the sparrow.'' Pimm has described some of the criticism as
``biologically incredible'' and ``absolutely bloody ridiculous.''
He said people who try to make him or the sparrow the center of the
debate are missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about an obscure little bird,'' said Pimm, 49, a
naturalized U.S. citizen who speaks in the accent of his native
Derbyshire, England. ``It's just inexcusable for the richest
country in the world with a rich national park to let the park go
to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Pimm's research helped inspire today's workshop
at Florida International University, in which experts assembled by
the American Ornithological Union will hear reports from all sides.
They'll later make recommendations for improving the research.
</P>
<P>
   The sparrow plays such a prime role because it's in a prime
location: Its scattered nesting grounds include prairies just south
of Tamiami Trail and the corps floodgates that drain the central
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   That sparrow population in that part of the park has plummeted
90 percent in recent years because of flooding by the corps, Pimm
says. Meanwhile, the rest of the sparrows are in danger of being
wiped out by fire because the drainage system has left the eastern
half of the park abnormally dry.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those limits, Pimm says water managers and the corps
could have prevented last year's debacle had they started draining
the Everglades in the fall of 1997, heeding warnings about El Nino.
Instead, El Nino-driven rains triggered a crisis as the corps kept
the Tamiami Trail floodgates closed to spare the sparrow. That
forced water to build up in the central Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   As water levels in Lake Okeechobee mounted, the corps poured
water into the St. Lucie estuary, which suffered a plague of
lesion-covered fish and a loss of tourism. Water managers said they
couldn't move the water south because the Everglades was so full.
</P>
<P>
   This year, despite predictions of a drier-than-average winter,
the lake and the central Everglades are again full, although the
water is lower than a year ago. So far, the corps has held back
from releasing water into the St. Lucie or the sparrow grounds.
Pimm, an author of two books on ecology, has his share of
ammunition in the credential war. He has testified before
congressional committees, spoken at national conferences and
appeared in New York Times articles on biodiversity. He is also on
boards of six scientific journals, including Science .
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of the very, very top people in conservation
biology,'' said Stanford University ecologist Paul Ehrlich, who
gained fame in the 1960s and 1970s with his predictions of global
doom from overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   But some scientists say Pimm's defensiveness has worked against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so arrogant, you want to see him wrong,'' said Ron Jones,
an FIU biologist who works for the Miccosukees.
</P>
<P>
   Pimm said he tries his best to be patient with questions. ``Do I
lose my temper sometimes? Yes. If you're going to try to defend
this issue, you have to do it enthusiastically, passionately.''

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ With the death of King Hussein, the always
too-eagerly centrifugal Middle East has lost one of the key figures
working effectively to keep it from flying completely apart. (Tom
Teepen is national correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ I've lost track of how many times I've
flip-flopped between favoring and opposing the death penalty.
Presently, I'm in my pro-death penalty mode, but something happened
last week that may reverse that position _ again. (Kleinberg, Cox
News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My friend Gail is a
self-proclaimed choco-holic. Heredity, she says. Too bad the
scientists don't agree. The perils of chocolate addiction linger _
esepcially around Valentine's Day. (Schuett, Cox News Service)
MOVED.

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ See the politician. See the
politician run. See the politician talk. See him talk from both
sides of his mouth as he runs. Out of one side, the politician
talks about ``local control of schools.'' Out of the other he talks
about ``accountability.'' That means state control through TAAS _
the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. TAAS is a criterion-based
test _ testing on specific objectives every child is supposed to
learn. So doing, what's in TAAS dictates what goes on in classrooms
across Texas. So when the Texas Education Agency sets out to expand
on TAAS, testing more students and on more subjects, it's no pebble
in the pond. It's an asteroid. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

 &HT;    Men interested in charity, but not funny hats, regalia
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Honeymooners had The Raccoons.
Laurel and Hardy had the Sons of the Desert.
</P>
<P>
   For so many men through so many years, a night at the lodge was
an irrevocable privilege that withstood the onslaught of tears,
threats and flying dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd believe they'd just give it up?
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all fraternal organizations started shrinking about 20
years ago and the acceleration for some has been dramatic: The Elks
down more than 20 percent, the Eagles nearly that much. The
Shriners have shrunk to nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   That may not mean much if you don't belong, but maybe it should.
Almost all fraternities stress charity and civic duty. So fewer
lodge members can mean fewer Little League umpires or less money
for children's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect lent a gloomy cast to a 1995 essay called Bowling
Alone by Harvard business professor Robert Putnam. Putnam tied the
decline of fraternities to a general decline in communal instinct.
More Americans than ever are bowling, for example, but membership
in bowling leagues has plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam's warnings about a continued decline in civic involvement
caught the attention of Bill Clinton, who invited him to Camp
David. But while others look for ways to plug the civic-duty gaps,
fraternal organizations are seeking their own rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   The Shriners, among the most recognizable of traditional lodges,
commissioned pollster Louis Harris to survey American men 35 to 55
_ considered of prime joining age.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most discouraging findings: Only a handful want to
spend a lot of time with other men or join a male-only
organization. They're also turned off by uniforms and regalia, and
by demanding entrance requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bright spots: Men are still attracted to charitable
work, especially if it's geared toward children.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all want to spend more time with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Most fraternities have responded aggressively to these changing
attitudes. Whimsical titles are fading from use along with fanciful
costumes. (It's been many years since Moose shed their hats, known
by the backward name ``tah.'')
</P>
<P>
   Moose International is urging the conversion of local lodges
into Moose Family Centers, with at least some bar space yielding to
kids' playrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Women of the Moose are also getting elevated status and
attention, but the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks took the
truly revolutionary step several years ago of admitting women as
full-fledged members.
</P>
<P>
   The Shrine of North America, more than a century old, is
unlikely to abandon it's male-only policy or cast off the
distinctive red fez, but joining has become a bit easier.
</P>
<P>
   The daunting process of becoming a Mason, a necessary first-step
to membership in the Shrine, has been vastly simplified in some
lodges. It used to take months of study, including the memorization
of long, complex passages of Mason lore. Now, much of that has been
compressed into a one-day course. Other lodges have abandoned the
historic prohibition against soliciting new members.
</P>
<P>
   And the Shrine's once-mysterious installation rites _ complete
with brightly colored costumes _ are now open to family members, as
are many other gatherings. Even conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we met at Disney World,'' said Jack Jones, the
Shrine's international secretary, otherwise known as the Imperial
Recorder. ``Just about everyone brought their wives.''
</P>
<P>
   One drawback to the family-friendly approach is that families
don't stay in one place any more. Kids move away instead of taking
their father's place at the local lodge. Then the fathers move,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for South Florida fraternities, this is where many
of them wind up. Many lodges here thrive on the constant flow of
prospective members who bring the old traditions and zeal.
</P>
<P>
   But all recognize the need to spread that spirit to a younger
generation. Says Fred Cohen, of the Order of Knights of Pythias,
Lake Worth Lodge, ``Every time a member passes away, that's one we
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick: Which ones are the Shriners? Are they the clowns, or the
guys in the little cars? Or are they the ones affiliated with
children's hospitals?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: All the above.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of subgroups in each lodge; or ``units'' in each
``temple,'' in Shriner parlance: The clowns are a fixture of Shrine
parades. So are the motorcycles and miniature Model Ts. David A.
Batchelor leads the Amara Shrine Temple (he gets to call himself
``potentate'') in Palm Beach Gardens, administering a district that
ranges from Boca Raton to Belle Glade to Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Batchelor, 58, joined in 1987. Back then, local membership was
about 3,000. Now it's about 1,900. Nationally, Shrine membership is
down from its peak of 941,000 in 1979 to about 550,000.
</P>
<P>
   That might mean fewer dinners to serve at the temple on Friday
night, but the number of children who need help keeps going up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 1,200 (children) from this area currently being
treated,'' says Batchelor, a trucker. That's a lot of round trips
to the nearest Shriners Hospital for Children in Tampa, Fla., a lot
of 15-hour days for Shriners at the wheel of the temple's vans
taking the kids to the hospital. and back.
</P>
<P>
   The district is at peak fundraising season now, and Batchelor
wants everyone to know that none of the money buys clown makeup or
hats or anything except hospital care. (Shrine entertainers buy
their own equipment.)
</P>
<P>
   The 22 hospitals are an abiding passion for almost all Shriners
but hardly the only reason they stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to like people and want to be around them,'' says
longtime member Jean LaCroix. ``It can bring relief from the
drabness of society. It makes life a lot nicer.''
</P>
<P>
   SURVEY SAYS: Restrictive policies a turnoff for many men
</P>
<P>
   The Shriners commissioned Louis Harris and Associates to survey
men between 35 and 55 to gauge the appeal of fraternal groups.
Here, some of the results from the 1995 study:
</P>
<P>
   One in four men belongs to a club or civic organization.
</P>
<P>
   Only one is 10 is very likely to join one in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half have trouble finding enough leisure time.
</P>
<P>
   Only 5 percent place great importance on spending time with
other men.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 percent would consider joining a club restricted to one
racial, ethnic or cultural group.

white gown is surrounded by children of various races. They appear
as pure as the gold leaf which frames their faces. The nation's
melting pot boils over onto Edna Hibel's canvas in ``America the

   AUTO-DESIGNER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Ed Levy set out to study
design and ended up learning magic. He learned how to leave an
imprint that is indelible but invisible. He learned from two men
who gave the world some of the most distinctive shapes of the 20th
century. Although they were starkly different, the brilliance of
Harley Earl and Raymond Loewy overlapped across the field of young
Levy's fascination. ``Earl was an automotive designer who could
also design other things,'' said Levy. ``Loewy was an industrial
designer who could also do automobiles.'' Levy, 68, who now lives
in Florida's Martin County, traces his excitement about cars to the
day in 1935 when his father came home from the golf course, still
wearing his knickers, in an Auburn Speedster. The 5-year-old's ride
through Springfield, Mass., in a car that looked like an
upside-down speedboat set his imagination roaring. (Kalajian, Palm

   CROSS-REVIEW _ In Southern Cross, Cornwell's apparently trying

who mocks all things modern Florida. And Hiaasen she isn't.
According to its cover notes and press material, Southern Cross
aims to be a satirical novel about a Southern police department.
But that's the only way you'd know. A review. (Gulliver, Cox News

<P>
   ELVIS-REVIEW _ It was the young Elvis who turned the world on
its ear, who led a rock 'n' roll revolution, who fairly radiated
the joy and passion he felt for his music. The older Elvis was the
rhinestone-studded ``sensuous clown'' (in the words of one critic)
who destroyed his reputation while lining his pockets (and those of
his infamous manager) by starring in dozens of bad movies,
recording scores of lackluster songs and giving ridiculously
ultra-glitzy performances in Las Vegas and across the United
States. He was also the living chemistry set whose prodigious drug
intake resulted in an ignominious death on a toilet in his Memphis
mansion, Graceland. It's the older Elvis who's the focus of
Careless Love , Peter Guralnick's follow-up to 1994's acclaimed
Last Train to Memphis. A review. (Beyerlein, Dayton Daily News)

   TVSURFER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Being in the audience for the taping

and that wasn't even a long night. (Kloer, Atlanta

   EVERGLADES-ECOLOGY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Even its staunchest
champion admits that the Everglades' most bitterly debated bird can
be hard for some to appreciate. Invisible to most visitors,
camouflaged in colors as drab as the flat grasslands it calls home,
the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is anything but majestic. It feeds
and nests at ground level and flies so slowly that researchers have
sometimes caught it by hand. ``Nobody's going to write soppy
poetry, an ode to the Cape Sable sparrow,'' admits Stuart Pimm, a
University of Tennessee ecologist who has devoted much of his
career to the endangered bird. ``I sort of wish it was a more
charismatic bird.'' (King, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   EVERGLADES-ECOLOGY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Even its staunchest
champion admits that the Everglades' most bitterly debated bird can
be hard for some to appreciate. Invisible to most visitors,
camouflaged in colors as drab as the flat grasslands it calls home,
the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is anything but majestic. It feeds
and nests at ground level and flies so slowly that researchers have
sometimes caught it by hand. ``Nobody's going to write soppy
poetry, an ode to the Cape Sable sparrow,'' admits Stuart Pimm, a
University of Tennessee ecologist who has devoted much of his
career to the endangered bird. ``I sort of wish it was a more
charismatic bird.'' (King, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   It's apparent that U.S. House managers _ and even lead
prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. _ finally see that President
Clinton won't be a convicted on either of the two articles of
impeachment. So, they have begun a whisper campaign. The managers
imply that the House impeachment investigation turned up
``evidence,'' now kept in sealed documents, about Clinton groping
Kathleen Willey and about other women who were sexually harassed by
Clinton when he was the governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. And there's a man outside a casino in Las Vegas who will
sell you a fool-proof way to win at roulette.
</P>
<P>
   In one of Hyde's rare moments of being candid, last week, he
pleaded for live testimony saying, ``We just need new evidence.''
New evidence for what? To convict, obviously. In other words, even
Hyde admits that the case the House brought to the Senate doesn't
have sufficient proof that Clinton committed perjury or obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The House impeachment managers were hoping something dramatic
would break in live testimony before the Senate, but that door was
shut tight by a vote of the Senate. Then they hoped something would
leap out of the depositions taken of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan
and Sidney Blumenthal. Nothing did. No new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   House manager Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., in order to ratchet up
moral outrage, described Lewinsky in the videotape of her
deposition as ``a young woman, very much like a family member we
might know.'' Other impeachment managers spoke of her innocence and
youth. Not one mentioned that Lewinsky had a lengthy affair with a
married man while she attend college at Lewis and Clark in
Portland, Ore. Not one mentioned, as the Oregonian reported in late
October, that Lewinsky had forged a dean's name on a letter to get
extra paid work for her married lover.
</P>
<P>
   Innocence?
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks various right-wing kooks have sprayed their
warped email across the Internet. They claim that Clinton fathered
a child with a black prostitute. That he had Vincent Foster killed.
That Clinton raped several women before he became president. That
he is guilty of treason for trading missile technology to China.
Worse, that Clinton is a womanizer _ and for such a sin alone
should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr let it be known that he may
decide to bring criminal charges against Clinton before the
president leaves office. His timing was critical to turning up the
heat on the president and the Senate. In effect, Starr was saying
to those senators who are reluctant to convict Clinton on the
unconvincing evidence presented to them: Look again, there's more
than enough to convict Clinton in a criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr really intends to bring criminal charges against
Clinton while the president is still in office, he is wading in
unknown waters. While some constitutional scholars may consider
that possible, the intent of the framers is clear _ impeachment is
the only way to topple a sitting president. A criminal trial will
have to wait until Clinton is no longer president.
</P>
<P>
   And now GOP Senate conservatives want to have Clinton found
guilty _ without convicting him of the articles of impeachment.
That's what a ``finding of fact resolution'' means _ and a
resolution only needs a majority vote to pass. In other words, the
55 Republicans in the Senate can vote in favor of a resolution that
claims the president is guilty since they can't convince enough
Democrats to vote to convict the president. Guilty, but not guilty.
Clearly, such a resolution would go beyond the impeachment
authority granted to the Senate by the U.S. Constitution _ and far
beyond America's sense of fair play. Either Clinton is guilty or
he's not guilty. He can't be both.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the American public has quietly been telling the
Republican Party to knock it off or pay the consequences in the
next election.
</P>
<P>
   Listen up, Republicans. This isn't an idle threat. Shut the
impeachment down, or be shut down yourselves.

THE PRO AND CON OF DICKENS' `TWO CITIES'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Dickens, the 187th anniversary of whose birth was Feb.
7, is by acclamation the greatest of all novelists. At his peak of
popularity he was the most famous man in the world. ``David
Copperfield'' marked that peak at midcentury, 1850; and
``Copperfield'' was the midpoint of Dickens' activity as novelist,
coming eighth in his sequence of 15 full-length works (including
``The Mystery of Edwin Drood,'' published in uncompleted form).
</P>
<P>
   And ``Copperfield'' was a significant turning point. Following
publication of the preceding novel _ ``Dombey and Son'' _ Dickens
put himself to work on an intended autobiography, labored awhile
without satisfaction, and abandoned the notion in favor of the
semi-autobiographical novel that ``David Copperfield'' became. The
unloading of autobiographical baggage finally freed Dickens to
become such a literary artist as he hadn't been before.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Pickwick'' in 1837 through ``Oliver Twist,'' ``Nicholas
Nickleby,'' ``The Old Curiosity Shop,'' ``Barnaby Rudge,'' ``Martin
Chuzzlewit'' and then ``Dombey'' an even decade later, Charles
Dickens was the great entertainer. His extravagantly appointed
characters _ caricatures, to be sure _ provoked laughter in his
readers, and his outrageous, calculated sentimentality jerked their
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Thus emancipated by the novel that recorded the injustices he
absorbed in childhood, Charles Dickens then put himself to work on
a sequence of novels that would reveal the corruptive nature of
social institutions _ in ``Bleak House,'' the law; in ``Hard
Times,'' industry; in ``Little Dorrit,'' the penal system; in
``Great Expectations,'' class; and in ``Our Mutual Friend,'' money.
</P>
<P>
   Only once was the sequence interrupted. Sandwiched between
``Little Dorrit'' and ``Great Expectations'' was the master's take
on the French Revolution _ ``A Tale of Two Cities,'' published in
1859. As I have gushed about the glory of Dickens' ``theme''
novels, readers have absorbed my inference that ``A Tale of Two
Cities'' is a somehow lesser novel, and regard me as its detractor.
</P>
<P>
   I am, and I'm not. ``A Tale of Two Cities'' is Dickens' only
post-''Copperfield'' novel to duplicate the popularity of the early
works, particularly ``Pickwick,'' ``Oliver Twist,'' and the saga of
the author's ``favorite child'' _ ``David Copperfield'' indeed. For
what it was meant to be, ``Two Cities'' was an unqualified success.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens' artistic mission had been put aside briefly so he could
write a historical novel. Not only was Dickens jealous of the
Stendhal reputation as master of the historical epic, he was
scarred by the failure of his only foray into the genre _ ``Barnaby
Rudge,'' the novel focused on the Gordon anti-popery riots of 1780,
beheld as a flop by Dickens scholars and other critics.
</P>
<P>
   So he had something to prove, and ``Two Cities'' was his
redemption. It's his most melodramatic novel, and the murky
business with the Defarges does captivate; but altogether it isn't
a patch on ``The Red and the Black'' or ``The Charterhouse of
Parma.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Dickens' French characters are realized much better
than his English principals. Lucie Manette is yet another simpering
heroine, certainly not pointing the way to Estella Havisham, Lizzie
Hexam and Bella Wilfer. Charles Darnay is a pallid hero, Jarvis
Lorry a bore; thus colorful wastrel Sidney Carton is transfigured
into a protagonist in every dramatization of the novel on stage or
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Dickens died in 1870 during composition of another response to a
dare. His close friend Wilkie Collins was outselling him with ``The
Moonstone,'' ``Armadale'' and ``The Woman in White.'' Dickens
warmed to the competition with ``Edwin Drood,'' vowing a super
mystery _ which, if completed, might have proved another point,
without enhancing its author's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens, though, is incomparable. Happy birthday.

SURVIVING PETS BECOMING FIXTURES IN OBITUARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Photos available on Wieck database)

 By CARMINIA DANINI  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Nancy Weir was at a funeral home last June mulling
over what information to include in her late husband's obituary
when a friend suggested she list one more survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You have to include Buford; everyone knew Buford
worldwide,''' Weir recalled.
</P>
<P>
   When Col. Donald Weir's obituary appeared in the San Antonio
Express-News the next day, Nancy Weir, his two sisters and a
brother were named as survivors.
</P>
<P>
   So was Buford, a 5-year-old bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Weir said she didn't need much convincing to include the
family pet because Buford and a Shar-Pei the couple also owned at
the time were included on the cover of the program for her
husband's 1995 retirement party.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Weir retired from the Air Force in November 1995 after a
30-year career, 20 of them as a trial judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buford is the last of some seven or eight bulldogs we've had
since 1971, and we even shipped three when we went to Japan,''
Nancy Weir said. ``Bulldogs were my husband's favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   Listing pets among the survivors in obituaries is not unusual.
People are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of pets to
their quality of life, said Paula Cooey, a professor of religion at
Trinity University in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that we get a major psychological lift from
animals and we are beginning to pay more attention to the intrinsic
value of pets,'' Cooey said.
</P>
<P>
   Janice Hume, an assistant journalism professor at Kansas State
University, studied more than 8,000 obituaries for more than a year
as part of the research for her doctoral dissertation at the
University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The content of obituaries has changed with society, Hume noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1800s, over and over again, we see people with links to
George Washington,'' Hume said by telephone from Manhattan, Kan.
``One elderly woman's obituary noted she sang in a choir when
Washington came through town, which says more about Washington than
it did about her.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Victorian era, flowery phrases describing the deceased as
``removed by the omnipotent author,'' ``scathed by the wing of the
destroying angel'' or ``paled by the almighty Death King'' were
common in obituaries, Hume said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think about it, an obituary is a synopsis of what we
did with our lives,'' she said. ``Mentioning a pet is indicative of
how much people value their pets.''
</P>
<P>
   Baby, a Shih Tzu, and Godfrey, a golden retriever and collie
mix, were listed as the ``loving dogs'' of former E.H. ``Herb''
Whitis Jr. when his obituary was published in October. Whitis was
the former mayor of Del Rio, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were such an important part of daddy's life, especially
toward the end, that I couldn't leave them out,'' said Holly
Warner, one of Whitis' daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Whitis died of lung cancer at his home in Del Rio, with his
wife, Elwyn, and Baby, the Shih Tzu, at his side, Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, obituaries mention survivors that are neither human
nor animal.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the obituary of Neil Blaylock Jr., a San Antonio man
who was killed in an auto accident, listed a 1965 Dodge pickup
truck among the survivors.

MAKING TRACKS WITH THE STONES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You can't blame the Rolling Stones for touring and
recording into their mid-50s.
</P>
<P>
   When the iconic blues-rock band started, the guys had no idea
they'd be at it some 35 years later. It's just that they kept
getting asked back.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Tuesday and Thursday at the Anaheim Pond as part of
the ``Social Security'' _ oops, ``No Security'' _ tour, which
offers Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ron Wood's
first series of indoor dates in 10 years, the Stones have heard it
all before.
</P>
<P>
   ``No band has ever survived this long ... we could have written
all the jokes ourselves,'' Richards said recently. ``You know what
they're gonna start saying, so you just have to ride it out. In a
way, it spurs the band on a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't know what spurs this band on. Like the Grateful Dead
during that band's last 20 years, the Stones churn out lackluster
albums and make their money by touring.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pond, the band's first Orange County concerts since 1978,
fans have paid up to $150 a ticket _ $300 for Pond season-ticket
holders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Dead, though, the Stones once really were the
Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band in the world.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of argument, and to get those nasty letters flowing
in, here's my list of the 10 best Stones songs of all time. My
criteria was only studio records, no live stuff, no cover tunes.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't trying to compile the greatest hits, only the very
best. Maybe that's why there's nothing here beyond 1972. Most
Stones fans agree the band was making its most witty, committed and
forceful music with ``Let It Bleed,'' ``Beggar's Banquet'' and
``Exile on Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   We also asked John Carr, editor of the bimonthly unofficial
Stones fanzine Sticky Fingers, to come up with his best 10 live
tracks from the many hundreds of Stones bootlegs out there.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Shuster's top 10:
</P>
<P>
   ``Gimme Shelter'': From the ``Let It Bleed'' album, this was the
Stones at their very best, with some of Keith's most stirring
guitar work and Jagger's most haunting vocals. The opening cut of
the last album to feature Stones creator Brian Jones, ``Gimme
Shelter'' will forever be linked to the murder at Altamont and will
always conjure up images of Jagger's top hat and scarf and the last
gasp of the '60s. The repeated line ``it's just a shot away'' is
answered by the ``you can't always get what you want'' chorus of
the album's final track.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Tumbling Dice'': This track from ``Exile on Main Street''
is the Stones doing blue-eyed soul better than anyone. A monstrous
Richards riff opens, followed by Watts' powerful edge-of-disaster
drums. Jagger is at his strutting best, while Mick Taylor's
terrific guitar lines weave in and out. Taylor also plays bass on
the song, and Jagger throws in some guitar while backup singer
Clydie King's sweet soul workouts in the background and Jimmy
Miller's raw production ensure classic status.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Sympathy for the Devil'': This epic tune is from ``Beggar's
Banquet,'' which signaled the Stones' return to their blues roots
after the previous year's psychedelic outing, ``Their Satanic
Majesties Request.'' An acoustic Delta flavor colors many of the
album's tracks, but ``Sympathy,'' with its fiery guitar licks,
leering vocal, Afro rhythms and satanic lyrics, defined the band's
image for all time.
</P>
<P>
   4. Off ``Sticky Fingers,'' this is the Stones' first nonironic
attempt at country music, and it's a beautiful, heart-tugging
masterpiece cut at legendary Muscle Shoals Sound in Alabama during
the band's 1969 tour.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Stray Cat Blues'': Another bluesy gem from ``Beggar's
Banquet,'' this one features some stunning slide work and Jagger at
his most lascivious and malevolent. The Stones' reputation as the
``world's greatest rock 'n' roll band'' begins with this album.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Satisfaction'': It's all been said before. When this
defining single came along, with its timeless three-note riff and
sexy lyrics, nobody had heard anything like it before. The Beatles
only wanted to hold your hand. When ``Satisfaction'' was issued on
the ``Out of Our Heads'' album, it established the Stones as rock's
bad boys.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Ruby Tuesday'': A beautiful, melancholy oldie from
``Between the Buttons,'' an album release that was bookended by
some of the most notorious incidents in the band's history. Before
the record came out, the Stones went on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' to
perform ``Let's Spend the Night Together,'' the suggestive B-side
to ``Ruby Tuesday,'' and Jagger was forced to mumble the song's
title or risk being banned. A few months later, Jagger and Richards
faced their first drug arrests.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Moonlight Mile'': With Paul Buckmaster's grandiose strings
sawing away and Taylor's moody guitar, this sad, yearning, perfect
piece closes ``Sticky Fingers'' on a note of cocaine-adled regret.
Richards doesn't play on this track _ he was busy living it.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Let It Loose'': A gospel-infused beauty from the Stones'
best album, ``Exile on Main Street,'' this track is fueled by Nicky
Hopkins' piano, a sweet vocal choir that included Mac Rebennack
(Dr. John) and a slippin' and slidin' horn section.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Sway'': Another ``Sticky Fingers'' classic, this time with
Taylor, the best guitarist ever to play with the Stones, handling
the numerous guitar overdubs while Richards sits this one out.
Watts is all over the drums, Hopkins rides the ivories, and Jagger
tries to keep up, but it's Taylor's showcase all the way. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JOHN CARR'S LIVE BOOTLEG TOP 10
</P>
<P>
   1. ``Jumpin' Jack Flash'': Bootlegged from the ``Gimme Shelter''
1969 Altamont concert film, this alternate version features a
fantastic lead guitar break from Taylor. It's the 1969 version of
the Stones without horns and sidemen.
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Roll Over Beethoven'': From the 1970 European tour, this
Chuck Berry favorite was last covered by the band in '65 and hasn't
been picked up since this trek.
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Stray Cat Blues'': From the 1971 farewell to Britain tour,
before the band moved to France for tax reason, this was recorded
at Leeds University with lots of inventive lead work from Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Love in Vain'': An incredible version of this Delta blues
classic taped during the 1972 tour, with Taylor's fluid, bluesy
guitar at its very best.
</P>
<P>
   5. ``You Can't Always Get What You Want'': Taped in Europe in
1973, a great 12-minute performance of a great Stones song with a
memorable sax solo by Bobby Keys.
</P>
<P>
   6. ``Wild Horses'': A song never played during the Taylor years,
this marks the start of the Ron Wood era of the Stones. Taped in
1975 by an audience member in Baton Rouge, La., tour keyboardist
Billy Preston's chimes ring in the background during a unique
version of this Stones country classic.
</P>
<P>
   7. ``Brown Sugar'': Bootlegged from a 1978 radio broadcast, this
performance features an energetic audience sing-along on the
chorus.
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Paint It Black'': With backup singers, horn section and
extra musicians, this 1989 track reveals an energized Stones back
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Gimme Shelter'': A fantastic, extended version from 1995,
taped in Europe for TV broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Let It Bleed'': Taped on the secondary smaller stage at a
Chicago venue in 1997, this is a solid country rave-up.

`RUSHMORE' CO-WRITERS OPERATE ON THE BUDDY SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ Wes Anderson has made one movie that critics kind
of liked (``Bottle Rocket'') and one movie that critics really
loved (``Rushmore''). But, as yet, he hasn't made a movie that
anyone has ever really seen. And that makes him a little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the accolades for `Rushmore' are kind of nice, but we were
hearing a lot of the same sort of things when `Bottle Rocket' came
out two years ago,'' Anderson says. ``Then the movie came out and
it turned out there were lots of people who hated it that we never
knew about. It was a really bad experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few months have helped ease Anderson's pain. (``Believe
me, I was severely depressed,'' Anderson says.) ``Rushmore,'' which
Anderson co-wrote with long-time friend and ``Bottle Rocket''
writing partner Owen Wilson, has opened to rave reviews at fall
film festivals in Telluride, Toronto and New York. Premiere
magazine called it the best movie of the year. The Los Angeles Film
Critics Association gave Anderson its prestigious New Generation
award.
</P>
<P>
   Disney chairman Joe Roth, who made ``Rushmore,'' liked the film
so much that he has just given Anderson and Wilson the financing
for their next movie, an ensemble comedy about a dysfunctional
family of New York geniuses.
</P>
<P>
   So why is Anderson so worried?
</P>
<P>
   To answer that, you have to understand the 29-year-old filmmaker
and just how close to his heart he holds the two movies he has
written with Wilson. Both ``Bottle Rocket'' and ``Rushmore''
revolve around questions of friendship and are filled with a
knowing innocence that makes perfect sense when you learn of
Anderson's obsession with the ``Peanuts'' comic strip. (``We love
that melancholy and bittersweet thing,'' Wilson says.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The movies Wes and Owen write combine wide-eyed idealism with
a deadpan, ironic sensibility,'' says ``Rushmore'' producer Barry
Mendel. ``(Director) Mike Nichols said `Rushmore' was the best
punctuated script he had seen in years, which says nothing about
the content but a lot about the writers. These guys have read a lot
of Cheever and Salinger and Fitzgerald. They have a literary
sensibility and it comes out in their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds filmmaker James L. Brooks, who produced ``Bottle Rocket''
and serves as a sounding board for Anderson and Wilson: ``You come
away from `Rushmore' with the same experience that you do when you
spend time with a terrific book. These guys are going to have a
career in their own mold, which is the hardest thing to achieve in
film today.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately for a couple of literary types, the writers drew
heavily on their own formative experiences for ``Rushmore.'' The
movie follows Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a 15-year-old
student at the Rushmore Academy who excels at extracurricular
activities (his Max Fischer Players bring an elaborate version of
``Serpico'' to the school's stage) but is close to flunking out
because of his poor grades.
</P>
<P>
   Max, though, remains impervious to his precarious position. He
loves Rushmore so much that he never wants the experience to end.
That's part of the rationale behind him telling Miss Cross (Olivia
Williams), a school teacher who becomes the object of a huge crush:
``I plan to go to Oxford or the Sorbonne; Harvard is my safety.''
</P>
<P>
   All three schools are impossibilities. But that doesn't bother
Max since he already attends the institution of his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Max decides to build a Rushmore aquarium for Miss Cross and
seeks funding from a depressed tycoon named Mr. Blume (Bill
Murray). When Blume falls for Miss Cross as well, he becomes Max's
mortal enemy. Blume, too, jumps into the fray, at one point running
over Max's bicycle with his Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between Max Fischer and Wes Anderson are
obvious enough. Anderson began writing school plays as a
fourth-grader. He devoted most of his high school years at St.
John's in Houston (which serves as the setting for Rushmore in the
film) to clubs and amateur dramatics, much to the detriment of his
grades. He wanted to go to an Ivy League school. He wound up at the
University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like myself that much back then,'' Anderson says. ``I
would have loved to have been somebody like Max, who would have
been a hero to me, but I wasn't as well-spoken or outgoing. And
when I didn't get into Brown or Dartmouth or Princeton, I felt like
a failure. I had no idea of who I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   He met Wilson in a playwriting class at Texas and they
eventually became roommates. They liked the same movies and books
and shared a similar comic sensibility. Plus, Wilson has a bit of
Max in him, too. He was expelled from Dallas' St. Mark's School of
Texas for stealing a teacher's edition geometry textbook and using
it to boost his extra-credit capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met Wes, he had just finished his first year at Texas
and he told me he was going to be transferring to Yale soon,''
Wilson says. ``And I remember thinking, `What kind of fantasy world
are you living in?' because I knew he was a terrible student. But
he said it with such conviction, I almost wanted to believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With us,'' Wilson continues, ``we like things that have
enthusiasm and have passion and aren't exactly drawn to bad guys or
meanness. Beyond that, we just click. When Wes writes something, I
can imagine having written it myself. Only it's better because I
didn't have to do all the work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottle Rocket'' began life as a 14-minute short and became a
full-fledged film when Brooks saw it. Even though the finished
product tanked, the movie demonstrated enough talent and promise
for Disney's Roth to make a deal for ``Rushmore.'' Murray's
enthusiasm for the script certainly didn't hurt their chances,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a tenacious perfectionist, admits to being a little
frightened at the prospect of directing a comic superstar like
Murray. Initially, Anderson gave his directions to Murray in a
whisper, so he wouldn't be embarrassed if his star contradicted
him. Murray never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, I had heard he threw a woman in a lake once on a
set where things weren't going well, so I had a certain trepidation
in approaching him at first,'' Anderson says dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Murray ended up being the film's biggest advocate, helping
newcomer Schwartzman feel at ease (``Once he stopped trying to
impress Bill, everything was OK,'' Anderson says) and hauling
sandbags and equipment when Anderson needed to complete a shot 10
minutes before sundown. At one point, Murray told Anderson he ``was
going to go a little deeper'' with his performance and, indeed,
Murray's work has already been hailed by critics as some of the
best of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson takes some satisfaction in this, but not too much.
(He's nervous, remember.) He and Wilson are already deep into
writing their new movie, and Anderson believes their best work is
still to come. They still live together, sharing a home in Hancock
Park with Wilson's younger brother, Luke. Both Wilsons have become
sought-after actors. (Owen was in ``Armageddon'' is currently
filming Jan DeBont's ``The Haunting of Hill House''; Luke was most
recently seen in ``Home Fries.'') Both also date famous people.
(Owen, Sheryl Crow; Luke, his ``Home Fries'' co-star Drew
Barrymore.)
</P>
<P>
   There has been some talk of house hunting and the three of them
going their separate ways now that success has come. Owen will have
none of it _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wes has hinted at going to New York some more because that's
where his girlfriend is, but I don't think we're going to be giving
up the house any time soon,'' Wilson says. ``I'd almost hate to see
that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot busier than we used to be, so we don't see each
other as much,'' Anderson says somewhat wistfully. ``And there are
times when I think we're getting a little too old for this
`roommates' business. But then there are other times when I think
it's good because it keeps the group together for a little longer.
Eventually, things will change, but for now, they don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a real-life Max Fischer who doesn't want his own
version of the Rushmore experience to end.

   A fireplace, a room with a view and a world-class ski resort.
What better place for a couple to spend the Valentine's Day
weekend, or any winter weekend for that matter, than at a romantic
ski hotel?
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the best. All packages are double occupancy and
based on February rates.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Inn at Lost Creek (119 Lost Creek La., Telluride, Colo.
81435; 888-601-5678) is Telluride's newest luxury hotel. Located in
Mountain Village, the 32-room slopeside inn is made of native stone
and weathered timber. Fireplaces, overstuffed chairs, marble
bathrooms with steam showers and Jacuzzi, kitchenettes and mountain
views give each room a distinct character.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's two newly opened restaurants, ``9545'' and the more
casual ``10 Below,'' are part of Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant
Group, which includes such restaurants as New York's Nobu and
Tribeca Grill. Rates begin at $385 per night.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Lake Tahoe region, the Resort at Squaw Creek (400 Squaw
Creek Rd., Olympic Valley, Calif. 96146; 800-327-3353) is an
imposing glass building artfully tucked into the woods. Inside are
surprisingly warm rooms with a nouvelle Arts &AMP; Crafts feel. There
are views to die for and a private chairlift to access the
challenging slopes of Squaw Valley. Not to mention resort pro Franz
Weber, a world champion speed skier, to supervise guest skiing.
</P>
<P>
   The resort has a full-service spa, heated outdoor pool and
outdoor Jacuzzi for relaxation, as well as five restaurants. Rates
from $300.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sundance (RR, Box A1, Sundance, Utah 84604; 800-892-1600) is

Timpanogos, the highest peak in the Wasatch Range. Rooms boast pine
interiors, stone fireplaces and rustic furniture. There is rarely a
lift line at Sundance.
</P>
<P>
   After cavorting in the powder, enjoy lunch at Bearclaw Cabin on
top of the mountain, a structure built for the film ``Jeremiah
Johnson.'' There's fine dining at the Tree Room Restaurant,
decorated with native American artifacts and Redford's movie
memorabilia. Rates from $195.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Little Nell (675 E. Durant, Aspen, Colo. 81611;
888-843-6355) is perhaps the most quietly elegant ski hotel in the
country. It boasts custom furnishings, marble baths, Frette robes
and the most attentive service imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Located at the base of Aspen Mountain, it's just steps to the
gondola. And under new chef Keith Luce, The Little Nell's
restaurant is one of the shining stars of the West. Rates from
$475.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Trapp Family Lodge (42 Trapp Hill Rd., Stowe, Ver. 05672;
800-826-7000) is for cross-country mavens and those who love
rolling Vermont countryside. The 2,200-acre property has been owned
by the ``Sound of Music'' von Trapp family since 1942. Down

</P>
<P>
   There are 100 kilometers of cross-country trails, and alpine
skiing at Stowe is minutes away. Rates from $150.
</P>
<P>
   _ Skiers heading up to Sugarloaf USA in northern Maine might
want to check out The Herbert (PO Box 67, Kingfield, Maine 04947;
800-THE-HERB). This 32-room Beaux Arts hotel at the edge of the
wilderness is the type of place where a moose head shares the lobby
with a grand piano and fireplace. Antique-filled rooms and fine
dining are hallmarks of this unpretentious and comfortable hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Restored to the tune of $1 million, The Herbert is a classic and
affordable New England getaway for alpine and cross-country skiers.
Rates from $98.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lodge at Vail (174 E. Gore Creek Dr., Vail, Colo. 81657;

Vail's very first luxury hotel has recently been revamped, but it
has retained its European flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, it still serves what is possibly the most bountiful
and lavish buffet breakfast in all of ski country, the perfect
preparation for a day on the slopes. Rates from $440 include
breakfast for two.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Post Hotel (PO Box 69, Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, TOL
1E0, 800-661-1586) lies minutes from Lake Louise. This Relais &AMP;

</P>
<P>

Europe at prices that reflect the discounted Canadian dollar. Rates
from $220 Canadian (about $146 U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   _ The Ski Tip Lodge (764 Montezuma Rd., Keystone, Colo. 80435;
970-496- 4950) at Keystone Resort is an 1860's stagecoach stop
under the pines that became the first skiers' lodge in the state of
Colorado. Started by Max and Edna Dercum in 1946, there are still
ski tips used for door handles and steel pitons embedded in the
fireplace by an ambitious climber.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms are quirky and charming, the food quite possibly the
best in the area. Rates start at $160.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spring Creek (PO Box 4780, Jackson, Wyo. 83001; 800-443-6139)
is a rustic retreat with monumental views of the Tetons. Set midway
between the town of Jackson and the Jackson Hole Resort, the log
cabin-style rooms have woodburning fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   The Granary restaurant is where to fuel up before a day on the
steep slopes or dancing two-step at the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar.
Rates from $190.

Q&AMP;A WITH Q HIMSELF _ QUINCY JONES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An impresario in the broadest sense, Quincy Jones'
career has encompassed the roles of composer, record producer,
artist, film producer, arranger, conductor, TV producer, executive,
magazine founder and multimedia entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he's a pretty good cook, too. And, boy, can he throw a
party. He's planning a special one for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The mild-mannered Q, as he's known, is music's No. 1 renaissance
man. Now marking his 50th year in the entertainment industry,
Jones' influence begins with the sounds of the post-swing era and
continues through today's high-tech music delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'50s, Q was the first popular conductor-arranger to
record with an electric Fender bass. His theme for the hit TV
series ``Ironside'' was the first synthesizer-based pop song. As
the first African-American composer to be embraced by the Hollywood
establishment in the '60s, Q helped refresh movie music with
infusions of jazz and soul.
</P>
<P>
   His landmark 1989 disc ``Back on the Block'' _ named album of
the year at the 1990 Grammy Awards _ brought such jazz legends as
Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Miles Davis
together with rappers Ice T, Big Daddy Kane and Melle Mel to create
the first fusion of be-bop and hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonnie Raitt said when Q was honored with the recording
academy's MusiCare Award a few years ago: ``The guy spans every
kind of music. He's still got his authentic jazz chops, (and) he's
got a great reputation for helping people. I mean, anybody that can
work with Michael Jackson and, you know, live to tell about it has
got to have some stories.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Jackson referred to Q's warm demeanor in the
recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so fatherlike and so helpful, we built a camaraderie
that was like a father-son type of friendship,'' Jackson once said.
``He was always to the rescue and very loving. He has a very
fatherlike charm. That's the main thing that's unique to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As producer and conductor of the historic ``We Are the World''
recording (the largest-selling single of the modern era) and
Jackson's multiplatinum mega-albums ``Off the Wall,'' ``Thriller''
(the top-selling album of all time at 45 million copies) and
``Bad,'' Q stands as one of the most successful and admired
artist/executives in the entertainment world.
</P>
<P>
   He is the most-nominated artist in Grammy history, with 77 nods,
and second on the all-time winners list with 26 statuettes. That's
a Q rating, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who also owns 50 percent of Vibe magazine, got his start
in his native Seattle as trumpeter, arranger and sometime pianist
with the Lionel Hampton Orchestra in 1950 and worked as a music
director for Mercury Records in 1961, becoming vice president of
the label three years later.
</P>
<P>
   He has scored countless films and TV shows, including ``The
Pawnbroker'' in 1963 and ``Roots'' in 1977, and has worked as
arranger-producer for hundreds of successful singers and bands. He
was the line producer for ``The Color Purple,'' which won 11 Oscar
nominations, and he established his own Qwest label in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he helped launch the hit NBC-TV series ``The Fresh
Prince of Bel-Air,'' for which he acted as executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has been married three times, most recently to actress
Peggy Lipton (of TV's ``The Mod Squad'') from 1974-89. He has six
daughters and one son.
</P>
<P>
   He's currently working on the score for a Broadway musical based
on the life of Sammy Davis Jr. and is also the executive producer
of the TNT movie ``Passing Glory,'' which airs Feb. 24 and stars
Andre Braugher in the story of two schools _ one black and one
white _ in Louisiana during the '50s who play each other for the
state's first integrated basketball championship.
</P>
<P>
   We met with Q at his cozy Bel-Air home on the eve of Tuesday's
release of his new album, ``From Q, With Love'' (Qwest), a 26-song
double-CD set that contains tracks he produced for such superstars
as the late Frank Sinatra, Aretha Franklin, Jackson and Patti
Austin and James Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   As the music industry prepares for its biggest night out Feb. 24
at the Grammys, we asked Jones about his career and his view of the
turmoil in the industry in the wake of the recent Seagram-Polygram
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been in the music business for 50 years, and your guru
was the visionary late Time Warner chairman Steve Ross. What do you
think of the mega-mergers in the industry today, and did you expect
them?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: It's much bigger than that _ it's Exxon, AT&AMP;T and TCI.
It's a mindset for the millennium. I've never seen anything like it
in my life. Executives are just flying in and out of windows,
playing musical chairs. Ross taught me how to look at all this
stuff. It's almost like a domino effect. It started with (ex-Warner
Bros. Records head, now DreamWorks Records leader) Mo Ostin. If you
go back to the genesis of it, there wouldn't have been DreamWorks
without (late Disney president) Frank Wells. Once they derailed
that incredible record company they had at Warner/Reprise, all the
top people jumped ship. The thing about the entertainment business
is, it's just a handful of people that control it all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are events like Seagram's Polygram purchase healthy for music
in general?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: I haven't had time to make that kind of an analysis. I
like (Seagram chief executive officer) Edgar Bronfman Jr. a lot.
I've known him as a friend and a songwriter, and I know he loves
the music industry. But I don't know. It hasn't been done before.
He now controls a lot of companies over there _ Island, Motown,
Geffen, A&AMP;M, Universal _ it's a lot of stuff. I'm not in a position
to evaluate yet. Everything's changing so fast, it's amazing. I've
never seen anything like this before, and I don't think anyone else
has either. But I'm always optimistic _ criminally optimistic that
the good will always prevail. I hope there's some kind of balance
in the universe and a voice of reason that will put it all where
it's supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you think of electronic distribution of music over
the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: We're facing a serious transition into electronic
distribution, without a doubt. We can put our head in the sand all
we want, but things like MP3 will just shove it right in our face.
And it should change because our current system of music
distribution is so archaic. I've always felt the Avon approach has
been the best for records. When computers can document what your
taste is all about, and they come to your house every Saturday
knowing what you like, they'll own you. They'll get all your money.
They really will.
</P>
<P>
   I know as for me, I'll say, ``I don't know anything about it,
but I'll take some of that, some classical music, the Mysterious
Voices of Bulgaria, all of that.'' These are amazing times, and
every day you're almost afraid to pick up the trades to see what's
going on now. I don't know what it all means, but the changes are
certainly here. It's not just the music business, it's everything.
Insurance companies, car companies, airlines _ it's all over the
world. The players are real busy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about sampling?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: I think sampling is great, 'cause we get 36 samples from
different records a week. One of Tupac's biggest hits was based on
``Body Heat.'' The Fugees' hit ``Killing Me Softly With His Song''
is Roberta Flack's record from 1972 that I worked on. Sampling is
translating things to today's terms. If it works for whoever's
there, great. I'm from the old school, man, where we go in there
with the blank page and carve it from beginning to end. Getting
involved in sampling is much less difficult than trying to create
from scratch. But there are imaginative uses you can make of it. A
lot of pop artists like Warhol did it, too. It's the same thing. I
don't criticize anything because it's all valid expression and it's
all good.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever makes you feel good, whatever works. If the people like
it, great. If the creator is happy and the people are happy, who's
going to complain? ``I'll be Missing You'' was great for Sting and
great for Puff Daddy, too. Everybody's happy. That's win-win.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the copyrights you hold, what's your most frequently
sampled track?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: We must have 14 or 15 of the intro to ``Velas'' (which is
on the new album). Oh, and the Brothers Johnson stuff. I have one
song I wrote 39 years ago, ``Soul Bossa Nova,'' which I wrote in 20
minutes for an album called ``Big Band Bossa Nova.'' In the past
five years, we had a worldwide smash with the Dream Warriors using
the same track but rapping right over it. Nike just bought it. It's
used at the beginning of ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,''
produced by the Dust Brothers. That's unbelievable. It's great to
be alive in this time when we're going to take the leap into those
three zeros (2000) and make that step across.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you go about choosing the tunes on the new
retrospective?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: It was very difficult, because we're talking about going
all the way back to 1966, and I'm telling you, there's been a lot
of records made since then. At first, this was kind of a personal
thing where I was trying to create a mood without any up-tempo
tunes to interrupt it. It was something I put together for a
birthday party we held here for Oprah Winfrey. I made this
collection of 34 songs as a very warm personal present for her and
her guests _ 40 people, including Steven Spielberg. And everyone
kept saying they needed 10 more copies.
</P>
<P>
   I've always worked on the basis that if it moves me, it's got to
move somebody else. I had to make the choice of paring it down and
making it balanced so it's not six tracks from one person. More and
more, there was the pressure to put it out, and we decided we
needed some new songs to include. And we got real lucky with new
tracks from Diane Warren and David Foster _ all these great songs.
Plus, there's this 24-year-old kid named Catero that my daughter
Kidada found, and I put him right between Ingram and Austin's ``How
Do You Keep the Music Playing'' and Michael's ``Human Nature.'' And
he held it. The album is dedicated to my brother, who left us July
13, and Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you look for in a song?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: Something that gives me goosebumps. That's it. I know
it's there whenever the goosebumps come up. Anytime I've been
touched by music and really love something, that's what happens. I
could listen to the lyrics and melody and vocal interpretation of
``How Do You Keep the Music Playing'' forever. Everything's in the
right place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has this made you want to look back and perhaps compile some
of the jazz sides you've done?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: Absolutely. It's time to do that now. I'd like to do an
album like this with all the singers I've worked with. I made a
list the other day for a book I'm working on, and it's ridiculous.
From Tony Bennett to Andy Williams to Ray Charles to Aretha to Paul
Simon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Regarding the millennium, I know you're planning something
special for New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   JONES: Spielberg, George Stevens and I will be producing the
millennium party for the White House. We've had four meetings
already, and it's going to be huge, probably the biggest party
ever. I did the inauguration, too, but this is different. This is
big.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the guest list look like?
</P>
<P>
   JONES: I don't even want to think about it. &UR;

FANS MAKE THE DIFFERENCE WITH `SENTINEL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Michigan)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Sentinel'' is a nice little show, a very nice little show
by UPN standards. But a better story than the plotlines in this
unique cop drama is how it got back on the air for its fourth
season.
</P>
<P>
   The show was dead after three years. Technically, UPN didn't
cancel it: It was ``bumped'' from the schedule until mid-season.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't make a difference: canceled, bumped, shoved it wasn't
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sentinel'' is the story of a Cascade, Wash., cop who had
survived a crash in Peru as a member of Special Forces and walks
away with magnified sensory powers. Paired with Lt. Det. Jim
Ellison (Richard Burgi) is Blair Sandberg (Garret Maggart), an
anthropology graduate student who is aware of the Peruvian
``Sentinel'' myth behind these powers and is studying the detective
as a full-time observer.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cop series, a buddy series, with a heavy accent on the
mystical and special effects. But there is something else you
should know about ``The Sentinel.''
</P>
<P>
   It has fans. Not a lot, but they are rabid. Throughout this
country. In Germany. In Italy and Australia. And they're tenacious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very vociferous fan base,'' said Burgi, the former
soap star (``Days of Our Lives,'' ``Another World,'' ``One Life to
Live''). ``Their ferocity is something to be reckoned with. The
people behind it are zealously passionate.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is back, for now. ``The Sentinel'' (Mondays at 9 p.m.
EDT, check local listings) is not a ratings winner. For one, it is
on UPN. Secondly, it is normally up against ``Ally McBeal'' (Fox)
and ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' (CBS). For the week of Jan. 25 it
finished 111th out of 132 shows.
</P>
<P>
   But it finished fifth out of 12 UPN offerings, which made its
absence from the fall schedule upsetting to the cast and producers
and excruciating to its small band of hard-core fans.
</P>
<P>
   Daria Littlejohn, a 50-year-old illustrator from Dearborn
Heights, Mich., is one of them. She was of the group that took an
ad out for the show in USA Today at a cost, she said, of $9,000;
previous fan-paid ads have also run. Littlejohn was also with SOS
(Save Our ``Sentinel''), which was among those who demonstrated in
January at the Television Critics Association gathering in
Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were over 250 of us there,'' Littlejohn said. ``There
would have been more, but a lot of people spent money in October
for a `Sentinel' convention in Vancouver,'' the British Columbia
city where the show is shot.
</P>
<P>
   Burgi shook every hand of the fans, who were overwhelmingly
female. ``I like going into the fray,'' the actor said. ``I enjoy
meeting the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask Littlejohn, nicely, why this show? Why such devotion?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really felt before like this for a show. I guess
having met the people makes it even more special,'' Littlejohn
said. ``Each show in itself is like a minimovie. The special
effects, the storyline .. there is quality.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a relatively new battleground. There have been other
fan-based movements like this before. ``Dr. Quinn: Medicine
Woman.'' ``My So-Called Life.'' ``I'll Fly Away.'' All quality
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sentinel?'' Again, a solid show, but not in the realm of
those above. The difference today is pockets of fans across the
country are now bonded by a second technological tool: the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really surprised me,'' said Maggart, 29, the son of actor
Brandon Maggart (``Chicken Soup,'' ``Jennifer Slept Here'') and
half-brother of rocker Fiona Apple. ``Not being too computer
literate, the effect the Internet has, specifically in this
situation, is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   And loud. The Internet Web sites, e-mails and chat rooms amplify
those frustrations throughout the general public. There is still
bitterness between the network and fans and UPN and the show
itself. ``I took it personally,'' Burgi said. ``I don't think I
have the same sense of blind trust or faith with the network. I
wasn't dealing with people who were clear-thinking or compassionate
with their employees.''
</P>
<P>
   UPN spokesman Paul McGuire said the show was bumped for ``Seven
Days.'' He said while plans were in place to bring it back, the fan
revolt played a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are fanatics. ... It is definitely on the radar of the
people involved,'' he said. ``It reminds you of the power of the
people watching the show. It is a phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   And a welcome one at that. Fans of ``Cupid'' and other quality
shows departed or on the rocks, are you paying attention? Guess
what: You can have a voice.

<P>
   ``When my time comes,'' King Hussein said, ``I hope it will be
like my grandfather's _ and like Yitzhak Rabin's.
</P>
<P>
   It was November 1995 at the funeral of my husband, Yitzhak, and
this was the first time since the death of his grandfather that
King Hussein had set foot in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   His bold comment reflected the personal history of the family of
the king. In July 1951, when he was just 16, King Hussein saw his
grandfather, King Abdullah, gunned down at the Al-Aqsa mosque in
Jerusalem by an Arab assassin who feared the king was trying to
make peace between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For my husband's funeral, 87 heads of state had landed at
Ben-Gurion Airport. President Bill Clinton and former Presidents
George Bush and Jimmy Carter also attended the funeral. Most of the
leaders wore yarmulkes, but King Hussein wore a traditional
Jordanian red-checkered kaffiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   So moving were the king's words: ``My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin,
my friends, I had never thought the moment would come like this
when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend
_ a man, a soldier whom we respected as he respected us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lived as a soldier,'' His Highness continued, ``you died
as a soldier of peace, and I believe it is time for all of us to
come out, openly, and to speak our piece, here today and for all
the times to come ... Let's hope and pray that God will give us all
guidance, each in his respective position, to do what he can for
the better future that Yitzhak Rabin sought with determination and
courage ...
</P>
<P>
   After the burial service, everyone filed past us. I shook hands,
I kissed them as they came to console us, sharing our unspeakable
pain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 1994, a very hot and humid day, King Hussein,
President Clinton and Yitzhak had signed, on the White House lawn,
a declaration that ended an official state of war between Israel
and Jordan. Just before the signing ceremony, I met King Hussein
and his wife, Queen Noor al-Hussein, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing beside Vice President Gore's wife, Tipper, when
the queen and I were introduced. The Princeton-educated queen, the
daughter of an American airline executive, struck me as both
articulate and surprisingly down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   (I was even more impressed when Yitzhak and I were guests of the
king and queen of Jordan, and Queen Noor personally served us at
the table as a special gesture of respect.)
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the agreement with Jordan meant that soon Jews from
all over could at long last visit Petra _ the dream of many young
people who literally risked being killed just for a glimpse of the
spectacular red rock formations.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't wait to see it. ``Your Majesty, are you aware how
much Israelis always wanted to visit Petra?'' I remember saying to
Queen Noor at this first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, do you know how worried we are already?'' she replied.
She was making reference to the Israeli reputation for ``storming''
tourist sites. Months later, before the opening of an important
bridge between our countries, Queen Noor sent me the most beautiful
gold pin with a relief of the red rock of Petra.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein and Yitzhak addressed the U.S. Congress on July 26.
In his speech Yitzhak noted, ``Only a 70-minute journey separates
these cities, Jerusalem and Amman _ and 46 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Yitzhak was invited to meet King Hussein alone
at his hotel. Shortly before the meeting, an unexpected message was
delivered: Would Mrs. Rabin please join us? Of course I came along,
figuring that Yitzhak and the king would talk while the queen and I
would spend time together, but I was surprised when His Majesty
asked me to join the three of them. They were to discuss the
financial implications of the Israeli-Jordanian treaty. I quickly
realized that the queen was totally aware of the issues, and I was
pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   We spent an amiable hour together. The Friday night after we'd
returned from our trip, we were sitting in the living room of our
Tel Aviv apartment when the phone rang. It was the king calling
from his airplane, en route from Washington to London, thanking
Yitzhak for his insight and his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion in 1970, at a holiday reception, I had
encountered Andrew Mossbacher, chief of protocol in the U.S.
Department of State. We were at the home of a Nebraska congressman,
and Mossbacher told me he was invited that night to a dinner in
honor of King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, in September 1970 _ ``Black September'' _
the Jordanian army had clashed with PLO guerillas in Jordan. Many
PLO leaders _ but not Yassir Arafat _ were advocating the overthrow
of King Hussein and the establishment of a Palestinian state inside
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein decided to strike back decisively. Meanwhile Syria
threatened to send tanks into Jordan, and the United States was
concerned that the king's government would fall. The United States
wanted to rally support for King Hussein. Israel was the conduit to
send a preemptive warning to Syria to keep their tanks out of
Jordan, but eventually Jordan did all this by itself.
</P>
<P>
   I told Mossbacher, ``Please tell King Hussein that you and I met
at a cocktail party and I asked you to give him my regards, and to
say that we Israelis very much admire his courage and determination
in his struggle with the PLO.'' Perhaps it wouldn't do any good,
but it certainly could do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Very early the next morning, Mossbacher phoned to say, in his
deep voice, ``Mrs. Rabin, we all have our problems. Perhaps King
Hussein has more than we do. You made the man happy last night. He
was so excited that, when I escorted him to his car, he repeated,
`Please don't forget to give the Rabins my heartfelt thanks and
best wishes.'''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Israeli Day of Independence in May 1995,
Israeli television presented a dialogue between King Hussein and
Yitzhak in Aqaba. Before the interview, we at last visited Petra.
We were a large group, including our children, and Petra was even
more magnificent than I expected.
</P>
<P>
   One walks down the narrow path between sheer red rock faces. The
limestone cliffs surrounding you almost obscure the sky, their
fantastic shapes rich in pinks, reds and grays. At the end of the
path is a clearing with a marvelous temple carved out of the pink
limestone.
</P>
<P>
   But the real excitement was to be found in what God, not man,
made. Yitzhak enjoyed the monumental scenery of Petra, but he may
have savored more the implication of Israelis now being able to see
Petra freely for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, 1995, Yitzhak appeared on Larry King's television
show on CNN, along with President Clinton, King Hussein, Shimon
Peres and Yassir Arafat. The interview reflected the rapport these
men now shared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was to be a dreadful day. But as Yitzhak walked off the
speaker's platform at the rally of Nov. 4, 1995, he heard the love
and blessings of hundreds of thousands of voices, young and old,
too long silent, now ringing out as one, urging him forward in the
name of peace. Descending the stairs to his waiting car, I am sure
his thoughts, as always, turned to the hard work of the days ahead
_ to Syria and beyond. But a nobody with a 9mm Beretta and a mind
littered with hate interrupted the song of his life _ and my world,
our world, was never to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the months following Yitzhak's death, the nation paid tribute
by naming many structures and facilities in his memory. On Jan. 6,
the trauma unit of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital was renamed the
Rabin Trauma Unit. King Hussein attended; it was his first visit to
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed my thanks to the whole trauma unit team, who had
been by Yitzhak's side that fateful night of Nov. 4 from the first
moment he was brought there to the very last, when they realized
they could do no more. The shock had been enormous _ to have the
prime minister brought in in critical condition, trying everything
possible to save him, and then having to make the decision to take
him off life support and declare him dead.
</P>
<P>
   I should have thanked them that night in November for their
efforts, but I was dazed _ I just was not thinking at all. Finally,
in a clearer moment, I expressed my gratitude for King Hussein's
presence by quoting scripture: ``Blessed be he by coming and by
leaving us on his way home.''

<P>
   ``When my time comes,'' King Hussein said, ``I hope it will be
like my grandfather's _ and like Yitzhak Rabin's.
</P>
<P>
   It was November 1995 at the funeral of my husband, Yitzhak, and
this was the first time since the death of his grandfather that
King Hussein had set foot in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   His bold comment reflected the personal history of the family of
the king. In July 1951, when he was just 16, King Hussein saw his
grandfather, King Abdullah, gunned down at the Al-Aqsa mosque in
Jerusalem by an Arab assassin who feared the king was trying to
make peace between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   For my husband's funeral, 87 heads of state had landed at
Ben-Gurion Airport. President Bill Clinton and former Presidents
George Bush and Jimmy Carter also attended the funeral. Most of the
leaders wore yarmulkes, but King Hussein wore a traditional
Jordanian red-checkered kaffiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   So moving were the king's words: ``My sister, Mrs. Leah Rabin,
my friends, I had never thought the moment would come like this
when I would grieve the loss of a brother, a colleague and a friend
_ a man, a soldier whom we respected as he respected us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lived as a soldier,'' His Highness continued, ``you died
as a soldier of peace, and I believe it is time for all of us to
come out, openly, and to speak our piece, here today and for all
the times to come ... Let's hope and pray that God will give us all
guidance, each in his respective position, to do what he can for
the better future that Yitzhak Rabin sought with determination and
courage ...
</P>
<P>
   After the burial service, everyone filed past us. I shook hands,
I kissed them as they came to console us, sharing our unspeakable
pain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 1994, a very hot and humid day, King Hussein,
President Clinton and Yitzhak had signed, on the White House lawn,
a declaration that ended an official state of war between Israel
and Jordan. Just before the signing ceremony, I met King Hussein
and his wife, Queen Noor al-Hussein, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing beside Vice President Gore's wife, Tipper, when
the queen and I were introduced. The Princeton-educated queen, the
daughter of an American airline executive, struck me as both
articulate and surprisingly down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   (I was even more impressed when Yitzhak and I were guests of the
king and queen of Jordan, and Queen Noor personally served us at
the table as a special gesture of respect.)
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the agreement with Jordan meant that soon Jews from
all over could at long last visit Petra _ the dream of many young
people who literally risked being killed just for a glimpse of the
spectacular red rock formations.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't wait to see it. ``Your Majesty, are you aware how
much Israelis always wanted to visit Petra?'' I remember saying to
Queen Noor at this first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, do you know how worried we are already?'' she replied.
She was making reference to the Israeli reputation for ``storming''
tourist sites. Months later, before the opening of an important
bridge between our countries, Queen Noor sent me the most beautiful
gold pin with a relief of the red rock of Petra.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein and Yitzhak addressed the U.S. Congress on July 26.
In his speech Yitzhak noted, ``Only a 70-minute journey separates
these cities, Jerusalem and Amman _ and 46 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Yitzhak was invited to meet King Hussein alone
at his hotel. Shortly before the meeting, an unexpected message was
delivered: Would Mrs. Rabin please join us? Of course I came along,
figuring that Yitzhak and the king would talk while the queen and I
would spend time together, but I was surprised when His Majesty
asked me to join the three of them. They were to discuss the
financial implications of the Israeli-Jordanian treaty. I quickly
realized that the queen was totally aware of the issues, and I was
pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   We spent an amiable hour together. The Friday night after we'd
returned from our trip, we were sitting in the living room of our
Tel Aviv apartment when the phone rang. It was the king calling
from his airplane, en route from Washington to London, thanking
Yitzhak for his insight and his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion in 1970, at a holiday reception, I had
encountered Andrew Mossbacher, chief of protocol in the U.S.
Department of State. We were at the home of a Nebraska congressman,
and Mossbacher told me he was invited that night to a dinner in
honor of King Hussein of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, in September 1970 _ ``Black September'' _
the Jordanian army had clashed with PLO guerillas in Jordan. Many
PLO leaders _ but not Yassir Arafat _ were advocating the overthrow
of King Hussein and the establishment of a Palestinian state inside
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein decided to strike back decisively. Meanwhile Syria
threatened to send tanks into Jordan, and the United States was
concerned that the king's government would fall. The United States
wanted to rally support for King Hussein. Israel was the conduit to
send a preemptive warning to Syria to keep their tanks out of
Jordan, but eventually Jordan did all this by itself.
</P>
<P>
   I told Mossbacher, ``Please tell King Hussein that you and I met
at a cocktail party and I asked you to give him my regards, and to
say that we Israelis very much admire his courage and determination
in his struggle with the PLO.'' Perhaps it wouldn't do any good,
but it certainly could do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Very early the next morning, Mossbacher phoned to say, in his
deep voice, ``Mrs. Rabin, we all have our problems. Perhaps King
Hussein has more than we do. You made the man happy last night. He
was so excited that, when I escorted him to his car, he repeated,
`Please don't forget to give the Rabins my heartfelt thanks and
best wishes.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the Israeli Day of Independence in May 1995,
Israeli television presented a dialogue between King Hussein and
Yitzhak in Aqaba. Before the interview, we at last visited Petra.
We were a large group, including our children, and Petra was even
more magnificent than I expected.
</P>
<P>
   One walks down the narrow path between sheer red rock faces. The
limestone cliffs surrounding you almost obscure the sky, their
fantastic shapes rich in pinks, reds and grays. At the end of the
path is a clearing with a marvelous temple carved out of the pink
limestone.
</P>
<P>
   But the real excitement was to be found in what God, not man,
made. Yitzhak enjoyed the monumental scenery of Petra, but he may
have savored more the implication of Israelis now being able to see
Petra freely for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, 1995, Yitzhak appeared on Larry King's television
show on CNN, along with President Clinton, King Hussein, Shimon
Peres and Yassir Arafat. The interview reflected the rapport these
men now shared.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was to be a dreadful day. But as Yitzhak walked off the
speaker's platform at the rally of Nov. 4, 1995, he heard the love
and blessings of hundreds of thousands of voices, young and old,
too long silent, now ringing out as one, urging him forward in the
name of peace. Descending the stairs to his waiting car, I am sure
his thoughts, as always, turned to the hard work of the days ahead
_ to Syria and beyond. But a nobody with a 9mm Beretta and a mind
littered with hate interrupted the song of his life _ and my world,
our world, was never to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the months following Yitzhak's death, the nation paid tribute
by naming many structures and facilities in his memory. On Jan. 6,
the trauma unit of Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital was renamed the
Rabin Trauma Unit. King Hussein attended; it was his first visit to
Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   I expressed my thanks to the whole trauma unit team, who had
been by Yitzhak's side that fateful night of Nov. 4 from the first
moment he was brought there to the very last, when they realized
they could do no more. The shock had been enormous _ to have the
prime minister brought in in critical condition, trying everything
possible to save him, and then having to make the decision to take
him off life support and declare him dead.
</P>
<P>
   I should have thanked them that night in November for their
efforts, but I was dazed _ I just was not thinking at all. Finally,
in a clearer moment, I expressed my gratitude for King Hussein's
presence by quoting scripture: ``Blessed be he by coming and by
leaving us on his way home.''

</P>
<P>
   Going to Europe? Consider paying for the trip with the euro, the
new coin of the realm in 11 European countries. Simplicity is the
most compelling reason to do so, as the euro eliminates the
arithmetical gymnastics needed to figure out the true cost of a
360,000 lire jacket in Rome, a 200 franc bottle of burgundy in
Paris or 35 Irish punts at a Dublin bed and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Like the dollar, the euro is made up of 100 cents. It is
currently trading at about $1.15 US. How much easier to estimate
that the jacket will run about 248 euros, that burgundy 40 euros
and that night in Dublin 57 euros. Just one currency to plan a
budget on, instead of 11.
</P>
<P>
   The euro debuted on Jan. 1, 1999, when 11 European countries
began the three-year transition of merging their individual
currencies into one. Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain are
the financial brothers-in-arms, while laggards Britain, Denmark,
Sweden and Greece have yet to join.
</P>
<P>
   During this initial stage, in which the euro will coexist
alongside national currencies, the euro is a ``virtual'' currency,
used for non-cash transactions, which include credit cards, checks,
travelers' checks and direct debits.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of exchange between the euro and the national currency
of a given country is fixed, so there's no fluctuation. There will,
however, be fluctuations between the euro and currencies in
nonparticipating countries, such as Switzerland and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The actual notes and coins won't appear until Jan. 1, 2002.
There will be seven notes, in denominations of five to 500 euro, as
well as eight coins. Seven months after issuance, on July 1, 2002,
national currencies from those 11 countries will no longer be
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Double price lists, of national currency and euros, are starting
to become commonplace at European airline offices and railway
terminals, as well as in hotels, restaurants and shops. While
European merchants are not required to accept euros until Jan. 1,
2002, many are already doing so and many more will follow suit.
There's economic pressure to do so, as increasing numbers of
travelers become accustomed to the idea of spending euros rather
than lire, pesetas or francs and patronize shops accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, travelers are not obliged to pay for anything in
euros. But they may want to. For Americans traveling to Europe this
spring, the most immediate benefit of the euro is simplification.
</P>
<P>
   With the euro, travelers can compare prices and values quickly
in the 11 participating countries. Since the cost of identical
goods in Europe can vary sharply between countries, with a single
currency you can easily compare what a Diet Coke, a compact rental
car or a modest inn will cost in the Netherlands, Belgium and
France. This ``price transparency'' will be evident on purchases
big and small and will likely result in an increase in competition,
both within the 11 countries and in neighboring countries looking
for their share of business.
</P>
<P>
   With financially strong countries like Germany and weaker ones
like Portugal as European Monetary Union members, prices may
decrease slightly in the former and increase in the latter. But
it's unrealistic to expect that a deluxe Berlin hotel will be as
modestly priced as Lisbon's finest, any more than one would expect
a Manhattan property to lower its rates to stay in line with a
hotel in, say, Omaha. But as the prices of goods fluctuate, the
cost of a European vacation may well change in the next couple of
years.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Handwerk, director of public affairs for American
Express, suggests that ``tour packages may actually decrease in
price,'' as a result of greater competition among suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Since there's no euro cash yet, credit cards will be the most
convenient way to complete a transaction in euros. With the advent
of euro notes and coins in the 11 countries, travelers will realize
an immediate savings in currency transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers ``can lose up to 5 percent'' of their capital by
trading dollars into francs and then pesetas, according to Deanna
Hermanson, the project manager for the single European currency at
Visa International. The company advocates charging purchases in
euros on multi-country visits to eliminate such losses.
</P>
<P>
   Euro-denominated travelers' checks are now in use and can be
prepurchased in the United States and used to pay for travel
services in 11 European countries. But travelers should note that
if they pay for a 75-euro meal in Frankfurt with a 100-euro
travelers' check right now, they'll get their 25 euros worth of
change in German marks.
</P>
<P>
   For American travelers, there may well be a downside to the
euro, whose ``raison d'etre'' is European economic stabilization.
That stability will likely mean a less volatile currency, less
fluctuation and fewer opportunities to take advantage of market
downturns.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hermanson of Visa International points out, ``Even though
Mediterranean countries are still less expensive than northern
countries, I think the destinations themselves will still draw the
traveler.''

HUNGARIAN MOTORISTS PAY TO REPEL BULLETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ The new rich of recently capitalist Hungary, sniffing
at the crummy East German Trabants and inexpensive Korean cars that
once dominated the roadways, are eyeing a sleek, luxurious upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The $200,000 BMW introduced last month has a TV, a front-seat
computer panel, a heated steering wheel, and windshield wipers that
sense how fast the rain is falling and adjust their speed
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   But its most attractive feature to present-day Budapest
residents is this: the entire car is bulletproof, right down to the
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the wheel is hit by a bullet, it can go another 60
kilometers (about 40 miles),'' said Mihaly Vida, marketing director
of Ormester, the Hungarian security company selling the BMW 540iA
``Protection.''
</P>
<P>
   The car is a product of two developments of still-emerging
Hungary: a new, small class of wealthy businesspeople, and a
burgeoning criminal element, often mob-related.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are vying for economic domination of the country, and
the competition can be fatal. Nervous drivers need only examine the
case of Janos Fenyo, a newspaper publisher killed last year. Fenyo
was in his car, on centrally located Margit Bridge, at afternoon
rush hour when he was shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   Although the case is unsolved, the Hungarian press has widely
speculated that there was some mob connection. Others have been
blown up in their cars, or shot in their cars in incidents police
suspect are caused by organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The car's level of bulletproofing will stop fire from .44
magnums, Uzis, Scorpion assault rifles, and certain
remotely-detonated bombs.
</P>
<P>
   A higher-protection version, not yet available in Hungary, can
stop assault from an M16, a Kalashnikov, and an AK-47. More
important, Vida said, is that the 540iA is fast, with a top speed
of 185 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a decade makes. During communist rule, few
people in Hungary had cars. Back in the 1970s, residents recall,
buyers had to wait several years to get a car, and then had the
choice of only about a dozen models.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Budapest, pre-1989, were jammed with Trabants _
cheap, small, and made in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As the macro-economy grew in Central Europe after the changes,
the vehicles reflected it. There's been an influx of cars made by
the South Korean company Daewoo, whose lower-priced vehicles are
ideal for what economists call Hungary's ``cost-sensitive'' market.
</P>
<P>
   American and Western European makers have also made big
investments in Hungary, both in marketing the cars and making
parts. Car sales soared last year, as dealers peddled 130,000 cars
and utility vans _ 25 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Renaults, Mercedes-Benzes, and Porsches, a few even
with vanity plates, have shown up on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarians have developed an American obsession with cars. There
is an American Car Club of Hungary, which holds two shows yearly.
The Hungarian Formula One Grand Prix is one of the biggest social
outings of the year, drawing 220,000 people last year to the auto
race.
</P>
<P>
   Those who can afford it buy the fanciest cars to flaunt their
wealth. German-made cars are especially popular, said Zoltan
Scrivner, a local professional driver, car reviewer, and proud
owner of an old Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants a BMW or a Mercedes,'' Scrivner said. ``It's
the thing. It's a sign of success, that they've made it.''
</P>
<P>
   But is it worth the hidden costs? Aside from the expense of the
car itself (including customs fees and the 25 percent sales tax),
theft and vandalism are constant threats.
</P>
<P>
   Parking is a big problem. Most drivers park on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 cars were stolen last year in Hungary. And some
people fall victim to car-theft scams, Scrivner said. For example,
if a radio station reports a stolen car, and broadcasts the
telephone number of the victim in case anyone has seen the car, the
owner might get an unwanted response _ a caller demanding ransom
for the return of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Second-hand cars are dicey options too, Scrivner said, because
the previous owner might simply keep a copy of the key, then have
the car stolen back. Shady garages might do the same, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty miserable, really, owning an expensive car,'' said
Scrivner.

A HOUSE MANAGER'S ILLUSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- You gotta love House Manager Asa Hutchinson. He
should be called The Doctor _ because of the way he operates, in
this case on the facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Doctor gets caught manufacturing a tale about Dec. 11, 1997,
as the starting date of President Clinton's alleged conspiracy to
obstruct justice, a plot he thinks is so vile that it justifies the
first impeachment conviction in our history.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't stop the man from Arkansas. In the same trial,
Hutchinson switches gears and makes up another story, claiming that
the plot started on Dec. 5, or maybe Dec. 6. This time his made-up
plot is of such alleged urgency that nothing happens to carry it
out for 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's chutzpah is for the ages. He gets caught during the
trial defaming as conspirators Vernon Jordon and Betty Currie, who
are then shown to have never conspired. And by perhaps the final
weekend of this farce, Hutchinson had invented an entirely new
theory _ that the testimony of the key players _ Jordan, Currie,
Monica Lewinsky, and officials of the company that hired her, all
of which is exculpatory _ is ``irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see,'' said The Doctor, ``that the president may have
been the only individual who had the complete picture.'' In other
words a trial based (from Ken Starr referral through House
Judiciary Committee re-write through trial brief and initial Senate
presentation) on a conspiracy to obstruct justice was transformed
into a one-man show, based entirely on inferences about the
president's intent by House managers that have been rejected by the
only witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction was ``triggered,'' Hutchinson said, on Dec. 5,
when the witness wish list by Paula Jones's civil lawsuit lawyers
came out; or maybe it was Dec. 6, when the list was actually faxed
to the president's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Hutchinson creating the illusion of activity in his
questioning of Jordan: ``And so there's two conversations after the
witness list came out _ one that you had with the president on Dec.
7, and then a subsequent conversation with him after you met with
Ms. Lewinsky on the 11th.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two problems: first, it has always been an accepted fact on
all sides that Jordan and Clinton never talked about any aspect of
Lewinsky life on Dec. 7; and second, the phrase ``after you met . .
.'' is a pathetic way of saying Dec. 19. The Doctor is creating the
illusion of activity between Dec. 5 and Dec. 19 involving the two
friends to cover the inconvenient fact that no such activity
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson faced a different problem with another critical
element of his alleged obstruction _ the famous Lewinsky affidavit
in the Jones case. Thanks to House manager Ed Bryant's questioning
last week, Lewinsky was able to obliterate the allegation that
Clinton and she talked content in their middle-of-the-night
conversation of Dec. 17, 1997. Her testimony is that they never
discussed content and that as a human being her own interest in
avoiding a Jones case deposition was real.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, The Doctor invented affidavit-altering activity between
the two on Jan. 5 or Jan. 6, referring to a phone call supposedly
discussing content related to a particular paragaph in the
then-draft document involving the White House legislative affairs
office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attorney Nicole Seligman could barely contain herself as
she replied with documented facts _ no such conversation on those
dates, or ever, on any page of the case's voluminous record, and no
such paragraph in the affidavit. Hutchinson made it up to create
another element of alleged obstruction, despite the fact that the
affidavit charge in the impeachment article is based solely on the
now-exculpatory evidence about Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing tops the con job about the gifts. Beginning with the
Starr referral, Lewinsky's memory of their Dec. 28, 1997, chat is
always misreported so that Clinton says ``I don't know'' or ``Let
me think about it,'' when she suggessts returning gifts on the same
day the president gave her more. In fact, as a typical backup
summary of her sworn statements to the feds makes clear and she
confirmed in her latest deposition, ``He either did not respond or
responded I don't know. Lewinsky is not sure exactly what was said,
but she is certain that whatever Clinton said she did not have a
clear image in her mind of what to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse. In her deposition, Lewinsky says she was
questioned after Clinton's grand jury testimony by an FBI agent,
who ran various quotes of his by her, including ``You have to turn
over whatever you have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that sounds a little bit familiar to me,'' Lewinsky
says she told the agent, thus corroborating an exculpatory
statement the managers have charged Clinton never made. Starr,
however, never provided this information in his referral, leading
Seligman to say, ``We can only wonder in troubled disbelief how
much more we still don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction article of impeachment was always headed for
rejection on any of three bases: the president is innocent; he is
not guilty; the offense is not impeachable. Now there's a fourth:
flagrant prosecutorial misconduct in a case that should never have
been brought.

NOTE OF DISCORD OVER PLANNED MUSIC HAVEN IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ It began with great announcements, grand visions,
and a dose of Hollywood hoopla. Television showman Dick Clark spoke
lyrically about preserving the legacy of US music. Paul Cellucci
got so excited he broke into song. State taxpayers wrote a check.
</P>
<P>
   With musical icons like Johnny Cash, Reba McEntire, and Travis
Tritt on its board of directors, the National Music Foundation set
up shop on the site of a former boys' school here six years ago,
promising a $35 million campus of rich instruction, alluring
exhibits, and _ most poignantly _ a cozy retirement home for
lifelong musicians who never quite struck it rich.
</P>
<P>
   But now that soaring prelude has given way to a downbeat chorus
of discord.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising efforts have foundered. Local supporters have grown
skeptical and irritated. The police chief has launched an
investigation into the foundation's finances. Last week, the state
auditor promised a review.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers here and elsewhere around the country are
wondering if the dream of a home for elderly musicians, in a town
indelibly linked to music, will ever be a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know if these people are real,'' said Lenox Town
Manager Joseph A. Kellogg. ``Are they really moving toward what
they say they're doing? If you look at their financial statements
for the past few years, it looks like all the money they're
spending is public dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, foundation president Gloria Pennington, who has led the
not-for-profit organization since it moved from Florida, indicated
that it has essentially been treading water for six years. The
foundation has used its revenues to pay for staff salaries,
overhead, and modest improvements on 63 acres of prime real estate
near the center of town _ a tony tourism mecca synonymous with
symphonic music and breathtaking vistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just starting,'' said Pennington, who vigorously denies
any suggestion of financial impropriety. ``I expected it to be
further along.'' The finish line, she acknowledged, is still $35
million away.
</P>
<P>
   The center's reliance on state start-up funding, its difficulty
raising money among the millionaires of an industry whose members
would benefit from the foundation's program, and its uneasy
alliance with some members of the local community have fanned
flames of suspicion that flared dramatically last month when Lenox
Police Chief David W. Berkel checked out an anonymous tip.
</P>
<P>
   What Berkel found were questions about the financial
underpinnings of a foundation benefactor whose $1 million pledge to
the group was used to help secure $2.5 million in matching grants
authorized by the state in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Clark, who is chairman of the foundation's board,
Florida developer Conrad Wagner said he would contribute $200,000 a
year for five years. Clark has made good on his pledge, but Wagner
has delivered only $25,000 of the money he promised to supply last
year. Foundation officials said Wagner has promised to pay the
remainder by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his Florida office, Wagner said he intends to honor
his commitment. ``I'm the one writing the checks,'' he said. ``I
don't understand what the police chief has to do with this. He's
not an auditor. Any allegations anybody has with me are absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berkel, citing published reports of Wagner's financial
distress in Florida, said: ``I don't think Mr. Wagner is solvent
and will be able to back up his commitments. I think he has a lot
of problems in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wagner's commitment was, in part, what prompted the state to
pony up the $2.5 million, Berkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Berkel handed over the findings of his investigation
to the state inspector general's office. A spokesman for State
Auditor A. Joseph DeNucci said that agency will launch its own
probe into the foundation's books. ``We will be reviewing it,''
Glenn Briere said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell L. Richards, the state's assistant secretary for capital
resources, defended the state's grant to the music foundation,
saying the funds must be used to repair, replace, and improve
physical facilities there. As for Wagner's ability to come through
with the cash that the state insisted on, Richards said: ``We took
it on face value that this organization would be in a position to
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions about a benefactor's business reversals in Florida,
lackluster fund-raising in Lenox, and investigations from Boston to
the Berkshires could not be more distant from the founding vision
of the National Music Foundation as expressed by Joey Dee, the
writer and singer of the 1961 pop chart smash, ``Peppermint
Twist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee had watched his friend, the great soul singer Jackie Wilson,
slip away into a coma and then die destitute. He resolved with some
friends to try to do something to make sure that other impoverished
musicians do not suffer the same fate.
</P>
<P>
   That dream still lives, Pennington said, during an interview in
her office in what used to be the library of the Lenox School for
Boys, on an estate that in another incarnation was a controversial
Bible school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a real shame if all the work and talent that went
into this place is brought down by innuendo and untruth,'' she
said. ``This is a perfect fit for this area. We intend to make this
the pride of the Berkshires.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennington has the unstinting support of her board of directors,
including Judith R. Haimes, who credited her with doing a superb
job under difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has almost killed her,'' said Haimes, one of the group's
cofounders who lives in Florida. ``Can you imagine how it must feel
to have this kind of press and these kinds of questions? She's
worked so hard to get the state matching funds not for her pocket
but to make the project go. Not one single thing can any person
come up with that she has done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   To make things go right, Pennington will need more help. She
said revenues for the last three fiscal years total $6.5 million,
including the 1997 grant of $2.5 million from the state. A new
fund-raising campaign is in its embryonic stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember Governor Cellucci was up here about a year ago
touting the state grant, and he went into this rendition of `Bye,
Bye, Miss American Pie,' '' said William ``Smitty'' Pignatelli,
chairman of Lenox's five-member Board of Selectmen. ``Now, the
house of cards is crumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   Pignatelli and Selectman Timothy Doherty said they hope the
investigations uncover no wrongdoing and that the foundation
recovers and thrives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know where they're going to go to create an income
stream in order to fulfill their mission statement,'' Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   That stream would have to grow into a torrent. A tour of the
property shows that the museum and the retirement village are
little more than sketches on a drawing board. No musicians live on
the property. Performances and educational programs are ongoing,
but many of the buildings are badly in need of repair. There is a
dormitory, two concert facilities, a main office, and an exquisite
mansion called Spring Lawn, a 1904 Berkshire Cottage where
Pennington and her husband, foundation program director Tom Heany,
occupy a second-floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people still don't understand the foundation's
mission and they haven't seen much growth,'' said James Gardner, a
former foundation employee who now manages a Berkshire County
recording artist. ``It's been difficult. It appears there's not
much outreach to the public and the public has a difficult time
reaching out to the foundation. This is the worst I've seen it,
honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundation officials say they are often asked why millionaires
like the music industry heavyweights who lent their names to the
foundation's inaugural drive for support do not just open their
wallets and make the foundation's vision a reality overnight. But,
music insiders said, it does not work like that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be having this discussion 30 years ago because the
people who ran the music industry at that time sincerely loved the
industry,'' said singer-songwriter Arlo Guthrie, a local star who
helped welcome the foundation here in 1993. ``But the people who
now control the music industry are in it not because they love the
music, but because they love the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The folk singer added: ``I hope for the best because it would be
great for the area. It would be great for musicians. The idea of
taking classes from people who changed the course of musical
history is fabulous. With this recent ruckus I guess the thing will
either happen or it will go away. A little local color is a good
thing.''

GOOD NEWS AT LAST FOR MELANIE AND BERNIE SINCLAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this month of valentines, here's a heartbreaker. To get to
their honeymoon suite, Melanie and Bernie Sinclair of Perrysville,
Ohio, had to step over snakes. What's more, there were squirrels on
their dinner menu. And a night of wedded bliss featured zany
relatives screaming and beating on pots and pans.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a bright side: Melanie and Bernie are the grand
prize winners of the fifth annual Thrifty Car Rental Honeymoon
Disasters Contest. They've been awarded a second honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   Here's their story. Because of limited funds, the Sinclairs
decided to honeymoon in the groom's ``ancestral home'' in West
Virginia. The place, it turned out, was a shack with holes in the
walls, snakes on the stairway, ``central heating'' from a
pot-bellied stove, and no running water. And, oh yes, the outhouse
had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   At dinnertime, Bernie's aunt greeted the bride with a gun in one
hand and a dead squirrel in the other. ``Here, this is for his
supper,'' the aunt announced.
</P>
<P>
   On the third night, there was a ``shivaree,'' in which friends
and relatives congratulated the newlyweds by telling crude jokes
and making noise with pots, pans, and screams until the couple
offered them food. There's more, but it's not printable.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinclairs have won a second honeymoon to the city of their
choice anywhere in the continental United States that is accessible
by a major airline, including air fare, hotel accommodations for
three nights, and a four-day car rental (a Thrifty car, perhaps?).
</P>
<P>
   Was your honeymoon disastrous? Send your terror tale to Thrifty
and the winner will be announced on Valentines Day 2000, if not
sooner. Check out the Thrifty Web site at www.thrifty.com and
e-mail your entry by visiting the ``Promotions'' section, or write
to Honeymoon Disasters 1999, c/o Thrifty Rent-A-Car System Inc.,
Corporate Communications Dept., CIMS (NU)1020, PO Box 35250, Tulsa,
OK 74153-0250. Include a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Entries
must be postmarked by Aug. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And next week we'll have more honeymoon hijinks from the
contest.

And speaking of valentines: The Barbizon Hotel &AMP; Towers in New York
City has a unique Valentine's Day package for survivors of
relationships that have ended badly. The ``Dis Your Ex'' package
allows guests to get through Feb. 14 by indulging themselves while
taking ``revenge'' on any former sweetheart. Women who book the
package will receive a heart-shaped box of Godiva chocolates,
aromatherapy candles, bath salts, a copy of Cosmopolitan, an
in-room movie, and a bottle of champagne with a single fluted
glass. Men, on the other hand, get a pair of boxer shorts (the kind
their girlfriends never let them wear), a copy of Playboy, a cigar,
a six-pack of their favorite beer, a box of Mallomars, and an
in-room movie or complimentary pay-per-view sporting event. Women
and men are invited to use the hotel's paper shredder, and will
receive a ``Dis Your Ex'' box in which to store all those newly
tattered love letters, and photos. Finally, the Barbizon will take
a picture of the guest enjoying herself or himself and forward it
to the ex-sweetheart. The cost is $350 per person. For more
information, call 800-223-1020.

Drive right in: Business class passengers flying Virgin Atlantic
can check in at London's Gatwick Airport without leaving their
complimentary limousine. As passengers are picked up, the chauffeur
calls the airport, and baggage tags are pre-printed. Upon arrival
at the new $1 million Drive-Thru Check-in facility, a porter
collects luggage from the limo and checks it in. Security questions
are asked and preprinted boarding passes and invitations to
Virgin's Upper Class lounge are issued while passengers are still
in the limousine. The whole check-in takes about 30 seconds. Virgin
serves Gatwick from Boston, Newark, Orlando, and the Caribbean. &QL;

classical French accent, it is constantly evolving. Some samples
from his new menu: Atlantic salmon with spinach, roasted potatoes,
and Asian flavors; sauteed Maine lobster with green lentils,
candied lemon zest, and an old port sauce; and roasted rack of lamb
with nicoise olive crust and a compote of eggplant and vegetable au

VERMONT MUSEUM EMBRACES THE CULTURE OF `A PLACE APART' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOHNSBURY, Vt. _ There is a phrase, sounding almost
religious in its pronouncement, used by those who reside in this
far northeast corner of Vermont: ``Living in the Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   They are referring to life in the Northeast Kingdom, a place
where the geography, the culture, the politics, and the economy
combine to delineate it from the rest of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Pinched between the Green Mountains to the west, the White
Mountains of New Hampshire to the east, and in the heart of the
Connecticut River watershed, the Kingdom, as many locals call it,
has more in common with the northern tip of New Hampshire and parts
of western Maine than it does with the bustle of Burlington or the
restored villages, so attractive to flatlanders, that dot the south
and west of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place apart,'' says Charles Browne, executive
director of the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium in St. Johnsbury.
</P>
<P>
   But Browne is determined that it will not be a place forgotten.
The small, white-clapboard house behind the stately brick museum is
home to the new Douglas B. Kitchel Center For the Study of the
Northeast Kingdom. Browne and Howard Reed, the museum's curator,
see their task as giving common access to a culture that Browne
calls ``isolated politically, geographically, economically . . .
from a lot of what we think about when we think about Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kingdom is a region where the roots of Abenaki,
Franco-American, and Scottish ancestry run deep. It is a place
where it is not politically incorrect to talk of logging, hunting,
and slaughtering farm animals for food. A place where, as writer
Reeve Lindbergh explained in her book, ``The View From The
Kingdom,'' ``land and climate define existence'' and people talk
almost sacramentally of wood and blood, heat and sustenance.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape is rugged, with glacially scratched lakes, rivers,
and streams flowing into the Connecticut River, hardwoods that grow
on high mountains, and lowlands of boreal spruce-fir forests that
sprawl from Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   The vestiges of money here came from the woods and from
industry. There was the lumber baron, George Van Dyke of Canaan,
and there was the Fairbanks family of St. Johnsbury, which made its
money in the platform scale industry and gave much of it back to
the town.
</P>
<P>
   It still is in many ways a true New England frontier, says
Browne, who calls it ``a place where people who want to `live away'
can live away.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only two small cities _ St. Johnsbury and Newport,
near the Canadian border. Its little towns have not been, as Donald
Hall, the author and poet once described Woodstock, as embalmed by
Rockefeller money ``in the shroud of a small New England town.''
</P>
<P>
   What endures are mostly small towns and isolated homesteads
linked by small roads. There are only about 50,000 people in the
2,000-square-mile Kingdom. The Kingdom never has been a major
tourist destination and it is physically cut off from the commerce
of the more affluent western reaches of the state and the state
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Browne says the people of the Kingdom tend to be individualistic
and Republican, which sets them apart from the rest of the state
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is also a drive to preserve the forests that cover
the land. Champion International Paper Co. is selling 133,000 acres
in the Kingdom, and while the federal government will buy 26,000
acres of it for the Silvio O. Conte Wildlife Refuge, the state is
attempting to purchase 22,000 more and hoping the rest will be sold
to another timber company.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to preserve traditional use of the forest: for
hunting, fishing, skiing, snowmobiling (a major industry here),
hiking, camping, and logging. Many of these activities mean jobs
and money and, to be sure, there is a lot of poverty in the
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Slayton, editor in chief of Vermont Life magazine, wrote in
an introduction to Virginia Campbell Down's book, ``Voices from The
Kingdom'' that two stereotypes of the region prevail: ``It's a
northern Appalachia . . . It's heaven on earth.'' Both are correct.
</P>
<P>
   But the shared struggle of making a living in the Kingdom unites
its people, Reed says. There is pride in independence, pride in
making do in a tough land.
</P>
<P>
   Its villages have been preserved not because of any great influx
of money, but because there was never enough to tear down and
rebuild. St. Johnsbury, Reed says, kept its wonderful Gothic and
Victorian architecture simply because there was never money for
urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   The graceful homes that line Main Street, he says, ``would have
been torn down long ago if there'd been any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Preserving the culture is important, Reed says: ``All you've got
to do is take a trip over to Burlington and you realize we don't
have a lot of what they've got _ but they've lost a lot of what we
still have.''

COURT CASE POINTS TO CONFUSION OVER AGE OF CONSENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-olds in Massachusetts can be sentenced to life in
prison without parole. Sixteen-year-olds can drop out of school,
have sex, hold a job, and drive. Eighteen-year-olds can marry,
vote, and get an abortion. But don't try to order a beer until
you're 21.
</P>
<P>
   How old is old enough?
</P>
<P>
   Now, the age of consent has become a question of life and death
in a landmark appeals court challenge by Alexis Demos, a
17-year-old Jehovah's Witness from Lenox, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Demos, who injured her spleen in a snowboarding accident Jan.
26, has refused a blood transfusion her doctors say she may need.
Her attorneys argued before the state Appeals Court in Boston last
week _ with her parents' support _ that such a medical procedure
would violate her religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital argued she is not old enough to make a potentially
fatal decision, and said her parents do not have the right to make
that decision either.
</P>
<P>
   The case points to how widely the age of consent ranges for
various activities. Demos asserts that if 16-year-olds can drop out
of school and 14-year-olds be sentenced as adults, why should she
not be able to reject a medical treatment?
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Smith, an attorney for Berkshire Medical Center in
Pittsfield, Mass., where Demos was recovering prior to her release
from the hospital Thursday, said in an interview, ``The decision to
withhold lifesaving treatment is of far greater importance that any
other decision involving the consent laws. Consenting to sex or
obtaining an abortion are significant issues _ but ones you can
recover from by maturing, therapy, or living a different way.''
</P>
<P>
   Demos's decision against a blood transfusion, Smith said, could
become ``truly irreversible.'' Even a leukemia patient declining a
transfusion would normally have time to change her mind before
death. But if Demos needed a transfusion, it would mean she was
facing an immediate threat of death, Smith said, and ``would have
no time to change her mind, because she would be bleeding to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Demos's attorney, Richard Simons, says his client fits the legal
description of ``mature minor'' _ one who can be granted permission
by a judge to be treated legally as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing magical about the chronological age of 18,''
Simons said. ``In terms of medical care, I think it is important to
have some qualitative measures. Is the child mature and
competent?''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Koocher, chief psychologist at Children's Hospital in
Boston, said, ``Hardly any of (the age limits) make sense. They
generally come about for social, cultural, or political reasons,
and are not based on child developmental issues. I don't believe
the hospital has any business challenging (Demos's) decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Male, author of ``The Scapegoat Generation: America's
War on Adolescents,'' said, ``At extremes, ages of consent work.
People should not have sex with 6 year-olds, and 3year-olds should
not have guns. But once you get to age 13 to 17, then individuality
really takes over.''
</P>
<P>
   In Demos's case, Berkshire Superior Court did not accept the
``mature minor'' assertion; it regards her as a child. The court
also rejected her parents' argument and ordered the hospital to
perform the transfusion if necessary. It is not known when the
three-judge Appeals Court panel might render its decision after
hearing the case Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Some child development experts criticize the hospital's decision
to force Demos to have even a lifesaving operation.
</P>
<P>
   Koocher said he would never allow children under 12 to make a
critical health decision on their own, but that beyond 12,
depending on the particular child, Koocher said he ``advocates
looking at the decision being made and asking what is the basis for
it? Is it being made competently? Is the person processing the
information and knowingly using it to inform a decision that would
be just as logical if an adult made it?''
</P>
<P>
   But even Koocher acknowledged that he would consider Demos's
case weaker if her parents were not supporting her decision.
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Marie Parente said it is inevitable that
any age of consent will be arbitrary, but there simply is no other
way to legislate them. ``They are there to protect society,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As of November, Massachusetts law requires 16-year-old drivers
with underage passengers to have a person who is at least 21 with
them. Passage of the measure was prompted by recent roadway
tragedies attributed not to drinking or drugs, but youthful
inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Some 23 states have tinkered with their driving age limit. In
the past decade, 43 states have lowered the age at which a juvenile
can be tried as an adult for violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum drinking age in Massachusetts has changed four times
since 1933, and has remained at 21 since 1985, according to the
state Alcohol Beverages Control Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The age limits that have remained unchanged for decades _ such
as the age of consent for sex _ _ sometimes seem to contradict more
modern laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have sex with a 16-year-old girl,'' said Male. ``But
if you film it and show it to her, you can be charged with
providing pornography to a minor.''

NEW BAY STATE GUN LAW RAISES REENACTMENT QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The British may or may not be coming.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on whether the state of Massachusetts makes them
childproof their muskets.
</P>
<P>
   The British, in this case participants of what is expected to be
the largest reenactment of the battles of Lexington and Concord
scheduled for next year, are threatening to retreat unless a new
state law requiring locks and licenses on their antique firearms is
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The 225th anniversary of the historic battles is expected to
draw re-enacters from around the world and perhaps as many as
250,000 spectators. But the plans are now in a state of suspended
chaos, organizers say, as they cope with the tough new gun-control
law. Plans for a Patriots Day reenactment, April 19, intended as a
dress rehearsal for the 2000 event, are also in chaos, organizers
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it was no one's intent that muskets and other
sorts of weapons with primitive ignition systems that date from the
last century or before were ever to be included in the present
legislation,'' said Paul O'Shaughnessy of Newton, commanding
officer of the British Army's 10th Regiment of Foot and an
organizer of the historic battle reenactments. ``They simply did
not extend the exemptions in the new part of the law, which
inadvertently left us . . . subject to some of the rather stringent
parts of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Shaughnessy said many foreign and out-of-state participants
will decide not to join in the reenactments if they are subject to
the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``These muskets are national treasures,'' O'Shaughnessy said.
``This is like putting a red nose on the Lincoln Monument so that
no one bumps into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Senator Susan C. Fargo filed a bill that would revise
last year's Assault Weapons Ban, exempting historic muskets made
before 1899 from trigger locks and storage requirements. She is
also seeking an executive ruling from the public safety secretary
to exclude participants from other countries _ Canada and Britain,
in this case _ from having to get temporary licenses through the
State Police in order to participate in the fake battle.
</P>
<P>
   But others say gun-control opponents are just trying to draw
fire to the state's new law by creating a controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Paul C. Casey, who helped write the law, said the
flap is indicative of gun-control opponents' ``propaganda'' used
``in an effort to stymie support'' for the Assault Weapons Ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latest theory to hit the streets has the `Modern
Minutemen' worked up about their ability to conduct historical
reenactments,'' said Casey, a Winchester Democrat. ``It's just
another falsehood.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey said it is untrue that the new law altered a standing
exemption covering Revolutionary-type muskets and replicas.
</P>
<P>
   But Fargo, on the advice of Senate counsel, disagreed. She said
that because the Assault Weapons Ban does not specifically exempt
the historic firearms and replicas, they are subject to the
childproofing locks and storage requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The new law has already triggered a tangible change inside the
Senate chamber. Two historic muskets on display there, one from the
battle of Lexington and Concord and the other the first gun seized
from the British during the Revolutionary War, recently have been
outfitted with trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   When the Gun Owners Action League, a group that fought the
Assault Weapons Ban, pointed out that the firearms hanging in the
chamber violated the law, Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham
installed the protective devices to show how easy it is to comply.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for GOAL said the group supports Fargo's bill.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham's quick action, whether politically motivated or not,
could have backfired, some on Beacon Hill say, because the gun
lobby is using the retrofitted muskets as proof that all of these
antique firearms must be made compliant.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion is also having an impact on next month's planned
reenactment of the Boston Massacre at the Old State House, as well
as the Patriot's Day event in April and June's Battle of Falmouth
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The history buffs who role play obviously don't want to be
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as this year's event, people may be forced to . . .
make the decision not to go,'' O'Shaughnessy said. ``The problem
with 2000 is that this year is a dry run for that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Fargo is seeking to clarify all this in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Her bill states that firearms manufactured in or before 1899, or
any replica, would be exempted under the Assault Weapons Ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Nolan, an aide to Casey, said the law is clear. Those
from other countries need a temporary license to carry the muskets,
while those from other states do not need a temporary license,
Nolan said. And no, the muskets don't need locks or safety cases,
``as long as they're under the control of someone authorized to use
them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply don't agree with his reading on this,'' Fargo said.
``We've been working on this for weeks, if not months, to make sure
the events of Patriots Day take place in Lexington and Lincoln and
Concord this year and next year when there's going to be a big
battle reenactment. There's some concern.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that even if trigger locks are placed on the antique
weapons, the primitive ignition systems would allow the muskets to
be fired. As for those muskets in the Senate chamber, Birmingham
remarked at the time that the only way the weapons could be
considered operable is if someone had gun powder at hand.
</P>
<P>
   John Rosenthal, founder and chairman of Stop Handgun Violence, a
lead advocate of the Assault Weapons Ban, said the law is not
intended to stand in the way of historical reenactments. ``Although
I think it's responsible gun ownership to lock all guns,'' said
Rosenthal. ``That includes muskets if you can find a lock to fit
it.''

VERMONT SENATOR MAY FIND A CHALLENGE IN EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ He has been an elected cult hero for nearly a
decade, a rumpled Socialist who gleefully calls himself an
``outsider in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all his independence, Representative Bernard Sanders is
starting to sound almost mainstream these days, with an
increasingly familiar Washington theme: Impeachment is bad.
Republicans are worse. And Republican senators up for reelection in
liberal states in 2000 _ such as Senator James M. Jeffords of
Vermont _ had better beware.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the day that Jeffords voted with the Republicans on the
motion to dismiss, we probably got 15 calls urging me to run
against the senator,'' Sanders said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it raises here is the fact that Senator Jeffords tells
people he is a maverick Republican . . . when the truth is, on most
of the important issues, Senator Jeffords will side with the very
right-wing Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has not yet announced his candidacy for Jeffords's seat,
saying he is only ``giving some consideration to running.'' He also
says impeachment ``would not be the focal point'' of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But in his harsh critiques of Jeffords _ who voted last week
with Democrats against calling Monica S. Lewinsky as a witness and
has given strong indications he will vote to acquit President
Clinton _ Sanders has joined a number of Democrats in recognizing
the value of impeachment as a political weapon, a kind of reverse
scarlet letter that stigmatizes not the adulterer but his accusers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jeffords is widely known for his moderate voting
record, his bipartisanship, and his alliances with Democrats,
including Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy on the Senate
Labor and Human Resources Committee. Jeffords was the only
Republican to vote against the Reagan tax cut of 1981. In the
Senate, he was the only Republican to cosponsor the Clinton health
care plan. According to the ``Almanac of American Politics,''
Jeffords has ``one of the most liberal records of all Republicans''
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He has also kept a low profile on impeachment, voting with the
GOP on several procedural matters but breaking away to vote against
calling Lewinsky as a witness. He was one of only two Republicans
opposing airing her videotaped testimony. While his colleagues have
rushed to the microphones after each day's proceedings, Jeffords
for the most part slipped quietly back to his office, carefully
avoiding attacks on either side. He has, an aide said, ``worked
behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do what you think is right,'' Jeffords said in an
interview. ``I think I won't have any problem tracing my votes, and
why I voted the way I did. The amount of effort I have put into
this has all been done in the best interest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, if challenged by Sanders, could hope for a forgiving
constituency. Although 53 percent of Vermont voters supported
Clinton in 1996, and 66 percent oppose impeachment, they might
remember Jeffords's support of other causes, such as abortion
rights or funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. On
Sunday, in several towns in northern Vermont, a number of residents
said they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think impeachment should have gone forward,'' said
Tammy Bonk, 30, a consultant from Winooski, Vt. ``But if Bernie
used it as a steppingstone against Jeffords, that wouldn't be
right, either. I think a politician should get criticized for what
matters, for what they've done for Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bombardier, 64, of Milton, Vt., agreed, saying he thought
Jeffords has ``done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, I think he's voted his conscience most of the
time,'' Bombardier said, as he ate a prime-rib supper at the Milton
Diner, which is perched along a two-lane highway north of
Burlington. ``I don't think Bernie has a chance. And I never liked
his appearance, but that's besides the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders's mussed looks may, in fact, speak to his true challenge
in any Senate race: overcoming his image as a freewheeling
independent, a firebrand alienated from mainstream politics and
lacking the experience of a senior statesman.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been reelected in every congressional election
since 1990, and enjoys the support of the left-wing of the
Democratic caucus, he remains the only Independent member of the
House of Representatives _ an identity that could be portrayed as
anathema to the more stately Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Even in downtown Burlington _ the city Sanders served as mayor
for four terms, a largely liberal enclave where Birkenstocks may
outnumber work boots _ there were some skeptics among Sanders's
fans. At Muddy Waters on Main Street, a low-key juice bar with
wood-beam ceilings and armchairs, several patrons brimmed with
pride when Sanders was mentioned. But they said they would be
reluctant to elect him over Jeffords _ and certainly not because of
impeachment alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermont policy would play a far bigger role in my voting than
impeachment,'' said Kenneth Hammond, 24, a youth counselor in
Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would probably vote for Jeffords,'' said Amanda Michel, 20,
a University of Vermont philosophy major whose family lives in
Orwell, Vt. ``Sanders, even though he has good ideas, has put
himself at the periphery. Jeffords seems to be much better at
working with others in both parties, working for Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there were those who believe Sanders could
fare well in a Senate race. Will Lozier, 26, a golf professional
from Burlington, said he believes Sanders could garner support
among younger voters who long ago tired of impeachment, and who
would respect the white-haired Independent for his straightforward
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got a lot of common sense, which a lot of these
people lack,'' Lozier said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords seems aware of the sentiments back home _ both the
public weariness over impeachment and the need to appear
reasonable. He has tried, he says, to ``keep an open mind.'' He has
even taken to cracking impeachment jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at an event in Washington, Jeffords introduced
Representative Barney Frank, a Newton Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm glad to be with my friend Barney Frank, but I do
have one criticism: He should have stopped that impeachment and
kept it from coming over here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Frank says he thought it ``an odd remark. You got the sense he
was telling the truth in the guise of a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank added that he views Jeffords's uneasiness over impeachment
as a sign of his difficult role within the GOP. One of Jeffords's
greatest assets is his Labor committee chairmanship, Frank said,
but that position makes Jeffords beholden to the Republican leaders
who make committee assignments, tethering him to the party's
conservative core on some issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is,'' Frank said, that what gains Jeffords access
to power ``is also what gives the right wing influence over him.
And that's what impeachment has driven home to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Russ, Jeffords's chief of staff, has been bracing for that
Democratic angle of attack. ``There's no question that in every
race in 2000 where there's a Republican running, an opponent is
going to look at impeachment to see if they can hang it around
someone's neck as a negative,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the trial is complete, she said, ``I think they'll look
at how he'' _ Jeffords _ ``handled it, and if he was able to
explain his votes in a way that reflects what Vermonters believe _
which is, basically, get it over with.''

IAN MCEWAN WRITES `LITE' _ AND WINS THE BOOKER  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four couples posed for the photograph in the Italian bookstore,
along with their favorite author, Ian McEwan, whose work had
brought the couples together.
</P>
<P>
   The British writer could not quite believe it, at first, when
the bookstore owner in Rome came to him and announced that he had
been drawn to his future wife initially when he spied her reading a
McEwan novel on the subway, and one thing led to another.
</P>
<P>
   But the bookstore owner and his wife were soon followed by
another Italian couple with a similar story, then another, then
another, all in the space of an hour. So the photograph was quickly
arranged to capture all these people and the writer of dark and
disturbing novels who had managed, in an odd way, to change their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, this is a service I can perform,'' McEwan said with a
sly chuckle during a recent interview. ``There were not only these
four couples who were brought together, but also seven children who
were born from these unions. So whole trajectories of lives were
altered by a shared passion for my books. That's the most I could
hope for from my work, and so different from the press line that I
am a writer whose work only descends into blood, gore and the
macabre.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan, whose early work earned him the media nickname of ``Ian
Macabre,'' has long been the sort of writer who attracted a cult
following for his novels and the way they examine moments in life
when happenstance suddenly turns to fate. But the 50-year-old's
recent winning of Britain's prestigious Booker Prize will probably
bring McEwan an even larger circle of readers, in Britain and
beyond, even if much of his work is an acquired taste, novels akin
to Brussels sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amsterdam'' (Doubleday, 193 pages, $21) will help in that
effort, and not just because the Booker is such an important award
that London bookmakers offer odds on the five finalists and it is
announced at a celebrity-rich black-tie gala broadcast live on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amsterdam,'' published on the heels of McEwan's much more
complex ``Enduring Love,'' is approachable McEwan, even McEwan
Lite, as the writer acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to do something lighter, less intense,'' McEwan
said. ``I settled on doing a social satire after reading a lot of
Evelyn Waugh. His work prompted me to wonder what would Waugh make
of us baby boomers _ I'm sure that he'd be snarling in comtempt at
our vanities.''
</P>
<P>
   Those vanities are much on display in ``Amsterdam,'' where
McEwan skewers such contemporary topics as the foibles of men at
middle age to the media's lust to expose the private lives of
public figures to the bombast attached to the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the satire storm are two longtime friends who
meet at the funeral of a woman with whom each had a love affair.
Clive Linley is Britain's most prominent composer of symphonies
with the assignment of penning an ode to the millennium, while
Vernon Halliday is editor of an old-fashioned newspaper trying
desperately to compete in the sweaty hothouse of tabloid frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Their lover's unsettling demise from a debilitating illness
prompts the two men to embark on a pact that each will assist the
other in dying, should their circumstances ever reach a similarly
desperate state. But no sooner have they agreed to the pact, likely
be put into effect in the Netherlands, where euthanasia is legal,
than their friendship begins to founder on the rocks of ego and
mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   And, as often happens in McEwan novels, the consequences soon
prove both inevitable and disastrous. The end illustrates that, as
McEwan writes, ``there was something seriously wrong with the world
for which neither God nor His absence could be blamed.''
</P>
<P>
   British literary critics were unanimous in their praise of
``Amsterdam'' _ unlike the mixed reviews usually prompted by McEwan
novels _ and the book has been a bestseller there, as it is now in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the critics' praise for ``Amsterdam'' was muted with
assertions that this novel was minor McEwan. Here was a great
writer at work but not quite operating at full potential, as if
Mark McGwire were crushing home runs while hitting in some bandbox
of a minor league park.
</P>
<P>
   McEwan, a soft-spoken but genial chap in most circumstances,
bristles at this often-repeated notion.
</P>
<P>
   ```Amsterdam' is absolutely not a minor work,'' he emphasized.
``I took it very seriously. I do not believe in the form of comic
novel where there is a laugh at every turn _ that is like being
tickled against your will. But this is a comic novel flirting with
the edges of realism and I hope part of its pleasure for readers
comes from watching things unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan's own powers of observation were honed growing up abroad
as the son of a career Army man. His youth included years in
Singapore and North Africa, a little stranger in strange lands,
although he was schooled with other British military dependents who
were also accustomed to the itinerant life.
</P>
<P>
   Writing first attracted McEwan during his college days. What
influenced him most at the outset was the fiction of American
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``America seemed to offer extraordinary liberties to its
writers,'' McEwan recalled. ```Portnoy's Complaint' and `Naked
Lunch' and Updike all seemed expressions of freedom that simply was
not available in Britain, as did the work of Saul Bellow and Norman
Mailer. They all seemed to be confronting modernity in ways that
British fiction was not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of McEwan's earliest work, short stories much influenced by
Henry Miller (still among his favorite authors), was published
first by the New American Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember receiving $600 for one story,'' McEwan recalled.
``That was enough for me to live on for six months back then. It
was quite extraordinary.''

BINGO'S DWINDLING NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just allinside the entrance to the parish hall in the
basement of St. Vincent de Paul Church in South Boston, about
two-dozen people are in line to buy a strip of bingo cards.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the sprawling room, thick with smoke, dozens of players
sit at well-worn folding tables getting ready, arranging cards,
pulling out magic markers, and making sure they have a clear view
of the electronic bingo board.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 players will drop several thousand dollars into St.
Vincent's coffers for a chance to yell ``BINGO!'' It's a typical
crowd for the Thursday night games, but a far cry from the 400 to
500 gamblers who used to pack the hall 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   More than 27 years after Massachusetts legalized gambling on
bingo, the game is on the decline, a casualty of the proliferation
of lottery games and instant scratch tickets, the lure of nearby
Connecticut casinos, and a limit on bingo cash prizes that has
remained unchanged for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Used to be that you'd be standing out the door waiting to get
in'' to bingo at St. Vincent's, said Lois Forcione, who has been a
regular at South Boston bingo halls for 37 years. ``Bingo is not
what it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, workers at synagogues and Catholic parishes say,
the number of bingo players is plummeting, revenues are plunging,
and dozens of games have been forced to close in recent years.
Parish officials say it has been a serious financial blow,
especially to parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Brigid Parish in South Boston, for example, officials are
having to turn to charitable social events to raise money for the
parish elementary school, after shutting down the weekly bingo game
in December.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the school had grown less dependent on bingo,
because the game had been making less and less money for years,
said the Very Rev. John P. Culloty, St. Brigid's pastor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, an average of about 175,000 people across the state
played bingo each week, according to the Massachusetts State
Lottery Commission. By 1997, the figure had dropped to 112,000.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, revenue from bingo statewide fell from $171
million to $123 million. And the number of bingo licenses also has
been decreasing steadily, from 841 in 1987 to 585 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 585 licenses, the Lottery Commission estimates that 30
belong to organizations that don't have active games any more, but
are just holding on to their permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bingo in this state is in serious trouble,'' said Allen
Nitschelm, publisher of the Massachusetts Bingo Bugle, a monthly
newspaper with a circulation of 32,000. ``And it's a shame, because
all the money raised by bingo goes directly to charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides schools, bingo proceeds are used to fund youth sports
programs, help pay for staff at churches and synagogues, and
subsidize programs for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Vincent, where annual bingo proceeds have shrunk from
$150,000 to $75,000 in four years, officials have had to lay off
office staff and are considering selling parish property to make
ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely hurting,'' the Rev. Richard E. Cannon, St.
Vincent's pastor, said of the drop in bingo receipts. But he added
that an increase in weekly Mass attendance is increasing parish
collections and helping to offset the loss of bingo revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In a small number of cases, bingo halls have been shut down not
by finances but by the opinions of some clergy that churches should
not condone gambling, even if the profits are used for worthy
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the Rev. Daniel Twomey received widespread
publicity, including some criticism, when he closed the bingo game
at St. Patrick's in Natick. ``I don't think Catholic churches
should rely on gambling to pay our heating bills,'' said Twomey,
adding that the bingo shortfall has easily been made up by
offerings at weekend Masses.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, bingo is being decimated by competition.
Today there are many more ways to gamble and win much bigger prizes
than local bingo halls offer.
</P>
<P>
   There are daily lottery drawings, electronic Keno games that can
be played all day at bars and convenience stores, and dozens of
instant scratch tickets paying hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only so much gambling money out there. Not that I'm
saying gambling is the best activity in the world,'' said the Rev.
Walter Keymont, pastor of St. Ann Church in Dorchester, where bingo
was stopped three years ago. ``And the prizes we were giving out
were just not attractive enough to people. They could go elsewhere
and do much better.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, two cavernous casinos, Foxwoods and
Mohegan Sun, opened in Connecticut and siphoned off the elderly, a
key bingo constituency. Buses to both casinos leave from various
Boston neighborhoods every day. Some seniors say they prefer to
play the slots in a brightly lit, nicely carpeted casino than play
bingo in a smoke-filled, musty church basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come here every week, but if we win and have a little more
money we'll go down to the casinos,'' said Tim Collins, who was
getting ready to play bingo at St. Vincent de Paul with his wife
Joan and their friend, Rita Foley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can win more money much faster at the casinos than you can
here,'' Collins said. ``Bingo is as much a social event as anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides visiting the casinos, many bingo players also have
diverted their gambling dollars to the video casino machines at
Lincoln Park, a popular dog track in Lincoln, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion by House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran that casino
gambling might be good for the Bay State would almost certainly
mean more bad news for bingo.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Lottery Commission and a handful of legislators have
tried without success to convince the Legislature to increase bingo
prizes. Most bingo halls pay out $50 per game, and a handful of
special games have a top prize of about $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to restructure the prizes if we are going to keep
bingo viable,'' said state Senator Michael W. Morrissey, a Quincy
Democrat who is a proponent of increasing bingo awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Bingo Bugle's Nitschelm agrees. ``I would think that if
legislators are going to allow the lottery to have more games and
higher prizes then they should be willing to protect charity bingo
games,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some games report reaping a windfall as bingo games close
elsewhere and have seen an increase in their own players. But many
bingo games are struggling, and operators wonder how much longer
they will be able to keep the game alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look ahead to the day when I'll have to decide whether
it's worth it,'' said the Rev. Francis H. Kelley, pastor of Sacred
Heart Parish in Roslindale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not have to rely on gambling,'' Kelley said. ``But
the choice I have is to close it, raise tuition at our school and
lose some families, or keep the bingo open and make the school as
affordable as possible. I know I'm going to have to figure
something out, because the game is simply collapsing.''

MYSTERIOUS SINUSES CAN BE SOURCE OF DEEPER TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Winter has always meant misery for Rochelle
Dewell, a registered nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seven to eight colds back to back,'' she said. ``Most of
my adult life I've had constant colds and they always went to my
sinuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days, Dewell's sinuses were so congested she could hardly
breathe. ``You felt like you were breathing through your ear.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Dewell thought she had allergies. Only
recently, a physician properly diagnosed her with chronic
sinusitis, a condition involving recurring infections in the
sinuses, those mysterious caverns behind the face that have puzzled
physicians for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   One theory suggests we have sinuses to lighten the skull. The
pockets of air inside may even serve as a cushion against
fractures. Others postulate that the sinuses evolved as part of our
speech development to help the voice resonate.
</P>
<P>
   Most physicians concur that sinuses play a role, albeit an
unnecessary one, in the making and movement of mucus. In fact, the
few people born without sinuses, or those who have them surgically
obliterated, don't miss them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is no good reason to have the sinuses,'' said Dr.
Karen Tan, an assistant professor of surgery at the Albany Medical
College.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us wouldn't even notice the sinuses except for that they
seem to cause so many problems. Each year, an estimated 35 million
Americans report a case of sinus pain. In fact, sinusitis is the
nation's most common chronic problem, costing an estimated $2.4
billion in surgeries, physician visits and missed workdays.
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated or undertreated, one serious sinus infection can
lay the groundwork for ongoing problems, as was the case with
Dewell. Despite many visits to physicians for antibiotics and to
rule out allergies, her infections kept coming back.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she saw a specialist last month, she had lost her
ability to smell or taste. ``Over time, I just got used to it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, sinus infections aren't always easy to
distinguish from other upper-respiratory problems, including a head
cold or allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur S. Cohn, of the Capital Region Otolaryngology Head
and Neck Group in Albany, said people should become concerned if
their upper-respiratory symptoms last longer than a week and seem
to get worse. ``When you get real severe pain in the face, with
yellow or green discharge, that's more an indication of a sinus
infection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other signs include a fever, a toothache or a headache that gets
worse when you lean over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sinuses are honeycomb-like cavities in the bones surrounding
the nose.
</P>
<P>
   When the sinuses are healthy, mucus drains from each sinus along
a narrow channel that opens into the nose. Along the entire system
is the smooth passage of air. But when a cold or virus causes nasal
congestion, that important air supply is cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You develop a vacuum,'' Cohn said. ``The negative pressure
develops and this promotes the growth of bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Recurrent infections can permanently damage and inflame the
sinuses, setting someone up for ongoing problems. So if you suspect
a case of sinusitis, talk with your physician. Sometimes simple
solutions can help, like using a saline nasal spray, taking a
steamy shower or drinking lots of water to keep your mucous
membranes hydrated.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, an antibiotic might be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The key is not to let bacteria get a permanent foothold. On rare
occasions, the multiplying microbes can spread into other organs,
causing blindness in the eyes or abscesses on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Dewell developed another complication: polyps or growths inside
the sinus passages that can impair breathing, smell and taste.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most severe chronic sinusitis problems can be
treated surgically.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 12, Dewell had a dozen polyps removed from her sinuses
during an out-patient procedure. Since then, she's been enjoying
the taste of bread and chocolate and rediscovering how pleasant
certain smells can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wonderful,'' she said. ``I think I've gained two
pounds. I'm going through my house like a dog smelling
everything.''

DOIN' WHAT WE OUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who would have thought a crowd of word people would care so
deeply about numbers? Last month's brief treatment of zero _
whether it can it be pronounced oh, how we'll handle it in the
coming decade _ brought forth a horde of cipher-philes with decided
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   First there's the question of that pesky and in the zero years.
My prediction that many people would say two thousand and one was
not welcome: ``I've been waiting for an outcry against the term and
when reading numbers like 2001,'' wrote Shirley Tribolet of Tucson.
``The word and should only be used to separate a whole number and a
fraction.'' David Curren of Arlington, Mass., Carol Ann Dumond of
Prides Crossing, Mass., Janice Knapp-Cordes of Framingham, Mass.
and several others supplied the outcry, all noting that an
unnecessary and could mean a wrong number. ``With numbers, and
signifies a decimal point, e.g. $2001.25 would read two thousand
one dollars AND twenty-five cents,'' wrote Jim Rutledge from
somewhere in Netland.
</P>
<P>
   True enough in its place, and on a check I too would write three
hundred forty-nine and 67/00 dollars. But people are not so easily
led astray as banks and computers are. If I say my kid will
graduate in two thousand and two, even Jim Rutledge won't think I
mean the year 2000.2. When you shop for a car, you know what
seventeen-five means; if it's a coat, you're not likely to hear two
fifty-nine as $2.59. (The urban legend about the cookie recipe _
the waitress says it costs two-fifty, say, and the customer is
stunned to find $250 on her charge card rather than $2.50 _ is a
good story because errors of that magnitude are so rare in real
life.) And our casual treatment of numbers like these doesn't mean
we're careless thinkers _ it just means we're smarter than
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sometimes we are. Two of my most vigilant readers, Charles
K. Cobb and Jim Muench, both of Ipswich, Mass., point out that the
lack of a year zero in the Christian calendar _ between 1 BC and AD
1 _ doesn't affect when the new millennium begins, as I claimed;
unless we had counted that zero year as one, we still wouldn't have
counted up our 2000 years till Dec. 31, 2000. File that missing
zero under ``true but irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the question of the aughts and naughts, leading
candidates for naming the years of the next decade. P. J. Plauger
of Concord, Mass., a Princeton alumnus, is among the correspondents
who noted that ``classes from the turn of the (last) century
referred to themselves as, say, ought seven, for 1907.''
</P>
<P>
   But for word people, ought presents a problem. Aught and naught
(or ought and nought) are good old English words meaning
``anything'' and ``nothing''; but the ought that means zero exists
only because of a mistake. At some point in its history, a nought
was misdivided into an ought, the same way a napron became an
apron. Do eagle-eyed decimal watchers really want to recycle an old
mistake in the new century?
</P>
<P>
   Reader Doug Butler, for one, would call the new decade the
naughties, and naught would certainly be more numerically correct.
But I suspect most of us have had enough naughties, here in the
'90s, to last us for several decades.

A HOUSE MANAGER'S ILLUSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- You gotta love House Manager Asa Hutchinson. He
should be called The Doctor _ because of the way he operates, in
this case on the facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Doctor gets caught manufacturing a tale about Dec. 11, 1997,
as the starting date of President Clinton's alleged conspiracy to
obstruct justice, a plot he thinks is so vile that it justifies the
first impeachment conviction in our history.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't stop the man from Arkansas. In the same trial,
Hutchinson switches gears and makes up another story, claiming that
the plot started on Dec. 5, or maybe Dec. 6. This time his made-up
plot is of such alleged urgency that nothing happens to carry it
out for 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's chutzpah is for the ages. He gets caught during the
trial defaming as conspirators Vernon Jordon and Betty Currie, who
are then shown to have never conspired. And by perhaps the final
weekend of this farce, Hutchinson had invented an entirely new
theory _ that the testimony of the key players _ Jordan, Currie,
Monica Lewinsky, and officials of the company that hired her, all
of which is exculpatory _ is ``irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see,'' said The Doctor, ``that the president may have
been the only individual who had the complete picture.'' In other
words a trial based (from Ken Starr referral through House
Judiciary Committee re-write through trial brief and initial Senate
presentation) on a conspiracy to obstruct justice was transformed
into a one-man show, based entirely on inferences about the
president's intent by House managers that have been rejected by the
only witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction was ``triggered,'' Hutchinson said, on Dec. 5,
when the witness wish list by Paula Jones's civil lawsuit lawyers
came out; or maybe it was Dec. 6, when the list was actually faxed
to the president's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Here's Hutchinson creating the illusion of activity in his
questioning of Jordan: ``And so there's two conversations after the
witness list came out _ one that you had with the president on Dec.
7, and then a subsequent conversation with him after you met with
Ms. Lewinsky on the 11th.''
</P>
<P>
   Just two problems: first, it has always been an accepted fact on
all sides that Jordan and Clinton never talked about any aspect of
Lewinsky life on Dec. 7; and second, the phrase ``after you met . .
.'' is a pathetic way of saying Dec. 19. The Doctor is creating the
illusion of activity between Dec. 5 and Dec. 19 involving the two
friends to cover the inconvenient fact that no such activity
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson faced a different problem with another critical
element of his alleged obstruction _ the famous Lewinsky affidavit
in the Jones case. Thanks to House manager Ed Bryant's questioning
last week, Lewinsky was able to obliterate the allegation that
Clinton and she talked content in their middle-of-the-night
conversation of Dec. 17, 1997. Her testimony is that they never
discussed content and that as a human being her own interest in
avoiding a Jones case deposition was real.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, The Doctor invented affidavit-altering activity between
the two on Jan. 5 or Jan. 6, referring to a phone call supposedly
discussing content related to a particular paragaph in the
then-draft document involving the White House legislative affairs
office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attorney Nicole Seligman could barely contain herself as
she replied with documented facts _ no such conversation on those
dates, or ever, on any page of the case's voluminous record, and no
such paragraph in the affidavit. Hutchinson made it up to create
another element of alleged obstruction, despite the fact that the
affidavit charge in the impeachment article is based solely on the
now-exculpatory evidence about Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing tops the con job about the gifts. Beginning with the
Starr referral, Lewinsky's memory of their Dec. 28, 1997, chat is
always misreported so that Clinton says ``I don't know'' or ``Let
me think about it,'' when she suggessts returning gifts on the same
day the president gave her more. In fact, as a typical backup
summary of her sworn statements to the feds makes clear and she
confirmed in her latest deposition, ``He either did not respond or
responded I don't know. Lewinsky is not sure exactly what was said,
but she is certain that whatever Clinton said she did not have a
clear image in her mind of what to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse. In her deposition, Lewinsky says she was
questioned after Clinton's grand jury testimony by an FBI agent,
who ran various quotes of his by her, including ``You have to turn
over whatever you have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that sounds a little bit familiar to me,'' Lewinsky
says she told the agent, thus corroborating an exculpatory
statement the managers have charged Clinton never made. Starr,
however, never provided this information in his referral, leading
Seligman to say, ``We can only wonder in troubled disbelief how
much more we still don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction article of impeachment was always headed for
rejection on any of three bases: the president is innocent; he is
not guilty; the offense is not impeachable. Now there's a fourth:
flagrant prosecutorial misconduct in a case that should never have
been brought.

JON CROSBY'S VAST REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Crosby, a one-man band who goes by the acronym of VAST, is
all over the local airwaves with ``Touched,' a song that starts
pretty and acoustic, with Crosby crooning ``I'll never find someone
quite like you again.'' Suddenly, a wave of chanting washes over
you, and the song zigzags in another direction as
industrial-strength hard rock kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touched'' is emblematic of Crosby's desire to fuse what might
seem to be disparate genres. He shuffles heavy rock, chants,
cathedral organ passages, an 18-piece orchestra, and more onto his
debut album, ``Visual Audio Sensory Theater.'' It is, by turns,
somber, spiritual, attacking, lush, gothic. It is sacred and mildly
profane, full of grandeur and corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   How did Crosby come to this sound?
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself listening to world music,'' he says, from
England, where he is visiting, ``and I felt that had been a fairly
untapped area even though people have done that _ Dead Can Dance,
Enigma, Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel. But comparing those four artists
to the zillion artists that have done stuff with electronics and
the bazillion artists that've worked with guitars, I thought it was
the freshest thing I could get into, and I felt it was specific to
now because of the new age of information. People nowadays are
exposed to music from all over the world; I was raised listening to
music from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't really heard it done the way I've done, with world
music or samples of organic things added into a pop-rock context. I
felt it adds a kind of mystery, which I think is important in rock
'n' roll because it's very cinematic, dramatic, and it's ancient. .
. . It brings back some kind of feeling that's spooky, reminiscent
of something but you don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Touched'' was played heavily in Boston last summer on WAAF-FM,
but had limited success on other active rock stations around the
country. It got a rebirth on modern rock radio last last year, with
WBCN-FM and WFNX-FM picking it up and playing it extensively in
Boston. The WFNX Web site lists it as No. 3, nationally; Billboard
ranks it 32 and climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: A spooky, seductive song (and video) called ``Pretty
When You Cry,'' which is reminiscent of Nine Inch Nails'
``Closer.'' In this, Crosby coos, ``I didn't want to hurt you baby,
but you're pretty when you cry,'' as dark shadows of pop-industrial
chords surround his vocals. Then, it gets nastier _ more
possessive, obsessive, and sexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``This record,'' says Crosby of the ``Visual Audio Sensory
Theater'' CD, ``is about reality and there are certain parts of
reality that are dark, and with `Pretty When You Cry' I didn't want
to run away from it and say that's too damn harsh. I felt it was an
insight into human nature. I had this real bad relationship and I
wanted to sing about it. Looking back, I feel quite ashamed of it,
in a sense, because it's like, if kids hear this song are they
going to think `Is it cool to be negative? Is darkness cool?' I
guess all I can really do is not do it again. The one thing about
being a musician is that you make your mistakes in front of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all musicians do, but Crosby _ something of a prodigy
at 21 _ is certainly in that position. The ``Visual Audio Sensory
Theater'' album is doing well, 35,000 and rising _ ``it's not a
flop or a hit,'' he says _ and has garnered the California-born
Crosby a lot of attention. He started out on guitar but has become
a musical mixologist, playing numerous instruments on the album and
showing a wise hand at sampling. Metallica's Lars Ulrich has termed
it ``one of the best debut albums I've heard in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   That VAST stands for Visual Audio Sensory Theater seems nothing
if not audacious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never meant it to be an adjective for me,'' says Crosby.
``Although I see where you can say that . . . In the '80s, there
was a lot of bands that had names like Extreme and Mr. Big. It's
not like that at all. It's like I'm calling the world and reality
vast, and all my songs are some kind of attempt at describing
reality. It's a very philosophical concept and that's where the
visual audio sensory theater applies _ the name of the band is a
statement. . . . Music does transcend language. A lot of countries,
musicians use rhythms that are in completely different time
signatures, but overall, the 4/4 rock beat _ you go to countries
that don't speak English and they understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   The multi-sensory aspect, explains Crosby, makes more sense in
the concert context. (VAST, Crosby plus three other musicians, will
play Axis March 24.) ``I am trying to make the show as compelling
as possible,'' he says, ``and I am very into multimedia and would
love to see this become one day something like a `Zooropa' or Pink
Floyd kind of stadium thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby has used music as therapy; he hopes his own music can
work that way for others. ``Music can be a lot more than a
moneymaking machine,'' he says. ``It can really help people; it has
really helped me. . . . I used to have this bad-luck hair and a
nose ring and get drunk all the time and be a goof-off. When you
have a surge of bad times . . . I know with Metallica, I used to
listen to their records over and over again. It was not just a song
on the radio or a record I liked _ it was something that meant
something to me.''

HOUSTON CLIMATE SPEEDS COMPOSTING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am a newcomer to the Houston area. Can you give me advice
on composting in this climate?
</P>
<P>
   A: You will find that organic matter may break down more quickly
here due to the warmer climate. And because we have such a long
growing season, you'll find you have plenty of nitrogen (grass
clippings) and, in the fall, carbon (leaves) to use.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy a large, manufactured container, but our home
compost bin is a simple construction of stacked landscape timbers
that allow good air circulation. First, we laid two timbers _
parallel and about 3 feet apart _ to form the front and back of the
bin. Then we placed timbers at the ends of these to form the ends
of the bin. Then we added two more front and back, then on top of
these, two for the ends. We continued this stacking process until
the bin was about knee- or thigh-high.
</P>
<P>
   The more diverse the ingredients in a compost pile, the more
nutritionally balanced the finished compost product. Healthy soil
means healthy plants that are more resistant to insects and
diseases. Rich, crumbly compost loosens packed, soggy soils
(typical in this area) and improves aeration and drainage. Plant
roots are then better able to spread and breathe. Earthworms,
frequent inhabitants of compost, further aid in aeration as they
tunnel through the soil. Their castings also boost fertility.
</P>
<P>
   Compost tightens loose soils and improves their ability to hold
moisture. Nutrients become more readily available for plants,
rather than being washed away.
</P>
<P>
   And compost is simple to make. Look around your garden for a
convenient location. You'll want an area at least 4 feet in
diameter and, ideally, near a water spigot. A pile too small may
lose essential heat too easily. One too wide or tall may have
aeration problems. You can build or buy a bin or go without one.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one compost recipe:
</P>
<P>
   Start with a 4- to 6-inch layer of coarse plant material such as
small twigs, vegetable scraps or stalks _ this aids in aeration and
drainage. Moisten. Add a 1-inch layer of soil. The soil contains
microorganisms that help break down organic matter. Moisten this
layer and all those that follow. Add a layer of plant refuse _
shredded leaves and kitchen scraps (no meat or bones). Add a layer
of soil. If possible, add a layer of nitrogen-rich organic matter
such as manure or fresh, untreated grass clippings. Don't put on
overly thick layers or they will mat and prevent aeration.
</P>
<P>
   Continue this layering. Make a bowl in the center and add water.
If a pile becomes too soggy, air flow will be blocked, and a
not-so-pleasant odor may develop. The material in the center will
build up heat to 160 degrees as it decomposes. If the temperature
is high enough, it will eliminate any diseases in the compost pile.
You can speed the decaying process by occasionally turning the pile
inside out, shifting the undecayed material to the center. If you
turn the pile once a month, the compost should be ready for use in
about three months. Turn it weekly, and you'll have finished
compost earlier.
</P>
<P>
   If you discover your pile is not generating enough heat to
decompose quickly enough, add more nitrogen. Manure (sheep, cow,
horse or chicken) is the surest form of nitrogen. Never use dog,
cat or human feces. Fresh grass clippings, coffee grounds and blood
meal are other forms of nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Finished compost resembles black, rich, friable soil. Work it
into new beds or use it as mulch in established areas. You can use
it, too, in containers.
</P>
<P>
   Below are materials to use and others to avoid in the compost
pile. And remember: Unless completely composted, weeds will
re-sprout in the garden. Think twice, too, about using diseased
crops in the compost pile _ it takes a hot pile to ensure thermal
kill of disease organisms.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Materials to use in the compost pile: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Kitchen wastes such as coffee grounds, fruit and vegetable
scraps, and eggshells.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yard wastes such as grass clippings, leaves, clippings from
pruned perennials, old mulch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shredded newspapers _ without colored ink.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sawdust (don't layer it too thick), shavings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wood ashes _ again, not too thick a layer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Farm-animal manure.
</P>
<P>
   _ Discarded flower bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fallen fruit that isn't diseased.

GRISHAM'S LATEST LEGAL THRILLER ADDS PLOT LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE TESTAMENT 
By John Grisham 
Doubleday, 435 pp., $27.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Grisham has gotten himself a shave since his last author
photograph. Well, he can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Testament'' is Grisham's 10th novel in a decade, and
probably the most ambitious of the series because he has dared to
vary the formula. His earlier novels were monothematic; their
success arises from their claustrophobic singlemindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Testament'' is pluralistic. Grisham is no fool, so one of
the plot lines remains a legal thriller. The testament in question
is the will of Troy Phelan, who estimates his own fortune at $11
billion. Phelan is so eccentric he makes Howard Hughes look like
L'il Abner. Now terminally ill, Phelan has chosen to bail out in
spectacular fashion, but before he does, he makes a new will,
insisting that three psychiatrists chosen by his three ex-wives and
their children examine his soundness of mind in front of video
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The last will and testament of Troy Phelan is not to the liking
of his highly dysfunctional family, which hires a phalanx of
lawyers, most of them crooked, to contest it. This is the substance
of the legal thriller: Will they get away with it? Will Troy
Phelan? Grisham writes with insider knowledge, an expert
appreciation of the elegant legal gambit, and real relish at the
unexpected things that can come out when smart, principled lawyers
who've done their homework ask dishonest witnesses the right
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham lets himself have a little more fun than usual this
time. Phelan's family is certainly grotesque. One son is married to
an ex-stripper named Amber ``without a brain but with a large fake
chest,'' as Phelan observes. The youngest son, Ramble, ``is now
fourteen, and already has one arrest for shoplifting and one arrest
for possession of marijuana. His oily hair sticks to his neck and
falls way down his back, and he adorns himself with rings in his
ears, eyebrows, and nose.'' On a video monitor, Phelan observes
Ramble ``licking his sticky green hair, scowling at his mother, who
had the gall to appear here today with a hairy little gigolo.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers aren't much better. ``Hemba and Hamilton were
big-firm lawyers, unaccustomed to the dirt and grime from the
streets. Not that they or their ilk were beyond corruption, but
their clients were rich corporations that used lobbyists for legal
bribery to land fat government contracts and hide money in Swiss
accounts for foreign despots, all with the help of their trusty
lawyers.'' Even the judge, before an important hearing, sequesters
hismelf in his chambers where, ``Alone, with his door locked, he
spent 15 minutes ironing his robe.''
</P>
<P>
   A second line of the plot concerns Phelan's own lawyer and the
need to search for the heir, Rachel Lane, an illegitimate daughter
no one knew about who is now a missionary working with an Indian
tribe beyond the reach of communication, near the Brazil-Bolivia
border. The search is entrusted to another lawyer, Nate O'Riley,
sprung from rehab for the job.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of ``The Testament'' is Indiana Jones-style
action-adventure in Brazil _ a form that represents new territory
for Grisham. Whether O'Riley finds Rachel Lane is a question you'll
have to read ``The Testament'' to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Grisham did his homework _ he went to the Pantanal region twice,
he writes in an afterword _ but he hasn't mastered the formulas
yet. There are plane crashes and boat overturnings, rains lashing
floodtide waters while alligator jaws snap in the background, but
the background is touristy and much of the excitement is
mechanical. Delay is not the same thing as suspense.
</P>
<P>
   A Grisham wouldn't be a Grisham without a soapbox, a cause to
preach. This time he wants to draw attention to the plight of the
Indian tribes of Brazil _ a worthy objective, and an issue less
commonly explored in popular culture than such previous Grisham
choices as child abuse, capital punishment, and the plight of the
homeless. He's not very good at making the sermon dramatic,
however. Electronic background files have been downloaded for
O'Riley; he reads them, and shares them with us.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's final subject is the spiritual awakening of Nate
O'Riley, whose alcoholism is treated with more immediate and
convincing detail than the lives of the Ipica tribe of Brazil.
Grisham observes that O'Riley had spent four months ``enjoying the
great lettuces of the world'' in rehab. The trip to Brazil is not a
voyage into the heart of darkness, exactly, but it does become a
kind of spiritual journey, which O'Riley continues under the kindly
guidance of a Maryland rector named Phil Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery is a trickier subject for popular fiction than
bottoming out. One admires Grisham for making the effort, but the
results have a pasty sentimentality about them. Nate joins Phil in
wallboarding the church basement; then they go for a coffee break
so Phil can become his guide. `` `Here's a wonderful daily
devotional guide, one of my favorites,' he said, gently removing
the book, wiping it as if it were covered in dust, then handing it
to Nate. It was a hardback with the dust jacket intact. Phil was
particular about his books.''
</P>
<P>
   Resurrections belong to Tolstoy, and no one is going to read
``The Testament'' for its account of a spiritual rewakening.
Grisham has lit out for new territory, which he may one day make
his own; right now we still cherish him as a connoisseur of the
comeuppance.

PAPERS THAT TOLD AND MADE BLACK HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE BLACK PRESS: SOLIDIERS WITHOUT SWORDS 
On: PBS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began in New York in 1827 when several young black men
started Freedom's Journal as a counterweight to the overtly racist
images in the popular press. It ended in the 1960s, when race riots
sent the mainstream media scurrying to hire black reporters who
understood what was happening on the street.
</P>
<P>
   But for almost 150 years, the black press _ born out of
desperation, forged in virulent racism, and targeted by everyone
from angry southerners to J. Edgar Hoover _ was more than a
lifeline for the black community. It was a catalyst for such great
social movements as the World War I-era northern migration and the
post-World War II civil rights battle.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on a largely hidden slice of America's journalistic
history, ``The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords'' skillfully
weaves together the towering figures of the black newspaper world
with the sweeping social upheaval of their times. The 90-minute
documentary, combining archival footage with interviews of black
journalists, just captured the Freedom of Expression Award in the
documentary competition at the Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't exist in the other papers . . . we were truly
invisible unless we committed a crime,'' veteran journalist Vernon
Jarrett explains at the outset of the program. ``But in the black
press, the negro press, we did get married. They showed us our
babies being born.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers Without Swords'' tells its story through its heroes.
Georgia native Robert Abbott, the son of former slaves, established
the Chicago Defender, which became the largest black paper in the
country. Shipped into the South, it became a rallying point with
its unflinching coverage of early 1900s race killings (``Lynch
Three in Texas'' was a typical headline) and its exhortations for
blacks to defy their enemies. ``When the mob comes and you must
die,'' the paper once chillingly counseled, ``take at least one
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotta Bass, who ran the California Eagle for 40 years, was
one of the great progressive voices on social issues, a career that
made her a target during the ``Red Menace'' days. In 1952, as the
Progressive Party candidate for vice president, she became the
first black woman to run for national office.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-nosed entrepreneur Robert Vann not only turned the
Pittsburgh Courier _ which at one point had 15 columnists opining
for it _ into the most powerful black paper in the country, he was
responsible for bringing black voters into the Democratic Party in
droves.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, the Courier helped popularize the ``Double
V'' campaign that called for victory over America's enemies abroad
and victory over racism at home. That suggestion of unrest and
discontent was enough for FBI director Hoover to brand the black
papers as instruments of sedition. It was only when John
Sengstacke, then publisher of the Chicago Defender, faced down
Attorney General Francis Biddle that the black papers avoided
persecution and prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``Soldiers Without Swords'' explains how the racial
upheaval of the '60s doomed the black press as white editors began
recognizing the need for black reporters _ triggering a devastating
``brain drain.'' In a poignant segment, the old-time black
journalists ruefully explain how they defected to the mainstream
media for money and security. ``The black press today seems to
react only,'' notes one observer sadly.
</P>
<P>
   But the real point of ``Soldiers Without Swords'' is that
throughout most of its proud history, that press was much more a
leader than a follower.

PASSENGERS SEND MESSAGE TO DELTA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Score one for the traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that ``the market has spoken,'' Delta Air Lines
rescinded the $1-per-segment surcharge it was assessing consumers
who purchased tickets through any means other than its Internet
site.
</P>
<P>
   Readers certainly spoke to me following a recent column about
the subject. And some comments are pertinent not only to Delta's
short-lived policy but to difficulties many online companies are
experiencing in ``jump-starting'' their travel booking services.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Day asked, ``How many people over 50 have computers in
their homes? How many of those who live in rural communities have
computers? What about those in low to median income levels?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think heads of large companies, where computers are an
everyday item, are losing touch with the average American who is
their customer. A large percentage of Americans are still computer
illiterate or simply don't have access to a computer for personal
use. However, that doesn't mean they don't fly _ to see relatives,
take vacations, send their kids to college, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Reader Joan Barbara Lupuloff touched on another factor: ``What
about travelers with no credit cards who routinely must pay cash at
a travel agency or airline ticket office? Does this not smack of
discrimination? Or do the airlines now want to pick and choose
their customers?''
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by complaints from travelers, travel agents,
independent online firms and some lawmakers _ and no doubt
concerned that other airlines' hesitance to follow its lead created
a competitive pricing disadvantage _ Delta obviously got the
message. We can still anticipate concerted efforts by all airlines
to lure us onto their Web sites, but the incentives likely will
take different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   If Delta had simply offered a $1-per-segment discount for
purchases on its Web site, I doubt we'd have seen a similar outcry.
What foiled this particular strategy in part was that even if
unintentional, it came across as a ``punishment'' to those who
don't make purchases via the Internet as opposed to a ``reward''
for those who do.
</P>
<P>
   Still, fair or not, those who don't possess _ or use _ a
computer are missing out on some genuine bargains offered only
online. It's just another sign of changing times.
</P>
<P>
   Also, take note that within days of rescinding the surcharge,
Delta and most other large carriers announced 2 percent to 4
percent increases on all standard domestic fares, no matter where
we purchase tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Readers were enthusiastic, too, in their response to a recent
column about unexpected gems we discover during our travels.
</P>
<P>
   Houstonian Pamela Bulla, in describing the Blue Ridge Parkway in
North Carolina as a ``drive to be savored for a lifetime,'' wrote
to recommend ``a magical place halfway between Boone and Asheville,
a quaint village known as Little Switzerland ... snuggled between
extreme dropoff mountain peaks that truly reminds one of a Swiss
snow village in the winter and a European getaway in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are Swiss chalets along the roadside and a wonderful
Swiss-Alpine restaurant located within the heart of the village
that serves delightful sandwiches and salads and sells assorted
homemade jams and jellies ... blackberry being made fresh off the
vines surrounding the mountain inn.''
</P>
<P>
   Her letter reminded me of an enjoyable afternoon I spent in New
Glarus, Wis., also known as ``Little Switzerland,'' where homes and
businesses are designed to resemble an Alpine village and
restaurants serve Swiss food and wine. Folks there haven't figured
a way, however, to import mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Reader Jean Anderson felt a close connection to my fascination
with the century-old Wolf Creek Tavern, a former stagecoach stop in
southern Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised about 15 miles north of Wolf Creek in
Canyonville,'' wrote Anderson. ``I wish you could have stopped at
Mexia's Pie Shop, just north of town. Mexia came from Texas,
married a local man and for years ran this pie shop. He propagated
blackberries in a field near their place, and her blackberry pies
cooked on a wood stove were to die for.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember efforts last fall to entice Congress to
require airlines to establish ``peanut-free zones'' in deference to
travelers with peanut allergies? A column on that subject drew
mixed reaction; indeed, a couple of readers took me to the woodshed
for what they deemed my insensitivity to their allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress chose not to take action, but Travel Holiday magazine's
February issue reports that three airlines _ Southwest, Northwest
and US Airways _ will now remove all peanuts from a plane if a
sincere request is made in advance. The bad news, according to the
magazine: Peanut ``residue'' can remain in stale airplane air for
up to 5,000 flying hours.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for staying in touch.

DAY TRADERS ANONYMOUS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It is nearly five years since he left Boston for New York. He
comes back frequently enough, as chairman of the Boston College
board of trustees. But Richard F. Syron has a different set of
worries today than when he was president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman and chief executive of the American Stock Exchange
(which last year teamed up with the National Association of
Securities Dealers to better compete with the New York Stock
Exchange) Syron now concentrates on maintaining the competitive
edge of his markets for common stocks, index shares, and
derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. In a lecture Monday at Bentley College,
Syron noted the emergence of a new threat _ a potent source of
private sorrow, not systemic risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real risk for some people of day trading becoming
an addiction,'' he said. ``It sounds kind of funny to think that a
Day Traders Anonymous might spring up to help people break the
habit, but it may come to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading is in the news. The Doonesbury comic strip has been
offering a seminar of sorts in how the new Web-based technology
permits anyone with a personal computer, modem, and a few thousand
dollars in the bank to bet their hunches about where particular
stocks _ or the market in general _ are headed.
</P>
<P>
   Darting digitally into the market to buy at one moment, selling
out 15 minutes _ or 15 seconds _ later, day traders take advantage
of electronic brokers who charge very low commissions to execute
the trades.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of braggadocio _ the California boys who make $60,000 or
so daily before heading out to surf and lunch _ compete on the
rumor bourse with tales of woe. Most recently there was the
Virginia dentist who hit the wrong key on his computer and lost not
only the $10,000 that he had allocated to his day trading account
but another $40,000 as well.
</P>
<P>
   Said Syron: ``It isn't much different than if you were sitting
there watching the New England Patriots play football, and suddenly
you wanted to make a bet that on the next play Bledsoe was going to
go down and deep, or off tackle, or double down, or do something
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not something we want to encourage in sports, I think.
So how do we begin to think about it in markets?''
</P>
<P>
   No Boston-born regulator in recent years has captured the
imagination more successfully than Syron, a Boston College graduate
and Tufts University-trained economist. From his days as a personal
assistant to Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, in the early
stages of the campaign against double-digit inflation in the late
1970s, he drew a succession of demanding assignments.
</P>
<P>
   He served at the Treasury Department as an architect of the
insurance contraption that brought the savings and loan crisis to
an end; as the president of the Boston Fed when the credit crunch
hit New England in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated again that his tough-guy Democrat views hadn't
changed much over the years. Last autumn during the gubernatorial
campaign he praised Acting Governor Paul Cellucci as a ``steady
hand'' on the Massachusetts economy.
</P>
<P>
   And at Bentley Monday, Syron was openly skeptical of the plan
proposed last month by President Clinton to invest up to $70
billion of Social Security funds in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's just having grown up in Massachusetts, and having
seen how the state pension funds were invested 20 years ago. Some
improvements could have been made in the way that was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, it's going to be just too, too tempting to
the body politic to direct that investment in a certain way. The
genius of the Federal Reserve System was to insulate monetary
policy from politics. I'm not sure you could do that with equities.
I'm not sure I see the value of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the crowd of accounting and finance students who
attended his talk, Syron recalled cutting through the Bentley
campus as the youthful possessor of a driving license and a 1953
Buick. ``I lived in Watertown. It was the shortcut to Wal-Lex
(Recreation Center),'' the old-fashioned roller rink and bowling
alley that has been a durable magnet to near-west-suburban youth
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   All of which goes to show that you can take the regulator out of
Massachusetts _ but you can't take the Massachusetts out of the
regulator.

VEHICLES ILLEGALLY TAKEN SOUTH OF THE BORDER RARELY RETURN TO U.S. 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EDWARD HEGSTROM 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO, Guatemala _ It all began in Houston one spring
day in 1996, when Fred Sandberg called police to report that his
new Dodge Ram pickup had been stolen from a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two months, several thousand miles and two or three
``owners'' later, that truck sits in a muddy police impoundment lot
in the jungle of northern Guatemala, waiting to be reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   The man found driving the truck in Guatemala still works as this
town's public treasurer. He has never been charged with possession
of stolen property. And, through a twist of Guatemalan law, he
might even get the stolen truck back.
</P>
<P>
   How Sandberg's truck went from a Houston parking lot to a small
Guatemalan town is a long tale filled with intrigue and false
documents. But the basic story line is one that police in Houston
and other U.S. cities have heard far too often of late.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the downside of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of world markets and rapid communication, authorities
say, criminals have increasingly learned to cross borders, creating
a $6 billion international market in stolen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling cars and trucks out of the United States is
surprisingly easy, experts say. And once the vehicles arrive in a
poor country rife with corruption and lax regulations, they can
usually be registered with false papers and driven with little fear
of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Though by no means new, the export of stolen automobiles appears
to be on the rise. As many as four out of every 10 vehicles stolen
in the United States and never recovered have been shipped outside
the country, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, with its large port and easy highway access to the
Mexican border, serves as an important trading post for stolen
vehicles destined for illegal export, says Sgt. T.J. Salazar, with
the Houston Police Department's auto theft division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very big theft ring,'' he says of the network of gangs
that steal vehicles in the United States, ``and it goes right
through Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Many stolen vehicles are turned over to Central American
criminals for export, Salazar and others say. Guatemala and other
Central American countries seem to be preferred destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Often, experts say, thieves with false documents simply drive
the vehicles across the U.S. border. Sometimes, they load them onto
ships and send them south.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the exported vehicles aren't stolen at all. According to
insurance experts, U.S. owners occasionally sell vehicles to
Central American criminals under the table, then report them as
stolen to collect insurance money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that a number of these cars are insurance fraud, but
we don't have good statistics,'' said Don Dobson, head of the
National Insurance Crime Bureau's international division, based in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Working on the theory that cross-border crime can only be
stopped through international cooperation, police in Houston and
other U.S. cities have begun collaborating with law enforcement
agencies south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar recently returned from a six-month visit to Guatemala,
where he helped authorities locate nearly 800 stolen vehicles _
including Sandberg's truck. &UR;  &LR; Federal authorities also have stepped
in, providing training for Central American police in an effort to
halt cross-border smuggling of vehicles. The training program has
become a highly touted part of the U.S. State Department's war on
organized international crime.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials in Washington and Central America,
however, U.S. insurance companies often have proved reluctant to
recover the stolen vehicles once they have been impounded by
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We train these guys to take these cars away, and then nothing
happens,`` said one State Department official who refused to be
named. ``The problem is with the insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel Barahona, head of the auto theft section of the Guatemala
National Civil Police, said that an abundant supply of stolen cars
and trucks sits in police impoundment lots across his country. Some
of the vehicles are top quality, he said, arguing that it would be
worth the effort of insurance companies to recover them. ``But they
don't do it,'' he said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Dobson, the insurance official, acknowledged that reclaiming
stolen vehicles from abroad is costly. The average value of cars
recovered from Latin America is about $9,000, he said. Between the
time the vehicles are stolen and reclaimed, their market worth
usually has plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   In a later conversation, however, Dobson denied allegations that
insurance carriers have failed to work hard enough to recover
stolen vehicles taken outside the United States. ``That is
categorically incorrect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere is the problem of smuggled vehicles worse than
in Guatemala. Under the control of a military dictatorship for
decades, the country became known as a haven for stolen cars. Many
top military leaders drove vehicles stolen in the United States,
and some still do, according to Guatemalan police.
</P>
<P>
   But the country has undergone a slow transformation toward
democracy and rule of law in recent years. Police corruption has
declined, and detectives have started cracking down on auto
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   In one major 1997 bust, police shut down Guatemala City's
largest used car lot after discovering more than 300 stolen
vehicles. The lot's owner now awaits trial for his alleged role in
an international auto-theft ring.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Salazar, Guatemalan police began a major stolen-car
recovery operation last year. Detectives set up roadblocks in
various parts of the country, confiscating as many as 10 or 15
stolen vehicles per day per roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those cars and trucks, which now collect soot on police
impoundment lots, eventually will be given back to the people
caught driving them. Under Guatemala's legal system, an impounded
stolen vehicle must be returned to the person from whom it was
taken if the legal owner does not claim it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Fred Sandberg's pickup _ a gray 1996 Dodge
Ram 2500 extended cab with a diesel engine and four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Though vital parts of the truck's history are missing, nearly a
dozen interviews and an extensive search of Guatemalan computer
records and court files offer a general picture of how the truck
got here from Houston. The pickup's story shows how easy it is to
register a stolen vehicle in Guatemala and how nearly helpless
police are to stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
   On June 13, 1996, four months after buying the truck, Sandberg
drove it from his Santa Fe, Texas, home to meet a friend for lunch
at a hotel in west Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back from lunch an hour later, and it was gone,''
recalls Sandberg, who promptly notified hotel security and then
reported the theft to Houston police. Sandberg collected the
insurance money but says he lost about $7,000 or $8,000 on the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan customs records indicate the truck entered this
country July 22.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the anomalies begin. Import records show that the
truck entered Guatemala from El Salvador, which lies south of
Guatemala. No one can explain how a truck from Texas got to El
Salvador first. El Salvador has no Atlantic port, so shipping the
car from Houston would prove problematic.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan police say they believe the car was driven to Central
America and the customs paperwork falsified to show the port of
entry as El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other paperwork was also doctored. The title
presented to Guatemalan customs officials did not name Sandberg as
the owner. Instead, it listed another man and gave an address on
``Karson St., USA TX.'' The omission of a city name in the address
did not catch the attention of Guatemalan customs inspectors, many
of whom do not speak English. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The vehicle identification number given for the truck was
correct, however. Had customs officials run a check on the number,
they would have learned that the vehicle had been reported stolen
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The official paperwork shows the truck was brought to Guatemala
by Manuel Romero Veliz, who declared it worth $31,000 and paid
$6,500 in import taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Romero, a cattle farmer on the southern coast of Guatemala,
declined to be interviewed for this story. But his attorney said
that Romero bought the truck from another man, who drove it from
the United States. The attorney refused to name the man who
imported the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   After keeping the truck for about 1 1/2 years, Romero sold it to
Walter Montejo, the treasurer of the town of San Francisco. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``He (Romero) assured me it wasn't stolen,'' Montejo said,
adding that he paid Romero about $25,000 for the truck. Police note
that Montejo makes less than $200 per month at his job as San
Francisco's treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, police based in Guatemala City who were working with
Salazar drove to the northern part of the country to search for
stolen vehicles. They pulled over Montejo driving a Mitsubishi
pickup, which, they said, turned out to be stolen. A few days
later, police went to Montejo's house, where they reported finding
two other stolen vehicles _ a Suzuki Sidekick and Sandberg's Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained Montejo, but the case against him quickly
disintegrated. Citing lack of evidence, local prosecutors declined
to bring charges, and he was released.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Sandberg learned that his stolen Dodge Ram had
turned up in Guatemala. By then, he had long since been paid off by
his insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a letter from some outfit in California that supposedly
was going to help me recover it,'' Sandberg said. ``But it wasn't
mine to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he passed the information on to his insurance company.
According to Guatemalan court officials, no insurance
representative from the United States has so far expressed interest
in recovering the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   If no one from the United States recovers the truck within the
next few months, both Montejo and Romero have the right under
Guatemalan law to file claims for it. Romero is still listed as the
``owner'' in Guatemala, because the title transfer had not been
completed when police confiscated the truck from Montejo. Romero,
therefore, stands a better chance of getting it.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of seeing either man drive away in the Dodge Ram is
not a pleasant one for the Guatemalan police who confiscated the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out there impounding and impounding and impounding, but
then no one ever comes down to reclaim these cars,'' said one
Guatemalan officer. ``It hurts our confidence.''

THE NEXT STOP: INTERPLANETARY-NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why are high-tech bigwigs so afraid of Joe Firmage?
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't heard of Firmage _ that is, if you've been
lounging on the planet Damogran and missed the coverage on CNN,
``Hard Copy,'' and in newspapers across the country _ he's the
Silicon Valley whiz kid who propounds the belief that
extraterrestrials are behind many major high-tech advances. His
views, outlined in a 600-page manifesto called ``The Truth'' on his
Web site (www.thewordistruth.org), hold that space aliens have
repeatedly popped in on Earth over the last several thousand years
to help guide us toward technological advancement.
</P>
<P>
   What worries high-tech executives is that Firmage is one of
them, and that his most dramatic pronouncement is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant 28-year-old launched his first company at age 18
and sold it to Novell in 1993 for $24 million. He served as a
Novell vice president until 1995, when he cofounded USWeb, an
Internet consulting firm, now valued at about $2 billion. When his
unconventional notions began circulating widely last year,
executives of his own company got nervous. In January, Frimage
stepped down as USWeb's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech luminaries are quick to call Firmage a quack.
``It's a joke,'' Narinder Kapany, the reputed inventor of fiber
optics, told the San Francisco Chronicle. ``If not, then I must be
an alien.''
</P>
<P>
   John McLaughlin, coauthor of ``The Making of Silicon Valley: A
One Hundred Year Renaissance,'' voiced a similar theme in the
Chronicle: ``I've met a bunch of the valley's pioneers, and none of
them I know are aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the spin begins _ even before Firmage's earthshaking
revelation. I have it on unimpeachable authority that Firmage will
soon confess that in fact he himself is one of the space aliens who
has repeatedly visited Earth with gifts of technological prowess.
But far more shocking is that Firmage intends to start outing his
alien colleagues, and the names form the A-list of technology's
wunderkind.
</P>
<P>
   But should we be surprised? The evidence has long been there,
only we mortals failed to see it. Just think of the other-worldly
corporate offices that high-tech companies pioneered. Didn't we
miss the obvious sign of alien overcompensation in the creation of
the humane work environment?
</P>
<P>
   Despite all their efforts to attain a certain earthliness, isn't
there a kind of trespasser's aloofness to high-tech executives?
Have you ever looked into the eyes of Steve Case of America Online?
What's more, doesn't Case and many of his high-tech friends and
enemies have a bizarre martian-like knack for creating money for
themselves out of thin air?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs, who has that impenetrable nonhuman veneer, is also
on the list. Where else would he get the idea of marketing iMacs in
colors of yummy flavors except from his home in some distant
galaxy? Of course, it's there that creatures have progressed from
using computers to eating them.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the presence of extraterrestrial influence more
pronounced than in the performance of Internet stocks. How silly
that we didn't realize sooner that the run-up has been beyond all
human proportions. Simple arithmetic reveals that there isn't
enough cash on Earth to propel these stocks to their phenomenal
highs. The force behind the bubble can only be interstellar
investment clubs, a cosmic network of the friends and family of the
Internet company executives. When our puny global crash comes, do
you think any of them will care?

<P>
   Inspiring St. Louis
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II's visit to St. Louis may inspire travelers to
see the city's many religious sites. The Cathedral Basilica of
Saint Louis has the largest collection of mosaic art in the world.
Pope John Paul VI called the church ``the outstanding cathedral of
the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   On the lower level of the cathedral, the Mosaic Museum traces
the construction of the facility and the art and installation of
the tiles. Just outside St. Louis in Belleville, Ill., is America's
largest outdoor shrine, the National Shrine of Our Lady of the
Snows. The shrine, founded in 1958, welcomes people of all faiths
and is the site of special events and daily Masses.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Gateway Arch is the Basilica of St. Louis the King,
known best as the Old Cathedral. Shortly after St. Louis was
founded by French fur traders in 1764, one of the first buildings
constructed was a church. The Old Cathedral was built in 1834 on
that site and contains a museum with items from the city's early
history.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first museum of interfaith contemporary art is found
on the campus of Saint Louis University.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Contemporary Religious Art is located in a chapel
formerly used by priests who studied philosophy at the Jesuit
university.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of the Holy Family is celebrating its 300th
anniversary this year. The current church dates from 1799 and is
built in a typical French Colonial vertical log style.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Western Jesuit Missions, in the former St.
Stanislaus Seminary, tells the story of Jesuit missionaries who
settled along the Mississippi River and contains four centuries of
gold and silver church vessels, Navajo sand paintings, and other
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The Shrine of St. Joseph in the downtown area is noted as the
site of a miracle that saved the life of a dying man. The Black
Madonna Shrine, built by a single Franciscan brother, has been
described as a ``galaxy of magnificent multicolored rock grottos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shrine of St. Rose Philippine Duchesne, dedicated to the
fourth American saint, contains artifacts of her missionary work
with the Indians, and her remains.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on these sites or St. Louis, call
314-916-0040 or visit www.explorestlouis.com

<P>
   Because of a reporting error, the date of the launch of the
Queen Elizabeth 2 was incorrect in a recent cruise article. The QE2
was built in 1969 and refurbished in 1996.

ARENA'S STAMP ON US WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US national team was inspired, organized, and clearly
deserving of its 3-0 victory over Germany in Jacksonville Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This must be recorded among the most significant victories in US
history, also because it was accomplished smoothly, without the
help of acrobatic goalkeeping or other flukes _ though the Germans
were completely out of character, uninspired, purposeless.
</P>
<P>
   Have things changed so much since June, when Germany embarrassed
the United States, 2-0, at Parc des Princes?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. There has been a significant change in the direction
of the US team, symbolized by coach Bruce Arena. Germany is still a
world power, and should regain some of its form in its exhibition
against Colombia in Miami Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arena has demonstrated an ability to succeed that few US soccer
coaches can match. His obvious strengths are as a motivator,
organizer, and strategist. But he is also displaying an equally
important, intangible asset _ the ability to win.
</P>
<P>
   Arena's D.C. United teams captured the first two MLS Cup
championships, and also fared well against outside competition. He
is an outspoken, uncompromising battler off the field, and has
publicly offended both US Soccer Federation and MLS officials, but
his players display calmness and certitude on the field, perhaps
because they know they have his support.
</P>
<P>
   Though the USSF and MLS heads would have preferred Arena to be
either tacit or tactful, they could not accuse him of dishonesty,
disingenuousness, or inaccuracy.
</P>
<P>
   In sports, and especially in soccer, momentum can turn very
quickly. And Arena has been able to anticipate events, mainly
because he insists on operating on his own terms. He has placed his
stamp on the national team already: It will be confident in
defense, and it will attack. Sometimes this will backfire. But he
will be true to his beliefs, and a decent style of play _ a
combination of pragmatism and offensive spectacle _ should emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The most graphic signs of Arena's success were his decisions to
use players such as Robin Fraser, Jovan Kirovsky, and Tony Meola.
Fraser marshaled the defense at sweeper, Meola returned to the team
after a four-ayear absence, and Kirovsky converted one of the most
spectacular goals ever by a native-born US player.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this game was as shocking as the US's 1-0 victory
over Brazil in the CONCACAF Gold Cup last February. Then, the
difference was solo efforts by Kasey Keller in goal and Preki, who
scored on a brilliant 20-yard blast that took the Brazilians by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Kirovsky's goal Saturday gave the US an early lead, and was less
the result of poor defending than of his accuracy and confidence.
The power of Kirovsky's shot was impressive, but his quickness in
wrong-footing the defense and goalkeeper Oliver Kahn were
world-class. And that is precisely what it takes to defeat the
Brazils and Germanys.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielders such as Chris Armas can complete important though
unglamorous tasks. But without the individual offensive brilliance
of the Kirovskys and Prekis, the US will not capture imaginations,
and the game will not rise above the pedestrian level. So far,
Arena has been able to both encourage the worker mentality and
nurture the creative types.
</P>
<P>
   Now the US is in danger of raising expectations unrealistically.
The Chileans, who will visit Fort Lauderdale Feb. 21, will likely
be better prepared than the Germans were. But Chile, like Germany,
will be missing some of its key figures.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's level has dropped recently, though it is difficult to
believe comments by former coach Berti Vogts and his successor,
Erich Ribbeck, that no top-level players are being produced in a
country of 80 million. Germany was exposed badly by Mexico at
France '98 and will have to modify its style.

<P>
   The Boston Bulldogs chose New Zealand international midfielder
Simon Elliot in the A League draft. Elliot played at Stanford for
ex-Scotland goalkeeper Bobby Clark, former coach of New Zealand's
national team. The Bulldogs, who open the season at Jacksonville
April 16, also selected midfielder Sam Franklin from the University
of Virginia and Keith MacDonald, 21, of Boston College . . . The US
will meet Group A's No. 2 team at 7 p.m. June 27 at Foxboro Stadium
in its final first-round game of the Women's World Cup. The US will
also play in the opening match June 19 at Giants Stadium, and June
24 at Soldier Field in Chicago. The full schedule will be
determined at halftime of the US-vs.-FIFA World All-Stars game in
San Jose Sunday.

WILDFIRE HOPES VOICE-MAIL SOFTWARE TAKES HOLD IN BRITAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Take a message, luv?
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated voice-mail software made by Wildfire
Communications Inc. hasn't drawn more than a few thousand customers
in the United States. So the Lexington, Mass. company is taking its
product across the Atlantic in the hope that British mobile-phone
users will rave about its ability to understand speech.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to sign up 250,000 customers to use Wildfire's
services by the end of the year, through its partnership with
London-based wireless phone provider Orange PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing in a quarter-million British customers would give
Wildfire one of the largest early deployments of speech-recognition
technology to date. So far, these systems have made only limited
public appearances in airline reservations systems and in directory
assistance services.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire's chances for success now depend on how well the
company has programmed its software to speak and to understand the
queen's English.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's acceptance of this is a social issue,'' say Rich
Miner, Wildfire's chief technical officer. ``It's almost as if you
were moving a play from one country to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Yankee Group telecommunications analyst Mark Lowenstein,
consumers in every country ``have a very limited tolerance for
machine-like speech.'' Before they accept voice recognition, he
said, ``It has to sound natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire's software allows telephone customers to use voice
commands to dial calls, send faxes, or listen to messages. The
program also serves as an electronic assistant, forwarding calls
and keeping lists of frequently called numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire needs deals with telecommunications providers like
Orange to popularize its program. Orange, for its part, hopes
Wildfire's features will make its mobile-phone services more
appealing to consumers, who might increase their total airtime and
their bills as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance took an important step Monday when Orange began
testing Wildfire's voice-mail services with 5,000 customers,
selected to provide a sampling of accents from Fleet Street to
Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   Their reactions will help polish British Wildfire for general
deployment later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is to detect all the different regional
accents,'' says Wildfire's Miner. ``There's everything from formal
English, what's called BBC English, to accents from the north and
the south.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire engineers installed an Anglo vocabulary, including
instructions for callers to hit the ``hash'' key rather than what
is known here as the ``pound'' key. The program also refers to the
``in-tray'' rather than the ``in-box.''
</P>
<P>
   Programmers also used the voice of an actress who speaks
informally. According to Wildfire's casting-call material, the
voice is that of a woman around 30 years old whose accent is
``Middle English. Definitely not BBC English or upper class,'' with
no regional accent. ``It's a voice that we've exhaustively tested .
. . so nobody will mind it,'' says Orange spokesman John Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange alliance represents a strategic retrenchment for
closely held Wildfire, whose software hasn't become as popular as
some had expected when it was introduced in 1994. Then, Wildfire
planned to market its service to large businesses and through
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   But costing between $150 to $200 a month, the software never
gained more than a niche following. Competitors like
California-based General Magic have also struggled, though that
company just announced an alliance with software giant Microsoft
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   To broaden its appeal, last summer Wildfire began negotiating
deals with phone companies directly. In September, it signed a
licensing agreement with Canadian telecommunications provider BEC
Mobile Communications Inc., parent of Toronto-based cell phone
company Bell Mobility. In December, Wildfire also announced an
agreement with Pacific Bell Wireless, a unit of SBC Communications
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Under those agreements about 5,000 people use Wildfire today.
The company's president and chief executive, Dan Hoy, says Wildfire
hopes its agreements with Orange will increase its customer base by
hundreds of thousands _ and triple company revenue by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire doesn't disclose its current revenue or say whether it
is profitable. But the firm's software has drawn investments from
Intel Corp. and Microsoft, among others. Hoy says he expects the
firm will grow to 140 employees within nine months from 70 today.
</P>
<P>
   Hoy was named to head the firm last December, replacing Robert
G. Mechaley Jr., who resigned to move to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Group's Lowenstein said Wildfire's new strategy seems
promising. But he had expected that the company would have reached
agreements with more than three cell phone providers by now, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because their product isn't ready, but rather because
the wireless carriers have a lot of things on their plate,''
Lowenstein said. ``Introducing this type of service is not
necessarily a priority for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildfire's Hoy says the company is in talks with ``virtually
every signficant mobile phone'' provider and expects to announce
more licensing agreements soon. Wildfire spokeswoman Leslie
Anderson also said that some planned announcements have been
delayed by industry mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers of PacBell and Bell Mobility currently pay about $20
extra a month to receive Wildfire services. Hoy said the British
deal differs in that Orange plans to offer Wildfire at no
additional cost to subscribers. The company expects the feature
will boost consumers' demand for airtime.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Wildfire has developed French and Italian versions of its
service that it will make available in partnerships with
telecommunications firms in those countries soon, Hoy said. The
firm also plans to develop versions of its software in two more
languages, perhaps Spanish or a Far Eastern tongue.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, Feb. 10:
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-CHEFS (New York) _ In the '80s, when women refused to
yield any corner of the work world to men, they began to make their
mark even in the competitive and brutal restaurant kitchens of New
York. Through persistence and sacrifice, skill and irrepressible
desire, an advance guard of women became stars on what was fast
becoming one of New York's most glamorous and visible stages. By
Marian Burros.

</P>
<P>
   CASSOULET (Undated) _ It is the perfect union of meat and bean
and as humble as bread. And it is quite possibly the most filling
dish ever created by man. But when cassoulet, a slow-cooked country
stew of plump beans, broth and various succulent meats, is right,
it can be one of the most memorable, most satisfying dishes in the
world. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   With recipe.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-SPOON (Paris) _ ``What is that?'' asked the Frenchman at
the next table, eyeing the dish before me. ``Macaroni and cheese,''
I replied in fluent English. ``An American classic.'' We were
lunching, not together, at Spoon Food &AMP; Wine, Alain Ducasse's
newest restaurant and his third in Paris. It is billed as an
international restaurant and, indeed, features Asian, Indian, Latin
American and Italian dishes, with a touch of British cooking, such
as it is, and, for local xenophobes, even a few things French. But
they're the supporting cast; the stars at Spoon are American. At
least they try to be. By Frank J. Prial.

WHERE A CUP OF JOE COSTS $222 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I guess the problem is that crime does pay.
Every time a Bay Area Rapid Transit cop gives a guy with a cup of
coffee a $222 citation, there's more money to support the BART
system's deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a San Francisco cop gives a $76 ticket to someone
smoking in a bar, or a guy pushing a shopping cart, there's more
money to support bureaucrats so they can think up more ways to
raise money by cracking down on lifestyle crimes.
</P>
<P>
   While the San Francisco police have gone into bars to issue
citations to cigarette-wielding criminals, the wonderful Mission
Playground can't get a full-time cop to protect kids, seniors and
supervisors from the gangs in the area.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on here? Our police agencies are cracking down on
cigarettes and coffee, and they can't protect little kids from dirt
bags with guns?
</P>
<P>
   This is a scandal. If a guy lights up next to you in a bar, you
can always get up and leave. If a guy pulls a gun in a park, you
have a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   Secondhand smoke doesn't exactly rank up there as a hazard with
firsthand bullets.
</P>
<P>
   I can see the logic of prohibiting food on BART. The cars have
nice carpets and you don't really want a guy with a cup of hot
coffee standing over you. But a $222 fine?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to ``Let the punishment fit the crime''? The
philosophy of city agencies now seems to be ``Let the punishment
fit the salaries we pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a city ordinance I'd never heard of. The other day I was
on a near-empty cable car and when it came to a stop I stepped over
the back of one of the outboard benches to sit down. There was no
other way to get there without running around in front of the cable
car.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket-taker came over and told me there was a $100 fine for
stepping over a bench. He was a nice guy, and he just warned me.
</P>
<P>
   I understand why the Municipal Railway doesn't want people
stepping over the benches. (Heck, you could get hurt almost as
badly as you could by getting off the car into oncoming traffic,
which is legal.) But there was no sign saying stepping over benches
is illegal. There aren't any such signs on any cable cars. So who's
going to know there's such a rule with a $100 fine?
</P>
<P>
   Tourists are the only ones who take cable cars, and they don't
live here, so they don't know. People who live here don't take
cable cars, so they don't know. Ignorance of this law must be at
100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While you or I can pay a fine of $222 for taking a bagel or a
cup of coffee onto a BART train, the Democratic Party doesn't have
to pay any fines for providing $5 ``chicken-and-potato-salad'' food
vouchers to voters so they'd come out and vote in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The vouchers were given out in selected low-turnout precincts,
most of them poor and African-American. I'm sorry, but this is
demeaning. The Democrats should be fined for trying to buy the poor
with such a cheap come-on. A $5 grocery voucher barely buys the
potato salad.
</P>
<P>
   If they were serious about turning out voters, they'd give them
the kind of spread you see at fund-raisers and parties thrown by
lobbyists. If these guys think they can get someone's vote with $5
worth of groceries, and they're the party that rules Oakland, what
the hell are they doing in office?
</P>
<P>
   Their constituents shouldn't be that desperate to get something
to eat.
</P>

 CHRON   When you lust for nuts and all you get is cremes . . .  
   
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
On Sunday, Valentines will turn the 35 million lovely heart-shaped
candy boxes expected to be sold this year into wrecks of cockeyed
paper frills and half-bitten, poked-at chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the caramel, and which one's the champagne truffle? If
only we had X-ray vision.
</P>
<P>
   Without a map, not even experts can be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have boxes and boxes of chocolates here, and we're forever
guessing what's inside each candy,'' says Karen Louie, a publicist
for the American Boxed Chocolate Manufacturers in New York City.
``You see people in the office biting into them, shaking their
heads and saying, `No, that's not it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always such a guessing game. In the not-distant past
when chocolates were handmade, it was easy to tell which was which.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, there are traditional patterns,'' says
Terry Richardson of Hayward, a British-trained chocolate
technologist and candy-industry consultant. ``English toffee, for
example, is chocolate-coated and rolled in nuts. If the candy had a
lemon-cream center, the candy maker would traditionally mark it
with an `L' on top. Raspberry was an `R.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some small-scale chocolate makers who make everything by hand,
still mark their candies in this way, he says, and vestiges of the
code crop up in some mass-made boxes: a curl like a ``C'' on a
round cherry cordial or a square caramel, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But mass-marketers using candy-coating machines (the first ones
were developed in the 1920s to keep up with increasing consumer
demand for chocolate) can't re-create the marks. Instead, many use
locator maps tucked into the boxes _ an idea pioneered by Whitman
Co. (now owned by Russell Stover) in 1912. After Whitman's first
map, imitators quickly surfaced, giving rise to the myth that candy
makers secretly code their chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a kid seeing a diagram with squiggles and marks,
a chart that maybe came out of a box, to tell what was inside a
chocolate candy,'' says Beth Klein, librarian at the California
Culinary Academy in San Francisco. She searched the school's
extensive library for a similar key but came up dry.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call recently from the people working on reviving the
TV game show `I've Got a Secret' who had thought, `What a great
idea if we could crack the See's candy code,' '' says Richard Van
Doren, vice president of marketing for See's in South San Francisco
and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It's no dark secret: See's includes a photo guide to its candies
in the back of its mail-order booklets. The pictures are side views
of sliced-open chocolates; they don't show the top markings, which
are specified in fat three-ring binders of candy measurements See's
executives keep in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   The specs call for particular marks: caramel, ``smooth with 1
mark''; buttercream, ``smooth''; cherry, ``4 marks''; orange,
``smooth with O mark.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was all done by hand, the candy makers would dip the
chocolate and put a mark on it with a piece of copper wire,'' Van
Doren says. See's now makes few marks by hand. Most are applied by
machinery that lightly touches the sticky tops of the candies after
they've passed through a sheet of liquid chocolate. Then the
candies move by conveyor belt through a cooling tunnel that
solidifies the marks.
</P>
<P>
   However, many chocolate companies long ago gave up the handmade
look. They make candy by coating molds with chocolate, pressing
fillings into the coatings, then sealing the backs with more
chocolate. The result: shiny identical shells, starfish, dollar
signs, hearts and other shapes. The advantage: a lot more perfect
chocolates turned out of molds a lot quicker.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to tell what's inside is to bite.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what chocoholics do.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey for Russell Stover Candies, customers 'fessed
up to surprising filling-detection techniques: 43 percent decide
based on a candy's shape; 30 percent eat whatever they touch; 27
percent nibble before taking for keeps; and 14 percent scratch or
poke the surface to try the filling. Because of that high
willingness to destroy pretty chocolates, this year the company
puts a candy map in boxes of its Russell Stover line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet I can figure out half the box, but that's no better than
most people,'' says Tim Moriarty, features editor at Chocolatier
magazine, aimed at amateur chocolate makers. In each issue, the
magazine takes the lid off a box of molded chocolates, photographs
it and identifies the filling in each piece.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are devising similar chocolate IDs. Laderbach, a
Swiss company whose chocolates sell for $50 a 15.2-ounce box,
prints a guide inside the lid. Joseph Schmidt Confections, of San
Francisco, puts its guide on box tags. Bernard Callebaut
Chocolaterie of Calgary, Alberta, includes a tiny photo guide in
its mail-order brochures. Brown&AMP;Haley, in Tacoma, Wash., just moved
its photo guide from the bottom to inside the lid after customers
complained about having to pick up the box to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps such guides won't be needed for long _ not since Mike
Bursk of San Clemente started selling the Sneak-Peek Candy Sampler.
The 31/2-inch-long device, sold by mail order, is made of nickel
and resembles a pogo stick.
</P>
<P>
   Bursk, a charter fishing boat operator, was inspired by a dinner
party at which he encountered a box of chocolates with all the
bottoms poked and scratched. ``My wife and I laughed about it, and
finally I decided to make something that would take a more
surgically clean sample,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One method is even more sanitary. ``Usually you can tell by the
shape and size,'' says Carole Bloom, author of ``All About
Chocolate'' (Macmillan, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not foolproof.''

 CHRON   The Tasteful Way to Taste  
 
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
You could scarf down your Valentine's Day chocolates like a frat
brother swallowing goldfish. But chocolate experts advise there's a
proper ritual for getting maximum delight from this food of the
gods:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Look at the pieces.  &LR; Fine chocolates should have a warm, deep color
with no streaks or gray spots. Those flaws indicate moisture or
quick temperature changes which can affect chocolate's flavor and
texture. Chocolate also should have a natural-looking satiny sheen
that's free of bubbles and blemishes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Take a whiff.  &LR; Chocolate should have a fresh aroma that's not

 &UR; Taste. &LR;  Fresh fine chocolates have intense but refined flavors. The
chocolate coating should snap but not shatter when you bite it but
melt smoothly in your mouth, leaving only a rich, nutty flavor on
your tongue with no gritty or chalky residue. The taste of the
filling should complement the flavor of the chocolate. The
aftertaste should linger pleasantly.

<P>
   Most of all, says Carole Bloom, author of ``All About
Chocolate'' (Macmillan, 1998) and spokeswoman for the American
Boxed Chocolate Manufacturers, chocolate should make you smile.

THE BAR BEHIND BARS: LAWYERS CONVERT OLD JAIL INTO OFFICES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ If you hire these lawyers, you will end up
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Not because their clients are always found guilty, but because
they own the jail. Not the new Cameron County Jail, but the old one
a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Four well-known Brownsville barristers threw caution _ and about
$1.5 million _ to the wind and set up their law practices in the
long-abandoned jail built by the county in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the handsome, and extremely solid, four-story brick
building stands as a convincing argument for the practicality of
historic preservation. The owners say the jail's thick brick walls
make it easy to heat and cool, the cost of restoration was
comparable to new construction and they now labor in a local
landmark steeped in the turbulent history of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The jail has housed notorious criminals, including hit man
Charles Harrelson, provided brief lodging for President Lyndon
Johnson's younger brother and some intoxicated companions, and was
reportedly the site where two young Mexicans were hanged during the
hysteria of 1915-era bandit raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real neat working here, and everyone who works here seems
to enjoy it,'' said Eduardo R. Rodriguez, the senior member of the
civil law practice of Rodriguez, Colvin &AMP; Chaney. ``It's different
than your normal building.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Different'' is lawyerly understatement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rodriguez's office on the fourth floor is built
into what was the jail's maximum-security unit, a massive steel box
set inside a cage of heavy bars. Over the door to Rodriguez's
office hangs a framed bumper sticker reading ``Free Harrelson,'' a
memento the lawyer picked up while defending the co-defendant of
the notorious hit man during his Edinburg trial for the 1968
contract murder of grain dealer Sam Degelia Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And Harrelson, the father of actor Woody Harrelson, stayed in
the same maximum-security cell when the jail was in use.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson is serving two life sentences for the May 29, 1979,
assassination of San Antonio federal Judge John H. Wood Jr., a
killing paid for by defendants in a drug-trafficking trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody really gets interested in it and wants to know what
it's like and so forth,'' said Rodriguez. ``I've had lawyers come
from all over the states _ we all have _ who have heard about it
and come by and want to see it. And nobody has ever made any
negative remark about it. It's been all positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and his two partners, Norton Colvin and Mitchell
Chaney, were already renting offices in an historic building in
downtown Brownsville and were searching for one they could purchase
and convert into law offices. About that time, Brownsville attorney
Tony Martinez suggested they pool resources and bid on the jail,
which had been standing empty for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who describes himself as an architect at heart,
frequently visited criminal clients in the old jail and always
believed it held potential for something more than a lockup. When
the jail was retired, Martinez hired structural engineers, and
explored the vacant building with an eye toward converting it into
office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The structure was great, big walls for keeping in heat and
cold, a very sound, solid building, a pretty building, and one that
should not have been demolished, thank God,'' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at it the first time, it was totally vacant,
overrun with weeds. I thought it really would not be difficult to
work out the division of space because (the cellblocks) were great
big rooms, which you could divide by adding interior walls.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the four attorneys submitted the high bid of $67,000 to
Cameron County officials and bought the jail. By then, the jail,
taken out of service in 1978, had become a home for vagrants.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers approached several general contractors about
overseeing the renovation process but the bids were prohibitively
high, likely because of the uncertainty of what nightmares could
lurk behind the aging walls. In the end, the attorneys acted as
their own general contractor, selecting an architect, along with
plumbers, electricians, carpenters, painters and experts to install
the 14 separate air-conditioning units.
</P>
<P>
   A complete refit was accomplished in 18 months, with minimal
alterations, which allowed the jail to be accepted on the U.S.
Interior Department's Register of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   ``All said and done, if you were going to build a brand new
building of this size, with the land and parking, you would have
the same amount of money we have in it, but you wouldn't have near
the amount of atmosphere and you wouldn't have the tax credit,
because it wouldn't be on the national register,'' Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`IT'S A GREAT BUILDING' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From blocks away, there is no doubt the classical-style,
fortress-like brick building served as a jail. The building's 154
windows are still covered with the original steel bars _
sandblasted and painted an industrial gray during restoration _ and
a 12-foot brick wall still surrounds the side and rear perimeters,
enclosing two large courtyards and a smaller one in which female
inmates were allowed to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The main entrance to the building is through two heavy steel
doors, behind which are the original floor-to-ceiling bars that
gave access to the interior of the jail. Today, visitors duck
through a low passageway just inside the front doors and into a
waiting room _ once the jail's booking area _ where a large cell
door serves as a table and seating is provided by the original
metal cell bunks.
</P>
<P>
   And although the spacious offices have plenty of light, the
labyrinth of low brick passageways that lead from one cell block to
another remain dark, lending a dungeon-like air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the most unique office building I've every
seen,'' said Jim Shaw, a Fort Worth criminal defense attorney who
tried a Brownsville murder case with Rodriguez last year. ``In my
type of practice, my clients might not feel too comfortable in a
jail that's been reconditioned, but it's pretty nice. It's a great
building. It has so much character.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw joked, ``And it's a good way to acclimate your clients if
they have an unwinnable case.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the partners hear all manner of clever lawyer
jokes inspired by their unusual offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, `If your client doesn't pay you can lock him up' and
stuff like that. But that goes with the territory,'' Rodriguez
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear, `Jail's a good place for lawyers,' that kind of
joking,'' said Chaney. ``Or `It's about time they started putting
lawyers in jail.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A RENOWNED ARCHITECT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jail and the nearby Cameron County Courthouse were designed
in 1912 by renowned San Antonio architect Atlee B. Ayres, who also
designed the courthouses in Jim Wells (county seat is Alice),
Kleberg (Kingsville) and Refugio (Refugio) counties in the Texas
Renaissance style.
</P>
<P>
   The original jail was a three-story building, but as Cameron
County's population tripled from 1912 to 1930 the jail was enlarged
three times to its current configuration of twin four-story towers
connected by a three-story addition.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville historian Bruce Aiken said during the early days of
the jail, a thriving red-light district reportedly operated nearby,
fueled by young soldiers from a dozen National Guard units
stationed on the border following the outbreak of the Mexican
Revolution of 1910.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, if you wanted to get by with something you
built under the eyes of the sheriff or police because they were
busy looking elsewhere,'' Aiken notes.
</P>
<P>
   And the old jail reputedly had a role in one of the darker
chapters of South Texas history during the 1915-1916 bandit raids,
an interracial bloodbath triggered by Mexican gunmen swooping
across the Rio Grande. Texas Rangers were sent in, and hundreds
were killed, most of them Mexican-Americans accused of banditry who
were summarily executed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SORRY, NO GHOSTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the lawyers bought the jail, an elderly woman who lived
across the street came over and tearfully thanked them because she
was terrified of the vagrants living in the empty structure.
</P>
<P>
   But she also shared a grim recollection of a double execution in
front of the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told us that as a young girl, her mother and father made
her leave the home and go stay with relatives because, in her
words, `They hung two boys from Mexico,' And then she went to a
wake and saw some bodies in a horse-drawn wagon. She made it sound
like the boys were 15 or 16,'' said attorney Chaney, who added the
youths supposedly stole a horse.
</P>
<P>
   But the current residents say there are no lingering spirits
haunting the old corridors, and nothing more sinister than the odd
squeak or clank at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned it would be spooky or eerie if I worked here
late at night, but we've made it so homey and so conducive to work,
that I don't think anyone has been bothered about working in a
jail,'' Chaney said.
</P>
<P>
   And the old jail has one thing in common with modern-day jails:
It has become crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offices for the two law firms, the 23,000-square-foot
building now provides space to a copy company, a private
investigator and a branch office of a third law firm.
</P>

   IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ After listening quietly for weeks to
testimony and argument, senators are ready to debate President
Clinton's fitness to remain in office. But first they must decide
whether to hold their historic deliberations in public or behind

obstruction-of-justice charges today, they were deciding whether to
change a Senate rule requiring closed deliberations. (Foskett, Cox

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ Fate arranged a cruel irony for the U.S. Senate
on the day it allowed Monica Lewinsky's videotaped image and voice
into its presence. Legislative clerk Scott Bates, who conducted
most Senate roll call votes, including those during the impeachment
trial, was killed in an accident Friday night. So as the Senate
gathered to at last hear from Lewinsky, the voice with which the
institution itself has come to be identified was silent. The moment
of silence for Bates set a somber mood for a session that many
senators have for months worried would upset the Senate's dignity.
Those concerns appear to have been overwrought. Whatever momentary
fascination may have come with the opportunity to study someone who
has been silent through so much speculation, Lewinsky's excerpted
testimony did nothing to lower this process further than it has
sunk. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   BLACK-VAUDEVILLE (New York) _ On one level, they were simply
black men and women, sometimes wearing burnt-cork makeup, who spoke
in dialect and told jokes, danced and sang about life's ups and
downs. On another level, the language and the routines of black
vaudevillians reflected an era in which most Americans considered
blacks inferior and black entertainers used their separate sphere
to escape the pain or create other meanings for their lives. The
ghosts of that time, representing the place where history,

FOOLS' GOLD: FINANCE GURUS RIDE WAVE OF POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you loathe investment jargon, then the Motley
Fools are the money gurus for you.
</P>
<P>
   The Fools, brothers Tom and David Gardner, are the co-creators
of Motley Fool (www.fool.com), the wildly popular Web site and
investment forum based in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardners' breezy, irreverent style has spawned a tiny media
empire of best-selling books, a syndicated newspaper column, a
weekly radio show, a media company of 120 employees and Motley Fool
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Both former English literature majors, the Gardners six years
ago launched an investment newsletter called ``Ye Olde Printed
Fool.'' It did poorly, but the Gardners offered on-line copies
free. A year later, their Web site caught fire on America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fidelity's Peter Lynch and San Francisco brokerage king
Charles Schwab, the brothers are masters at demystifying Wall
Street for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the Fools' advice for investment newbies: Invest
for the long run. Do not invest in what you don't understand. And
do not listen to market gurus who predict short-term stock
movements.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Fools are broadening their strategies. In their new
book, ``Rule Breakers, Rule Makers: The Foolish Guide to Picking
Stocks'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), they're advising folks to take a close
look at ``Rule Breakers,'' or top companies that are pioneers in
emerging industries. Top rule breakers: America Online, Yahoo and
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the book breaks little new ground. A recent Business
Week review slams it: ``For all of the Fools' elaborate posturing
as truth-telling court jesters, the advice they offer has become
pretty conventional stuff like the wisdom of investing in a strong
brand such as Coca-Cola. For a jester, that amounts to
malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Fools keep drawing fans with their message.
They discussed their trade during a recent interview:
</P>
<P>
   Q: As literature students in college, did you ever imagine you
would become famed financial gurus?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner: Never. Our interest in finance came from our dad,
who was a banking lawyer for the Federal Reserve. His largest
holding was in the Washington Post, our local paper. In the
supermarket, dad always pointed out products to us. ``Look at that
chocolate pudding,'' he'd say. ``We're part owners of that
company!''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But how'd you make the leap from Chaucer and Shakespeare to
index funds and price/earnings ratios?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner: Our challenge as writers was to create a language
that would get people interested in investment subjects. The
literary world of Shakespeare and the Elizabethan court is rich
with great quotes and ideas and ways to think about the world.
That's why the core of our whole financial venture is our name,
drawn from Shakespeare. If we can put everything in terms that the
average person can understand, we've succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Motley Fools are credited with pioneering the new era of
the individual investor. Was there a turning point, an epiphany,
when you realized you were onto something big?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner: The Internet radically changed our thinking. We
were running a publication with no paper, no printing costs, no
distribution or once-a-month delivery. And we were exchanging ideas
with people out there.
</P>
<P>
   The most profound experience for us was simply opening a message
folder on line and having a public discussion about investments.
Imagine what could happen if people actually traded investment
ideas amongst themselves on-line!
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your critique of Wall Street has been pretty harsh. Have you
gotten the same from investment pros?
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner: In general, we've been treated fairly well,
especially by the research community on Wall Street. We have a
great relationship with analysts who use our sites regularly.
</P>
<P>
   We're most in conflict with the retail side, with Jack the
broker who still thinks he knows more about stocks than the rest of
us. Our belief is that Jack has been trained as a salesperson, and
Jack spends more of his time trying to sell you products, rather
than researching the best investment opportunities for you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you see happening in the investment world 10, 20
years from now?
</P>
<P>
   David Gardner: We're gonna see a massive sea change in the
democratization of the market. All of Wall Street's information
will pour into the desktop computer of the average guy.
</P>
<P>
   What we started in 1994 was pretty revolutionary. Now we're
getting e-mails from our readers, saying they're killing us, their
portfolio returns are beating our returns. If that's really
happening, we're doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your investment model and philosophy seems to be evolving.
Before, you wouldn't have touched high-risk Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner: Our basic ideas are the same. Investing over the
long term. Thinking less about stock price valuation and more about
where the business is going, whether or not the company will be
around in five or 10 years, whether it will succeed in its market.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com may be dramatically overpriced in the short term, but
it has a better chance than ever to win in electronic commerce over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You guys are starting to sound suspiciously like every other
market expert.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gardner: Much of Wall Street is based on predictions, on
what's gonna happen in the market the next three months. Unless you
have a psychic connection to Alan Greenspan, we still believe
anyone who tries to call the market is an idiot. So we're still
contrary to the conventional wisdom out there.
</P>
<P>
   We also distinguish ourselves in how we communicate our
investment message. We're not investment advisers or money
managers. We enable businesses and individuals to do it themselves.

<P>
   &UR; FOCUS: BUILDING SCHOOLS (Available by 2 p.m., Fri, Feb. 12) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a move expected to spark a new partisan battle in Congress,
President Clinton wants the federal government to authorize $22
billion in bonds to build new schools and repair old ones, issuing
tax credits to those who buy them. The debate on school
construction also is being fueled by a 1996 federal report that
showed 60 percent of American schools need significant repairs.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: DREAM SCHOOL: As politicians debate federal support for
school construction and renovation, Missouri is just one of several
states creating a new generation of improved learning environments
for students.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: OSCAR NOMINATIONS (Available by 2 p.m., Wed., Feb.
10) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A critical reaction to the Oscar nominations released Tuesday.
Will ``Saving Private Ryan'' come close to landing ``Titanic's'' 14
nominations? Will four of the five best-actor nominees be over 40,
like last year? Will British actresses once again overshadow
Americans? A look at trends and surprises.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS:``Antz,'' ``Rounders,'' ``Clay Pigeons,''
``Next Stop Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS: The new Steve Earle CD and ``Trio II''with
Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL: NASHVILLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the opportunity arose to take a trip to Nashville, I bought
a copy of ``Nashville Wives,'' listened to the Nashville Bluegrass
Band and donned the closest thing I have to cowboy boots.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: OPRY: Today's Grand Ole Opry finds itself at a major
crossroads. Over the past 10 years, and especially since the
closing of the Opryland theme park in December 1997, management
concedes that ticket sales to Opry shows, now performed at the
``new'' glass-and-wood Opry House on the outskirts of town, have
been down. While the country music audience grows younger, spending
millions on pop-oriented acts such as Shania Twain, Garth Brooks
and Faith Hill, the Opry's cast of regulars is graying.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CRUISE: Eight news cruise vessels will take to the high
seas in coming months _ from yachtlike ships to mega-liners.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL BRIEFS: A new historical itinerary with maps and photos
tracing events in the civil-rights movement has been introduced on
the Web. The site describes and shows 42 places in 21 states.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD: TOMATO SAUCES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When cooking sauces, Italian cooks have never been ashamed to
use tomatoes from a can, which frequently yield a superior product
to fresh ones that are often of less than optimal ripeness.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: RECIPES: Farfalle With Simple Tomato Sauce, Chicken
Cacciatora
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSPICE: The world has an enduring passion for
chocolate. This is the season for chocolate lovers to openly
indulge their passion, and the Internet increases the pleasure by
offering total immersion to anyone surfing the thousands of
chocolate-related sites.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: NUTRITION: Listeria is dangerous for anyone, but in
someone susceptible, it is catastrophic. In addition to causing
miscarriages and stillbirths, listeria can cause fatal blood
infections and meningitis.
 &UR; WHEELS: SATURN SC2 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given the proliferation of trucks with three and four doors and
the constant addition of doors to vans, it's hardly a surprise to
find a three-door car coming to showrooms. What is pleasantly
surprising is to find it's from Spring Hill, Tenn., with Saturn
badging.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: AT A GLANCE: A look at the 1999 Saturn SC2.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: THE MECHANIC: Ideally, once the engine is started, the
generator or alternator begins feeding electricity back to the
battery as well as meeting the rest of the car's electrical needs.
This ``charging action'' reverses the discharge process and, in
time, completely recharges the battery to full capacity. Notice
that I used the words ``ideally'' and ``in time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY: CABLE MODEMS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've heard about the lightning-fast speed in which cable
modems operate, and you're tired of the hassles brought by dial-up
service to the Net such as frequent busy signals, that annoying
sound a modem makes dialing in to the server and broken
connections. But are cable modems everything you've wanted? Heres
the lowdown .
</P>
<P>
   WITH: INTERNET SCAMS: The more the Internet grows and the more
new users it attracts, the greater the opportunities for those who
wouldn't mind conning newbies out of their money.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: Powered by a little computer that looks like
an iridescent gumdrop, Apple Computer continues to grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: Life on the Web mirrors life. As the Web has
become a tool, instead of just an amusement, the ability to search
for needed information has become more important.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS: SUSAN ORLEAN AND `THE ORCHID THIEF' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Q&AMP;A with the Susan Orlean, who journeyed into the swamps to
research her latest book, ``The Orchid Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: In ``The Orchid Thief,'' Susan Orlean conjures a
wandering, sweaty report on a people obsessed, and the equally
obsessive, spongy land that accommodates them. Orlean's ability to
gently insinuate herself onto her journalism _ in ways both
humorous and heartbreaking _ is a rare gift, and a treat to read.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: Beginning this month, a software program
called E-rater scores essays on the Graduate Management Admission
Test taken annually by 200,000 college students. In the past, each
essay was read by two people, and sometimes a third. Now, E-rater
replaces one of those judges. Just like the guy at the garage
slamming that loud nut gun onto your wheel: might not be much
artistry to it, but it gets the job done fast.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: BOOK NEWS: John Glenn, America's resurrected space hero,
has signed a deal with Bantam Books to publish his memoir in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: Tony Fletcher's `Moon: The Life and Death of a
Rock Legend' is the literary equivalent of manic-depression, a
condition from which The Who's late drummer, Keith Moon, likely
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: N.Y. TIMES BEST SELLERS LIST
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH: AIDS DRUG RESEARCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS virus is clumsy _ and that may be one of its greatest
strengths. When HIV copies itself, as it endlessly does in the
human body, it is liable to make mistakes. These mistakes change
the virus's genetic blueprint ever so slightly _ enough to create a
drug-resistant version of the virus, much harder to treat. This
genetic sleight-of-hand is nothing new to doctors, who face it with
other infectious diseases. What dismays AIDS specialists and their
patients, though, is the frightening swiftness with which HIV can
mutate and shield itself against anti-HIV drugs.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: Fifteen years ago, two young scientists met in a lab, fell
in love with their work and then fell in love with each other. Now,
the couple, Drs. Beatrice Hahn and George Shaw, have caught the
world's attention by presenting a paper at a conference in Chicago
showing that a virus in chimpanzees was the starting point for the
AIDS epidemic in humans.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: DOG DRUGS: Veterinarians increasingly are turning to
anti-depressant drugs to treat dogs' behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEALTH BRIEFS: In-vitro fertilization and other techniques
helped produce more than 20,000 babies in 1996, and the good news
for infertile couples is that the success rate is rising,
researchers say.

research her latest book, ``The Orchid Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: In ``The Orchid Thief,'' Susan Orlean conjures a
wandering, sweaty report on a people obsessed, and the equally
obsessive, spongy land that accommodates them. Orlean's ability to
gently insinuate herself onto her journalism _ in ways both
humorous and heartbreaking _ is a rare gift, and a treat to read.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: Beginning this month, a software program
called E-rater scores essays on the Graduate Management Admission
Test taken annually by 200,000 college students. In the past, each
essay was read by two people, and sometimes a third. Now, E-rater
replaces one of those judges. Just like the guy at the garage
slamming that loud nut gun onto your wheel: might not be much
artistry to it, but it gets the job done fast.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: BOOK NEWS: John Glenn, America's resurrected space hero,
has signed a deal with Bantam Books to publish his memoir in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: Tony Fletcher's `Moon: The Life and Death of a
Rock Legend' is the literary equivalent of manic-depression, a
condition from which The Who's late drummer, Keith Moon, likely
suffered.

   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH: AIDS DRUG RESEARCH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS virus is clumsy _ and that may be one of its greatest
strengths. When HIV copies itself, as it endlessly does in the
human body, it is liable to make mistakes. These mistakes change
the virus's genetic blueprint ever so slightly _ enough to create a
drug-resistant version of the virus, much harder to treat. This
genetic sleight-of-hand is nothing new to doctors, who face it with
other infectious diseases. What dismays AIDS specialists and their
patients, though, is the frightening swiftness with which HIV can
mutate and shield itself against anti-HIV drugs.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: Fifteen years ago, two young scientists met in a lab, fell
in love with their work and then fell in love with each other. Now,
the couple, Drs. Beatrice Hahn and George Shaw, have caught the
world's attention by presenting a paper at a conference in Chicago
showing that a virus in chimpanzees was the starting point for the
AIDS epidemic in humans.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: DOG DRUGS: Veterinarians increasingly are turning to
anti-depressant drugs to treat dogs' behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEALTH BRIEFS: In-vitro fertilization and other techniques
helped produce more than 20,000 babies in 1996, and the good news
for infertile couples is that the success rate is rising,
researchers say.

   WOMEN-CHEFS (New York) _ In the '80s, when women refused to
yield any corner of the work world to men, they began to make their
mark even in the competitive and brutal restaurant kitchens of New
York. Through persistence and sacrifice, skill and irrepressible
desire, an advance guard of women became stars on what was fast
becoming one of New York's most glamorous and visible stages. By

   CASSOULET (Undated) _ It is the perfect union of meat and bean

it can be one of the most memorable, most satisfying dishes in the

   PARIS-SPOON (Paris) _ ``What is that?'' asked the Frenchman at
the next table, eyeing the dish before me. ``Macaroni and cheese,''
I replied in fluent English. ``An American classic.'' We were
lunching, not together, at Spoon Food &AMP; Wine, Alain Ducasse's
newest restaurant and his third in Paris. It is billed as an
international restaurant and, indeed, features Asian, Indian, Latin
American and Italian dishes, with a touch of British cooking, such
as it is, and, for local xenophobes, even a few things French. But
they're the supporting cast; the stars at Spoon are American. At

black men and women, sometimes wearing burnt-cork makeup, who spoke
in dialect and told jokes, danced and sang about life's ups and
downs. On another level, the language and the routines of black
vaudevillians reflected an era in which most Americans considered
blacks inferior and black entertainers used their separate sphere
to escape the pain or create other meanings for their lives. The
ghosts of that time, representing the place where history,

<P>
   Want to add about 90 points to your child's SAT score? Start
now, while she's young, by getting her into the school band or
orchestra. Or the chorus. Or give her piano lessons.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board found that music students outperform others by
52 points on the verbal portion of the SAT, and 37 points in math.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a youngster may be too small to reach the last note
on the trombone slide or can't stretch his thumb and pinkie an
octave on the keyboard, don't put off lessons. The window of
opportunity for a child to most easily understand music, say
developmental psychologists, is from infancy to 10. Music helps
children form neural bridges from birth. It's harder to learn if
you begin later.
</P>
<P>
   The human brain is a mass of neurons. Think of it as a
three-dimensional dot-to-dot with more dots (neurons) than could
ever be connected.
</P>
<P>
   Connections _ information pathways called neural bridges _ are
formed or strengthened each time a child is exposed to stimulation.
The more bridges that form, the more the intellect is developed.
Neurons that receive no information for a period of time die off,
leaving weak spots.
</P>
<P>
   Plato once said that music ``is a more potent instrument than
any other for education.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been well-established by research on the link between
an early musical education and other academic skills.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Fran Rauscher and physicist Gordon Shaw of the
University of California at Irvine have conducted a variety of
tests involving music and learning. One showed that piano
instruction beat computer instruction in dramatically enhancing
children's abstract reasoning skills _ those needed for learning
math and science.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists gave a group of 3-year-olds piano lessons for
eight months. Though the tots' motor skills didn't bode well for
serious piano-playing, their spatial intelligence increased by an
average of 46 percent. Classmates who received no musical training
improved their spatial intelligence by just 6 percent in the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   Rauscher and Shaw are best known for their study showing that
just listening to complex music, such as pieces written by the
classical composers, could temporarily enhance spacial reasoning in
people of all ages, a phenomenon dubbed ``The Mozart Effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have shown that music combined with movement, as
in ballet lessons or the Orff music program for children ages 3 to
12, improves children's language and motor skills development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach sound and listening skills almost immediately,'' says
Orff expert Edna Geary, chairman of music education at the Boston
Conservatory. By third grade, Orff students are writing music, to
become familiar with its structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talent is no accident of birth,'' wrote the late Shinichi
Suzuki, author of ``Nurtured by Love,'' and the Japanese violinist
who founded the Suzuki method, in which children as young as 3 are
taught to play lengthy instrumental pieces from memory.
</P>
<P>
   After the benefits of musical instruction were publicized in the
media, there was a rush by parents to enroll their children in some
type of early childhood music program.
</P>
<P>
   Private music academies and individual instructors, such as
piano teachers who work out of their homes, began waiting lists to
keep up with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Greensboro, N.C.-based Kindermusik International recently teamed
up with Gymboree to offer music classes at the children's play
program locations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Most children, however, still get their first taste of reading
musical notes, playing strings or woodwinds, or singing in a chorus
in their elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Public school music programs usually wait until fourth or fifth
grade to introduce specific instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Barron-Stolcz, an elementary music teacher in Santa
Rosa, Calif., starts her fourth-grade beginning players off with
three weeks of music theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids have the idea they're going to get on the
instrument and are magically going to be able to play it. Then they
get an instrument, can't play, get frustrated and drop it,'' said
Barron-Stolcz, who teaches both band and orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to get them comfortable with the language first. If you
put lines and spaces (the musical staff) in front of them and tell
them what to do with their fingers at the same time, it's too much
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour a day is the optimal practice time for beginning
students, say music instructors, who stress that virtually every
child can succeed musically on some level.
</P>
<P>
   Students who don't become professional musicians or instructors,
will at least have developed a lifelong appreciation for music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy playing as a stress-reliever,'' says Amy
Hedrick, who just signed her 8-year-old son David up for weekly
piano lessons in suburban Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is a source of joy for me, and I would hate to deny that
to my son. You can't back up and say 'Oh gosh, I wish I'd have
learned that as a child.' ''

CHICKEN SOUP WORKS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For your winter health, here are facts and fictions about
children's colds:
</P>
<P>
   FICTION: A drafty room can give your child a cold.
</P>
<P>
   FACT: More than 200 viruses can cause a cold, but a blast of
cool air can't, notes Dominick Iacuzio, director of influenza and
related viral respiratory diseases at the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Far from causing colds, opening a window to air out the house
can actually let germs escape. And if you crank up the heat
instead, it can make a child more susceptible to a cold. ``Heated
indoor air is drier than a desert,'' says Dr. Steven Mostow,
chairman of medicine at Rose Medical Center in Denver. The low
humidity creates gaps in the mucous fining of the respiratory
tract, which holds key immune cells. These gaps expose the
underlying tissue to infection, Mostow explains.
</P>
<P>
   To help your child's mucous membranes stay supple and
sniffle-resistant, run a cool-mist humidifier in his room during
the winter. Be sure to wash it out daily to prevent the growth of
bacteria and mold. Otherwise, germs could penetrate his mucous
lining, causing a serious infection.
</P>
<P>
   FICTION: A child is contagious only when she shows symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   FACT: Actually, a child is most contagious before she has
symptoms. ``Kids carry the most virus during the 24-hour incubation
phase,'' notes Mostow, when the only clues of a cold in the making
are crankiness and maybe a bit of clear mucus coming from the nose.
</P>
<P>
   Focus your protective efforts on the three to five days
following the onset of obvious symptoms, when the virus is spread
easily by touching, coughing and sneezing. Try to minimize your
child's contact with other kids, wash her hands frequently and
discourage touching of the nose and mouth during this time.
</P>
<P>
   Most doctors agree that a school-age child with a cold need not
stay home more than three days, says Dr. Bennett Kaye, assistant
professor of clinical pediatrics at Northwestern University Medical
School in Chicago. If she has no fever and feels up to it she may
return sooner. But remind your child to scrub up and to avoid
sharing food and drink with classmates while recovering.
</P>
<P>
   FICTION: Zinc, vitamin C, or chicken soup can conquer a cold.
</P>
<P>
   FACT: No remedy available today can cure a cold, although a few
are touted as having anticold properties. Zinc, for one, may hasten
a cold's disappearance, but only in adults. New research from Dr.
Michael Macknin, chairman of general pediatrics at the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation in Ohio, found that this benefit doesn't extend
to kids.
</P>
<P>
   As for vitamin C, the belief that it prevents colds hasn't been
borne out by research, Macknin says. ``Whether it relieves a cold's
symptoms is hotly debated. If it has any effect at all, it's
minimal,'' he adds. Besides, kids get all the vitamin C they need
by drinking juice and eating a variety of fruits and veggies.
</P>
<P>
   Cold-fighting properties are also ascribed to certain herbs, but
these should be given to kids only with a doctor's OK. Echinacea
may help make a child's cold symptoms milder if it's used at the
first sign of the sniffles, says Dr. Robert Rountree, author of
``Smart Medicine for a Healthier Child'' (Janet Zand, $15.95). But
it can cause gas and bloating and loses effectiveness if taken
continuously for more than a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Another herb, astragalus, is less trendy but more effective at
actually preventing colds. ``It's very safe and won't lose
effectiveness with prolonged use,'' observes Rountree.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken soup is a cold remedy definitely worth trying with kids.
Not only is it comforting, but ``it seems to contain an antiviral
property that no one has identified yet,'' says Mostow.
</P>
<P>
   FICTION: You should feed a cold and starve a fever.
</P>
<P>
   FACT: The fever part is fairly well discredited. But the cold
advice, though more innocuous, is also wrong. Many parents think a
special diet will hasten their child's recovery. Not so, says Kaye.
For example, they may stop serving dairy products during a cold
because they've heard these foods increase stuffiness. ``But unless
your child has a milk allergy, his mucus won't get thicker from
consuming dairy,'' Kaye explains.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, one dietary rule for kids with colds:
Increase their fluid intake to help prevent dehydration.

STUDY SHOWS INCOME GAP WORSENING IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the story of a remarkable economic
expansion has transfixed Californians in the past few years, the
gap between the rich and poor has grown and continues to expand, an
economic analysis shows.
</P>
<P>
   The study indicates that lack of education hurt low-income wage
earners and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this inequality in California more troubling is
that it is not just about the rich getting richer, but about
profound losses at the bottom,'' said Deborah Reed, an economist at
the San Francisco-based Public Policy Institute of California
(PPIC), an independent, nonprofit organization that researches
economic, social and political issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the poor are not sharing in California's economic
prosperity,'' said Reed, whose report is titled ``California's
Rising Income Inequality: Causes and Concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is yesterday's news to the Rev. Floyd Lotito at San
Francisco's St. Anthony Foundation, who sees the ranks of the poor
growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always avoided saying it because it's such a cliche _ the
rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer _ but it's
very evident in not only the numbers of people who frequent our
program but in the type of person,'' Lotito said.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Anthony's dining room, which has served 26 million
midday meals since 1950, is providing 2,064 per day now, a 9
percent increase over 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more telling is the 20 percent increase in the number of
visits by children to the St. Anthony Clinic in the past year and
the 15 percent overall increase in clinic visits _ from 13,000 to
15,000 over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The economic study follows a 1996 PPIC report that showed income
inequality in California rising sharply between 1969 and 1994 and
growing faster in California than in the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The new study extended the analysis to 1997 and found the income
inequality in the state was actually higher than before.
</P>
<P>
   Reed found that a household of four in the bottom 10 percent of
income had a real income of $15,000 in 1989. During the early '90s,
in the depths of the recession, that number fell to $11,300. As of
1997, the figure was $13,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two main concerns for the state,'' Reed said. ``One
is the dramatic income decline for the poor and lower middle class
and how do we maintain standards of living for those families, and
the second is with equal opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When incomes are more unequal it is harder to make opportunity
equal, because the children of the rich are getting better
educated, have better health care and live safer lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The income disparity is greater in California than in other
states, Reed said, because immigrants are represented in a larger
share of the state's workforce and ``we see in California an even
greater payoff to education and training and experience than we see
in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, a U.S.-born man with a bachelor's degree earned almost
50 percent more than a similar worker who had only a high school
diploma. By 1989, the difference had increased to more than 60
percent and by 1997 it was nearly 70 percent, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of other reasons for poverty _ a trauma happens
and someone cannot adjust to it. Not coming from a strong family
that would be supportive and establish some sort of discipline or
value education, and certainly a lack of education or job
training,'' Lotito said.
</P>
<P>
   Lotito has an idea for those who are economically comfortable:
Recognize there are people less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a plunge for people to come into a place such as
St. Anthony to see there are others not living at their level,'' he
said. ``It's a way to overcome compassion fatigue.''

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors _ This is Part I in a four-part series.)
 &HT;    ........................................................
 &HT;    When Kenneth Starr was chosen to investigate Whitewater in 1994,
the White House counsel, Abner Mikva, assured the Clintons that
this was a fine selection.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr had known each other for years. During the
1980s, the two men served together on the Federal Appeals Court in
Washington, and though they were on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, the liberal Mikva and the conservative Starr were
friends.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr socialized at each other's homes, dined out
together with their wives. When Mikva thought of Starr, words such
as ``ethical,'' ``fair,'' ``decent'' came to mind.
 &HT;    If Mikva saw a fault in the younger judge, it was that Starr was
a little too much of an egghead, too pedantic, just not
street-smart. This was brought home to Mikva one day during a near
fistfight at the federal courthouse. Starr, Mikva and Laurence
Silberman were on a three-judge panel and, when they retired to the
conference room, it turned out that Silberman was furious with
Mikva over the case they had just heard.
 &HT;    ``Silberman said to me, 'If you were 10 years younger, I'd punch
you out!' ``Mikva recalls. ``I look over, and there was Ken,
looking at the ceiling, wishing he was not there. He never said a
word. I attributed it to the gentle son of a minister who didn't
like controversy.''
 &HT;    And so, in August 1994, Mikva assured the Clintons: ``Ken and I
had good relations on the court and I'm sure it will continue.''
 &HT;    Twice during 1995, Starr wanted to question both the president
and the first lady in connection with the Arkansas inquiries, and
each time arranged it with Mikva.
 &HT;    ``The milieu could not have been more pleasant or cooperative,''
Mikva says. ``Upstairs in the White House residence, both times on
a Saturday. He arrived discreetly through the back entrance. He
later issued a short statement. There was no commenting or leaking
to the press.''
 &HT;    Mikva walked Starr out after one session and thanked him. ``I
said: 'I realize it was not done for this president. I appreciate
your concern for the presidency.' He said: 'I would not have it any
other way. The Republicans will elect a president again and I want
the presidency to be there.'''
 &HT;    Starr was considered too bland in those days to have political
enemies, and if he did, they would probably have been conservative
Republicans. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr shepherded Sandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court
nomination through the Senate and was attacked by conservatives for
having covered up O'Connor's pro-choice views.
 &HT;    After President Bush appointed him solicitor general in 1989,
Starr showed his independence on his first controversial case,
defying the president by siding with a group of whistle-blowers
against defense contractors.
 &HT;    Even after Starr took a million-dollar-a-year corporate law job
at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in 1993, he was viewed by the Washington
establishment as the perfect man for handling delicate public
matters. When the congressional committee investigating
sexual-harassment charges against Sen. Bob Packwood needed someone
to review the most intimate secrets in Packwood's diaries, Starr
was hired.
 &HT;    His law partners watched him rushing about, installing a lock on
his door, setting aside a special table as the only place the
diaries could be reviewed and declaring that only the office
administrator could carry the diaries in and out of a special
vault.
 &HT;    In October 1995, Mikva left the White House, still on good terms
with Starr. But what happened a few months later radically changed
Mikva's feelings and embarrassed him in front of the Clintons, who
were by then referring to the independent counsel as ``your friend
Ken Starr.''
 &HT;    ``I was shocked when Mrs. Clinton was called before the grand
jury and he made her go to the courthouse,'' Mikva says. ``He could
have taken her testimony under oath at the White House. He knew
there was no back stairway at that courthouse, that she'd have to
walk right in front of the barrage of cameras. Ken knew that
courthouse better than anyone.
 &HT;    ``When he and I were on the bench there in the 1980s, there was
a U.S. attorney, Jay Stephens, who constantly used the press _ he'd
call press conferences in front of the courthouse to announce an
indictment and then haul in the defendant in front of the cameras.
Ken and I used to stand together at an upstairs window looking
down. We agreed that using the press as a prosecutorial tool was
not something an ethical prosecutor did.
 &HT;    ``The Judge Starr I knew was cautious, deliberate, careful, not
zealous and reckless. The Ken Starr I see now is not the Ken Starr
I knew.''
 &HT;    Is it true? Is there really a new Ken Starr? Rusty Hardin thinks
so too, although he draws a very different conclusion. Hardin, a
lawyer in the independent counsel's office at the start of the
Whitewater investigation, says that Starr needed to learn to think
like a prosecutor. He had never been one, had never even been a
trial lawyer, had spent his career in the high-altitude world of
appellate law.
 &HT;    ``Appellate lawyers don't stand up before the Court of Appeals
and call each other (expletive) _ they don't question each other's
motives,'' Hardin says. ``Prosecutors live with that.''
 &HT;    The reserved Starr drove his assistant prosecutors mad,
endlessly weighing and deliberating every matter. ``Starr was more
concerned with what people thought of him,'' Hardin says. ``But the
more the White House stonewalled, the more he hunkered down.''
 &HT;    Over time, his assistants began to glimpse a new fire in
Prosecutor Starr. Frustrated by Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas's
legal challenges to the independent counsel's jurisdiction, Starr
argued the appeal himself. The moment that decision came down from
the Eighth Circuit, Eric Jaso, an assistant in Little Rock,
informed Starr that they had won on every point.
 &HT;    ``Ken let out a yell,'' Jaso recalls. ``He yelled, 'Total and
complete victory!' I wrote it on my screen saver _ 'Total and
Complete Victory!' Ken said, 'This is fantastic!' He was excited,
breathless with exhilaration.''
 &HT;    What drives Starr onward? Who is this minister's son in such
relentless pursuit that he forced the president to admit his sins
on national television?
 &HT;    Very soon, this man the public knows so little about will
command the nation's undivided attention. After spending more than
four years and an estimated $40 million investigating Whitewater,
Filegate, Travelgate, Vincent Foster's death and the Lewinsky
matter, Starr is expected to deliver his final report to Congress
in the coming weeks.
 &HT;    For the first time, the public will get Starr's full view of the
president's wrongdoing; the report will also tell us a good deal
about its author and about the quality and scope of the
investigation. Then we will all have to decide: Should the matter
have been dropped long ago? Did Starr lose all sense of proportion?
Or does he make the case for a criminal cover-up worthy of
impeachment?
 &HT;    For his part, Starr is not talking, and has never talked much
publicly about himself. He has granted few on-the-record interviews
in the last four years to reporters writing profiles of him and has
refused repeated requests over a four-month period to be
interviewed for this article.
 &HT;    The only on-the-record interview he has done on any subject
recently _ conducted in April by Steven Brill for his media
magazine, Brill's Content _ landed Starr in trouble with a federal
judge over leaking information to the press about the
investigation. And so, morning after morning, TV crews camp out in
front of his McLean, Va., home at dawn, shooting fresh video of the
man walking to his car with his Starbucks coffee, trying to prod
him into a sound bite.
 &HT;    Nor was Starr willing to permit an interview with his wife,
Alice, although she made the single-most-telling comment about what
their lives are like these days, during an hourlong profile of
Starr shown by the A&AMP;E network in June. ``Sometimes,'' Alice Starr
said, ``it seems like a nightmare that won't ever go away, and I
always think to myself, `It can't get worse than this.' And it
does. Every day it seems to get worse and worse.''
 &HT;    Of course, it didn't have to go on this long. A different
independent counsel might have ended things a lot sooner. In 1987,
James McKay, a Democrat, began investigating Attorney General Edwin
Meese III, a Republican. After a year, McKay concluded that Meese
had broken the law by accepting favors from a defense contractor
and could be convicted by a jury.
 &HT;    Meese's behavior was so troubling that two of his top aides at
the Justice Department, William Weld and Arnold Burns, fellow
Republicans, resigned in protest. But that independent counsel
decided against taking the case to trial; McKay thought the scope
of Meese's wrongdoing was not worth the political trauma that would
be caused by putting the nation's top law-enforcement officer on
trial.
 &HT;    McKay says he feels the same way about the Lewinsky matter, that
Starr has gone ``so far afield'': ``We could have gone off on
things with Meese, but I said no. It makes your blood run cold, the
idea of looking into a case about sexual affairs.''

 &HT;    ........................................................
 &HT;    When Kenneth Starr was chosen to investigate Whitewater in 1994,
the White House counsel, Abner Mikva, assured the Clintons that
this was a fine selection.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr had known each other for years. During the
1980s, the two men served together on the Federal Appeals Court in
Washington, and though they were on opposite ends of the political
spectrum, the liberal Mikva and the conservative Starr were
friends.
 &HT;    Mikva and Starr socialized at each other's homes, dined out
together with their wives. When Mikva thought of Starr, words such
as ``ethical,'' ``fair,'' ``decent'' came to mind.
 &HT;    If Mikva saw a fault in the younger judge, it was that Starr was
a little too much of an egghead, too pedantic, just not
street-smart. This was brought home to Mikva one day during a near
fistfight at the federal courthouse. Starr, Mikva and Laurence
Silberman were on a three-judge panel and, when they retired to the
conference room, it turned out that Silberman was furious with
Mikva over the case they had just heard.
 &HT;    ``Silberman said to me, 'If you were 10 years younger, I'd punch
you out!' ``Mikva recalls. ``I look over, and there was Ken,
looking at the ceiling, wishing he was not there. He never said a
word. I attributed it to the gentle son of a minister who didn't
like controversy.''
 &HT;    And so, in August 1994, Mikva assured the Clintons: ``Ken and I
had good relations on the court and I'm sure it will continue.''
 &HT;    Twice during 1995, Starr wanted to question both the president
and the first lady in connection with the Arkansas inquiries, and
each time arranged it with Mikva.
 &HT;    ``The milieu could not have been more pleasant or cooperative,''
Mikva says. ``Upstairs in the White House residence, both times on
a Saturday. He arrived discreetly through the back entrance. He
later issued a short statement. There was no commenting or leaking
to the press.''
 &HT;    Mikva walked Starr out after one session and thanked him. ``I
said: 'I realize it was not done for this president. I appreciate
your concern for the presidency.' He said: 'I would not have it any
other way. The Republicans will elect a president again and I want
the presidency to be there.'''
 &HT;    Starr was considered too bland in those days to have political
enemies, and if he did, they would probably have been conservative
Republicans. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr shepherded Sandra Day O'Connor's Supreme Court
nomination through the Senate and was attacked by conservatives for
having covered up O'Connor's pro-choice views.
 &HT;    After President Bush appointed him solicitor general in 1989,
Starr showed his independence on his first controversial case,
defying the president by siding with a group of whistle-blowers
against defense contractors.
 &HT;    Even after Starr took a million-dollar-a-year corporate law job
at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis in 1993, he was viewed by the Washington
establishment as the perfect man for handling delicate public
matters. When the congressional committee investigating
sexual-harassment charges against Sen. Bob Packwood needed someone
to review the most intimate secrets in Packwood's diaries, Starr
was hired.
 &HT;    His law partners watched him rushing about, installing a lock on
his door, setting aside a special table as the only place the
diaries could be reviewed and declaring that only the office
administrator could carry the diaries in and out of a special
vault.
 &HT;    In October 1995, Mikva left the White House, still on good terms

Mikva's feelings and embarrassed him in front of the Clintons, who

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors _ This is Part II in a four-part series.)
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Kenneth Winston Starr was born July 21, 1946, in Vernon, Texas,
the youngest of three children. His father, Willie Douglas Starr, a
fundamentalist minister and a barber, put in long, hard hours to
support the family. From the beginning, religion was central to the
boy's life.
 &HT;    ``He's gone to church ever since he was 2 weeks old and never
known any different,'' says his mother, Vannie, who is 91. ``We
just started him from babyhood to know right from wrong.''
 &HT;    When Kenneth was in fifth grade, the Starrs moved to a white
frame house shaded by ash and pecan trees in a working-class
section of San Antonio, where Vannie Starr still lives.
 &HT;    Starr's friends from his teen-age days remember him as bright,
bookish, religious, a little nerdy, totally unathletic but popular,
mature and focused beyond his years. Sam Millsap, who went to
junior high with Starr, lived nearby and, like Starr, was raised in
the Church of Christ. There was no drinking, smoking, dancing, no
musical instruments in church, but a lot of Bible verse.
 &HT;    ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' Millsap says. ``We were
told _ Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night _ almost
everything fun was wrong and we were going to hell because we were
sinners.'' Millsap, who went on to become the district attorney of
San Antonio, says, ``When I got older I switched to the Methodist
Church so I'd have a shot at heaven.'' Starr attends an evangelical
Bible church.
 &HT;    ``In retrospect,'' Millsap says, ``as I piece together Starr,
the thing at the core of everything is his church faith. Ken was
always independent and sure of himself, his ability and his beliefs
of what's right and what's wrong. He was following his own light _
he didn't give a hoot about the group. When we were in church as
kids, we knew we were out of step with the mainstream, because we
believed what others didn't and we understood we could be subject
to persecution _ it was part of the yoke that made us special.''
 &HT;    The other thing that school friends such as Gary O. Smith
remember was Starr's passion for politics. At Sam Houston High,
besides being a member of the drama club and the yearbook and
newspaper staffs, Starr was president of the junior and senior
classes. As a ninth grader in 1960, he passed out campaign
literature for Richard Nixon; as a senior, for Barry Goldwater.
After graduating, he spent two years at Harding College, a Church
of Christ school in Arkansas, selling Bibles door to door to help
pay his tuition.
 &HT;    But if there is one thing that has struck people who have known
Starr well, both in Texas and Washington, it is his ability to
grow. He wanted an Eastern education. He wanted to see how he
stacked up against different people. He wanted to see how far he
could go.
 &HT;    For his junior year, he transferred to George Washington
University. He did stick out a little there; while classmates were
protesting the Vietnam War in tie-dyed shirts, Starr wore a tie to
lectures. But like most of his classmates, he did not go to
Vietnam, classified 4-F thanks to a case of psoriasis.
 &HT;    The summer he graduated, he met Alice Mendell, a Jewish girl
from Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Skidmore College. They were wed by a
Church of Christ minister and have been married 28 years. It was
Alice, friends say, who taught the minister's son to dance.
 &HT;    After getting a law degree at Duke, Starr was selected in the
mid-1970s for a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger. It was
the first of many times he would advance his career by ably serving
an older, conservative Republican.
 &HT;    In 1982, when Starr was Attorney General William French Smith's
chief of staff, a profile in American Lawyer magazine described the
35-year-old Starr as the perfect assistant, ``deferential without
being obsequious, intelligent without being intimidating ...
anything but one of those arrogant aides who strut the corridors of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Jacob Stein, one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, noticed
some of those same traits during his negotiations with Starr over
which sexual acts his client might testify to. ``Ken Starr has the
manners of a Southern gentleman,'' says the 73-year-old Stein,
``beautiful manners.''
 &HT;    He is also a workaholic of mythic proportions, even by
Washington standards. ``Ken's smart, but he's not a genius,'' says
Tex Lezar, a former colleague in the Reagan Justice Department.
``He's not this person with a 195 IQ. He got where he is by working
very, very hard.''
 &HT;    Henry Habicht, another Reagan-era colleague, remembers that at
the Justice Department in the early '80s he would be in Starr's
office at 8:30 p.m. discussing an issue as Starr changed into a
tuxedo for a black-tie event. ``He'd come back to the office after
the affair,'' Habicht says, ``pick up work to take home, then be in
at 7 the next day.''
 &HT;    Often Starr had to learn as he went. He became an Appeals Court
judge in 1983, though he had never been a lower court judge; the
solicitor general _ the government's lawyer to the Supreme Court _
in 1989, though he had never argued before the Supreme Court; the
independent counsel in 1994, though he had never been a prosecutor.
 &HT;    An interviewer once asked Alice Starr what she and her husband
did for fun and she said that on Sundays they took car rides in the
country: She drove while he read.
 &HT;    He has put in the same endless hours juggling the independent
counsel's job with private practice. Starr was so busy flying
around the country for those two jobs, plus making speeches and
teaching a course at New York University, that when John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, wanted to discuss the Clinton
investigation, he sometimes had to ride with Starr in a taxi to the
airport.
 &HT;    Most profiles have portrayed Starr as a career man who still
manages to coach his daughter's softball team and teach Sunday
school, although friends say it has been years since he has been
able to do those things. ``He's a good father for a workaholic,''
one friend says.
 &HT;    It is Alice who is ``so brilliant about organizing their lives
so he has family time,'' Bates says. At an ABA breakfast appearance
in August, as Starr shook every hand in sight, Alice slipped off,
filled a plate with food, quietly set it on the table in front of
his chair, then went back to get him juice. She is also an
executive in a real-estate firm.
 &HT;    While McLean is an upscale suburb, the Starrs live in the same
four-bedroom brick-and-frame house they bought 21 years ago when he
was a young lawyer, a comfortable home but not lavish. They are
known as gracious hosts.
 &HT;    In his most recent financial-disclosure statement, filed for
1996, Starr lists a salary of $1.14 million and assets of $3.8
million to $7.9 million. (Federal forms are vague, requiring that
assets be listed as a range, and it is possible that his worth is
higher, since one trust is in the top category of ``over $1
million.'')
 &HT;    His three children are used to having his work life mixed into
their family time. When Eric Jaso applied for a job as a prosecutor
in Starr's office three years ago, Starr suggested that they meet
for an interview in Princeton, where Jaso was working on a case.
 &HT;    ``I'm waiting in a hotel lobby,'' Jaso remembers, ``and all of a
sudden this man rushes up and says: 'Eric? Ken Starr. Sorry I'm
late, but we're in the middle of a tour of the campus. Come join
us.' And we go out front and there's this wood-paneled minivan and
inside are his two daughters, his son'' _ the prospective freshman
_ ``his wife, plus two Princeton undergrads conducting the tour,
and he says, 'Hop in,' and I sit in the back near his littlest
daughter.''
 &HT;    Jaso took the walking tour of the Princeton campus with the
entire Starr family. ``He and I hung back so he could interview
me,'' Jaso says. ''And then all of us went to lunch.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, Starr's wife gave him a 50th birthday party, and
one of the speakers roasting him was their son, Randall, the oldest
child, who recalled how his father tortured them on family trips by
playing tapes of famous historical speeches.
 &HT;    Habicht remembers Starr testing Carolyn, the middle child, when
she was 5 or 6 to see if she could name the presidents in order.
Today, Randall is an undergraduate at Duke and Carolyn is beginning
her freshman year at Stanford, a year behind Chelsea Clinton.
 &HT;    Even as a young man, Starr ``carried himself very much in a
judicial manner,'' says Bob McConnell, another lawyer in the Reagan
Justice Department. ``I kidded him. He was always trying to be
thoughtful, deliberate.''
 &HT;    All along, friends say, it was perfectly clear Starr didn't want
to be just a Supreme Court justice; he wanted to be chief justice.
 &HT;    In January 1989, President Bush asked Starr to be solicitor
general. It was an honor _ and, for someone whose goal was to be on
the Supreme Court, a political minefield. For days, he spent long
stretches in his office, door closed, on the phone to friends. ``He
was very conflicted,'' Lezar recalls.
 &HT;    Starr had watched Reagan's first solicitor general, Rex Lee,
attacked from the right for not being aggressive enough in
challenging Roe vs. Wade and from the left for being too
aggressive.
 &HT;    ``Ken recognized if he took it, there was a good chance he'd
never get back to the appellate bench, never make it to the Supreme
Court because he'd make too many political enemies,'' Lezar says.
``But he understood that reaching the Supreme Court is kind of like
lightning striking, it's out of your control.''
 &HT;    Starr was trapped. If he said no, he risked alienating the very
president who would select the next justice. But in taking the job,
Lezar says, Starr still hoped the call would come someday. ``I
don't think he ever completely gave it up. It's like a senator who
wants to be president. At some point, time passes you by and you
know intellectually that it won't happen, but in your heart you
don't give up.''
 &HT;    A good solicitor general strikes a delicate balance, primarily
arguing the agenda of the president who nominated him but, when the
law demands, saying no to the president. Starr's predecessor as
solicitor general, Charles Fried, is widely regarded as having been
too much a political lackey of the Reagan administration; Starr is
credited with restoring a proper balance.
 &HT;    On his first tough case, a request from the White House to write
an amicus brief for military contractors in a dispute with
whistle-blowers, Starr sided with the whistle-blowers and against
Bush.
 &HT;    ``He held endless meetings with all the parties involved,'' says
Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former deputies. ``Starr sat there
like a judge, hearing everyone out, very courtly _ if anything,
excessively judicious. I kept wishing he'd throw everyone out of
his office and decide. He took so long making up his mind to do the
right thing _ but he did.''
 &HT;    Starr argued several cases involving moral issues _ including a
Bush administration challenge to Roe vs. Wade _ but, his deputies
say, he did not discuss his religious or moral views. Prosecutors
in the independent counsel's office say the same. Although he sings
hymns on his morning jog and keeps a calendar with daily Scripture
verses at his private residence, he did not bring his religion into
the workplace, they say.
 &HT;    The main criticism of Starr as solicitor general was also
expressed later at the independent counsel's office: He was
involved in too many outside activities, spread too thin,
constantly touring the country, advancing his name in legal
circles.
 &HT;    Merrill says that Starr could be gone a couple of days a week,
``off delivering some ridiculous speech to a bar association in
Tucson.'' He would send back legal briefs for his deputies, full of
little yellow stickers they called Ken-grams.
 &HT;    ``I questioned these road shows,'' Merrill says. ``He'd make
some dry legal speech and then go around the room meeting and
greeting as many lawyers as he could. I don't know why he bothered
_ maybe he felt like he was building a base for the Supreme
Court.'' Starr's assistants could tell that possibility was never
too far out of his mind. If they were working a controversial case,
he'd joke, ``This will do me in for the Supreme Court for sure.''
 &HT;    In July 1990, Justice William Brennan announced his retirement.
Press reports said that Starr was on the short list of nominees.
But by then, as he feared, he had alienated too many
constituencies. The Bush White House was upset about the
whistle-blower case. Senate liberals felt he had been too
aggressive arguing a challenge to Roe vs. Wade.
 &HT;    Robert Shapiro, a deputy solicitor general, was with Starr in
his office when they heard the news. ``The announcement that it was
Souter came on TV over CNN,'' Shapiro says. ``I looked at his face
for signs of disappointment. We all knew how he felt. There was
nothing. Nothing. Not a single indication of any emotion. Not
one.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors _ This is Part II in a four-part series.)
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Kenneth Winston Starr was born July 21, 1946, in Vernon, Texas,
the youngest of three children. His father, Willie Douglas Starr, a
fundamentalist minister and a barber, put in long, hard hours to
support the family. From the beginning, religion was central to the
boy's life.
 &HT;    ``He's gone to church ever since he was 2 weeks old and never
known any different,'' says his mother, Vannie, who is 91. ``We
just started him from babyhood to know right from wrong.''
 &HT;    When Kenneth was in fifth grade, the Starrs moved to a white
frame house shaded by ash and pecan trees in a working-class
section of San Antonio, where Vannie Starr still lives.
 &HT;    Starr's friends from his teen-age days remember him as bright,
bookish, religious, a little nerdy, totally unathletic but popular,
mature and focused beyond his years. Sam Millsap, who went to
junior high with Starr, lived nearby and, like Starr, was raised in
the Church of Christ. There was no drinking, smoking, dancing, no
musical instruments in church, but a lot of Bible verse.
 &HT;    ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' Millsap says. ``We were
told _ Sunday morning, Sunday night, Wednesday night _ almost
everything fun was wrong and we were going to hell because we were
sinners.'' Millsap, who went on to become the district attorney of
San Antonio, says, ``When I got older I switched to the Methodist
Church so I'd have a shot at heaven.'' Starr attends an evangelical
Bible church.
 &HT;    ``In retrospect,'' Millsap says, ``as I piece together Starr,
the thing at the core of everything is his church faith. Ken was
always independent and sure of himself, his ability and his beliefs
of what's right and what's wrong. He was following his own light _
he didn't give a hoot about the group. When we were in church as
kids, we knew we were out of step with the mainstream, because we
believed what others didn't and we understood we could be subject
to persecution _ it was part of the yoke that made us special.''
 &HT;    The other thing that school friends such as Gary O. Smith
remember was Starr's passion for politics. At Sam Houston High,
besides being a member of the drama club and the yearbook and
newspaper staffs, Starr was president of the junior and senior
classes. As a ninth grader in 1960, he passed out campaign
literature for Richard Nixon; as a senior, for Barry Goldwater.
After graduating, he spent two years at Harding College, a Church
of Christ school in Arkansas, selling Bibles door to door to help
pay his tuition.
 &HT;    But if there is one thing that has struck people who have known
Starr well, both in Texas and Washington, it is his ability to
grow. He wanted an Eastern education. He wanted to see how he
stacked up against different people. He wanted to see how far he
could go.
 &HT;    For his junior year, he transferred to George Washington
University. He did stick out a little there; while classmates were
protesting the Vietnam War in tie-dyed shirts, Starr wore a tie to
lectures. But like most of his classmates, he did not go to
Vietnam, classified 4-F thanks to a case of psoriasis.
 &HT;    The summer he graduated, he met Alice Mendell, a Jewish girl
from Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Skidmore College. They were wed by a
Church of Christ minister and have been married 28 years. It was
Alice, friends say, who taught the minister's son to dance.
 &HT;    After getting a law degree at Duke, Starr was selected in the
mid-1970s for a clerkship with Chief Justice Warren Burger. It was
the first of many times he would advance his career by ably serving
an older, conservative Republican.
 &HT;    In 1982, when Starr was Attorney General William French Smith's
chief of staff, a profile in American Lawyer magazine described the
35-year-old Starr as the perfect assistant, ``deferential without
being obsequious, intelligent without being intimidating ...
anything but one of those arrogant aides who strut the corridors of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Indeed, Jacob Stein, one of Monica Lewinsky's lawyers, noticed
some of those same traits during his negotiations with Starr over
which sexual acts his client might testify to. ``Ken Starr has the
manners of a Southern gentleman,'' says the 73-year-old Stein,
``beautiful manners.''
 &HT;    He is also a workaholic of mythic proportions, even by
Washington standards. ``Ken's smart, but he's not a genius,'' says
Tex Lezar, a former colleague in the Reagan Justice Department.
``He's not this person with a 195 IQ. He got where he is by working
very, very hard.''
 &HT;    Henry Habicht, another Reagan-era colleague, remembers that at
the Justice Department in the early '80s he would be in Starr's
office at 8:30 p.m. discussing an issue as Starr changed into a
tuxedo for a black-tie event. ``He'd come back to the office after
the affair,'' Habicht says, ``pick up work to take home, then be in
at 7 the next day.''
 &HT;    Often Starr had to learn as he went. He became an Appeals Court
judge in 1983, though he had never been a lower court judge; the
solicitor general _ the government's lawyer to the Supreme Court _
in 1989, though he had never argued before the Supreme Court; the
independent counsel in 1994, though he had never been a prosecutor.
 &HT;    An interviewer once asked Alice Starr what she and her husband
did for fun and she said that on Sundays they took car rides in the
country: She drove while he read.
 &HT;    He has put in the same endless hours juggling the independent
counsel's job with private practice. Starr was so busy flying
around the country for those two jobs, plus making speeches and
teaching a course at New York University, that when John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, wanted to discuss the Clinton
investigation, he sometimes had to ride with Starr in a taxi to the
airport.
 &HT;    Most profiles have portrayed Starr as a career man who still
manages to coach his daughter's softball team and teach Sunday
school, although friends say it has been years since he has been
able to do those things. ``He's a good father for a workaholic,''
one friend says.
 &HT;    It is Alice who is ``so brilliant about organizing their lives
so he has family time,'' Bates says. At an ABA breakfast appearance
in August, as Starr shook every hand in sight, Alice slipped off,
filled a plate with food, quietly set it on the table in front of
his chair, then went back to get him juice. She is also an
executive in a real-estate firm.
 &HT;    While McLean is an upscale suburb, the Starrs live in the same
four-bedroom brick-and-frame house they bought 21 years ago when he
was a young lawyer, a comfortable home but not lavish. They are
known as gracious hosts.
 &HT;    In his most recent financial-disclosure statement, filed for
1996, Starr lists a salary of $1.14 million and assets of $3.8
million to $7.9 million. (Federal forms are vague, requiring that
assets be listed as a range, and it is possible that his worth is
higher, since one trust is in the top category of ``over $1
million.'')
 &HT;    His three children are used to having his work life mixed into
their family time. When Eric Jaso applied for a job as a prosecutor
in Starr's office three years ago, Starr suggested that they meet
for an interview in Princeton, where Jaso was working on a case.
 &HT;    ``I'm waiting in a hotel lobby,'' Jaso remembers, ``and all of a
sudden this man rushes up and says: 'Eric? Ken Starr. Sorry I'm
late, but we're in the middle of a tour of the campus. Come join
us.' And we go out front and there's this wood-paneled minivan and
inside are his two daughters, his son'' _ the prospective freshman
_ ``his wife, plus two Princeton undergrads conducting the tour,
and he says, 'Hop in,' and I sit in the back near his littlest
daughter.''
 &HT;    Jaso took the walking tour of the Princeton campus with the
entire Starr family. ``He and I hung back so he could interview
me,'' Jaso says. ''And then all of us went to lunch.''
 &HT;    Two years ago, Starr's wife gave him a 50th birthday party, and
one of the speakers roasting him was their son, Randall, the oldest
child, who recalled how his father tortured them on family trips by
playing tapes of famous historical speeches.
 &HT;    Habicht remembers Starr testing Carolyn, the middle child, when
she was 5 or 6 to see if she could name the presidents in order.
Today, Randall is an undergraduate at Duke and Carolyn is beginning
her freshman year at Stanford, a year behind Chelsea Clinton.
 &HT;    Even as a young man, Starr ``carried himself very much in a
judicial manner,'' says Bob McConnell, another lawyer in the Reagan
Justice Department. ``I kidded him. He was always trying to be
thoughtful, deliberate.''
 &HT;    All along, friends say, it was perfectly clear Starr didn't want
to be just a Supreme Court justice; he wanted to be chief justice.
 &HT;    In January 1989, President Bush asked Starr to be solicitor
general. It was an honor _ and, for someone whose goal was to be on
the Supreme Court, a political minefield. For days, he spent long
stretches in his office, door closed, on the phone to friends. ``He
was very conflicted,'' Lezar recalls.
 &HT;    Starr had watched Reagan's first solicitor general, Rex Lee,

Lezar says, Starr still hoped the call would come someday. ``I
don't think he ever completely gave it up. It's like a senator who

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors: this is Part III in a four-part series.) 
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Everyone has a theory on Kenneth Starr. After the Monica
Lewinsky story broke, Hillary Clinton called Starr ``a politically
motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of
my husband.''
 &HT;    Harold Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, says
he sees Starr as a dangerous moralist who views the Clintons ``like
Sodom and Gomorrah and is hellbent on running them out of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Who is Starr that he sees his mission so differently from
earlier independent prosecutors?
 &HT;    In hopes of any insight, I followed him to Toronto in early
August for the speech he delivers every year at the American Bar
Association convention reviewing recent Supreme Court decisions.
 &HT;    He spoke on ``the new textualism.'' Reporters' pens barely
moved. Still, hungry people will take what crumbs they can, and
afterward a dean of a major law school told me that it was a
blatantly political speech, an effort to butter up the Supreme
Court, particularly the Democrat-appointed justices, so they would
be happy to see Starr the next time he argued before them.
 &HT;    ``Did you see all the nice things he said about Breyer and
Ginsburg?'' the dean asked.
 &HT;    Had I missed it? Was Starr sending coded messages to Supreme
Court justices via C-Span 2? Who knew? In time, I learned that
tracking Starr was like following Chauncey Gardiner around in
``Being There'' _ you could read into him almost whatever you
wanted.
 &HT;    I pored over Starr's past speeches but found they offered little
insight into the human being behind the ideas. At Duke University's
1995 commencement, he talked about ``accountability''; at a 1996
meeting of the Economics Club of Detroit, he spoke of ``civic
virtue.'' (He was in favor of both.)
 &HT;    In May at a Charlotte, N.C., bar association meeting, he urged
lawyers to take ``the moral high ground of Atticus Finch,'' the
brave country lawyer in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Harper Lee's
novel, ``who strove to find the truth while defending a black man
wrongly accused.''
 &HT;    In terms of content, the speech was one of Starr's best,
discussing the balance a lawyer must maintain between defending a
client and serving the truth.
 &HT;    But in tone, it was a disaster and widely ridiculed. Starr, the
million-dollar corporate lawyer who represents tobacco companies,
was urging his fellow lawyers to be more like Atticus Finch? Didn't
he know what this would sound like? How much perspective on Ken
Starr did Ken Starr have?
 &HT;    Mostly what Starr talks about these days in his rare public
moments is his search for truth. In the Atticus Finch speech, he
used the word ``truth'' 25 times. In his TV sound bites, he comes
across as some Old World prophet, but instead of wandering the
desert he is rushing in and out of courthouses, hurrying up and
down his driveway.
 &HT;    ``Our job is to get at the truth, and the truth will speak for
itself,'' he says. Or, ``My commitment is to the people and to the
pursuit of the truth.'' Or, in his most famous variation, analyzed
and reanalyzed for its religious overtones: ``There's no room for
white lies. There's no room for shading. You cannot defile the
temple of justice.''
 &HT;    He has also compared himself to Sgt. Joe Friday. (ital.) Just
the facts, ma'am. (end ital.) Frequently, his spokesman, Charles
Bakaly III, warns reporters, ``We're the only ones who have all the
facts.''
 &HT;    But in Washington, other perceptions of Starr also persist. If
you say ``tin ear,'' people instantly understand that you're
talking ``Ken Starr'' and his lapses of political common sense.
This tin ear is partly a matter of being more book smart than
streetwise. In 1989, after his confirmation hearing to be solicitor
general in the Bush administration, Starr called Bob McConnell, a
friend who'd worked with him in the Reagan Justice Department in
the early '80s, to ask how he had come across.
 &HT;    ``I said, 'Everything's going to be fine,''' remembers
McConnell, who was impressed. ``Ken said: 'Really? I watched myself
on CNN and I must tell you, I thought I sounded pedantic.'''
 &HT;    ``Ken, you ARE pedantic,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    ``I am?''
 &HT;    ``Of course you are,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    While solicitor general, Starr organized a half-day seminar in
the Justice Department's Great Hall commemorating the 100th
anniversary of William Howard Taft's appointment as solicitor
general. Starr was quite excited, had programs printed, arranged
for several speeches in praise of Taft, contacted Taft family
members.
 &HT;    ``Among the lawyers on the staff, this was a subject of immense
lunchroom talk,'' says Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former
deputies. To some it seemed a too-obvious sign of his ambition:
Starr paying homage to the former solicitor general who went on to
be president and then chief justice of the Supreme Court. To others
it just seemed goofy: William Howard Taft Day?
 &HT;    In short, Starr has never had a great sense of how he appears to
others. It has been one of the harshest criticisms of him as
independent counsel. Rather than acting as an (ital)independent(end
ital) counsel, he has repeatedly entangled himself with
anti-Clinton forces, making himself appear highly partisan.
 &HT;    One example among many: Starr's public appearance a month before
the 1996 presidential election with Pat Robertson, the
Christian-right leader and vicious Clinton critic, at a celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Robertson's law school.
 &HT;    Why didn't Starr see his own potential conflicts of interest?
His assistant prosecutors did. Several told me they wish that when
he became independent counsel he had taken a leave from his law
firm and from representing clients such as tobacco companies, which
had a stake in seeing the president weakened politically. But
Starr's aides didn't tell him this. ``He doesn't take criticism of
his motives well,'' one colleague says.
 &HT;    Friends say Starr is so sure he's a fair person, and works such
backbreaking hours to come to the right answers, that he can't
conceive of people questioning his ethics. ``He expects everyone to
apply a legal standard to things,'' says Thomas Yannucci, a senior
partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where Starr began working in 1993.
 &HT;    For Starr, the fact that his speech at Pat Robertson's law
school had nothing to do with the investigation was the crucial
point, not the appearance of his honoring Robertson the
Clinton-hater. (Indeed, Starr's speech, on the future of the
judiciary, was so dull and academic that reporters had trouble
finding a usable quote.)
 &HT;    ``He thinks, `Why should he be deprived of the right to speak at
Pat Robertson's university?''' Yannucci says. ``He sees it like a
First Amendment issue. He thinks, 'I speak at all kinds of places.'
And intellectually what he thinks is correct, but politically it
does not always wash.''
 &HT;    But even Starr's best friends were caught off guard when he took
the independent counsel's job in 1994 and are not sure why he
wanted it. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr had been united with his young colleagues in their
disdain for the independent counsel's law. Starr helped prepare a
legal brief arguing that it was unconstitutional, placing too much
unchecked power in one person.
 &HT;    ``When I heard Ken had taken the job,'' McConnell says, ``I sent
him a note: 'I guess if someone has to do an unconstitutional deed,
it has to be you.'''
 &HT;    Starr's other friends from the Reagan Justice Department had
different theories on why he accepted. Theodore Olson, who is now a
prominent Washington lawyer, saw it as a personality thing: ``Ken
has a hard time saying no to people.'' Henry Habicht thought
religion was a factor: ``Reading between the lines, I think Ken
believed that since God had put him in all these lofty posts, he
had a duty to use his experience when a public-service challenge
arose.''
 &HT;    Still others saw Starr's choice as a career decision by a man
who had lost some of his taste for corporate law. Some say he
wanted to be back in the public spotlight. Anyone who has seen
Starr work a room would swear he's running for something.
 &HT;    At the ABA convention in Toronto, he attended a prayer breakfast
in addition to delivering his speech, and at each event he roved
the banquet hall, shaking hundreds of hands, hugging women, signing
autographs, posing for photos.
 &HT;    ``He's really eating this up, isn't he?'' one ABA staff member
said. After Elizabeth Dole's speech at the prayer breakfast,
several people came up to Starr and said, ``God bless you _ keep up
the good work.''
 &HT;    There is probably some truth in a variety of motivations _ that
Starr had no love for Clinton, felt a civic and religious duty, was
bored in his law job, wanted more attention, had trouble saying no.
Yet no single explanation seems sufficient. If he was part of a
vast right-wing conspiracy devoted to nailing the president, why
did he try to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a
dean at Pepperdine University?
 &HT;    Rusty Hardin, a prosecutor in the independent counsel's office
at the start of the Whitewater investigation, says that in 1994,
Starr did not have a clue what he was taking on.
 &HT;    ``He thought he could parachute in, do it in a year or two, not
consume his whole life and get out. He misjudged. He'd never been
in the national spotlight. He still thought like an appellate
lawyer _ that cases would be decided on their merits.''

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors: this is Part III in a four-part series.) 
 &HT;    .......................................................
 &HT;    Everyone has a theory on Kenneth Starr. After the Monica
Lewinsky story broke, Hillary Clinton called Starr ``a politically
motivated prosecutor who is allied with the right-wing opponents of
my husband.''
 &HT;    Harold Ickes, the former deputy White House chief of staff, says
he sees Starr as a dangerous moralist who views the Clintons ``like
Sodom and Gomorrah and is hellbent on running them out of
Washington.''
 &HT;    Who is Starr that he sees his mission so differently from
earlier independent prosecutors?
 &HT;    In hopes of any insight, I followed him to Toronto in early
August for the speech he delivers every year at the American Bar
Association convention reviewing recent Supreme Court decisions.
 &HT;    He spoke on ``the new textualism.'' Reporters' pens barely
moved. Still, hungry people will take what crumbs they can, and
afterward a dean of a major law school told me that it was a
blatantly political speech, an effort to butter up the Supreme
Court, particularly the Democrat-appointed justices, so they would
be happy to see Starr the next time he argued before them.
 &HT;    ``Did you see all the nice things he said about Breyer and
Ginsburg?'' the dean asked.
 &HT;    Had I missed it? Was Starr sending coded messages to Supreme
Court justices via C-Span 2? Who knew? In time, I learned that
tracking Starr was like following Chauncey Gardiner around in
``Being There'' _ you could read into him almost whatever you
wanted.
 &HT;    I pored over Starr's past speeches but found they offered little
insight into the human being behind the ideas. At Duke University's
1995 commencement, he talked about ``accountability''; at a 1996
meeting of the Economics Club of Detroit, he spoke of ``civic
virtue.'' (He was in favor of both.)
 &HT;    In May at a Charlotte, N.C., bar association meeting, he urged
lawyers to take ``the moral high ground of Atticus Finch,'' the
brave country lawyer in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Harper Lee's
novel, ``who strove to find the truth while defending a black man
wrongly accused.''
 &HT;    In terms of content, the speech was one of Starr's best,
discussing the balance a lawyer must maintain between defending a
client and serving the truth.
 &HT;    But in tone, it was a disaster and widely ridiculed. Starr, the
million-dollar corporate lawyer who represents tobacco companies,
was urging his fellow lawyers to be more like Atticus Finch? Didn't
he know what this would sound like? How much perspective on Ken
Starr did Ken Starr have?
 &HT;    Mostly what Starr talks about these days in his rare public
moments is his search for truth. In the Atticus Finch speech, he
used the word ``truth'' 25 times. In his TV sound bites, he comes
across as some Old World prophet, but instead of wandering the
desert he is rushing in and out of courthouses, hurrying up and
down his driveway.
 &HT;    ``Our job is to get at the truth, and the truth will speak for
itself,'' he says. Or, ``My commitment is to the people and to the
pursuit of the truth.'' Or, in his most famous variation, analyzed
and reanalyzed for its religious overtones: ``There's no room for
white lies. There's no room for shading. You cannot defile the
temple of justice.''
 &HT;    He has also compared himself to Sgt. Joe Friday. (ital.) Just
the facts, ma'am. (end ital.) Frequently, his spokesman, Charles
Bakaly III, warns reporters, ``We're the only ones who have all the
facts.''
 &HT;    But in Washington, other perceptions of Starr also persist. If
you say ``tin ear,'' people instantly understand that you're
talking ``Ken Starr'' and his lapses of political common sense.
This tin ear is partly a matter of being more book smart than
streetwise. In 1989, after his confirmation hearing to be solicitor
general in the Bush administration, Starr called Bob McConnell, a
friend who'd worked with him in the Reagan Justice Department in
the early '80s, to ask how he had come across.
 &HT;    ``I said, 'Everything's going to be fine,''' remembers
McConnell, who was impressed. ``Ken said: 'Really? I watched myself
on CNN and I must tell you, I thought I sounded pedantic.'''
 &HT;    ``Ken, you ARE pedantic,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    ``I am?''
 &HT;    ``Of course you are,'' McConnell said.
 &HT;    While solicitor general, Starr organized a half-day seminar in
the Justice Department's Great Hall commemorating the 100th
anniversary of William Howard Taft's appointment as solicitor
general. Starr was quite excited, had programs printed, arranged
for several speeches in praise of Taft, contacted Taft family
members.
 &HT;    ``Among the lawyers on the staff, this was a subject of immense
lunchroom talk,'' says Thomas Merrill, one of Starr's former
deputies. To some it seemed a too-obvious sign of his ambition:
Starr paying homage to the former solicitor general who went on to
be president and then chief justice of the Supreme Court. To others
it just seemed goofy: William Howard Taft Day?
 &HT;    In short, Starr has never had a great sense of how he appears to
others. It has been one of the harshest criticisms of him as
independent counsel. Rather than acting as an (ital)independent(end
ital) counsel, he has repeatedly entangled himself with
anti-Clinton forces, making himself appear highly partisan.
 &HT;    One example among many: Starr's public appearance a month before
the 1996 presidential election with Pat Robertson, the
Christian-right leader and vicious Clinton critic, at a celebration
of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Robertson's law school.
 &HT;    Why didn't Starr see his own potential conflicts of interest?
His assistant prosecutors did. Several told me they wish that when
he became independent counsel he had taken a leave from his law
firm and from representing clients such as tobacco companies, which
had a stake in seeing the president weakened politically. But
Starr's aides didn't tell him this. ``He doesn't take criticism of
his motives well,'' one colleague says.
 &HT;    Friends say Starr is so sure he's a fair person, and works such
backbreaking hours to come to the right answers, that he can't
conceive of people questioning his ethics. ``He expects everyone to
apply a legal standard to things,'' says Thomas Yannucci, a senior
partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, where Starr began working in 1993.
 &HT;    For Starr, the fact that his speech at Pat Robertson's law
school had nothing to do with the investigation was the crucial
point, not the appearance of his honoring Robertson the
Clinton-hater. (Indeed, Starr's speech, on the future of the
judiciary, was so dull and academic that reporters had trouble
finding a usable quote.)
 &HT;    ``He thinks, `Why should he be deprived of the right to speak at
Pat Robertson's university?''' Yannucci says. ``He sees it like a
First Amendment issue. He thinks, 'I speak at all kinds of places.'
And intellectually what he thinks is correct, but politically it
does not always wash.''
 &HT;    But even Starr's best friends were caught off guard when he took
the independent counsel's job in 1994 and are not sure why he
wanted it. In 1981, as an aide to Attorney General William French
Smith, Starr had been united with his young colleagues in their
disdain for the independent counsel's law. Starr helped prepare a
legal brief arguing that it was unconstitutional, placing too much
unchecked power in one person.
 &HT;    ``When I heard Ken had taken the job,'' McConnell says, ``I sent
him a note: 'I guess if someone has to do an unconstitutional deed,
it has to be you.'''

prominent Washington lawyer, saw it as a personality thing: ``Ken

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;     (NOTE: Editors _ This is Part IV in a four-part series.)
 &HT;    .............................................
 &HT;    Another prosecutor might have formed a different perspective on
an American president who lied about sex in a dismissed civil suit.
 &HT;    Another prosecutor could have ended the Monica Lewinsky inquiry
long ago.
 &HT;    James McKay, the Democratic independent counsel who in 1987
began investigating Republican Attorney General Meese III _ and
opted to avoid the political trauma of a trial for the nation's top
law-enforcement officer _ says that not prosecuting is one of the
hardest decisions a prosecutor makes.
 &HT;    Even within Starr's own office, there was dissent among seasoned
prosecutors over how hard to pursue the Lewinsky investigation. Two
of Starr's assistants, Michael Emmick and Bruce Udolf, argued for
accepting Lewinsky's first proffer in January, then running a swift
investigation and turning a report over to Congress in 60 days.
 &HT;    In typical Starr fashion, these issues were debated endlessly.
Over time, Starr sided with other assistants _ two of his deputies,
Robert Bittman, whom Starr affectionately calls Bulldog, and Jackie
Bennett, known among fellow prosecutors as the office expert on the
president's sex life long before anyone had heard of Lewinsky.
Ultimately, Starr opted for an investigation that would turn up
every last fact.
 &HT;    He fought up to the Supreme Court to get Clinton's Secret
Service guards to testify, up to the Supreme Court trying to get
hold of the notes of the lawyer for the late Vince Foster. Starr
pushed normal prosecutorial practices to the limit by calling
Lewinsky's mother before the grand jury.
 &HT;    It all reflected a big change in Starr. At some point, the
reserved appellate lawyer decided he would do whatever it took
within the limits of the law to squeeze people for his
investigations. He had come to realize that the White House was
going to do what defense lawyers almost always do during criminal
investigations: delay, stall, buy time.
 &HT;    What was the turning point for Starr? His assistant prosecutors
cannot pinpoint it, and who knows if even Starr can. This much is
clear: By the time Lewinsky appeared on the scene, he was poised
for an all-out assault. As to whether he was overzealous and
irresponsible or was simply ``becoming a prosecutor,'' as Rusty
Hardin, his former colleague at the beginning of the Whitewater
investigation believes _ that will depend on what is in his final
report.
 &HT;    What we do know is that Starr was willing to drive on when so
many other prosecutors would have stopped.
 &HT;    Part of the reason is Starr's legal temperament. All his
professional life, before reaching a decision, he has doggedly
pursued every last fact. His friends say it over and over: ``Ken is
determined that no one will defeat him by outworking him.''
 &HT;    As solicitor general in the Bush administration, the first case
he argued before the Supreme Court was an old-fashioned
civil-rights matter left over from the Carter era that forced the
City of Yonkers to remedy past discrimination by racially balancing
its public housing and schools. That couldn't have been a case
Starr had much political sympathy for, and yet his aides remember
his exhaustive preparation.
 &HT;    When he lost, says Robert Shapiro, a former deputy solicitor
general, ``Ken took it very hard.'' He hates to lose.
 &HT;    Starr also has a scholarly, at times pedantic, love for the law
and is genuinely offended that anyone, let alone the president of
the United States, would denigrate it. In his May ``Atticus Finch''
speech at the Charlotte, N.C., bar association, invoking the
beloved character in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Starr warned that
the single biggest problem facing lawyers today is ``loss of
respect for the truth.''
 &HT;    While Starr wants to be liked, he was also raised to have
confidence in his beliefs even if most people don't agree. A detail
such as a 19 percent approval rating in the polls isn't going to
deter Starr.
 &HT;    As for his career, he had little at stake anymore. When he tried
to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a dean at
Pepperdine University, he changed his mind a few days after the
announcement due to an uproar from the press and his prosecutors;
he couldn't escape. His great dream, the Supreme Court, had long
passed. His next most likely steps _ academia and corporate law _
are assured no matter how this investigation turns out.
 &HT;    Indeed, a senior partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, Thomas Yannucci,
who is close to him, says that Starr, despite taking an unpaid
leave of absence from the firm in July, plans to return when this
is all over. In what may be the understatement of the year,
Yannucci says, ``Now that he's taken on his public duty, I don't
think he has the same view of public service.''
 &HT;    Did Starr come to hate the president _ did that drive him too?
The answer is probably yes, although not at first, and not until he
felt that the White House was stonewalling. I asked John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, whether Starr hates Clinton.
 &HT;    Bates was quiet a long time and then gave an answer so
convoluted that I stopped taking notes. I asked again, Did Starr
hate Clinton? ``I think Ken is very upset at how personal and
political the attacks on him, the office and others in the office
have become,'' he said.
 &HT;    Did moral outrage at Clinton's sexual escapades also fuel
Starr's investigation? Lawyers who have sat with him at meetings
when these details were discussed say they could tell that Starr
was offended.
 &HT;    But when asked for a single example, a single comment or
outburst, they could not provide one. They answered that it was
subtle, in the wrinkle of an eyebrow or a quiet grimace. They had
heard his deputies make lewd remarks, but not Starr; he was too
professional for that.
 &HT;    We do know that Starr was raised to take a hard line against
such behavior. When his mother was asked for this article what she
wanted Americans to think of her son, she answered, ``I want them
to think of a man who believes in doing right and a man who does
not cheat on his wife, like Clinton has on his wife.''
 &HT;    All this said, in the end Starr's motives no longer matter. That
is his victory, his measure of vindication. It no longer matters if
malicious right-wingers consorted with his office to lay a trap for
the president, if prudishness or ambition or even radio waves from
outer space drove Ken Starr. The president has admitted misleading
the American public. He lied. Through Starr's doggedness, his
relentless effort to amass every last fact, he has succeeded in
making his investigation about Bill Clinton, not about Ken Starr.
 &HT;    All Clinton's life, the man from Hope has relied on his brains,
his charm, his boyishness, his uncanny political instincts, his
superhuman energy to squeeze through tight spots. Not this time.
This time Starr built such a wall of facts that Clinton had no
place to go. On Aug. 17, 1998, at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
Clinton hit that wall. It was not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that Starr has scored his total and complete
victory. This may or may not turn out to be about obstructing
justice, but regardless, it is lots and lots about sex, and no one
wins when such private matters are made public.
 &HT;    All who became embroiled in the Lewinsky case _ the White House,
the press and the prosecutors, too _ dirtied themselves. When Starr
needed someone to show the American public that he was acting
fairly, he hired the Watergate hero Sam Dash as his ethics adviser.
Within Starr's office, Dash is referred to as ``our secret
weapon.''
 &HT;    A generation from now, if there is another president who needs
investigating, will the special prosecutor of that era hire Starr
as his secret weapon? Not likely.
 &HT;    Once Starr drops his report at Congress's door, the nation's
attention will be riveted on Clinton. It'll be (ital)just the
facts(end ital). People laughed at Starr when he once compared
himself to Sgt. Joe Friday, but it turns out he was right, he did
have something in common with the ``Dragnet'' cop.
 &HT;    In making the decision on what should be done with Bill Clinton
_ drop the matter? censure? impeachment? _ some in Congress will
choose along partisan lines, a few will look into their own
personal lives, but most will stick their fingers into the wind and
check the public-opinion polls. The citizenry will decide. Starr
has forced Americans to confront every last prurient fact, right
down to the presidential DNA.
 &HT;    There are those who will say that half the marriages in America
end in divorce, that if every spouse who lied about sex had to
confess on TV, the testimony would fill 500 cable channels for 500
years, that this is a matter between the Clintons and that what
Bill Clinton has already publicly admitted to is more than we would
ask of any other human being.
 &HT;    And there are those who will say it is shameful for a president
with Clinton's history to be arrogant enough to carry on a sexual
affair with a 21-year-old right in the White House, lie about it
and then take advantage of his good friends and aides by using them
to clean up his mess and cover his tracks.
 &HT;    Both conclusions are right, of course, and thanks to Starr,
during this era of relative peace and prosperity, some very painful
divisions will fracture the body politic before the matter is put
to rest.

Service guards to testify, up to the Supreme Court trying to get
hold of the notes of the lawyer for the late Vince Foster. Starr
pushed normal prosecutorial practices to the limit by calling
Lewinsky's mother before the grand jury.
 &HT;    It all reflected a big change in Starr. At some point, the
reserved appellate lawyer decided he would do whatever it took
within the limits of the law to squeeze people for his
investigations. He had come to realize that the White House was
going to do what defense lawyers almost always do during criminal
investigations: delay, stall, buy time.
 &HT;    What was the turning point for Starr? His assistant prosecutors
cannot pinpoint it, and who knows if even Starr can. This much is
clear: By the time Lewinsky appeared on the scene, he was poised
for an all-out assault. As to whether he was overzealous and
irresponsible or was simply ``becoming a prosecutor,'' as Rusty
Hardin, his former colleague at the beginning of the Whitewater
investigation believes _ that will depend on what is in his final
report.
 &HT;    What we do know is that Starr was willing to drive on when so
many other prosecutors would have stopped.
 &HT;    Part of the reason is Starr's legal temperament. All his
professional life, before reaching a decision, he has doggedly
pursued every last fact. His friends say it over and over: ``Ken is
determined that no one will defeat him by outworking him.''
 &HT;    As solicitor general in the Bush administration, the first case
he argued before the Supreme Court was an old-fashioned
civil-rights matter left over from the Carter era that forced the
City of Yonkers to remedy past discrimination by racially balancing
its public housing and schools. That couldn't have been a case
Starr had much political sympathy for, and yet his aides remember
his exhaustive preparation.
 &HT;    When he lost, says Robert Shapiro, a former deputy solicitor
general, ``Ken took it very hard.'' He hates to lose.
 &HT;    Starr also has a scholarly, at times pedantic, love for the law
and is genuinely offended that anyone, let alone the president of
the United States, would denigrate it. In his May ``Atticus Finch''
speech at the Charlotte, N.C., bar association, invoking the
beloved character in ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' Starr warned that
the single biggest problem facing lawyers today is ``loss of
respect for the truth.''
 &HT;    While Starr wants to be liked, he was also raised to have
confidence in his beliefs even if most people don't agree. A detail
such as a 19 percent approval rating in the polls isn't going to
deter Starr.
 &HT;    As for his career, he had little at stake anymore. When he tried
to leave the independent counsel's job in 1997 to be a dean at
Pepperdine University, he changed his mind a few days after the
announcement due to an uproar from the press and his prosecutors;
he couldn't escape. His great dream, the Supreme Court, had long
passed. His next most likely steps _ academia and corporate law _
are assured no matter how this investigation turns out.
 &HT;    Indeed, a senior partner at Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, Thomas Yannucci,
who is close to him, says that Starr, despite taking an unpaid
leave of absence from the firm in July, plans to return when this
is all over. In what may be the understatement of the year,
Yannucci says, ``Now that he's taken on his public duty, I don't
think he has the same view of public service.''
 &HT;    Did Starr come to hate the president _ did that drive him too?
The answer is probably yes, although not at first, and not until he
felt that the White House was stonewalling. I asked John Bates, a
deputy prosecutor from 1995 to 1997, whether Starr hates Clinton.
 &HT;    Bates was quiet a long time and then gave an answer so
convoluted that I stopped taking notes. I asked again, Did Starr
hate Clinton? ``I think Ken is very upset at how personal and
political the attacks on him, the office and others in the office
have become,'' he said.
 &HT;    Did moral outrage at Clinton's sexual escapades also fuel
Starr's investigation? Lawyers who have sat with him at meetings
when these details were discussed say they could tell that Starr
was offended.
 &HT;    But when asked for a single example, a single comment or
outburst, they could not provide one. They answered that it was
subtle, in the wrinkle of an eyebrow or a quiet grimace. They had
heard his deputies make lewd remarks, but not Starr; he was too
professional for that.
 &HT;    We do know that Starr was raised to take a hard line against
such behavior. When his mother was asked for this article what she
wanted Americans to think of her son, she answered, ``I want them
to think of a man who believes in doing right and a man who does
not cheat on his wife, like Clinton has on his wife.''
 &HT;    All this said, in the end Starr's motives no longer matter. That
is his victory, his measure of vindication. It no longer matters if
malicious right-wingers consorted with his office to lay a trap for
the president, if prudishness or ambition or even radio waves from
outer space drove Ken Starr. The president has admitted misleading
the American public. He lied. Through Starr's doggedness, his
relentless effort to amass every last fact, he has succeeded in
making his investigation about Bill Clinton, not about Ken Starr.
 &HT;    All Clinton's life, the man from Hope has relied on his brains,
his charm, his boyishness, his uncanny political instincts, his
superhuman energy to squeeze through tight spots. Not this time.
This time Starr built such a wall of facts that Clinton had no
place to go. On Aug. 17, 1998, at 10 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time,
Clinton hit that wall. It was not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    Which is not to say that Starr has scored his total and complete
victory. This may or may not turn out to be about obstructing
justice, but regardless, it is lots and lots about sex, and no one
wins when such private matters are made public.
 &HT;    All who became embroiled in the Lewinsky case _ the White House,
the press and the prosecutors, too _ dirtied themselves. When Starr
needed someone to show the American public that he was acting
fairly, he hired the Watergate hero Sam Dash as his ethics adviser.
Within Starr's office, Dash is referred to as ``our secret
weapon.''
 &HT;    A generation from now, if there is another president who needs
investigating, will the special prosecutor of that era hire Starr
as his secret weapon? Not likely.
 &HT;    Once Starr drops his report at Congress's door, the nation's
attention will be riveted on Clinton. It'll be (ital)just the
facts(end ital). People laughed at Starr when he once compared
himself to Sgt. Joe Friday, but it turns out he was right, he did
have something in common with the ``Dragnet'' cop.
 &HT;    In making the decision on what should be done with Bill Clinton
_ drop the matter? censure? impeachment? _ some in Congress will
choose along partisan lines, a few will look into their own
personal lives, but most will stick their fingers into the wind and
check the public-opinion polls. The citizenry will decide. Starr
has forced Americans to confront every last prurient fact, right
down to the presidential DNA.
 &HT;    There are those who will say that half the marriages in America
end in divorce, that if every spouse who lied about sex had to
confess on TV, the testimony would fill 500 cable channels for 500
years, that this is a matter between the Clintons and that what
Bill Clinton has already publicly admitted to is more than we would
ask of any other human being.
 &HT;    And there are those who will say it is shameful for a president
with Clinton's history to be arrogant enough to carry on a sexual
affair with a 21-year-old right in the White House, lie about it
and then take advantage of his good friends and aides by using them
to clean up his mess and cover his tracks.
 &HT;    Both conclusions are right, of course, and thanks to Starr,
during this era of relative peace and prosperity, some very painful
divisions will fracture the body politic before the matter is put
to rest.

   &UR; Given the continuing interest in the persona and probe of
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, we are rereleasing the following
series from The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART I: ``What Drives Ken Starr?'' (1,500 words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During his early career, Ken Starr, a minister's son, was
considered too bland, cautious and reserved to have political
enemies. But Starr changed into a prosecutor so relentless that he
drove a U.S. president to admit his sins on national television.
What changed Starr is unclear. By now, however, Starr's character
has forever altered President Clinton's destiny. (slugged:
BC-STARR-CLINTON-PROBE-ONE-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART II: ``Ken Starr's Passions: Religion, Politics and the
Supreme Court'' (2,200 words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' says a childhood friend,
recalling Ken Starr's religious upbringing _ no drinking, smoking,
dancing or musical instruments in church. It didn't keep Starr from
becoming fascinated with politics, though, and campaigning for
Nixon and Goldwater. Beyond that, Starr's driving ambition, one
that now he will never attain, was to become chief justice of the
Supreme Court. (slugged: STARR-CLINTON-PROBE-TWO- NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART III: ``Ken Starr's Search for Truth'' (1,600 words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Ken Starr compared himself to Joe Friday, the detective on
TV's erstwhile ``Dragnet'' _``just the facts, ma'am; only the
facts'' _ it seemed laughable. But today, a search for truth is
probably one of the most charitable interpretations that can be
made of his dogged pursuit of President Clinton. (slugged:
STARR-CLINTON-PROBE-THREE-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART IV: ``The Shadow Bill Clinton Can't Shake'' (1,550
words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr has been willing to drive on in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation long after many other prosecutors would have stopped.
Some say he is driven by hate, others by religious values, others
by moral outrage at Clinton's escapades, others by his legal
temperament and love of the law. But at this point Starr's motives
are secondary. The question is, What is to be done with President
Clinton, and how badly has the whole affair fractured the American
body politic? (slugged: STARR-CLINTON- PROBE-FOUR-NYTSF)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We lavish time and money on our houses. We decorate the rooms,
paint the walls and clean the carpets. We mow the yard and replace
the roof.
</P>
<P>
   We spend more dollars on our houses than we do on anything else.
Yet, just about the time we retire and are ready to spend quality
time in our homes, they turn on us faster than a disgruntled teen.
We're left with an overabundance of bedrooms, steep stairs and a
time-consuming lawn. At best, our houses become hostile
environments. At worst, death traps.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the house that will age gracefully with us? Will we
have to remodel? Move, or, God forbid, live with the kids? Who is
building for our future?
</P>
<P>
   A savvy few in the building industries _ architects, builders,
remodelers _ are beginning to cater to the inevitably aging
boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Greg Davis, Fort Worth home builder. He looks over the
landscape and sees retirees rattling around multistory behemoths
that are too big for two people.
</P>
<P>
   He can envision the enormous herd of boomers sliding down the
time line, reaching retirement, getting a little arthritic and
crotchety. He wants to be there for them.
</P>
<P>
   He suspects they will want a small house, one that is easy to
take care of. He also knows they will want a splendid kitchen, a
huge master bedroom and luxurious bath _ it's what they are used
to. Boomers are a self-indulgent lot.
</P>
<P>
   As for lots _ they'd like theirs on a golf course, with a
magnificent view. They'd also feel safer if there was a huge gated
fence surrounding their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is accommodating. He has just completed the first of 13
homes under 2,000 square feet and with expensive appointments on
the Lost Creek golf course west of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell people they're going to grow old and go to a
nursing home,'' said Davis, who came to elder-awareness when his
in-laws began looking for a house.
</P>
<P>
   He realized ``we need to make houses that are designed to fit
their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Association of the Remodeling
Industry, the market needs homes with accessible floor plans to
accommodate disabilities and impaired mobility. The association
says 30 percent of baby boomers currently buy remodeling services,
spending $130 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers will do whatever is necessary to make their homes
as comfortable as possible,'' said Brett Martin, a spokesman for
the association.
</P>
<P>
   The boomers are 76 million strong, but weakening. They are
getting a little gimpy and wishing they had bought a single-story
house instead of a 2-story one. Mature buyers are the
fastest-growing market segment and will be for the next 10 years,
the remodeling industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   These numbers have not gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Dallas Convention Center, at the recent International
Builders Show, a house was built that addressed the fluid needs of
family _ from a loud and busy place with parents and teens to a
quiet retreat for a single empty-nester who needs in-home nursing
care.
</P>
<P>
   The Life Stages Home, built, decorated, disassembled and
reconstructed on the convention floor, was based on results of a
study commissioned by Masco Corp., which makes building products,
and Builder Magazine. The survey indicated that buyers want a home
flexible enough to allow them to age in place. The builder,
magazine employees, architects from Devereaux &AMP; Associates and the
pros at Fleetwood Homes wrestled with the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Space and accessibility were the most obvious solutions. For
example: The master bedroom with a kitchenette and bath area is
adjacent to a study. This portion of the house can be a
self-contained apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The wall between the two children's bedrooms can be easily
removed to make an apartment-size space for a live-in caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   All the home's cabinetry is height-adjustable, as are many
counters, to accommodate wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   The split garage with room for two cars can become a single
garage and hobby room. As people age, they often reduce the number
of vehicles they possess.
</P>
<P>
   They also indulge their extracurricular interests, commandeering
their children's bedrooms in the process. There was a time when
little Tiffany's bedroom would become a shrine to Tiffany's
childhood. Not any more. Tiffany's canopy bed is out and a darkroom
or painting studio is installed.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Benson is adding a painting studio to her Mistletoe
Heights home in Fort Worth. When her children left for college, she
and her husband considered buying a new home, but with nine years
of renovations already done to her house, she couldn't bear to
begin again. ``I didn't want another house, or to move. There are
so many good things about this one, we decided to stay,'' Benson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, they began remodeling, calling in architect
Richard Wintersole. They added a master bath upstairs and then
began discussing the painting studio. Benson is getting exactly the
house she wants by staying put. ``I want to live in this house
forever,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wintersole is familiar with that sentiment. Several generations
of the Bodycomb family want to live in the same house at Fort
Worth's Eagle Mountain Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '60s, Ross Bodycomb, the family patriarch, staked a
claim on the shores of the lake. He built a basic ranch house on a
breathtaking lot and there he and his wife raised their family.
Eventually, after his wife died and his children were grown, he
gave the house to his son, Michael, and married the lady next door.
</P>
<P>
   Michael and his wife, Rosalyn, hired Wintersole to add a
2,000-foot addition to the house. It included a master bedroom, a
painting studio for her and a photography studio for him. Not long
afterward, Ross' second wife died and he was left homeless. ``We
had to do something immediately,'' said Michael.
</P>
<P>
   It could have become one of those nasty family feuds that ends
up on the afternoon television sleaze-fests. Instead, Michael
called Wintersole. ``We need a place for Dad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wintersole designed a small, one-bedroom house for Ross on a
triangular piece of land between the big house and Ross' old
workshop. He has a bedroom, living room, bath and kitchen in less
than 1,000 square feet. ``The budget was meager,'' said Wintersole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my father feels real lucky,'' said Michael. ``My
brother lives not far away, the family sort of stayed intact.''

 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    When Beth Faragher went to college in Florida, she found a
part-time job that appeared to her a dream come true: lifeguarding
on the beach at Boca Raton.
 &HT;    From 1985 to 1990, Faragher worked steadily as one of a
half-dozen women on a force of 50. All worked from a single-story
beachfront building with a unisex locker room and a lone shower.
All the supervisors in the organization, which was run along
paramilitary lines, were men.
 &HT;    Recently, Faragher recalled the turmoil of her Baywatch years as
a Boca Raton lifeguard. Both of her immediate supervisors _
``Chief'' Bill Terry and ``Lieutenant'' David Silverman _ sexually
harassed the female lifeguards. ``They touched us,'' she recalls.
``They would grab your buttocks or around your waist. I was tackled
... on the beach'' by Silverman, she says. If her body were more
appealing, he taunted, he might have deigned to have sex with her.
 &HT;    On June 26, 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that this was
no innocent horseplay, ruling in Faragher's favor in the lawsuit
she had filed against the city of Boca Raton in 1992. The two men,
who were 10 to 20 years older than the women they supervised, had
abused their authority, the court said.
 &HT;    For fear of losing their jobs, Faragher and the other female
lifeguards did not complain to the city of Boca Raton until after
they left its employment. And so the issue that brought Faragher to
the Supreme Court was not whether she had been sexually harassed _
the city acknowledged, and the courts quickly ruled, that she had.
It was whether, even though Faragher had made no formal complaint,
her employer could be held liable for the actions taken by Terry
and Silverman, two low-level managers at a municipal outpost far
from city hall.
 &HT;    Last summer, when they issued their opinion on Faragher vs. City
of Boca Raton, seven of the nine Supreme Court justices concluded
that, under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act _ which
prohibits discrimination by race, creed, ethnicity or sex _ the
city was indeed liable for the treatment that Faragher suffered.
 &HT;    Faragher, now 33, received the news in a Denver courtroom, where
she works as a public defender. In the time it took for her case to
wind its way through the judicial system, Faragher had finished law
school and passed the bar. For all her trouble, she won only the
nominal, symbolic award of $1. But ``I was happy,'' she says.
``Happy that others will not have to go through what I did.''
 &HT;    Faragher's case was one of four sexual harassment disputes the
justices agreed to hear during the 1997-98 term. In a companion
case on the day of the Faragher decision, the court also ruled for
Kimberly Ellerth, who during 15 months as a Chicago salesperson for
Burlington Industries, a national fabric manufacturer, was told by
her boss that the way she dressed and responded to his suggestive
remarks about her breasts and legs would determine whether her life
at the company was ``very hard or very easy.''
 &HT;    In both cases, the court made it clear that employers who fail
to mount an aggressive campaign to root out sexual harassment can
be held liable for the actions of even the most junior and
low-level managers, even if the victims never alert management
about what is happening on the job site. With those twin decisions,
the court sought to bring clarity and order to a turbulent and
emotionally charged field of jurisprudence.
 &HT;    In another 1998 case, Oncale vs. Sundowner Offshore Services
Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that employees could suffer sexual
harassment from members of the same sex. Joseph Oncale, a Louisiana
roustabout, claimed that he was sexually harassed by male coworkers
on an oil rig. But in writing the majority opinion, Justice Anton
Scalia called on Americans to employ ``common sense and an
appropriate sensitivity to social context'' or run the risk of
establishing a mandatory national ``civility code.''
 &HT;    It remains to be seen if American men and women will find
clarity in the law or further strife. The court's recent actions
have sent a tremor through the offices of the nation's corporate
lawyers, who have moved zealously to protect their clients _
drawing up lists of behavioral do's and don'ts, posting conduct
codes for employees, calling for sensitivity seminars, and
instructing managers to err on the side of caution.
 &HT;    The court's critics contend that the warnings being posted
across the country will actually serve to chill the workplace and
spur new divisiveness at job sites, where men and women are already
struggling to define the difference between flirtation and
harassment, humor and humiliation.
 &HT;    Consider Jerold Mackenzie, who was fired by the Miller Brewing
Co. after 19 years with the firm for relating the racy punch line
of a ``Seinfeld'' episode to a female coworker; a Milwaukee judge
ultimately concluded that Miller had wrongfully terminated
Mackenzie's career.
 &HT;    Should Tom Pierce have been demoted by the Commonwealth Life
Insurance Co. for exchanging off-color greeting cards with a
reciprocating female subordinate?
 &HT;    Was a married Christian student justified in suing a California
college when his psychology class had a lesbian professor give a
guest lecture on masturbation?
 &HT;    ``It gives feminism a bad name when men (or women) are fired for
merely talking about sex at work. In my view, it is misguided to
attempt to banish all hints of sexuality from the workplace,'' says
Vicki Schultz, a Yale law professor, in an April 1998 article in
the Yale Law Journal.
 &HT;    In some ways, feminists have become victims of their own
success. Emboldened by their triumphs, feminist scholars and
spokeswomen have pushed the theoretical envelope. They are
questioning whether, because of the ``power differential,'' there
can ever be a truly consensual sexual relationship between a female
employee and a male supervisor _ or even between male and female
coworkers. In a male-dominated society, some feminist theorists
ask, is not any sexual relationship an act of predation that
precludes the concept of consent?
 &HT;    Such theoretical musings are easily caricatured, leaving
feminist scholars vulnerable to academic attack and political
backlash. ``It is the feminist project to say that the relationship
between the sexes is like that which exists between races,'' says
Jeremy Rabkin, a professor of government at Cornell University and
a critic of the current state of sexual harassment law. But ``that
viewpoint is fundamentally insane . . . basically crazy.''
 &HT;    ``Yes, there is a lot of misogyny. Some men can be horrible. But
we don't have an entire culture like that . . . not like the racist
culture that used to exist in the South,'' says Rabkin.
 &HT;    Schultz contends that the preoccupation with issues of sexuality
overshadow more pressing problems, such as the disparity of pay
between men and women, the ``glass ceilings'' that keep women from
being promoted, the furious attempts by men to carve out bastions
of ``masculine competence and authority'' in high-paying fields of
employment, the patronizing attitudes toward women that exist in
many offices and job sites, and the hazing, taunting, stereotyping
and even sabotage experienced by some women workers.
 &HT;    Much of the hostility women endure at work ``is neither driven
by the desire for sexual relations nor even sexual in content,''
Schultz argues. ``It was important for courts to recognize that
gender discrimination can take the form of sexual overtures. But
... by emphasizing sexual abuse, the paradigm threatened to eclipse
other, equally harmful forms of gender-based hostility.''
 &HT;    The raging policy debate over sexual harassment, the corporate
and legal excesses and the continuing uncertainty in the lower
courts _ an eight-judge appeals panel passed the Ellerth case to
the Supreme Court with eight individual opinions _ gave the Supreme
Court reason to readdress the issue. Because Congress passed such a
broad prohibition against sex discrimination, it has largely been
up to the courts and executive agencies to define the terms
``discrimination'' and ``sexual harassment.''
 &HT;    ``One would think that all of these questions would have been
better addressed in a legislative rather than a judicial forum,''
says Douglas Kmiec, a legal scholar at the University of Notre
Dame. ``But I suppose it is better that they be addressed somewhere
than not at all.''
 &HT;    Thus the decisions in Faragher, Ellerth and Oncale. In the first
two cases, the court ruled that an employee may successfully sue
for damages even if the victim suffered no loss of pay or promotion
and did not alert higher-ups by filing a complaint. Employers can
avoid liability, the court said, by offering the ``affirmative
defense'' of adopting aggressive corporate policies and procedures
to stamp out sexual harassment in the workplace and dealing with
complaints via an open, fair reporting process.
 &HT;    In the Oncale decision, the court strove to craft a ``common
sense'' definition of sexual harassment. ``Title VII does not
prohibit all verbal or physical harassment in the workplace,'' the
court ruled. ``We have never held that workplace harassment, even
harassment between men and women, is automatically discrimination
because of sex merely because the words used have sexual content or
connotations.''
 &HT;    The ``critical issue,'' said the court, was ``whether members of
one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of
employment to which members of the other sex are not.'' A victim
``must always prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged
with offensive sexual connotations, but actually constituted
`discrimination.' ''
 &HT;    Nor does Title VII prohibit ``genuine but innocuous differences
in the ways men and women routinely interact with members of the
same sex and of the opposite sex,'' the court declared. ``The
prohibition of harassment on the basis of sex requires neither
asexuality nor androgyny in the workplace ... courts and juries
(must) not mistake ordinary socializing in the workplace _ such as
male-on-male horseplay or intersexual flirtation _ for
discriminatory conditions of employment.''
 &HT;    The court concluded by pleading (in an example of either hope or
naivete) that lawyers and juries and coworkers take into account
the context of each snigger, joke or pat on the butt.
 &HT;    ``A professional football player's working environment,'' Scalia
wrote, ``is not severely or pervasively abusive, for example, if
the coach smacks him on the buttocks as he heads onto the field _
even if the same behavior would reasonably be experienced as
abusive by the coach's secretary (male or female) back at the
office.
 &HT;    ``The real social impact of workplace behavior often depends on
a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and
relationships which are not fully captured by a simple recitation
of the words used or the physical act performed,'' said Scalia.
``Common sense, and an appropriate sensitivity to social context,
will enable courts and juries to distinguish between simple teasing
or roughhousing ... and conduct which a reasonable person in the
plaintiff's position would find severely hostile or abusive.''
 &HT;    Scalia's opinion sounds downright plaintive, in its call for
this litigious society to chill out and use some common sense. But
perhaps Americans will hear the court's plea.

 &HT;    
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    When Beth Faragher went to college in Florida, she found a
part-time job that appeared to her a dream come true: lifeguarding
on the beach at Boca Raton.
 &HT;    From 1985 to 1990, Faragher worked steadily as one of a
half-dozen women on a force of 50. All worked from a single-story
beachfront building with a unisex locker room and a lone shower.
All the supervisors in the organization, which was run along
paramilitary lines, were men.
 &HT;    Recently, Faragher recalled the turmoil of her Baywatch years as
a Boca Raton lifeguard. Both of her immediate supervisors _
``Chief'' Bill Terry and ``Lieutenant'' David Silverman _ sexually
harassed the female lifeguards. ``They touched us,'' she recalls.
``They would grab your buttocks or around your waist. I was tackled
... on the beach'' by Silverman, she says. If her body were more
appealing, he taunted, he might have deigned to have sex with her.
 &HT;    On June 26, 1998, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that this was
no innocent horseplay, ruling in Faragher's favor in the lawsuit
she had filed against the city of Boca Raton in 1992. The two men,
who were 10 to 20 years older than the women they supervised, had
abused their authority, the court said.
 &HT;    For fear of losing their jobs, Faragher and the other female
lifeguards did not complain to the city of Boca Raton until after
they left its employment. And so the issue that brought Faragher to
the Supreme Court was not whether she had been sexually harassed _
the city acknowledged, and the courts quickly ruled, that she had.
It was whether, even though Faragher had made no formal complaint,
her employer could be held liable for the actions taken by Terry
and Silverman, two low-level managers at a municipal outpost far
from city hall.
 &HT;    Last summer, when they issued their opinion on Faragher vs. City
of Boca Raton, seven of the nine Supreme Court justices concluded
that, under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act _ which
prohibits discrimination by race, creed, ethnicity or sex _ the
city was indeed liable for the treatment that Faragher suffered.
 &HT;    Faragher, now 33, received the news in a Denver courtroom, where
she works as a public defender. In the time it took for her case to
wind its way through the judicial system, Faragher had finished law
school and passed the bar. For all her trouble, she won only the
nominal, symbolic award of $1. But ``I was happy,'' she says.
``Happy that others will not have to go through what I did.''
 &HT;    Faragher's case was one of four sexual harassment disputes the
justices agreed to hear during the 1997-98 term. In a companion
case on the day of the Faragher decision, the court also ruled for
Kimberly Ellerth, who during 15 months as a Chicago salesperson for
Burlington Industries, a national fabric manufacturer, was told by
her boss that the way she dressed and responded to his suggestive
remarks about her breasts and legs would determine whether her life
at the company was ``very hard or very easy.''
 &HT;    In both cases, the court made it clear that employers who fail
to mount an aggressive campaign to root out sexual harassment can
be held liable for the actions of even the most junior and
low-level managers, even if the victims never alert management
about what is happening on the job site. With those twin decisions,
the court sought to bring clarity and order to a turbulent and
emotionally charged field of jurisprudence.
 &HT;    In another 1998 case, Oncale vs. Sundowner Offshore Services
Inc., the Supreme Court ruled that employees could suffer sexual
harassment from members of the same sex. Joseph Oncale, a Louisiana
roustabout, claimed that he was sexually harassed by male coworkers
on an oil rig. But in writing the majority opinion, Justice Anton
Scalia called on Americans to employ ``common sense and an
appropriate sensitivity to social context'' or run the risk of
establishing a mandatory national ``civility code.''
 &HT;    It remains to be seen if American men and women will find
clarity in the law or further strife. The court's recent actions
have sent a tremor through the offices of the nation's corporate
lawyers, who have moved zealously to protect their clients _
drawing up lists of behavioral do's and don'ts, posting conduct
codes for employees, calling for sensitivity seminars, and
instructing managers to err on the side of caution.
 &HT;    The court's critics contend that the warnings being posted
across the country will actually serve to chill the workplace and
spur new divisiveness at job sites, where men and women are already
struggling to define the difference between flirtation and
harassment, humor and humiliation.
 &HT;    Consider Jerold Mackenzie, who was fired by the Miller Brewing
Co. after 19 years with the firm for relating the racy punch line
of a ``Seinfeld'' episode to a female coworker; a Milwaukee judge
ultimately concluded that Miller had wrongfully terminated
Mackenzie's career.
 &HT;    Should Tom Pierce have been demoted by the Commonwealth Life
Insurance Co. for exchanging off-color greeting cards with a
reciprocating female subordinate?
 &HT;    Was a married Christian student justified in suing a California
college when his psychology class had a lesbian professor give a
guest lecture on masturbation?
 &HT;    ``It gives feminism a bad name when men (or women) are fired for
merely talking about sex at work. In my view, it is misguided to
attempt to banish all hints of sexuality from the workplace,'' says
Vicki Schultz, a Yale law professor, in an April 1998 article in
the Yale Law Journal.
 &HT;    In some ways, feminists have become victims of their own
success. Emboldened by their triumphs, feminist scholars and
spokeswomen have pushed the theoretical envelope. They are
questioning whether, because of the ``power differential,'' there
can ever be a truly consensual sexual relationship between a female
employee and a male supervisor _ or even between male and female
coworkers. In a male-dominated society, some feminist theorists
ask, is not any sexual relationship an act of predation that
precludes the concept of consent?
 &HT;    Such theoretical musings are easily caricatured, leaving
feminist scholars vulnerable to academic attack and political
backlash. ``It is the feminist project to say that the relationship
between the sexes is like that which exists between races,'' says
Jeremy Rabkin, a professor of government at Cornell University and
a critic of the current state of sexual harassment law. But ``that
viewpoint is fundamentally insane . . . basically crazy.''
 &HT;    ``Yes, there is a lot of misogyny. Some men can be horrible. But
we don't have an entire culture like that . . . not like the racist
culture that used to exist in the South,'' says Rabkin.
 &HT;    Schultz contends that the preoccupation with issues of sexuality
overshadow more pressing problems, such as the disparity of pay
between men and women, the ``glass ceilings'' that keep women from
being promoted, the furious attempts by men to carve out bastions
of ``masculine competence and authority'' in high-paying fields of
employment, the patronizing attitudes toward women that exist in
many offices and job sites, and the hazing, taunting, stereotyping
and even sabotage experienced by some women workers.
 &HT;    Much of the hostility women endure at work ``is neither driven
by the desire for sexual relations nor even sexual in content,''
Schultz argues. ``It was important for courts to recognize that
gender discrimination can take the form of sexual overtures. But
... by emphasizing sexual abuse, the paradigm threatened to eclipse
other, equally harmful forms of gender-based hostility.''
 &HT;    The raging policy debate over sexual harassment, the corporate
and legal excesses and the continuing uncertainty in the lower
courts _ an eight-judge appeals panel passed the Ellerth case to
the Supreme Court with eight individual opinions _ gave the Supreme
Court reason to readdress the issue. Because Congress passed such a
broad prohibition against sex discrimination, it has largely been
up to the courts and executive agencies to define the terms
``discrimination'' and ``sexual harassment.''
 &HT;    ``One would think that all of these questions would have been
better addressed in a legislative rather than a judicial forum,''
says Douglas Kmiec, a legal scholar at the University of Notre
Dame. ``But I suppose it is better that they be addressed somewhere
than not at all.''
 &HT;    Thus the decisions in Faragher, Ellerth and Oncale. In the first
two cases, the court ruled that an employee may successfully sue
for damages even if the victim suffered no loss of pay or promotion
and did not alert higher-ups by filing a complaint. Employers can
avoid liability, the court said, by offering the ``affirmative

HOT CEREALS EVEN CHILDREN LIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. LANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gruel is certainly not something many Americans would want on
their breakfast tables. The very word has an unpleasant
association; the British use the expression `taking one's gruel' to
describe accepting punishment. Yet gruel, in its modern guise as a
hot cereal, is the essence of comfort food.
</P>
<P>
   The gruel of my childhood in Sweden was made from wheat flour,
and for me it conjures only pleasant memories. My mother cooked
this white porridge with milk, energetically whisking the mixture
until it thickened. The result, a richer dish than the watery gray
gruel of Dickens fame, was set before me in a big soup plate, which
I sprinkled liberally with sugar.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure whether the magical flavor of that gruel derived
from the sugar or from the faintly burnt taste contributed by the
charred birch whisk my mother used in vain attempts to keep the
gruel from scorching the bottom of the pot. Whatever the case, I
have never been able to duplicate that remarkable flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The hot cereal many Americans grew up with is oatmeal, which is
a step up _ or down, depending on the cook and your taste _ from
wheaten gruel. Of course, oatmeal, especially the Irish oatmeal,
can be rather creamy and rich when cooked in milk.
</P>
<P>
   But on the negative side, I had an aunt whose oatmeal was
positively primordial, yet in our family it was considered rude to
decline a generous bowlful. That would have been futile, anyway, as
at her house leftover oatmeal was bound to reappear at the evening
meal, fried _ a nightmare of breakfasts' past.
</P>
<P>
   Few children today face such traumatic food experiences. In
fact, offered a proliferation of colorful, crunchy,
action-character-driven breakfasts, they are not easily enticed by
traditional hot cereals. Nor, of course, can many parents take the
time to make a cooked-from-scratch, stick-to-the-ribs breakfast
when the whole family is running off to school and work.
</P>
<P>
   Large food companies know this, and try to mix entertainment
with ease of preparation. Witness the Quaker Oats instant oatmeal
in which tiny edible dinosaurs hatch from eggs before the
youngsters' eyes in their breakfast bowls. The child in me found
these toys mildly amusing, though I thought there were far too many
red stegosaurus and too few green Tyrannosaurus rexes. But the
flavor of the cereal itself, for me, didn't measure up. The same
could be said for just about all of the hot cereals _ cream of
wheat, cream of rye, cream of rice, oatmeal and Wheatena _ that are
made from packages, though many are improved if cooked with milk
instead of water. (A breakfast risotto with berries like the one
served at Norma's in the Parker Meridien in Manhattan is another
story: it starts with a pint of cream.)
</P>
<P>
   Noting the quantity of sugar that our son Revell was sprinkling
on his cream of wheat one morning, I suggested to him that perhaps
the proportion of sugar to cereal should not exceed two to one. To
which he replied: ``You miss the point, Dad. I think of the cereal
as just a carrier for the sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   He had something there. For most of us hot cereal eaters, the
icing really makes the breakfast. That thought led to creating my
brown sugar nut cereal crumble: I toast three-quarters of a cup of
chopped pecans in a small pan over low heat, sprinkle them with a
cup of dark brown sugar and three-quarters of a cup of flour and
mix well, then stir in a stick of melted butter until it's
absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   The whole mix _ two and a half cups _ gets flattened with a
spatula, then cools in the pan before being refrigerated. Besides
flavor and texture, the nuts in the crumble add a bit more
nourishment to a bowl of cereal.
</P>
<P>
   As an added challenge, I decided to come up with a hot cereal
that Revell wouldn't hide beneath a decking of sugar. Mixing dry
oat bran cereal and cream of rye for crunchiness, sliced almonds
for even more crunch and dried cranberries and cream of coconut for
extra flavor did the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like this one'' was his comment as he ate the whole
thing _ without realizing he hadn't added any sugar.
</P>
<P>
   As popular as these cereals have become with my family, though,
I'm still trying to figure out my mother's method for scorching a
cereal to perfection. Sometimes, memories can outdo even the most
comforting comfort food. &QL;

 &HT;    BUSINESS SAVVY, REFUGEE BACKGROUND MAY ENDEAR PRINCESS RANIA TO
NEW GENERATION OF JORDANIANS
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ As a Palestinian refugee and former bank teller,
Jordan's Princess Rania has the hint of a Cinderella past.
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with her contemporary tastes and mind for business,
and she could someday make a very popular queen for a new
generation of Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, thin, striking beauty, she's hard to miss driving around
town in her own car, having coffee with the 20-something crowd at
one of Amman's trendy Internet sandwich shops or picking up her two
children -- 4-year-old Hussein and 2-year-old Iman -- from
preschool.
</P>
<P>
   But, that will change. Her husband, 37-year-old Abdullah, became
King of Jordan this week after the death of the legendary King
Hussein. Hussein, died after a seven-month battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rania stood in a receiving line with the other women
in Hussein's extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a tissue in one hand, she looked tired and downcast as
she kissed the cheeks of hundreds of women coming to offer
condolences. Towering over most of her well-wishers, she wore a
dark suit and her brown hair poked out from the front of her white
head scarf, which is customary wear for women in Moslem mourning
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Near her was Hussein's widow, Queen Noor. They are friends, but
it is too soon to tell whether Rania will someday be a queen
herself.
</P>
<P>
   While there can be two queens -- as in England, or in Jordan
before the death of Hussein's mother -- it is a decision for the
king and the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein was married four times and two of his wives were
never queens. The two who were could be instructive examples for
Rania.
</P>
<P>
   The blonde, American-born Noor has acquired fame internationally
but been coolly received in Jordan's traditional culture. Before
her was Queen Alia, who died in a helicopter crash in 1977. She is
still recalled fondly, in part because she was Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians make up a majority of Jordan's 4.4 million people.
Rania's family, considered well-known and well-educated, left its
town in the West Bank after Israel captured the territory in the
1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million of Jordan's Palestinians still live in
refugee camps, but just as many are well-integrated into Jordanian
society. Indeed, some help form its upper classes. Rania's father,
for example, is a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Her family members have a double-refugee experience. They
originally left the West Bank for Kuwait, where Rania grew up. When
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat sided with Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, more than 300,000 Palestinians were expelled and
many went to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Rania, with degree in business from the American University in
Cairo, worked in marketing at a computer company and as a teller
for a bank in Amman. She had a reputation for being friendly and
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Juma worked with Rania at the computer company. Like most
Jordanians, he declined to be interviewed Tuesday while still
mourning Hussein's death. He did say, however, that Rania is ``a
smart business woman and is career-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Rania met Abdullah at a business reception. The prince fell for
the beautiful woman especially hard, friends say, because she did
not throw herself at him as did so many others.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Jordanian television would show King Hussein drive
Abdullah to the apartment building where Rania lived with her
parents. It was an upper middle-class building, but neighbors still

 &HT;    YELTSIN'S TRIP TO KING'S FUNERAL RAISES MORE QUESTIONS AT HOME
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 400 words.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin, sidelined by illnesses for
months, chose King Hussein's funeral as an opportunity to remind
Russians and the world that he is not yet dead.
</P>
<P>
   Not dead, but seemingly close, Russia's press responded Tuesday
in unflattering coverage of Yeltsin's surprise trip to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Pale, bloated and walking stiffly, Yeltsin, who turned 68 last
week, attended the royal funeral in Amman on Monday. But he
departed after spending only six hours in Jordan and received
medical treatment before boarding his plane to return to Moscow,
according to reports from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin officials insisted Tuesday that Yeltsin did not require
medical treatment and that his health was normal for a man
recovering from bleeding ulcers, which sent him to the hospital
last month.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the point, Yeltsin made an appearance at the
Kremlin on Tuesday -- only his third this year -- to demonstrate
his fitness. His aides boasted of plans for the president to visit
France and make other international trips in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage to his image was done, as reflected in coverage
Tuesday in the Russian media and the commentary from independent
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on the fact that the sickly Yeltsin did not stay for the
graveside service of King Hussein, the tabloid Moskovsky
Komsomolets said in its banner headline: ``Yeltsin did not make it
to the grave but was very close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's trip was widely viewed in Moscow as an attempt to
reassert his authority after months of illnesses that have kept him
in hospitals or recovering at his country home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world saw an old, unhealthy man,'' said Viktor Kremenyuk,
of the USA-Canada Institute, a Moscow think tank, part of the
Russian Academy of Sciences. ``He looked incapable of attending a
funeral much less running a country like Russia which is dealing
with an economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yeltsin's absence, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has been
handling the day-to-day affairs of state and has emerged as the
leading contender to replace Yeltsin when his term ends in
mid-2000. Primakov took over following the Aug. 17 economic
collapse and amid Yeltsin's recurring health problems since he had
heart bypass surgery in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In the sequestered intrigue that still marks Kremlin politics,
rumors were rampant late last week that Yeltsin may fire Primakov.
Government spokesmen were forced to issue strong denials that a
government shake-up was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov reportedly irked Yeltsin and his inner circle when he
proposed a series of government reforms that were viewed as seeking
to restrict the broad powers of the president. Primakov also has
launched an anti-corruption campaign which appears to target Boris
Berezovsky, a tycoon with close ties to Yeltsin's senior advisers.
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement of King Hussein's death on Sunday, the
government in Moscow said Primakov would be leading the Russian
delegation. A former foreign minister who speaks Arabic and met
often with the Jordanian king, Primakov seemed a likely
representative.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Kremlin confirmed that Yeltsin would go from
his convalescence at a sanitorium outside Moscow to Amman, against
his doctors orders, and Primakov would remain in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than allow Yevgeny Primakov a presidential aura, Boris
Yeltsin sacrificed his own health,'' the newspaper Sevodnya said
Tuesday of Yeltsin's trip to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin met briefly with President Clinton and other world
leaders before the start of the funeral on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided to show the world and the country that he -- and he
alone -- makes political decisions. Both in domestic and foreign
policy,'' said the daily business newspaper Kommersant.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Yevgeny Primakov has been the main violator of this
monopoly of the head of state in recent times, it is possible to
say Yeltsin decided finally to restore the status quo,'' the paper
added
</P>
<P>
   .

 &HT;    BUSINESS SAVVY, REFUGEE BACKGROUND MAY ENDEAR PRINCESS RANIA TO
NEW GENERATION OF JORDANIANS
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (l) Lifestyle
categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ As a Palestinian refugee and former bank teller,
Jordan's Princess Rania has the hint of a Cinderella past.
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with her contemporary tastes and mind for business,
and she could someday make a very popular queen for a new
generation of Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, thin, striking beauty, she's hard to miss driving around
town in her own car, having coffee with the 20-something crowd at
one of Amman's trendy Internet sandwich shops or picking up her two
children -- 4-year-old Hussein and 2-year-old Iman -- from
preschool.
</P>
<P>
   But, that will change. Her husband, 37-year-old Abdullah, became
King of Jordan this week after the death of the legendary King
Hussein. Hussein, died after a seven-month battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rania stood in a receiving line with the other women
in Hussein's extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a tissue in one hand, she looked tired and downcast as
she kissed the cheeks of hundreds of women coming to offer
condolences. Towering over most of her well-wishers, she wore a
dark suit and her brown hair poked out from the front of her white
head scarf, which is customary wear for women in Moslem mourning
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Near her was Hussein's widow, Queen Noor. They are friends, but
it is too soon to tell whether Rania will someday be a queen
herself.
</P>
<P>
   While there can be two queens -- as in England, or in Jordan
before the death of Hussein's mother -- it is a decision for the
king and the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein was married four times and two of his wives were
never queens. The two who were could be instructive examples for
Rania.
</P>
<P>
   The blonde, American-born Noor has acquired fame internationally
but been coolly received in Jordan's traditional culture. Before
her was Queen Alia, who died in a helicopter crash in 1977. She is
still recalled fondly, in part because she was Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians make up a majority of Jordan's 4.4 million people.
Rania's family, considered well-known and well-educated, left its
town in the West Bank after Israel captured the territory in the
1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million of Jordan's Palestinians still live in
refugee camps, but just as many are well-integrated into Jordanian
society. Indeed, some help form its upper classes. Rania's father,
for example, is a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Her family members have a double-refugee experience. They
originally left the West Bank for Kuwait, where Rania grew up. When
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat sided with Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, more than 300,000 Palestinians were expelled and
many went to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Rania, with degree in business from the American University in
Cairo, worked in marketing at a computer company and as a teller
for a bank in Amman. She had a reputation for being friendly and
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Juma worked with Rania at the computer company. Like most
Jordanians, he declined to be interviewed Tuesday while still
mourning Hussein's death. He did say, however, that Rania is ``a
smart business woman and is career-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Rania met Abdullah at a business reception. The prince fell for
the beautiful woman especially hard, friends say, because she did
not throw herself at him as did so many others.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Jordanian television would show King Hussein drive
Abdullah to the apartment building where Rania lived with her
parents. It was an upper middle-class building, but neighbors still
hung laundry on lines to dry. There, in the king's presence,
Abdullah asked her parents' permission to marry. The wedding was in
1993, and is remembered by guests for an Army buddy of Abdullah's
parachuting into the palace garden and cutting the wedding cake
with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   Rania is now the president of an organization that helps small
businesses and rural women generate income from handcrafts. She
also helped form a special police unit that handles spouse and
child abuse -- sensitive topics in conservative Jordan.

CHEESY VALENTINE SAYS IT BEST

   PHOENIX - Around this time of year, my husband starts to get
nervous.
</P>
<P>
   He stares at the TV screen, scanning commercials that flicker
back at him in color, whispering subliminal things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want that?'' he asks, pointing to some product he's
supposed to buy me for Valentine's Day if he really loves me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I really don't need a corn- and wart remover just
yet,'' I try to say soothingly. ``Why don't we wait until my toes
get to be the size of sausages?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about this?'' he calls to me five seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honey, those Victoria's Secret girls don't wear those wings
for real,'' I inform him. ``If I wore those underclothes, people
would start handing me calcium pills and making me eat yogurt. And
we both know I'm not Victoria's secret. I'm Rosie O'Donnell's
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to do!'' he finally said, throwing his hands
up. ``I'm feeling a lot of pressure here!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anything,'' I replied. ``Let's do what we did
last Valentine's Day. That was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me blankly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' I answered honestly. ``I don't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   My husband took a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like this game,'' he warned me. ``You are playing with
my mind and so is the capitalist machine! Tell me. Please. Just
tell me!''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' I said, trying to explain it to him as he lay
thrashing about on the floor, ``is that if you didn't make me cry,
then you did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped flailing for a moment and looked at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TV tells me that you want romance.'' he said. ``Don't
you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance?'' I answered. ``Romance to me is having both sour
cream and real butter on a baked potato. Romance is getting in the
shower quick enough that I don't catch a glimpse of my own
reflection. Romance is looking in the mirror every morning and
making sure that my gums haven't receded into my nostrils.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I hate Valentine's Day as much as my husband does.
In my opinion, ``romance'' is a scheme cooked up by jewelers,
florists and sex-toy stores that feeds on the weak, the lonely and
those of us who write out a weekly check to our therapists. I have
learned to dread Valentine's Day, since it was always more of a
bitter disappointment to me than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   It all started in the sixth grade, when my mother bought me a
box of Valentines from TG&AMP;Y. I searched out the perfect Holly
Hobbie Valentine for the boy I really super liked, Paul Ritchie. In
my best cursive handwriting, I signed the back, ``To Paul; Luv,
Laurie,'' and to be an even more alluring sixth-grader, dotted the
i's with puffy hearts.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand now how that kind of chilling message would be
enough for a boy to shy away from the love of an oily-headed
prepubescent girl, but I still don't think it reached the amount of
terror required for him to stand up during lunchtime and scream,
``I am NOT your boyfriend! I like Melissa Crow because she can sit
on her hair and she has horses!''
</P>
<P>
   During high school, I had a date on one Valentine's Day with an
older guy from LA who worked with me at a Pizza D'Amour (The Pizza
of Love) in the mall. When he pulled in front of my house that
night in a green Chevy van with the windows painted black, my
mother chased him away, waving a dishtowel and screaming ``Put it
in reverse and back it up, buddy! You're not getting your greasy
pizza paws on my kid, Mr. California!''
</P>
<P>
   In college, I wish I would have had enough sense to bring my
mother on all of my Valentine's dates, especially the ones when the
guy was already drunk when I went to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   One such fellow took me to dinner and proceeded to eat an entire
cheeseburger without the use of his hands. He would look up every
now and them, his face smeared with ketchup, meat flecks and chewed
up bits of lettuce, and simply grunt at me.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, tried as hard as I could to pretend that
everything was fine, saying things like, ``So, how long did it take
you to make the rainbow _ oh, I'm sorry, (begin ital) light prism
(end ital) _ in your living room out of beer bottles?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fascinating that you can play every REM song by
blowing into a beer bottle,'' ``It takes a certain kind of talent
to make a wind chime out of a beer bottle,'' and ``No, Todd, I
really don't think that will fit up your nose, being that it's a
beer bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   After I finished college, my luck didn't get much better. In
1994, my then-boyfriend announced that he couldn't do anything with
me on Valentine's Day because he was spending it with his ``other
girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What `other girlfriend'?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he answered quickly. ``the one I moved in with.''
</P>
<P>
   I was complaining to a friend of mine about the bad luck I've
had in the love-connection department when he sighed and looked at
me sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You girls just expect too much,'' he said. ``Men are simpler
than women; men don't have to invent problems to make their lives
more exciting. Women just don't understand how simple men are. They
shouldn't look for anything deeper, because there's nothing
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite those disturbing words of ``men's wisdom,'' I ended up
spending my next Valentine's Day with him, curled up under a
blanket, watching a (begin ital) COPS (end ital) marathon. For
dinner, he made me macaroni and cheese without milk or butter, and
although it was one of the worst things I've ever eaten, he used a
fork and lived with two other guys that I don't think he was
attracted to, so I only complained a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I looked at that same guy, curled up into a ball, tears
welling up in his brown little eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean that all you want for Valentine's Day,'' my husband
said, ``is a baked potato and a Water Pik?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not exactly,'' I answered, shaking my head. ``I have an idea.
Let's make some macaroni and cheese, snuggle under a blanket and
watch ``When Animals Attack Their Masters and Rip Their Faces
Off!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' he said, surprised. ``I'll even use milk and butter
this time!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' I said, thinking about it. ``You don't have to.'' &QL;

PATIENCE A VIRTUE OF `ENGLISH PATIENT' AUTHOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The process of setting up an interview with Michael Ondaatje has
an air of espionage about it, as if you are trying to make contact
with a man who does not want to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Messages go back and forth through intermediaries. The amount of
time you request is cut by half. You engage in a string of friendly
conversations with Ondaatje's agent and later Ondaatje's assistant,
but Ondaatje himself is nowhere to be found. Finally, mysteriously,
you are given a telephone number and told to send a fax at 3
o'clock on Sunday afternoon. Ondaatje will get it. He will try to
fit you in.
</P>
<P>
   All of this takes more than a week, and you begin to contemplate
the effects of celebrity on a literary novelist. You wonder whether
Ondaatje will say no, or whether, as with so many people who have
lived in the limelight, he simply expects to be pursued.
</P>
<P>
   When he calls, you learn that nothing is further from the truth.
He is gracious and self-effacing. He seems genuinely unseduced by
the attention and stature he has had since the publication of his
novel, ``The English Patient,'' which won England's coveted Booker
Prize in 1992 and was made into an Academy Award-winning film by
director Anthony Minghella and producer Saul Zaentz.
</P>
<P>
   He has not felt compelled to try to repeat his wild success; his
first book since ``The English Patient'' will be released this
month, a slender collection of poems about his native Sri Lanka
called ``Handwriting'' (Knopf, $22).
</P>
<P>
   He lives in Toronto, where with his wife, Linda Spalding, he
edits the literary journal ``Brick.'' It's a writerly publication,
but they are not above indulging in popular curiosity: For the 50th
anniversary issue of ``Brick,'' they posed the question, ``What
would you be if you were not a writer?'' to the likes of Annie
Proulx, Edmund White, Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Richard Ford
and Russell Banks.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, Ondaatje will participate in the Northern Arizona
Book Festival in Flagstaff, along with Czeslaw Milosz, Grace Paley,
Carolyn See, Cristina Garcia, Ron Chernow, Dorothy Allison, Leslie
Marmon Silko, Susan Straight and many others.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks with an odd, lovely accent that reflects all of the
places he has lived _ Sri Lanka, England and now Canada. Although
he says he dislikes giving interviews, he talked for nearly an hour
and seemed to enjoy himself.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: How do you think of ``The English Patient'' now? As a
phenomenon, or are you able to take pleasure in the novel as it was
at the start?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: I think of it with a lot of affection, although I
haven't read it since it came out. In that sense, the film was an
extra little flourish. Actually, it was a (begin itals) big (end
itals) flourish, and quite separate from the book. Because I became
very close to Anthony Minghella, who made the film, I had no
problems with it. The film was his version of the same story.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your friend Russell Banks told me that he survived the
filming of his novel, ``The Sweet Hereafter,'' because of the
lessons he learned while watching you go through the filming of
``The English Patient.'' Do you know what he means?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was very lucky. The stories, you know, are so horrendous
about writers and films. Saul and Anthony were very personal. I'd
go to meet with them about the script, and Saul would always pick
me up at the airport himself. He doesn't have a huge staff like
every other Hollywood producer. The three of us actually bonded
during that year or two before the script even went out.
</P>
<P>
   When it was finished, they were very sure what kind of film they
wanted to make and what kind they didn't want to make. It was with
that certainty, that privacy, that they went out into the
marketplace, as opposed to most producers and directors who go into
the marketplace and listen to what people want and then try to
provide it. It's a very different attitude toward filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you like the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: I thought it was terrific. I see it as a kind of sequel. It
nestles into the book and doesn't take anything away from it, and I
don't think the book takes anything away from the film.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was it like when the novel was first released?
</P>
<P>
   A: It came out in England and within days it was nominated for
the Booker Prize. It was like getting on a carousel very suddenly
and then you were just (begin itals) on (end itals) and you
couldn't get off.
</P>
<P>
   What saved me was that I did not live in England. The Booker is
so big there that every writer is always looking in that direction
out of the corner of his or her eye. It's not such a target in
Canada and in the States. I was in England for a few days when the
book came out and then I returned to Canada and missed all of the
craziness. In England, you were like a shark in an aquarium and
there were five other sharks in there with you, circling. I managed
to avoid that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You published three books of prose and lots of poetry before
``The English Patient'' came out. Did that help you keep things in
perspective?
</P>
<P>
   A: I began with small presses where you didn't expect to sell
more than 500 copies, if that. My career sort of inched up over the
years, as opposed to someone like (Jay) McInerney, whose first book
came out with a major publisher and probably sold more copies than
the Bible. That would have destroyed me.
</P>
<P>
   I was very lucky that I was able to discover the way I wanted to
write and the kind of books I wanted to write instead of books that
had to be written a certain way. It's not that I'm against plot or
adventure. I find lots of plot and adventure in my books, but it's
not done in the usual way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your writing style is audacious _ many voices, many time
frames, lyrical stories that don't move in a straight line. You've
jokingly called it ``the avoidance of plot.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Our lives are full of diversions. We don't think or act
within the structure of a plot _ we move backward as much as we
move forward. I don't think of it as audacity. It's just the only
way I can tell a story. But I also think my books are very ordered.
Though ``The English Patient'' may be difficult to read, that's not
intentional. I spent a lot of time trying to shape the book in a
way that would leave clues.
</P>
<P>
   I guess I see the reader as an equal to the writer. When I'm
reading a book I'm happiest when I do as much work discovering the
story as the writer does. Books that talk down to me, that tell me
what to think and who is the wise one and who is not _ I just get
bored. Most books have wonderful first chapters and then they hit a
plateau and remain there. It's difficult to find a good thriller
for that reason. They begin sensationally and then slide downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What made you decide to come to the festival in Flagstaff
next month?
</P>
<P>
   A: Russell (Banks) was there last year, and he told me about it.
It sounded great, and I'm looking forward to it very much.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you enjoy reading and answering questions from an
audience?
</P>
<P>
   A: I love readings. The questions people ask are always
different. I much prefer that, actually, to doing interviews. I
apologize . . . that's very rude, isn't it? Yes, I quite enjoy the
question-and-answer sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you like to read?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm a very eclectic reader. I like poetry, fiction, some
non-fiction. A book that really knocked me out was Jamaica
Kincaid's ``My Brother.'' W.G. Sebald had two books out recently,
``The Emigrants'' and ``The Rings of Saturn.'' They're in that hard
land between fiction and memoir. And I'm always looking for a good
thriller. Some of the early le Carre books were great.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would you be if you weren't a writer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd be Fats Waller. But I like the answer Russell gave when
we asked him. He said something like, ``I'd be dead. I'd be stabbed
or shot, in a parking lot somewhere. It's that simple.'' &QL;

TASTER'S CHOICE: 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON   Top Chocolate Caramel Wins Panelists' Hearts  
   
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
With Valentine's Day just around the corner, many are looking for
the perfect heart-shaped box of candy. Some people buy based on
looks _ the prettiest box wins. But what about taste?
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted the most popular individual chocolate _
chocolate-covered caramels _ from eight of the most widely
available brands. Unlike the Food staff tasting, the panelists
tasted the chocolates blind and tasted only caramels, not a
sampling from each box.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise winner was &UR; Brown &AMP; Haley  &LR; (14-ounce heart-shaped
box, $10.99 at Rite Aid) _ which wasn't big among the Food staff,
who found all of the fillings in the box too sweet and similar. But
panelists liked the creamy, easy-to-eat caramel center _ ``sexy and
rich,'' one said. Two panelists also noted the chocolate's superior
taste. All would buy the chocolate-covered caramel, which scored
enough points (80 or more) to make the Taster's Choice Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; See's &LR;  ($14, 1-pound heart-shaped box at See's stores
throughout Northern California) came in second. While the score was
significantly lower than Brown &AMP; Haley's, one panelist said this
would be the onehe'd like to receive because of the ``really nice
chocolate.'' Panelists liked the candy's flavor but found the
caramel filling too hard. Three would buy this chocolate-covered
caramel, one might, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped significantly to third place, which went to
 &UR; Russell Stover &LR;  (8-ounce heart-shaped box, $3.99 at Rite Aid).
Three panelists liked the caramel _ but all thought the chocolate
tasted inferior. Three might buy the caramel; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Clara Stover  &LR; (1-pound heart-shaped box, $6.99 at Rite Aid),
made by Russell Stover, came in fourth. All panelists liked the
flavor of the caramel but thought the texture was too hard. Three
might buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Zachary &LR;  (6-ounce heart-shaped box, $1.99
at Rite Aid). All the panelists thought the caramel was too firm,
and most commented on the overly sweet taste. One might buy it;
four wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's, Hershey's and Godiva chocolate-covered caramels
scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; Patricia Hart, dietitian and consultant;
Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco;
Roland Passot, chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank
in Larkspur and Menlo Park; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind.

 CHRON   Bay Area Chocolatier Carefully Molds His Success  
   
   
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
While dreamers often believe ``if you build it, they will come,''
local confectioner michael Recchiuti has a different vision. He
doesn't have a chocolate shop or even plans to build one. Right
now, he's concentrating on his chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   But with clients like Williams-Sonoma and Neiman Marcus, he
doesn't have to hurry to take out a building permit.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection is the key to Recchiuti's chocolates. He uses
tip-top-of-the-line ingredients. Chocolate for his Sur de Lago
chocolates is made exclusively for him by Scharffen Berger from a
special bean from Venezuela. Kona coffee comes from a single
plantation in Hawaii for his Kona pyramids. He buys tea leaves from
Pure Tea and picks up his herbs at Green Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   The results are more than just a compilation of fine
ingredients, however. His chocolate-covered fruit _ like key
lime-infused pears and candied orange peel _ are babied until they
reach the exquisite texture Recchiuti desires.
</P>
<P>
   And his flavor combinations are unlike anything else on the
market. He fills a dark-chocolate-sprayed white chocolate heart
with an intense ginger-infused chocolate ganache. He mixes jasmine
tea in a semisweet ganache coated in marblized chocolate. He takes
the unlikely combination of tarragon and chocolate and accents it
with candied grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   Recchiuti and his wife, Jaclyne, make all the chocolates by hand
in a space only marginally larger than a San Francisco
apartment-size kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   The couple opened their chocolate business in San Francisco in
1997 but have been working on it for years. But Recchiuti credits
his own passion to his restaurant experiences in Philadelphia,
where he grew up and worked.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the buzz when Alain Tricou, who had done pastries
at Maxim's in &UR;  &LR; Paris during its heyday, came to town to work at
Deja Vu.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this big thing in the paper about him showing up in
Philadelphia,'' he says. ``So I came walking in. It was perfect
timing. I said, `Can I work with you?' And he was like, `Of
course.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We would work all day in the restaurant and at night work on
this big City Hall piece out of 3,000 pounds of sugar. He just
wanted to give this gift to the city. That was a real thrust in my
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, Recchiuti came to San Francisco and supplied
pastries for many of the caterers, including Taste and Paula Le
Duc, and also did the bridal registry for wedding cakes at Gump's.
His actual chocolate work began when he returned to San Francisco
after a brief stint at the New England Culinary Institute in
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd sell chocolates at the farmers' market in Marin as a
test,'' explains Recchiuti. ``We would sell out. It was incredible.
All the money I put into it just to do these little tests, I'd make
a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the couple knew they should really pursue chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   They spent the next five years working at an exclusive resort
called Twin Farms in Vermont, but they also developed their first
chocolate line. And many of the customers at the resort still
search out his chocolates _ including Twin Farms, which offers his
chocolates to guests.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Neiman Marcus and the Williams-Sonoma catalog,
the chocolates can be purchased locally at a number of chocolate
shops and specialty foods stores. They don't come cheap.
Recchuiti's confections are about $60 a pound, which reflects not
only the high-quality ingredients of the handmade chocolates but
also the beautiful packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The chocolates are housed in earth-tone boxes wrapped in
origami-folded scatter print, then tied with a chocolate-brown
Italian linen ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   The chocolates have a short shelf life, so Recchuiti makes them
in small batches. ``I've got all these volatile, organic masses
that are eventually going to give way,'' he says. In the summer, he
lowers his production and sells only locally to shops that have
temperature-controlled cases because chocolates don't travel well
and he wants his customers to have them in peak condition.
</P>
<P>
   So what about plans for his own chocolate shop?
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening up a store is like you have to be there every day,''
Recchiuti says. ``We're here every day, but we run around with all
the deliveries. I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When he opens a shop, he promises it will be ``super boutique.''
But he's not in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love San Francisco,'' he says. ``I don't want to do anything
to ruin my relationship with the city.''
</P>

 CHRON   San Leandro sausage maker thrives on link to Portugal  
   
   
 By Tilde Herrera  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pia Dot Santos had no idea 78 years ago, when she re-created for
friends an old linguisa recipe she had learned in her native
Portugal, that her recipe would lead to a thriving family business
prospering well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Linguisa, a Portuguese sausage heavily flavored with garlic, is
used in the traditional soup caldo verde. Introduced by immigrants,
it became popular with non-Portuguese Americans, who enjoyed it as
a breakfast and sandwich meat. Soon friends of Pia and her husband,
Antonio, were sending the couple so many requests for linguisa that
they began producing it in the basement of their modest San Leandro
home. Word of mouth generated even more orders while Antonio began
selling the sausages at the now long-gone 6th Street farmer's
market in Oakland. Business began to boom.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, an empty lot next door to the couple's
home went up for sale in the late 1920s. Pia decided to purchase
the land with revenue from the basement production and eventually
built a small factory that would serve as the headquarters and main
production facility for the Santos Linguisa Factory.
</P>
<P>
   The business became a family affair, employing four or five
relatives, including Pia's daughter, Laura. In the 1930s, Pia
expanded the line with morcella, Portuguese blood sausage made with
a mixture of cow blood, onions and spices. Vinho d'alhos, 1/2-inch
marinated pork steaks, were introduced in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   When Herman Alexander, grandson of Pia Dot and general overseer
since the 1950s, died in 1993, the factory was shut, much to the
dismay of longtime customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People went crazy,'' said Stuart Alexander, Herman's son and
Pia's great-grandson. ``They wouldn't stop calling! Some even
called the chamber of commerce to find out what happened.''
Succumbing to public pressure, Stuart reopened the factory after
four months.
</P>
<P>
   Business continues to be brisk in the late 1990s. The Santos
Linguisa Factory continues to cater to a sizeable Portuguese
clientele as well as local restaurants and businesses, such as
Lucky and Domino's pizza. Orders pile in daily from across the
nation. Not bad, considering that the company has never advertised,
relying strictly on word-of-mouth publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart credits the company's success to the hard work of his
ancestors, the high-quality products used and to ``a good recipe
from the old country.'' Pia's original recipe is used. The linguisa
and morcella have never contained preservatives and are made daily
from fresh corn-fed pork. The linguisa-making technique is the same
as his great-grandmother's; the pork is cut, ground and marinated
before being stuffed into natural casings and smoked with oak for
12 hours in two 8-foot-by-15-foot smokers. Orders are shipped
within a week and in as little as 48 hours locally.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart is determined to see the company through its 100-year
anniversary. This should be a cinch because it is ``the food you
make friends with; you give someone our linguisa, and you have a
friend for life.`` &QL;

 CHRON   How we tasted more than 400 chocolates and lived to pick a 
 winner  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; After eating our way through dozens of heart-shaped boxes of
chocolates, the Chronicle Food staff has concluded American romance
is in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   From flimsy cardboard and dusty chocolate to cream fillings with
weird chemical flavors, Valentine chocolates on local drugstore
shelves don't say, ``I love you.'' They say, ``I'm leaving you.''
</P>
<P>
   We began by tasting eight popular brands of boxed chocolate (all
except See's were purchased at Rite-Aid and Walgreens), seeking the
best of bunch _ the inexpensive candy you could give or receive
without shame.
</P>
<P>
   A few bites into the project, though, we realized there must be
more to romance than a few sad maple creams and a rancid nut
cluster. So, in the names of love and research, we added eight
high-end chocolates _ in their own category, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the results were predictable, with one exception _
See's. It was a slam-dunk winner in the mass-market range, so we
retasted it against pricier European-style chocolates.
Surprisingly, it ended up in the middle of the high-end pack,
surpassing several more-expensive brands.
</P>
<P>
   The Fine Print: This is subjective. Taste, personal experience
and attraction to chocolate all affect judging. Price per piece is
based on Valentine-specific packaging. Some of the chocolates will
be cheaper per piece when not purchased as part of a special
Valentine box.
</P>
<P>
   And please don't give any of us chocolate for Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MASS MARKET
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 1. See's. &LR;  From the real bow and tasteful red heart-shaped box to
the variety of carefully crafted fillings, this is a box you'd be
happy to give or receive. The chocolates have a homey look and a
fresh taste. The variety is so good, everyone can find something to
love, whether a complex marshmallow-caramel chew; a tender-crisp,
buttery toffee; or a caramel-laced almond square.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  One-pound heart-shaped box, 29 pieces, $14. Price per piece: &LR; 
 &LR; 48 cents. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 2. Russell Stover.  &LR; A small, simple red-foil cardboard heart with
the brand discreetly etched in the lobe makes these drugstore
classics appear more sophisticated than they are. The look and
taste of the candy is, in a word, boring. Pieces have a slightly
dull finish, as if the chocolate wasn't fully tempered. The
homespun feel of the little paper cups helped push this brand into
the ``fine in a pinch'' category. Go for the twist on the classic
Heath Bar or the nicely bittersweet caramel. Avoid the cherry
nougat at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Eight-ounce heart-shaped box, 15 pieces, $3.99. Price per &LR; 
 &LR; piece: 26 cents. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 3. Hershey's Heart of Gold.  &LR; The box looks perfect _ a little  &LR; too
 &LR; perfect: precisely manufactured chocolates packed neatly into a
straightforward plastic heart-shaped liner. No messy edges. No
untidy paper cups. But like a first date that seems interesting at
the start of the evening and bores you stiff by the end, Hershey's
turns out to be a dud. The coconut-milk chocolate cups are gritty;
the dark chocolate hazelnut, too sweet. If someone gives you a box
of these (and this might be a good choice for someone used to
processed candy bar flavors), go for the raspberry-fudge-filled
dark chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  6.2-ounce heart-shaped box, 15 pieces, $5.99. Price per &LR; 
 &LR; piece: 40 cents. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 4. Clara Stover.  &LR; Who is she? Russell's poor relation? The
photograph of lace covering the heart shaped box suggests Clara is
an aunt you've spent much of your life trying to avoid. The candy
looks relatively fresh, but each piece is so similar that selecting
a certain type is a crapshoot. They all taste one-dimensional. The
cherry chew, despite a slight alcohol overtone, might be the best
of the box. The cherry cream, on the other hand, is the worst.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  One-pound heart-shaped box, 30 pieces, $6.99. Price per &LR; 
 &LR; piece: 23 cents. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 5. Brown &AMP; Haley.  &LR; The beauty-parlor-pink plastic container is
straight out of a bad drag queen act. And nestled in the molded
wells are equally plastic-looking chocolates. Each shiny,
machine-tooled shell holds overly sweet, near-liquid fillings that
are difficult to differentiate. The exception? The caramels, which
have a rich, creamy flavor that works with the gooey consistency.
(See Taster's Choice, Page 2.) The chocolate cream isn't too bad,
either. Still, one or two outstanding varieties do not a good box
make. How could the creators of beloved Almond Roca have gone so
wrong?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  14-ounce heart-shaped box, 35 pieces, $10.99. Price per
piece: &LR;   &LR; 31 cents. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 6. Whitman's.  &LR; What to many is the definitive name in dime-store
boxed chocolate disappoints. The chocolate-covered almonds and
peanuts border on rancid, the chocolate-covered cherry tastes worse
than cough syrup, and the cloying sweetness of the creams is
outdone by their chalky consistency. Still, some pieces strive to
redeem their brothers. The toffee has a good, buttery flavor, and
the caramel has a nice filling-to-chocolate ratio.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  14.8-ounce heart-shaped box, 37 pieces, $8.79. Price per &LR; 
 &LR; piece: 23 cents. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 7. Zachary Confections.  &LR; Inside a box covered with a photograph of
roses, all the chocolates look the same. Awful shells cover equally
horrid fillings. Tasters spit many of them into the trash. You get
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Six-ounce box, 11 pieces, $1.99. Price per piece: 18 cents. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 8. Elmer's.  &LR; Poor little Elmer's. From the sad plastic box to the
indifferent candies inside, this could only look charming in the
hands of an earnest kindergartner with a crush. Most of the
chocolates needed a trip back to the chemistry lab at the
Ponchatoula, La., factory where they were born. If you get this
box, it means you're either a parent of a very young child or your
relationship is about to end.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Three-ounce box, 99 cents. Price per piece: 20 cents. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE HIGH END
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; 1. Bernard C.  &LR; A simple cardboard chest wrapped in textured white
paper with a red ribbon is the perfect understated container for
this exceptional Belgian-style chocolate from Calgary, Alberta.
Milk chocolate enrobing strawberry cr &LR; e &LR; me fraiche elicits audible
gasps of pleasure. The dark chocolates define the genre. ``Yes,''
sighed one chocolate-stained staffer. ``Please give me one of
these.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  One-pound box, 48 pieces, $38. Price per piece: $1.26 &LR; .
 &LR; Bernard Callebaut Chocolaterie, 75 O'Farrell St., San Francisco; &LR; 
 &LR; (415) 781-2601 or (800) 661-8367. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR; COL. 2 of BEST OF (25143 ) &QL; 
 &UR; 2. Laderach Chocolatier Suisse.  &LR; No ostentatious red hearts here _
just beautiful, intricate chocolates crafted with Swiss attention
to detail and packed precisely into an understated square box,
along with perhaps the best candy key we've seen. From the
checkerboard praline to the fresh-tasting raspberry truffle, these
are smooth chocolates with refined texture and an emphasis on
craftsmanship. Giving them might indicate serious intent.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  15.2-ounce box, 36 pieces, $50. Price per piece: $1.39. &LR; 
 &LR; Available at Neiman Marcus stores. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 3. Teuscher.  &LR; Elegant and expensive, this smooth Swiss chocolate
packs intense flavor into intricate designs _ the tri-toned
champagne truffle and the pistachio filling with a nut sliver on
top, for examples. The box, a heart covered with heavy red velvet
and fake-silk roses, might explain the huge price tag, but so could
the quality of the chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Eight-ounce box, 16 pieces, $49.95. Cost per piece: $3.12 &LR; .
 &LR; Teuscher Chocolates of Switzerland, 255 Grant Ave., San &LR; 
 &LR; Francisco; (415) 398-2700. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 4. Neuhaus.  &LR; Although they are available boxed in expensive
red-satin hearts with lace, the candy might be best suited to the
Belgian chocolatier's standard: an understated yellow box with
green accents. This is sublime, clean-tasting chocolate molded into
perfect shapes. Among them, a foil-wrapped cone piped full of
crushed almonds and hazelnuts suspend in a nicely bitter chocolate.
Points off, however, for the soft praline molded to look like a
dollar sign. Of course, at this price . . .
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  5.25-ounce heart-shaped box, nine pieces, $25. Cost per &LR; 
 &LR; piece: $2.77. &LR;   &LR; Available in the Cellar department in some &LR; 
 &LR; Macy's stores and at Neiman Marcus. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 5. Alfred Schilling.  &LR; The San Francisco chocolatier pitches several
kicky Valentine boxes, but the closest to the traditional is a
rectangular box papered with graphically playful hearts. If yours
is a love-hate relationship, these are for you. Some varieties are
excellent; some, way off the mark with an unfortunate
sugar-to-cocoa ratio. A milk chocolate pyramid has a gritty
consistency, but the heavenly white chocolate version filled with
peanut butter bests all comers. The sugar-covered chocolate truffle
is another winner, along with the champagne truffle.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  6.75-ounce box with heart paper wrapping, 12 pieces, $16.50. &LR; 
 &LR; Price per piece: $1.37. Alfred Schilling Chocolate Co., 1695 &LR; 
 &LR; Market St., San Francisco; (415) 255-1666. Also available in &LR;   &LR; the
Cellar department at some Macy's stores. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 6. See's.  &LR; The hands-down best of the box in the low-end category
is a little flat when it plays with the big boys. The chocolate
flavor is not as well defined and possesses a decidedly down-home
sensibility when compared to its costly counterparts. Still, piece
for piece, it holds its own. And for the price, it's hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  One-pound heart-shaped box, 29 pieces, $14. Price per piece: &LR; 
 &LR; 48 cents. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of BEST OF (25143 ) &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 7. Joseph Schmidt.  &LR; San Francisco chocolatier Schmidt offers a
lush, etched velvet heart filled with unwieldy, large truffles,
each identically shaped like a small volcano. The smooth fillings
include a luscious Frangelico and a Hawaiian coconut that makes a
Mounds bar taste like nirvana. The box is romantic; the chocolates
might put you to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Eight-ounce heart-shaped box, 12 pieces, $24.95. Price per &LR; 
 &LR; piece: $2.08. Joseph Schmidt Confections, 3489 16th St., San &LR; 
 &LR; Francisco; (415) 861-8682. Also available in the Cellar &LR; 
 &LR; deparment in some Macy's stores, at Neiman Marcus and at &LR; 
 &LR; Draeger's Marketplace in San Mateo, Menlo Park and Los Altos. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 8. Godiva.  &LR; The polished gold packaging, heart-embossed ribbon and
red velvet rose allow givers of these chocolates from Reading, Pa.,
a certain level of flash. But the flavors don't come through as
cleanly as some other top-end brands, and many are simply ho-hum.
This box is geared to poseurs rather than serious students of
chocolate. If you get a box, avoid the solid chocolate starfish and
go for the semi-opened clams.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  One-pound square box decorated for Valentine's Day, 34 &LR; 
 &LR; pieces, $31. Price per piece: 91 cents. Godiva Chocolatier &LR;   &LR; Inc.,
865 Market St., San Francisco; (415) 543-8910. Also at &LR;   &LR; 3251 20th
Ave., San Francisco, (415) 566-5058; and in the &LR;   &LR; Cellar department
in some Macy's stores and in some Nordstorm &LR;   &LR; stores. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; 9. Ghirardelli.  &LR; A satin-covered heart. A fake flower. A decent
selection with inoffensive, overly sweet chocolates. The caramels
taste the richest; the white chocolate espresso heart is the piece
to avoid. This box would do well in the low-end category but can't
stand up to big-league competition. The bottom line? We'd rather
have See's and save a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  One-pound heart-shaped box, 31 pieces, $24.99. Price per &LR; 
 &LR; piece: 80 cents. Ghirardelli at Union Square, 44 Stockton St., &LR;

THAILAND TO BEGIN AIDS VACCINE EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government of Thailand on Tuesday approved the
first large-scale test of a vaccine to prevent infection by HIV
strains prevalent in Asia but rare in the Western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, which will begin next month, calls for the
injection of an experimental AIDS vaccine into 2,500 Thai
volunteers who are at risk of contracting HIV through intravenous
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   HIV infection is widespread among Asia's drug users, who often
sexually transmit the disease to partners or, in the case of
pregnant women, to unborn children. HIV is the virus that sparks
AIDS
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the trial, the Thai government said in a statement
Tuesday that it hopes the trial ``will lead to an effective tool
that will stop this dreadful epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Seth Berkeley, the president of the International AIDS
Vaccine Initiative, an advocacy organization based in New York,
said the experiment is ``a critical milestone'' because most prior
AIDS vaccine tests have targeted HIV strains unique to the
industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, which is helping administer the experiment, Thailand
has been particularly savaged by the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The country ``has experienced a rapidly escalating and severe
HIV epidemic since 1988,'' the CDC said Tuesday. Out of a
population of 60 million, nearly one million Thai people are
infected with HIV, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said Thailand was ``one of the nations most severely
affected by HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   Several HIV strains _ known as subtypes B/E _ are common to
South Asia and Southeast Asia but rare in the West, while
variations found in the Americas, Europe, the Caribbean and
Australia _ known as subtypes B/B _ are unusual in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that five separate HIV subtypes account for
the bulk of the global epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Because scientists are uncertain whether an AIDS vaccine
designed to attack strains common in the West will work in Asia,
public health organizations have been urging pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies to devote more attention to the Third
World.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus,
90 percent live in developing nations. Next to sub-Saharan Africa,
Asia has the largest concentration of people infected with HIV,
according to The World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine that will be tested in Thailand is manufactured by
VaxGen Inc. of South San Francisco. The vaccine, called AIDSVax,
will be given only to HIV-negative volunteers, half of whom will
receive the vaccine while the other half receive a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is ``double blind,'' meaning that neither the
volunteers nor the experiment's administrators, nor the vaccine's
manufacturer know if a particular volunteer is receiving the
vaccine or the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the trial, researchers will compare the infection
rate of the placebo group with that of the vaccine group. If
AIDSVax is effective, the vaccine group should have a lesser
infection rate.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is conducting the only large-scale AIDS vaccine
trial in North America involving 5,000 volunteers. That experiment
utilizes a variation of the AIDSVax vaccine geared to Western HIV
strains.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 1980s, when women refused to yield any corner
of the work world to men, they began to make their mark in the
competitive and brutal restaurant kitchens of New York. Through
persistence and sacrifice, skill and irrepressible desire, an
advance guard of women became stars on what was becoming one of New
York's most glamorous and visible stages.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Revsin broke the gender barrier in the kitchens of the
Waldorf-Astoria. Anne Rosenzweig at Arcadia received three stars in
a restaurant review in The Times, and so did Debra Ponzek at
Montrachet. Everyone who cared about restaurants knew their names.
And there were others working their way up the line behind them.
</P>
<P>
   But, evidently, it was a false start. Today, the great and
potentially great female chefs of New York are mostly missing in
action. Women are nearly invisible in restaurant kitchens despite
an exponential growth in high-end restaurants and the opportunity
they offer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Revsin is writing cookbooks in Bronxville, N.Y., and Ms.
Ponzek owns a carryout shop in Greenwich, Conn. Only Ms. Rosenzweig
is still at it, running her own restaurant in New York, the Lobster
Club, and it received just two stars.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six restaurants in New York today that have received four
stars, not one is run by a woman. Only 4 of the 40 chefs at
restaurants rated three stars are women. What is it about New York
that makes it difficult for women to reach the top? Or maybe the
right question to ask is, Do they want to?
</P>
<P>
   Women dominate every other area of the culinary arts _ catering,
cookbooks, cooking schools. Elsewhere in the country, especially on
the West Coast, women have achieved the glamour, fame and money
that go with reaching the top post in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this say more about New York than about women as
chefs. No American city is more competitive. The Eurocentric model
of a militaristic kitchen run by a drill sargeant is alive and well
here.
</P>
<P>
   Women still have to work harder to prove themselves, and the
testosterone levels in the kitchen continue to encourage some
sexual harassment, no matter how muted. Women who want to make it
in what remains a man's world must have great determination and be
willing to sacrifice a lot. Now that they have had an opportunity
to see what it takes, many have decided they don't want it.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of women as celebrity chefs begins even before they
get to a restaurant kitchen. Women have been welcomed at
professional cooking schools for 20 years but are still in the
minority.
</P>
<P>
   At the Culinary Institute of American in Hyde Park, N.Y., 25
percent of the students in the culinary program are women, only 4
percent above the 1975 figures. At the French Culinary Institute in
New York City and at Johnson &AMP; Wales University in Providence,
R.I., 40 percent of the students are women. But in the pastry
department of all these schools, women outnumber men.
</P>
<P>
   Through school and up to five years later, said Pat Bartholemew,
the chairwoman of the department of hospitality management at New
York City Technical College, women have the same opportunities as
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``While they are students, women have the best grades, the best
hands and are the most focused,'' she said. ``When they leave
school, there is no problem getting the grunt jobs. But after about
five years, lots of these really top young women have disappeared.
They are out of fine restaurants into all kinds of other jobs _
catering, journalism, cookbook writing, restaurant consulting.'' Or
they are pastry chefs.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the perquisites that come with being a celebrity chef
takes years of physically demanding work for 12 to 15 hours a day
under stressful conditions. In exchange, cooks on the way up are
paid comparatively little _ $30,000 to $60,000 a year _ and have
virtually no outside life. Waiters work fewer hours and can make
$50,000 to $70,000 under less trying conditions.
</P>
<P>
   During service hours, a high-powered kitchen resembles an
emergency crisis center at full throttle. ``Kitchens are a
dangerous place to be,'' Clark Wolfe, a New York restaurant
consultant, said. ``They are physically rugged. There are fires,
knives and a lot of swift movement and big egos.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy Sparks, the chef at Quilty's, says the rigors of this
city's kitchens do not appeal to a lot of women. ``I don't want to
sound sexist, but it's not the kind of job that expresses your
feminine side,'' she said. ``You get burned, you get cut. You can't
wear makeup. I think the women who don't know what they are getting
into are suprised at the physical demands and drop out. Line
cooking is the brawn part. It isn't until you go beyond that that
you get to use the brain part.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with cities elswhere in the country, ``New York
kitchens tend to be more disciplined and harder to work in,'' said
Diane Forley, the chef and owner of Verbena.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with the old days, Daniel Boulud of Restaurant
Daniel, said today's kitchens are positively civilized: ``Even
myself, I have changed a lot with time. I am certainly much nicer
and much more concerned with the comfort of the cook.'' Still, he
added, ``You have to be a total masochist to be on a burning-hot
line where everyone is suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition to be better than anyone else in the kitchen is
also brutal and alien to many women. ``If I were put in charge of
the world,'' Ms. Bartholemew said, ``I'd make all women go to
Little League and learn how to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some women thrive on competition. ``I love that
discipline, that striving for perfection,'' Ms. Rosenzweig said.
``I think women who are successful in the kitchen love the military
code of the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Most men in the kitchen still have trouble treating women as
equals there, though women generally agree that things are better
than they were 20 years ago. The Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission has not had a case of sexual harassment in a restaurant
kitchen reported in at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean such suits do not exist. Four months ago,
three women who worked in a corporate dining kitchen in New York
filed a civil sexual harassment lawsuit. None of the women will
speak on the record because a settlement is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my first years of working, I had so much sexual
harassment,'' said Seen Lippert, who came to New York from Chez
Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., in 1997 and is the executive chef at
Metrazur, scheduled to open in the spring at Grand Central
Terminal. Before she worked at Chez Panisse, she said she was
constantly repelling the advances of a chef ``who would have me up
against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   You also learn to ignore suggestive remarks and barroom
language. Occasionally, drastic measures are required. ``I did
punch a guy once,'' said Alexandra Guarnaschelli, 29, a junior
sous-chef at Restaurant Daniel. ``And he apologized.''
</P>
<P>
   Women must tread a very fine line between being strong and being
too strong, many said, a problem men never face. ``You can't push
people, because you come across as being a bitch, and you can't get
that name,'' said Michelle Koslosky, 27, a line cook at Le
Bernardin. ``You have to stay extremely calm and in control at all
times, both mentally and physically. People don't touch me, and I
don't touch them. ''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ripert, the executive chef at Le Bernardin, who has four
women in his kitchen, seems mildly nonplused by Ms. Koslosky, whom
he describes as tough and very direct. ``I say to her, `Don't scare
the boys _ we are not used to it.' They act a little like tough
cookies. Women feel they have to prove they are the equal of the
guys. Coming into a macho world, they feel maybe they are not going
to be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen is not the only place that is less than hospitable
to women. Bankers are still skittish about lending them money for
restaurants. ``The perception is that men are more versatile,
willing to move and probably won't get pregnant,'' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the restaurant backers interviewed acknowledged any
reluctance. Several women, however, did.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York real estate is so expensive that people are very
cautious about whom they hire for big projects,'' said Ms. Sparks,
who does not own Quilty's. ``Women get the short end of the
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs like Jerry Kretchmer and Drew Nieporent swear it
isn't true. But they say top women are hard to find.
``Conservatively, I get a resume every three weeks from men,'' said
Kretchmer, who owns four restaurants, including the Gotham Bar and
Grill and Judson Grill. ``I don't think I've seen a woman's resume
in two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Where do all the promising women go? ``It's a level playing
field until you are 25,'' said Dorothy Cann Hamilton, the founder
and chief executive officer of the French Culinary Institute.
``Then it's work 12 hours a day, and you have to do that for 10
years. To make the top grade, the most important part of life is
between 25 and 35 _ but between 25 and 35 is when women think about
getting married, think about having children.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a chef in a three- or four-star restaurant in New York is
not conducive to good relationships or child rearing, and many
women are not willing to make the sacrifice. Ms. Rosenzweig tried
to have it all but concedes she has fallen short. She received
three stars at Arcadia before she married and had a child. But
Lobster Club, which followed, received only two stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work so hard for perfection in your kitchen and in the
front of the house, and it's the most wonderful energizing sort of
thing, and it's all-consuming,'' she said. ``And when you have a
family, you don't want it to be any different for your family, and
then you realize if you are going to work 90 or 100 hours a week,
how can you have the same thing for your family? And you can't.
That's the giant rub. It's a dilemma men just don't feel.''
</P>
<P>
   In some careers women can spend several years in child rearing
and then go back to work. At this high level of cooking, they
can't. By the time they are ready to come back, it's too late. And
unlike lawyers, investment bankers or advertising agency
executives, chefs cannot fax in their work when they have to stay
home with a sick child.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work is probably the reason I'm not married anymore to my
first husband,'' said Pat Williams, who is the chef at City Wine
and Cigar Company in New York. ``He couldn't deal with it. It's a
very difficult business in which to carry on a relationship. For
men a relationship is secondary to the restaurant, to the food.''
</P>
<P>
   What about children? ``No cats, no kids, no dogs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams, who recently remarried, said her goals have
changed: ``When I first started, my vision was of being a master
chef with the high toque and white jacket. Now, my main goal is to
do what I like and be successful moneywise and happinesswise but
not necessarily to be a famous chef. I think it's more about owning
your own place.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women, like Emily Luchetti, choose pastry instead. Most
pastry chefs work day shifts and are are mostly removed from the
macho atmosphere in the rest of the kitchen, and with more
restaurants concentrating on desserts, there are more high-profile
jobs in pastry kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my passion for the cooking world and got tired of
cooking the line and realized I didn't want to be an executive
chef,'' Ms. Luchetti said. Today she is a star, but as a pastry
chef at Farallon in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Some women move out of New York to more welcoming places, where
they become star chefs at their own restaurants. Places perhaps
where personal cooking styles are more appreciated than they are in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast beckons many because, Ms. Revsin said,
``California has always been more accepting, more open, and it has
never been based on the French tradition.'' California kitchens are
more relaxed, less competitive and tend to have more equal numbers
of men and women. And the impact of Alice Waters and Chez Panisse
cannot be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
   Traci des Jardins, who worked at Montrachet, is one of those who
moved to San Francisco, where she is now an acclaimed chef at her
own restaurant, Jardiniere.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a pretty tough place to raise children,'' she
said. ``It's easier in California. There is not so much frenetic
energy. The pace is slower. There is a lot more space. You can get
out of the city quickly. There is an unspoken movement among women
in our industry to allow more flexibility. I like to think people
are becoming more conscious of the burnout rate and that maybe it
doesn't take 80 hours. Maybe you can do it in 55 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without flexibility, Ms. Sparks of Quilty's remains
undeterred. ``Now that I am executive chef I have more control over
my schedule, and I have no intention of dropping out, no matter how
tough it gets,'' she said. ``I intend to be a grand dame of cuisine
some day.'' &QL;

AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, GONE EVER SO SLIGHTLY ASTRAY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ ``What is that?'' asked the Frenchman at the next table,
eyeing the dish before me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macaroni and cheese,'' I replied in fluent English. ``An
American classic.''
</P>
<P>
   We were lunching, not together, at Spoon Food &AMP; Wine, Alain
Ducasse's newest restaurant. With six Michelin stars, Ducasse is
France's restaurateur of the moment. His Louis XV in Monaco has
three stars; so does the Paris restaurant that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   But Spoon, which opened in mid-December, could be viewed as
Ducasse's most adventurous effort yet. It is billed as an
international restaurant and, indeed, features Asian, Indian, Latin
American and Italian dishes, with a touch of British cooking, such
as it is, and, for local xenophobes, even a few things French.
</P>
<P>
   But they're the supporting cast; the stars at Spoon are
American. At least they try to be. From the chicken wings to the
barbecued ribs, from the BLT to the Philadelphia cream cheese to
the California wines, the American presence is large.
</P>
<P>
   The menu is in American English _ with French subtitles. Some
translations work; some don't. Pastrami is pastrami, even when you
tart it up with Chinese cabbage, mustard, olive oil and pickles.
The same with BLT _ you know, bacon, laitue et tomate? Alas, the
Spoon version has something called basil condiment sprinkled
blasphemously over the bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, no attempt has been made to Frenchify Philadelphia
cream cheese, which, by the way, along with Cheddar and Stilton,
transforms Spoon into that singular anomaly, a French restaurant
with no French cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Other Americanisms are simply untranslatable. What does one do,
for example, with Ben &AMP; Jerry's Chunky Monkey ice cream? Spoon
takes a stab at it with ``creme glacee vanille a la banane, noix et
pepites de cacao.'' I'd stick with Chunky Monkey and demand a
waiver from the Academie Francaise, France's language police force.
If the Academie takes on Spoon, it will have its hands full. The
French word for take out is ``emporter.'' Spoon prefers the British
``take away.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, the staff says, ``tres Spoon.'' Like the Christofle
chopsticks on the tables and the signature Spoon wristwatch by
Pulsar for sale. And to confuse things a bit more, all take-away
meals come _ or go _ in Japanese-style bento boxes, the lacquered
containers in which Japanese meals are sometimes served.
</P>
<P>
   But the restaurant itself has a slick, minimalist design that
would be as much at home in Tokyo or San Francisco as in the chic
neighborhood of expensive shops and businesses where it is
situated, right off the Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   The American influence is pervasive, but the results can be
startling. The macaroni and cheese, for example is not your
mother's Kraft dinner. It more resembles a kind of lasagna.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces of macaroni _ actually ziti _ are lined up side by
side in the bottom of a pan, looking for all the world like white
corduroy. They are covered with a layer of cheese, then with
another layer of macaroni, laid at right angles to the bottom
layer, and finally another layer of cheese. Out of this are punched
rounds about the size of compact disks, three of which are served,
like sushi, on an oblong plate. My neighbor didn't ask what they
tasted like. If he had, I would have said ``bland.''
</P>
<P>
   For want of a better metaphor, several French commentators have
characterized Spoon as Ducasse's statement about the future of
French cooking. Local writers, while not directly addressing the
quality of the food and service, have taken to calling Spoon a
``Restaurant for the Millennium'' and a ``Restaurant for the 21st
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse prefers to talk about the supermodern electronic
kitchen, with its eight separate cooking systems. He said he had
come across many ideas as he traveled the world and wanted to bring
them all together in one restaurant. And so Spoon, he said, ``is a
place of freedom where everything is possible and nothing is
required.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the menu is arranged so that each guest can construct
his own dishes. Under salads alone there are 15 ingredients _
including iceberg lettuce _ which can be mixed and matched. There
is one basic pasta but a choice of five sauces, two cheeses and a
julienne of ham to add to it in any number of combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing? Yes, particularly for guests who want to eat their
meal rather than create it. Which might explain why there is so
much rubbernecking, especially among the many French patrons;
everyone is looking at everyone else to see what to do. Ducasse is
not much help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting of techniques and ingredients from every corner of
the globe gives birth to new tastes,'' he said. ``Everyone is free
to compose his own meal according to his desires of the moment;
everything is designed for the complete freedom of the guest.'' In
hidebound France, it feels like innovation for innovation's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Even the seating arrangements are variable. There are banquette
tables, low tables, round tables and square tables and, even in
Spoon's relatively small space _ which accommodates only 70 seats _
alcove tables for serious business lunches and for what Ducasse
calls ``rendez-vous amoureux.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, this studied casualness takes its toll on the
staff members, in their dress shirts, ties and long aprons. Dishes
go to the wrong tables, arrive out of sequence or never appear at
all.
</P>
<P>
   An American cabernet sauvignon I ordered, Ridge Vineyards 1995
Santa Cruz Mountains, arrived ice cold. I pointed this out to the
waiter. ``Of course,'' he said in French, with a disarming smile.
Rather than press the issue, I cradled the bottle in my arms until
it made me cold, then I asked that it be decanted. It was clear
that they considered me a crank. The wine, which cost $102, never
did warm up.
</P>
<P>
   The last page of the menu has an authentically American saying:
``That's all, folks.'' The bill, however, had a very Parisian
punch: including 21 percent value-added tax and 17 percent service
charge, $278 for two. &QL;

<P>
   MACARONI AND CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Alain Ducasse
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 quarts plus 1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, peeled and lightly crushed
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   14 ounces pencil-thick ziti or other tube pasta, about } inch
long
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   \ cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1 and one-third cups finely grated Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for the baking dish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large saucepan combine 2 quarts milk, garlic and salt
and pepper to taste. Bring to a boil, add the pasta and reduce heat
to medium-low. Simmer until the pasta is al dente, about 8 minutes;
while the pasta is simmering, prepare the cheese sauce.
</P>
<P>
   2. To prepare the cheese sauce, combine the remaining cup milk
and the heavy cream in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, and
reduce for 5 minutes. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt
the butter. When it bubbles, whisk in the flour and cook 2 minutes,
whisking constantly. Add the cream mixture; whisk until smooth and
slightly thickened. Remove from the heat and stir in 1 cup cheese.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Drain the pasta and add it to
the cheese mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste. Place a colander
over a large bowl and pour in the pasta, allowing the sauce to
drain into the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   4. Lightly oil a 9-by-12-inch baking dish. Arrange the pasta in
neat rows, covering the bottom of the baking dish with a single
layer. Spoon over just enough of the cheese mixture to lightly coat
the pasta. Repeat with a second layer, arranging the tubes at a
right angle to those in the bottom layer, and again spoon just
enough sauce to lightly coat the pasta. Sprinkle the remaining
cheese over the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bake until bubbling and lightly browned on top, about 15
minutes. Remove from oven and allow to rest 10 minutes. Cut into
neat squares, or, using a 3-inch pastry ring, into circles. Serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I was standing on the deck of the Delta Pride, a 738-foot,
61,477-ton cargo vessel from Pakistan that had been stranded for
months in the Gulf of Mexico.
 &HT;    The ship's immense size emphasized the acute isolation described
by its crew. A month earlier, the ship was nearly lost at sea, just
10 miles shy of American waters, when its 22-person crew made a
last-ditch run for what it hoped would be a safe and welcoming
harbor.
 &HT;    ``We are trying to make Port Brownsville in extreme emergency
condition,'' the ship's captain, Maqsood Ahmed, wrote in a telex,
which was quickly passed on to the U.S. Coast Guard. ``We have no
fresh water, no diesel oil, no food left on board. Please help
us.''
 &HT;    For five months, the Delta Pride had been adrift off the coast
of Tampico, Mexico. ``Time passed in misery,'' says Shamshad Ahmed,
the boat's first officer. ``We were forced to think the world had
forgotten us.''
 &HT;    The ship had been sent there by its owners, Tristar Shipping
Lines in Karachi _ for what, exactly, Ahmed didn't know. Responding
to the company's telexed instructions, the ship had, for the last
18 months, plied the seas, from Liverpool to Korea to China to
Singapore to Bulgaria to Turkey to Gibraltar to West Africa to Iraq
to Texas, hauling millions of dollars' worth of coal, bauxite,
scrap iron and grain mostly on behalf of different government
agencies. But once the crew crossed the Tropic of Cancer, it didn't
hear from its employers again. That was in July.
 &HT;    Not knowing that Tristar had filed for bankruptcy, the crew
waited for the next cargo order. The ship had no refrigeration, no
air-conditioning, no electricity and limited ship-to-shore
communications.
 &HT;    Only Ahmed and a couple of crewmen were allowed to go ashore,
but Ahmed, who didn't speak Spanish, had trouble communicating with
Mexican authorities. He was made to understand that if he took the
rest of his men off the boat, they would be arrested by harbor
officials, who were wary of immigration problems and of having to
deal with a worthless vessel obstructing shipping channels.
 &HT;    Unable to bathe or wash their clothes, the men began to get
rashes and scabies and to show the first signs of scurvy. No
doctors, however, were allowed on board. Only by pawning rings and
watches and selling cartons of cigarettes onshore could Ahmed get
his hands on some basic medicine to help his crew with kidney
infections, heart troubles and dysentery.
 &HT;    Soon the crew was running out of food. By early November,
despite collecting rainfall, the men were down to their last
gallons of drinkable water. Ahmed was forbidden to leave Tampico
without paying the ship's bills and collecting its papers and the
crew's passports, which he had long ago surrendered in a desperate
negotiation for much-needed supplies.
 &HT;    The ship had nothing else of value to put up for collateral, and
nobody was extending the crew any more credit. Every plea to bosses
in Pakistan, to the consulate in Mexico City and to the local
harbor master was either dismissed or ignored.
 &HT;    ``I could see death in my crew's eyes,'' Ahmed says. ``They were
dying.'' It was then that he decided to risk the run north.
 &HT;    The plight of the Delta Pride is hardly unusual. All too often,
the merchant marine has become a kind of sweatshop on the high
seas. With the exception of the military during times of war, few
workers subject themselves to a harder fate.
 &HT;    More than 6,000 men have died on the job in the 1990s. There are
some 134 shipwrecks a year, not counting those among fishing fleets
and pleasure craft. Hijackings and extortion are commonplace.
Pirates attack at night with M-16s and grenade launchers, murdering
crews, siphoning oil, robbing payroll safes and then letting the
unpiloted ships careen out of control in crowded shipping channels.
 &HT;    A glance at the casualty reports in the shipping journals
reveals the risks seamen routinely take. There's the Dubai Valour,
whose Ukrainian crew was held for ransom in August 1997 by a
Nigerian warlord named Chief Humphrey Idisi. (Despite orders from
Nigeria's highest court that the entire crew be released, four of
the men are still in captivity.)
 &HT;    There's the Cheung Son, whose 23 crew members were killed by
Chinese pirates in December in the Taiwan Straits. There's the
Erria Inge, whose 10 Australian crewmen were found in an unused
refrigerator. And there's the Vanderpool Express, whose captain and
four crewmen were killed shortly after leaving Miami in 1997.
Another 51 deaths were documented that same year.
 &HT;    In addition to the Delta Pride's crew, there are currently 200
men on 10 ships around the world that have been stranded in foreign
ports by their employers. Ship owners have been known to unload
their cargos and then deprive a crew of food and water until the
men give up the vessel as well as any claims to back wages.
 &HT;    Most of the sailors on the Delta Pride, for instance, haven't
been paid since they signed on nor have they been in contact with
their families since they unloaded their last cargo in May.
 &HT;    About 90 percent of the goods consumed in the United States
travel on cargo ships at some point during their manufacture. But
nowadays, the world's cargo ships sail mostly under dubious
registries, flying so-called flags of convenience from countries
with low safety and health standards and little muscle to guarantee
the welfare of their workers.
 &HT;    The United States may be the world's No. 1 trading nation, but
it carries less than 5 percent of its own oceangoing freight.
 &HT;    To avoid taxes and high labor and insurance costs, most of the
major bulk carriers in the United States contract out their
business, registering their ships in other countries and hiring
foreign crews _ Indians, Koreans, Filipinos, Romanians, Pakistanis
and Ukrainians, who are willing to risk life and limb for, say,
$100 a week. (Unionized U.S. mariners typically command at least
five times that in wages, not including benefits.)
 &HT;    ``Marine transportation is a very cheap way to connect all the
economies of the world,'' says Richard du Moulin, the chairman of
Marine Transport Corporation, the oldest shipping company in the
U.S. ``But there's a hole in the net. A crew from the United States
is going to be taken care of. But a poor third-world country _ does
it really care enough about its citizens to go through all the
diplomatic channels to make sure an abandoned crew is paid and
repatriated when millions of people are starving at home?''
 &HT;    In the global economy, a Panamanian-registered vessel may be
built in Japan, owned by a Norwegian and manned by Pakistanis. This
tangled provenance often makes it difficult to determine who is
responsible for a ship and its crew when they run into trouble.
 &HT;    That's not to say that every ship registered in a foreign
country is at greater risk of mishap _ Liberia, for example, has an
impressive safety record _ but according to the Institute of London
Underwriters, ships registered to Honduras and Belize, with their
lax enforcement of regulations, are among the most dangerous for
their multinational crews.
 &HT;    A crew is often viewed as expendable. Unless a vessel happens
into American waters and issues a distress call like the one Ahmed
sent out on Nov. 24, the ordeal of a ship like the Delta Pride may
never generate any attention.
 &HT;    Ahmed had joined the merchant marine, like many of his men, in
hopes of seeing the world. He was, at 36, on his first assignment
as captain when the Delta Pride became effectively stalled in the
Gulf of Mexico. Although he had no financial control of his ship,
he was still responsible, by traditional maritime law, for the
lives of his 21 crew members.
 &HT;    To maintain authority, Ahmed felt he had to keep his distance
from his crew. He was years than many of his men. Ahmed had long
ago stopped trying to reassure them that they would be paid at the
next port of call, or even that their employer would see to it that
they were eventually sent home. Ahmed sent out telexes _ more than
100, in the estimation of Shamshad Ahmed, the ship's first officer.
They all went unanswered.
 &HT;    Although Ahmed had threatened to bring his crew ashore in
Tampico, he doubted the seaworthiness of the ship's lifeboats.
Besides, he felt certain that if his sailors left the ship they
would give up the only bargaining chip they had. The men similarly
regarded leaving the ship as unthinkable.
 &HT;    If they didn't return home paid in full, they said, they would
jump into the sea from shame. Their families were in debt, their
possessions were in hock and they felt that if they didn't have two
years' back wages to show for their absence, there would be no
redeeming themselves.
 &HT;    One sailor, working from midnight to 4 a.m., had begun talking
to himself in a disturbing manner. Two deck workers went to Ahmed
in his cabin and said that they were prepared to kill themselves
right then and there. Even after Ahmed calmed them down, they vowed
that they would jump off the ship if they weren't home by the holy
month of Ramadan.
 &HT;    Then Hurricane Mitch hit the region. The tempest brought water
and relief from dolorous days. Soon, however, it was back to
praying for some kind of deliverance. Ahmed began to consider
fleeing, in defiance of Mexican law, for American waters, some 300
miles to the north.
 &HT;    He doubted that the ship had sufficient diesel fuel to operate
its navigational equipment or even enough water to keep the engines
cool. Also, the generators were in particularly bad repair: Two
weren't working and the last kept catching fire. For three days,
Ahmed didn't sleep. He took inspiration from words he found on a
U.S. $10 bill that he happened upon in his dresser drawer: ``In God
We Trust.''
 &HT;    The crew was suddenly re-energized, feeling at last that they
were taking charge of their fate. They had work to do _ gathering
the last dregs of diesel fuel in buckets, cranking up the massive
engines and pooling the last few gallons of water, which would be
used as coolant. Under cover of darkness, they hoisted the anchors
and began their frantic run north.
 &HT;    The Delta Pride made it, barely, and today it is anchored just
this side of the Mexican border, faintly within sight of
Brownsville, Tex. But the ship and its crew are still floating in
legal and financial limbo.
 &HT;    Except for Ahmed, the men have not been allowed to go ashore, or
even put into port, since the Coast Guard is afraid the vessel will
break down in the middle of Brownsville's shipping channels.
 &HT;    A week before Christmas, I visited the Delta Pride. The men
gathered on the rust-pocked deck to greet my shore-to-ship boat.
They were waiting to beseech me for news _ for anything other than
the vague promises that ``things'' were being done, that more
supplies were on the way, enough to last them until the spring, if
necessary.
 &HT;    ``The last 15 days were horrible,'' said the first officer about
their misfortune in Mexico. He pointed out the fire hoses that ran
down from the upper decks to two 55-gallon drums that had been
secured by padlocks in case someone tried to make off with the
boat's last valuable commodity _ drinking water _ as he smoked what
seemed like an endless series of cigarettes.
 &HT;    At the ship's stern were patches of charred deck, where, to
conserve butane, the crew had done its cooking. Bedding of the sort
that homeless people construct on city streets was strewn in the
ship's nooks and crannies. At the prow were metal rods as thick as
a boxer's wrists that had been jimmied into the anchor holds and
bent end to end by the heaping seas of Hurricane Mitch.
 &HT;    The crew members were dressed in a combination of secondhand
Izod polo shirts, cardigan sweaters and Indian shalwar-kameez pants
suits. In the officers' dining room, crew members spoke with
contempt of the ship's owner, whose framed photograph was one of
the few decorative adornments in the drab and dirty interior.
 &HT;    A few days before Ramadan began, the crew learned that a
Pakistani vice consulate general had flown in from Los Angeles. He
got seasick on the boat ride out to the ship and returned to shore.
The next day, he was back in California, having never boarded the
ship or done anything by way of repatriating the stranded crewmen
or securing their back pay.
 &HT;    Instead, the matter has been left to the federal courts in Texas
to sort out. The Delta Pride is now the property of U.S. marshals,
and the crew must get in line with creditors who have a claim on
the ship, which will, in all likelihood, be scrapped for its steel
after being auctioned.
 &HT;    Most days, Ahmed is ashore meeting with lawyers and local
boosters among Houston's Pakistani community. One group has raised
enough money to pay the crew a portion of its wages and provide
airplane tickets home, but Ahmed, as a point of honor, refused the
offer.
 &HT;    ``Our work is our pride,'' he said. ``This is hard-earned money.
We shouldn't have to go begging for it or accept donations.''
 &HT;    So while the ship's men are finally eating, drinking and bathing
again _ and two have even been sent home _ most are back to
listlessly playing the waiting game.
 &HT;    Five times a day, Naseem Khan, a 58-year-old oiler and the
ship's muezzin, calls for prayer and the men gather in an empty
carpeted cabin that serves as a mosque. The rest of the time, they
shuffle about like patients in a hospital. They complain of mental
``depletion,'' although there is nothing to do or even to think
about.
 &HT;    Some fret about their families, about the suspicions their wives
and children must have about their months, and now years, away from
home. They wonder if marriages that were carefully arranged by
their families have now been canceled.
 &HT;    ``Our minds are off,'' said one man as he walked the deck in
boredom.
 &HT;    In the mess hall, a few men loafed, lulled to silence by the
rocking ship. Others zoned out to Indian music videos that they had
seen countless times. When the tape came to an end, the television
turned to static, but nobody moved for about 10 minutes. Only the
cook was busy and in seemingly good spirits. He had something to
do.
 &HT;    The Delta Pride may have dropped anchor, but it is still adrift
in a sea of indifference.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I was standing on the deck of the Delta Pride, a 738-foot,
61,477-ton cargo vessel from Pakistan that had been stranded for
months in the Gulf of Mexico.
 &HT;    The ship's immense size emphasized the acute isolation described
by its crew. A month earlier, the ship was nearly lost at sea, just
10 miles shy of American waters, when its 22-person crew made a
last-ditch run for what it hoped would be a safe and welcoming
harbor.
 &HT;    ``We are trying to make Port Brownsville in extreme emergency
condition,'' the ship's captain, Maqsood Ahmed, wrote in a telex,
which was quickly passed on to the U.S. Coast Guard. ``We have no
fresh water, no diesel oil, no food left on board. Please help
us.''
 &HT;    For five months, the Delta Pride had been adrift off the coast
of Tampico, Mexico. ``Time passed in misery,'' says Shamshad Ahmed,
the boat's first officer. ``We were forced to think the world had
forgotten us.''
 &HT;    The ship had been sent there by its owners, Tristar Shipping
Lines in Karachi _ for what, exactly, Ahmed didn't know. Responding
to the company's telexed instructions, the ship had, for the last
18 months, plied the seas, from Liverpool to Korea to China to
Singapore to Bulgaria to Turkey to Gibraltar to West Africa to Iraq
to Texas, hauling millions of dollars' worth of coal, bauxite,
scrap iron and grain mostly on behalf of different government
agencies. But once the crew crossed the Tropic of Cancer, it didn't
hear from its employers again. That was in July.
 &HT;    Not knowing that Tristar had filed for bankruptcy, the crew
waited for the next cargo order. The ship had no refrigeration, no
air-conditioning, no electricity and limited ship-to-shore
communications.
 &HT;    Only Ahmed and a couple of crewmen were allowed to go ashore,
but Ahmed, who didn't speak Spanish, had trouble communicating with
Mexican authorities. He was made to understand that if he took the
rest of his men off the boat, they would be arrested by harbor
officials, who were wary of immigration problems and of having to
deal with a worthless vessel obstructing shipping channels.
 &HT;    Unable to bathe or wash their clothes, the men began to get
rashes and scabies and to show the first signs of scurvy. No
doctors, however, were allowed on board. Only by pawning rings and
watches and selling cartons of cigarettes onshore could Ahmed get
his hands on some basic medicine to help his crew with kidney
infections, heart troubles and dysentery.
 &HT;    Soon the crew was running out of food. By early November,
despite collecting rainfall, the men were down to their last
gallons of drinkable water. Ahmed was forbidden to leave Tampico
without paying the ship's bills and collecting its papers and the
crew's passports, which he had long ago surrendered in a desperate
negotiation for much-needed supplies.
 &HT;    The ship had nothing else of value to put up for collateral, and
nobody was extending the crew any more credit. Every plea to bosses
in Pakistan, to the consulate in Mexico City and to the local
harbor master was either dismissed or ignored.
 &HT;    ``I could see death in my crew's eyes,'' Ahmed says. ``They were
dying.'' It was then that he decided to risk the run north.
 &HT;    The plight of the Delta Pride is hardly unusual. All too often,
the merchant marine has become a kind of sweatshop on the high
seas. With the exception of the military during times of war, few
workers subject themselves to a harder fate.
 &HT;    More than 6,000 men have died on the job in the 1990s. There are
some 134 shipwrecks a year, not counting those among fishing fleets
and pleasure craft. Hijackings and extortion are commonplace.
Pirates attack at night with M-16s and grenade launchers, murdering
crews, siphoning oil, robbing payroll safes and then letting the
unpiloted ships careen out of control in crowded shipping channels.
 &HT;    A glance at the casualty reports in the shipping journals
reveals the risks seamen routinely take. There's the Dubai Valour,
whose Ukrainian crew was held for ransom in August 1997 by a
Nigerian warlord named Chief Humphrey Idisi. (Despite orders from
Nigeria's highest court that the entire crew be released, four of
the men are still in captivity.)
 &HT;    There's the Cheung Son, whose 23 crew members were killed by
Chinese pirates in December in the Taiwan Straits. There's the
Erria Inge, whose 10 Australian crewmen were found in an unused
refrigerator. And there's the Vanderpool Express, whose captain and
four crewmen were killed shortly after leaving Miami in 1997.
Another 51 deaths were documented that same year.
 &HT;    In addition to the Delta Pride's crew, there are currently 200
men on 10 ships around the world that have been stranded in foreign

travel on cargo ships at some point during their manufacture. But
nowadays, the world's cargo ships sail mostly under dubious
registries, flying so-called flags of convenience from countries
with low safety and health standards and little muscle to guarantee
the welfare of their workers.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A former Buddhist monk convicted of killing two
Orange County shopkeepers in 1981 was executed by lethal injection
early Tuesday despite a flurry of clemency pleas from the pope, the
government of Thailand and others.
</P>
<P>
   Jaturun Siripongs, 43, was described as almost motionless with
his eyes closed as he died at 12:19 a.m. in the San Quentin death
chamber. The Thai native was the sixth killer executed at San
Quentin in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs had expressed remorse for the killings and admitted he
was there in the holdup of a Garden Grove market, but he maintained
until the end that an unnamed accomplice was the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs was pronounced dead 15 minutes after the curtain was
drawn between witnesses and the execution chamber. A prison doctor
administered a deadly chemical cocktail of sodium pentothal to put
him to sleep, pancuronium bromide to stop his breathing and
potassium chloride to stop his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the prison, some 300 protesters demonstrated against the
execution in torrential rains and driving winds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the evening is done, we'll all get into our cars and go
to our warm homes,'' protester Linda Fox said. ``Jay Siripongs will
be cold and dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs' last hours were spent quietly while a flurry of
activity was occurring outside the prison in a vain attempt to save
his life.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court rejected two appeals for a stay of
execution and a review of his case during the evening Monday.
Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said the court rejected one
appeal at 8:10 p.m. and the second 19 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had turned down
his appeal, as had a three-judge panel of the appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs last week lost an appeal in the California Supreme
Court and a clemency bid to Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who last month persuaded the governor of
Missouri to cancel an execution, appealed for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Davis on behalf of Pope John Paul II, Vatican
Ambassador Gabriel Montalvo on Monday urged the governor to make
``a gesture of mercy that would certainly contribute to the
promotion of nonviolence in today's society.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier appeals to spare Siripongs came from Thailand's
ambassador to the United States, two of his jurors, the widower of
one of the victims and former San Quentin Warden Daniel Vasquez, an
ardent supporter of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   State Corrections Department spokesman Tip Kindel said Siripongs
spent his last hours with his spiritual advisers in a holding cell
only a few steps from the death chamber. His last meal was spare:
canned iced tea and canned peaches.
</P>
<P>
   As he lay on the gurney behind a thick glass window, Siripongs'
slender arms and chest were bound with leather straps and tape.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said his body twitched several times as the poisons
worked through his body. At one point, his chest heaved and he
seemed to gasp for air. His few more breaths were increasingly
shallow until they stopped and he lay still.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs was the fourth killer in California to die by lethal
injection. The two previous executions in the past seven years were
done by lethal gas.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In the corner of the small witness room, his sister held hands
with two of his attorneys, all three expressionless.
</P>
<P>
   One of the murder victim's sons, Vitoon Harusadangkul, also was
a witness, along with several reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Siripongs was born in poverty in Thailand, according to his
attorneys, and his first brush with trouble came at age 20 when he
was shot in the head while robbing a department store.
</P>
<P>
   Released for good behavior after a short stay in prison, he
trained as a monk in a Buddhist monastery for a short time before
getting a job as a cook on a cargo ship. There, according to his
supporters, he aided U.S. drug authorities in a sting operation
that got him enough money to buy passage to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, 1981, prosecutors say, he strangled shopkeeper
Packovan Wattanaporn and stabbed clerk Quach Nguyen at an Asian
marker where he sometimes worked. He was arrested and tried after
he was caught trying to use Mrs. Wattanaporn's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Though claiming he didn't do the killing, he expressed remorse
for them. His lawyers said he offered daily penance ``for his
deeds, for the shame he has brought his family and ancestors and
for the suffering he has brought to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Wattanaporn's husband, a Buddhist who said he did
not believe in revenge, wrote a letter supporting clemency, others
were less forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Vitoon Harusadangkul, pressed for execution, testifying
at the clemency hearing, ``What he did, he should pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   Orange County Senior Deputy District Attorney Jim Tanizaki also
opposed clemency, saying of the long span between the murders and
Siripongs' execution: ``These are 16 years that Quach Nguyen and
Pat Wattanaporn, and their respective families, have been denied.''

   &UR; Cycling Across Iowa  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I find information about the annual Ragbrai bike ride
across Iowa? _ Louise James, Barrington, R.I. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ragbrai (rhymes with ``pie'') is an acronym for the
Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, an event
sponsored and organized by The Des Moines Register each year since
1973, when two columnists decided to ride across the state looking
for stories.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Tyson, special projects coordinator for the event,
said the ride _ and it is not a race, the Ragbrai people stress _
will take place this year from July 25 to 31. The exact route will
be announced Feb. 28 in The Register, but it always goes from the
Missouri River on Iowa's western border to the Mississippi on the
other side of the state, usually about 470 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The route is not necessarily flat throughout, and riders should
expect to cover 50 to 80 miles a day. So, riders should be
reasonably fit, even though the ride is meant to be a leisurely
getaway.
</P>
<P>
   Eight communities along the route are chosen as volunteer hosts
for the riders and their support staff. These towns set up
campgrounds in parks, on school grounds and in town squares.
Churches and community organizations organize spaghetti dinners and
the like, and vendors set up booths, as well (Ms. Tyson said food
would probably cost about $20 a day for most riders).
</P>
<P>
   Showers are made available at schools, swimming pools, private
homes, even converted car washes. There is, in short, Ms. Tyson
said, a real family spirit to the event.
</P>
<P>
   Ragbrai has grown to the point where not everyone who wants to
join the ride can. Participation is being limited to 8,500 weeklong
riders, plus 500 to 1,000 others with single-day passes. Up to
10,000 people are expected to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Applications must be postmarked by April 1 and received by April
12 (no fax or e-mail entries). The drawing is done by computer, and
a family or a group can apply together, listing a contact person,
so all will either be chosen or not.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong fee is $95 a rider and $35 for a nonrider, who
might follow by car and support participants. One-day passes are
$25 and $15.
</P>
<P>
   The fee includes an official identification tag, which allows
free baggage transportation, discounts on showers and food, free
support-wagon service, emergency medical insurance, maps and
overnight camping in the host towns. Any profit goes to charities,
including in the host communities, Ms. Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more or to request an application, go to
www.ragbrai.org on the Web, or contact Ragbrai, Post Office Box
622, Des Moines, Iowa 50303; (800) 474-3342, fax (515) 284-8138.

   &UR; Donana Park Update &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the status of Donana National Park in Spain? Last
year, there was a serious mining-waste spill not far from the park
and it was feared that the contaminants would flow into its
marshlands. _ Kathleen W. Morgan, Downingtown, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Last April, noxious black waters spilled from a burst
reservoir of a Canadian-owned zinc mine, and left a thick layer of
zinc, lead, iron and cadmium particles along a path of more than 20
miles. Some entered aquifers feeding the wetlands of Donana, one of
Europe's most important wildlife reserves, southwest of Seville, on
the Atlantic coast between Huelva and Cadiz.
</P>
<P>
   According to the park director, Alberto Ruiz de Larremendi, the
initial cleanup of some 10,300 acres, mostly upstream of Donana was
completed on schedule before the annual rains began in October.
Only a small part of the eastern flank of the 125,331-acre park _ a
bit bigger than Brooklyn and Queens combined _ was directly
affected by the spill.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, government officials and environmental groups are
monitoring the effect of the spill on topsoil, vegetation, aquifers
and fauna. They disagree on the potential long-term damage, but
predictions of dozens or hundreds of dead migratory birds have not
come true this winter. Donana is noted as an important habitat for
about 250 species of birds, and as the home of such endangered
species as the pardel lynx and the Spanish imperial eagle.
</P>
<P>
   The spill did not affect the park's system of guided-only tours.
They are arranged by calling Cooperativa Marismas del Rocio,
(34-959) 430-432, daily 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Spanish time. The tours,
costing about $18.75, are held daily except Monday, at 8:30 a.m.
and at 3 p.m., plus 5 p.m. in summer.
</P>
<P>
   They use all-terrain vehicles holding about 20 people and last
about four hours. They visit all the ecosystems in the park,
including beach, dunes, forest, brush and wetlands. Reservations
are recommended, especially from Easter Week through July. An
English-speaking guide is no extra charge, but must be requested.
</P>
<P>
   More information is available by faxing Donana National Park
headquarters at (34-959) 448-576.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Family Reunion Site &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am planning a family reunion for about 50 people and would
like to hold it somewhere between Philadelphia and Washington. Are
there any reasonably priced all-inclusive resorts in this area? _
Debbie Prigal, Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There seem to be no resorts of the kind you'd find in the
Poconos or Catskills along the I-95 corridor in Maryland and
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Mannix, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Office of Tourism
Development, suggested the Rocky Gap Lodge and Golf Resort in
Cumberland (800) 724-0828, in the western panhandle, and certain
hotels in Ocean City. The former is much farther west than you seem
to want and the latter are not inclusive properties, so you'd have
to seek out activities throughout the city and outside it. The same
can be said for hotels on the Delaware coast.
</P>
<P>
   A place that may meet your needs is Lancaster Host Resort and
Conference Center, in Pennsylvania Dutch country. It's about 45
miles southeast of Harrisburg, 85 miles west of Philadelphia and
120 miles north of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Laughlin, a sales manager who coordinates family reunions
at the resort, said it offered 330 rooms, indoor and outdoor pools,
championship and miniature golf courses, a driving range, four
tennis courts and a children's playground. It is across the street
from the Dutch Wonderland Amusement Park, and close to about 200
outlet shops. Current group room rates are $129 to $139 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The resort is at 2300 Lincoln Highway East, Lancaster, Pa.

 &HT;    DUELING PRESS CONFERENCES WILL SPOTLIGHT TELECOM BATTLE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long-simmering battle between long-distance
giant AT&AMP;T Corp. and the regional Bell telephone companies may boil
over Wednesday as the companies hold dueling events at the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman of AT&AMP;T, is slated to give
the club's luncheon speech, recapping the company's bold moves in
recent months to regain its status as the nation's dominant phone
company.
</P>
<P>
   That event will be followed quickly by a news conference
featuring the U.S. Telephone Association's president, Roy Neel, who
plans to discuss the Bell companies' position that they have been
unfairly locked out of long-distance competition.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back events underscore the competition within the
telecommunications industry as companies scramble to offer
customers integrated services including voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has sent shivers down its competitors' spines in recent
weeks with announcements of a partnership with Time Warner Inc. and
its intent to buy Tele-Communications Inc., both major cable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by regulators, these deals would enable AT&AMP;T to sell
local and long-distance telephone service directly to consumers,
rather than relying on the networks of the regional Bells.
</P>
<P>
   The deals also would give AT&AMP;T access to millions of cable
customers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The regional Bells, consumer groups and Internet service
providers such as America Online Inc. have argued that an AT&AMP;T-TCI
conglomerate should be required to share its cable lines with
competitors. Their reasoning is that regional Bell companies must
make their telephone networks available to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Federal Communications Commission, expected to approve
the AT&AMP;T-TCI merger in coming weeks, is not likely to take that
position.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, FCC Chairman William E. Kennard said he would not
require AT&AMP;T to share its cable lines as part of the merger
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The press club's decision to feature Armstrong as a luncheon
speaker hit a nerve with the regional Bells. At first, the
companies demanded a similar lunch appearance, club officials said,
but then settled for a separate event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Press Club refused to give us the same venue as AT&AMP;T, ``
said BellSouth's spokesman John Schneidawind. ``But we'll be there
to respond to what's likely to be a Bell-bashing session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our markets are open, we're losing business to competitors and
we should be let into the long-distance business,'' he said.

FORGET THE LINGERIE; BRING ON THE APRON AND GARLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By POLLY FROST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I want my husband's attention, there is one sure way to get
it. I head into the kitchen and start chopping and stirring and
sauteing, perfumed by fresh herbs and, yes, garlic. No slinky dress
could do it better.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking is a guaranteed seduction technique. It's about giving
pleasure, and pleasing yourself at the same time. Restaurants are
where we look when we plan for romance, but dining out is not about
intimacy. A four-star meal in sumptuous surroundings is very
different from an evening spent in the kitchen while a man _ or a
woman _ turns carefully selected ingredients into a tantalizing
dinner. This is foreplay on a voluptuously higher level.
</P>
<P>
   When we bond with another person through his sauced-up spare
ribs or his fish in black bean sauce, cooked just for us, we're
connecting on a primal level. Feeding another person is about the
most fundamental social act you can make, said Alan Fiske, a
professor of anthropology at the University of California at Los
Angeles. Infants learn from how they're fed whom they should trust,
and to what communal group they belong, he said. As people grow
older, sharing food becomes one of the primary ways in which they
bond. By sharing food, you're saying, ``What's mine is yours,''
Fiske said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually preparing the food takes it into another dimension.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for the ingredients gives you a chance to daydream
about who you will be cooking for, and what he or she really loves
to eat. A souffle made with imported goat cheese? A curry hot
enough to bring sweat to a brow? Strawberries with creme fraiche?
</P>
<P>
   The actual cooking is even more beguiling. There is something
entrancing about watching someone do something as mundane as dice
an onion if it's being done just for you. The handling of food can
be a very sensual thing to see, whether it's bread being kneaded or
lamb being studded with whole cloves of garlic. I think you can
tell a lot about a person by the way he cooks. Is he attentive to
the cooking temperatures and times for that choice piece of tuna?
Does he take his time cleaning those mushrooms? Does he take
dietary needs into account and yet indulge your senses with spices?
</P>
<P>
   Food is not only a way of bonding socially, but also one of the
ways people determine their sexual relationships. In many
societies, Fiske said, people have food metaphors to describe sex.
Whom you eat with has even played a role in dictating whom you were
allowed to have sex with in some cultures. Or to whom you're
married. A 1930s study on the Kwoma tribe of Papua New Guinea,
Fiske pointed out, reported that ``men and women might have sex
with each other, but until he eats food that she's cooked, they're
not married.''
</P>
<P>
   Even America has always had its food and sex rituals. In pioneer
times, women made enticing box suppers and men bid on them as the
first step in a potential courtship, as lyrically shown in the
musical ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Bailey, the author of ``From Front Porch to Back Seat:
Courtship in 20th-Century America'' (Johns Hopkins University
Press, 1988), said that in years past, it has been the man's role
to take a woman to a restaurant. But when a relationship was being
nudged toward marriage, a couple would move their courtship from
the public space _ restaurants and community events _ to the
private space of the woman's home. This happened under variously
chaperoned circumstances, but once in a more intimate setting, the
woman would set out to prove her wifely potential by cooking an
alluring meal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bailey said that by midcentury, this divison between public
and private space for courtship became increasingly confusing, as
women began to enter the workplace in greater numbers. By the
1960s, advice was being doled out on how they should conduct
themselves in a changing world. Helen Gurley Brown, when she was
the editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, wrote a cookbook telling women
what they should make for a man. Ms. Brown, who advocated getting
as many restaurant meals as possible out of a man, was saying that
there was a reason a woman would want to cook for him, Ms. Bailey
said. Losing that man? Pull out all the exotic stops and reel him
back in. Otherwise, stick to that old reliable, steak and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's just as likely to be the man seducing the woman
through cooking. A man recently told me he learned how to make one
dish _ creme brulee _ as a way to win over women. He faked the rest
of a ``home cooked'' meal, hiding the takeout containers, while
making dessert seductively real.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alternative to having just one person engage in
seduction through cooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Co-preparing food is the best,'' said Suzanne Lopez, a
psychotherapist in Los Angeles and the author of the upcoming book
on relationship guidance for women ``Get Smart With Your Heart,''
to be published this spring by G.P. Putnam's Sons. Ms. Lopez says
she thinks this is how real bonding for couples takes place.
</P>
<P>
   And if only one of you can cook, the other can contribute just
as much to the seductive mood by offering to clean up.

TRUTH-IN-SLAUGHTERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There's a lot of political silliness in this world,
and not all of it is in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it is in Beverly Hills, the sophisticated playground of
the rich, famous and spoiled Rodeo Drive shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The beautiful people there who sit on the city council recently
approved a truth-in-slaughtering initiative that would attach
labels to fur coats describing the possible murderous methods by
which the pelts might have been obtained. Voters will be asked to
vote on the measure in a special election May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The labels would list the many ways minks, beavers, fox,
raccoons and other fur-bearing animals can be killed _ by
electrocution, gassing, neckbreaking, poisoning, clubbing, stomping
or drowning. It would not, however, specify the method by which the
particular victims who contributed to the labelled coat actually
met their fate.
</P>
<P>
   Furriers insist that animals raised on farms for their skins are
killed humanely with a lethal dose of painless sodium phenobarbital
just as veterinarians end the suffering of beloved but ailing pets.
Yet the labels will not mention that.
</P>
<P>
   It is the very notion of killing an animal that is under attack
here, although hunting smaller species has been the human habit
since our ancestors crawled out of the primal ooze into caves.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is supposed to be fighting cruelty to animals, in
particular the ruthless destruction of wildlife for no good
purpose. And a worthy cause that is. In today's atmosphere of moral
purity, who could object?
</P>
<P>
   But the Beverly Hills proposal is about something more extreme,
something truly nutty. It amounts to shameful economic warfare. A
fur coat in itself is not sinful, although its plump price may
encourage that reaction. The goal is to put a legal industry out of
business by making women like myself who adore furs feel too guilty
to buy one.
</P>
<P>
   And it is just a short hop from the killing of animals to drape
the human body to the killing of animals for human food. A fur is a
steak is leather. This may not be a promotion for veggie burgers,
but the proposed labels point that way.
</P>
<P>
   Can pork chops bearing pictures of the adorable Babe be far
behind? Or nutrition labels on mom's chicken soup describing fowl
dismemberment? Or steak personalized with little name tags; ``Hi.
My name is George Angus?''
</P>
<P>
   It is not necessary or useful to read before dining that
chickens and cows are stunned or electrocuted and then their
throats are slit before they arrive, all cut up, on our plates. Did
we think they got there by some sort of divine intervention?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the problem of leather, for surely as many
animals wind up as belts, shoes and purses as end up as hamburger.
Wearing plastic or wooden shoes _ or heaven forbid, going barefoot
_ is not considered an acceptable alternative in the nation's
boardrooms, eating houses or offices.
</P>
<P>
   The animal rights group that thought up the coat-labeling
exercise is called Beverly Hills Consumers for Informed Choices,
but it is the kissing cousin of the national group People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).
</P>
<P>
   PETA is famous for pulling dumb stunts to attract attention.
Recently it crusaded to end the traditional February groundhog day
ceremonies, during which a local groundhog is awakened from his
winter slumber and prodded to come outside briefly to look for his
shadow. PETA contends this is cruel because, said a spokesman,
``These animals haven't volunteered their services and should be
left in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   PETA's campaign against the wearing of fur coats has been more
visible and successful than its parallel efforts to change the
national diet. It is less troublesome to wear a cloth coat than it
is to become a vegetarian. Not everyone is ecstatic about daily
consumption of tofu or cabbage soup.
</P>
<P>
   The labeling gambit is the latest in a series of PETA tactics on
behalf of cloth coats, from throwing paint on fur-clad pedestrians
to luring supermodels into coatless _ and nude _ poses in
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   When the campaign peaked a couple years ago, the fur industry
fell into a marketing slump, although it is not clear whether this
was due to a sluggish economy or the activists' threats. But
recently fur coat sales have rebounded and some of the anti-fur
models have been seen in mink again.
</P>
<P>
   There were even quotes from fashion industry luminaries allowing
as how PETA was, well, dead. Unfortunately, this edict seems
premature.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Hills is a small, elite enclave of little more than
30,000 citizens. It symbolizes the power of money, big money. But
if it votes for this stupid labeling trick, it would demonstrate
that money is not the equivalent of brains.

WINE TALK: A MARATHON CELEBRATION FOR A VINEYARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Southern California is used to fanatics,
so a group of them who gathered here last weekend attracted little
attention. All they did was eat and drink wine. Ninety wines.
</P>
<P>
   You could call them wine enthusiasts, but then there are wine
enthusiasts and there are Ridge Vineyards fans, fans being
shorthand for fanatics. These folks, all 70 of them, were devoted
admirers of the venerable winery in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They
came from as far as Caracas, Venezuela, and as near as 10 blocks
away, and they knew their Ridge vintages the way some people know
baseball statistics.
</P>
<P>
   They were here for an extraordinary three-day retrospective of
wines from Ridge, from its very first vintage in 1962, Monte Bello
cabernet sauvignon, to the most recent Ridge vintage to be
released, 1996. What it demonstrated was a renewed awareness of
how, in the new world of winemaking, Ridge is a rare bastion of
tradition. And how California wines can have the staying power of
great French wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``American wines have no classification as they do in Bordeaux
because they have no history,'' a longtime Ridge fan, John Tilson
Ridge, said. ``Except at Ridge, where they have 35 years of
consistency. If any wine ever earned a right to be a first growth,
it has to be Ridge and the wine has to be Monte Bello.''
</P>
<P>
   The marathon comprised 30 wines Friday night at a dinner at
Spago on Canon Drive here, 30 more Saturday at a lunch at Valentino
in Santa Monica and 30 more at Sunday lunch, again at Spago. At
each gathering, Paul Draper, Ridge's president and, since 1969, its
winemaker, commented on the wines and fielded questions.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day party _ no one could call it a mere tasting _ was
arranged by Bipin Desai, a physicist from Riverside, who qualifies
as both a wine enthusiast and a Ridge fan. Over the years he has
put together similar retrospectives featuring American and French
wines at prominent restaurants in California, in New York and in
Paris. At each gathering, he has worked with the chef to create a
meal that complements the wines.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge Vineyards was founded in 1959 by a group of scientists at
Stanford University who bought the mountaintop site in Cupertino,
an hour south of San Francisco, for weekend camping and with the
idea of using it for retirement homes. But they found old vines on
the property, which was a vineyard before prohibition, and the rest
is wine history.
</P>
<P>
   None of the original partners were winemakers, but one of them,
David Bennion, taught himself how to crush and ferment grapes. He
was so successful that three years later, the group decided to open
a commercial winery with Bennion in charge. They called their
vineyard Monte Bello, after Monte Bello Road, which led up to their
mountain fastness from the Santa Clara Valley floor. (Since 1986,
the winery has been owned by the head of a Japanese pharmaceutical
company, Akihito Otsuka.)
</P>
<P>
   Their first commercial wine, the 1962 Monte Bello cabernet, is
still Ridge's most important and most desired. Every bottle of each
new vintage is snapped up by collectors unfazed by the $100 price.
Older vintages are difficult to find. The winery, which supplied
almost all the wines over the weekend, had no more 1962 Monte
Bello. Desai had to buy several bottles, with some people at the
party saying he had to pay $1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge has two audiences, Draper said: collectors who buy the
Monte Bello cabernets and a wider group who buy the winery's second
cabernet, Santa Cruz Mountains, and its even better-known
zinfandels, especially Geyserville and Lytton Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was very little cabernet to be had in the early '60s,''
Draper said, ``but there were small holdings of these wonderful old
zinfandel vines everywhere. So while Monte Bello was being
expanded, Ridge moved into making zinfandel.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, Ridge bought zinfandel grapes all over
northern and central California, enticing farmers with good prices
and the prospect of having their or their vineyard's name on the
Ridge bottles. ``Over the years,'' Draper said, ``we've had between
30 and 40 different labels, most of them for old-vine zinfandels.''
</P>
<P>
   Such vines, some of them more than 100 years old, are prized by
winemakers. Their yields are low but the grapes are intensely
flavorful, as is the wine made from them.
</P>
<P>
   The wines served Friday included chardonnay, which Ridge has
made since the 1960s; merlot, relatively new on the list, from the
early 1990s; petite sirahs from 1971 to 1995; Lytton Springs
zinfandels, and a selection of other wines that were, like the
merlot, originally used for blending but sometimes bottled by
themselves. They included barbera, carignan, grenache, mataro
(called mourvedre in France) and syrah. There was also a selection
of late-harvest, dessert-type wines, both dry and sweet, made from
zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's wines were almost all Geyserville zinfandels, from
1970 to 1996, with half-a-dozen Lytton Springs zinfandels from the
mid-1970s added in. The Geyserville vineyard, in the Alexander
Valley in Sonoma County, is leased. At present, Draper said, Ridge
owns or leases with a right to buy 60 percent of its vineyard
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday featured all Monte Bello cabernets. So prestigious is
this wine that some guests came only for this portion of the party,
and paid accordingly. The three-day event cost $1,400 a person, but
the Monte Bello overview alone cost $750.
</P>
<P>
   The only non-Monte Bello cabernet was the 1983. Draper
explained: ``We sent the wine to our mail-order customers as Monte
Bello, then decided it didn't live up to the standard we set for
that wine. So we gave the rest of the vintage the name of our
second wine, Santa Cruz Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we wrote to the mail-order customers and told them that
if they'd send back the wine labeled Monte Bello, we'd send them
two cases of the same wine labeled Santa Cruz Mountains. Most did,
but a few figure that the bottles labeled Monte Bello would be
worth something one day, so they hung on to them. The '83 you have
today is Santa Cruz, formerly Monte Bello.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the three events were for comparisons, not competition, no
one pushed for winners. In fact, different wines appealed to
different guests, in part because bottle variation can be
considerable in older wines, even those from the same cellar.
</P>
<P>
   While Draper refrained from excess enthusiasm for any of his
wines, a close friend made a revealing observation. The Ridge boss'
license plate, he said, ``is MB 70.''

 WINTER DESSERT PAR EXCELLENCE  (mk) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not exactly sure when the tradition of poaching dried fruit
dropped out of the average home cook's repertory. Probably about
the same time fresh summer fruits from the Southern Hemisphere
starting arriving in midwinter.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing can match dried fruit for convenience and intensity
of flavor. And when you poach an assortment with port and a few
spices, the result belies the ease of preparation. This is not a
summer dessert _ no one would mistake this for fresh fruit _ but it
is delicious, low-fat and a welcome change from any other winter
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   For breakfast, I like fruit poached in water, with no spice at
all, but adding port and spices makes the dish really sing. This is
especially true if you use unexpected flavorings like pepper, anise
or candied ginger, which becomes tender and delicious during
poaching, more like a fruit than a seasoning. Consider the spices
included in the recipe a guideline or series of suggestions rather
than an absolute list. (You might even try adding a dried chili if
your tastes run in that direction.) But be careful with especially
strong spices like cloves, which can quickly overwhelm a dish.
</P>
<P>
   Since the preparation of this dish is absolutely foolproof, the
challenge lies entirely in the shopping. One of the great things
about dried fruit is that organic varieties are readily available,
especially in natural food stores. Another is the incredible
variety of fruits now being dried. In the course of fine-tuning
this recipe I tried not only the obvious prunes, figs, apricots,
peaches and pears, but also cherries, blueberries, strawberries,
pineapple and even banana. I tend toward the traditional, but I
really enjoyed the tartness that pineapple added.
</P>
<P>
   I did not try poaching the fruit in mature vintage port, because
I'm not an eccentric millionaire. But I did try lighter, younger
tawny port versus older, stronger (and more expensive) ruby and
late-bottled vintage ports and, although I did like the intensity
of flavor of the more powerful port, I don't think the difference
is all that notable. Buy a port you'll enjoy, though, because the
recipe uses less than a third of a bottle.
</P>

<P>
   12 prunes
</P>
<P>
   8 figs
</P>
<P>
   4 apricot peach halves
</P>
<P>
   4 pear halves
</P>
<P>
   3 pieces candied ginger
</P>
<P>
   1 clove
</P>
<P>
   5 allspice berries
</P>
<P>
   5 peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 star anise
</P>
<P>
   1 inchlong cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   1 cup port.
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine all ingredients in a medium-size saucepan, and bring
to a boil. Turn heat to very low, and cover. Cook about 30 minutes,
at which point most of the port will have been absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   2. If the fruit is tender, it's done. If not, add 1/2 cup water,
bring to a boil again, cover and cook 15 minutes longer. Repeat
once more if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove the fruit with a slotted spoon; then strain the liquid
to remove the spices. Serve a portion of the fruit warm, cold or at
room temperature with a spoonful or two of its juice and, if you
like, a bit of sweet or sour cream, yogurt or creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   Herbes de Provence
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can I buy herbes de Provence?
</P>
<P>
   A. Herbes de Provence, which usually contain some combination of
crushed bay leaves, fennel seeds, lavender, marjoram, rosemary,
sage, summer savory and thyme, can be used like other dried herbs.
Whisk the blend into marinades, dressings or eggs; sprinkle it over
vegetables and meats before roasting, or crumble it into soups,
stews and casseroles. It is available in specialty stores, usually
in little clay pots or rustic-looking miniature burlap bags (often
lined with plastic to keep the herbs fresh).
</P>
<P>
   In New York: Dean and Deluca, 560 Broadway (Prince Street),
(212) 431-1691, or (800) 221-7714 for mail order, carries herbes de
Provence in 1.5-ounce tins for $4.50 and 7-ounce bags for $7.
Kalustyan's, 123 Lexington Ave. (28th Street), (212) 685-3451,
sells the herb blend loose for $1.50 an ounce. You may also find it
in supermarkets like D'Agostino.
</P>
<P>
   Frozen Ricotta?
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you freeze fresh ricotta?
</P>
<P>
   A. You can, but like any other cheese, it will suffer. Fresh
ricotta, with its creamy texture and sweet, milky flavor, is best
used within a day of two of buying it. If you must freeze it, be
advised that it will break down on defrosting. Italian-food expert
Michele Scicolone, author with Charles Scicolone of ``Pizza Any Way
You Slice It'' (Broadway Books, $20), says the result is usually
too grainy and watery to use in uncooked recipes like a cannoli
filling. It could be used in cooked dishes, where its unpleasant
texture will be hidden by the other ingredients (like the tomato
sauce and mozzarella in lasagna).
</P>

   Passing the ricotta through a sieve or whirling it in a food

   Q. Can food be flambeed in a nonstick pan? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Not usually. Many manufacturers of nonstick pans use
plastic-based coatings that could burn off if subjected to a direct
flame as in lighting brandy or a sauce. (That is why the directions
warn against placing such pans under the broiler.) There is,
however, one type of nonstick pan that will withstand a flame
because it is made of a specially processed stainless steel. Called
French Cybernox, it is available at Bridge Kitchenware, 214 East
52d Street, (212) 688-4220; (800) 274-3435 for calls from outside
New York; www.bridgekitchenware.com. The price is $145 for a
9{-inch pan or $160 for a 10\-inch pan).

`KILL ZONE' MISSES MARK BY LOSING FOCUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
KILL ZONE 
By Jim Silver (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23) 
 
 By MONTY PHAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's best not to use too high power a scope when examining
Phoenix author Jim Silver's new novel, ``Kill Zone,'' about a
revenge-seeking ex-military sniper.
</P>
<P>
   Like the sniper, the book works best from a distance. Silver
puts an original spin on the classic ``son avenges father'' tale,
the novel's dominant and most developed plot line. But the story
loses focus when the often convoluted subplots come into play.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins in 1970, during the withdrawal of troops from
Vietnam. Waiting to return home, members of a brigade stationed in
what American troops called the VC Valley find out that the Army
major in charge of operations in the area, Ralph Longbaugh, is
preparing to send them out for one last body count.
</P>
<P>
   With its dense jungle providing cover for Viet Cong guerillas,
the valley is a certain death trap. So, instead of obeying orders,
the squad decides to kill the one issuing them, an act termed
``fragging.'' Knowing the major's schedule, the brigade ambushes
him, setting it up to look like the Viet Cong did it.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the members, arrested for selling drugs, confesses
the killing to two captains in the Army's Criminal Investigation
Division. The captains are convinced of the squad's guilt, but the
lack of solid evidence allows the brigade members to go home free
men. Meanwhile, the Army tells Longbaugh's family only that the
major was killed in action.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, Longbaugh's son, Aaron, has become an expert
Army sharpshooter. During a chance encounter, one of the captains
who investigated the suspected murder tells Aaron what really
happened, unwittingly setting forth a 14-year-long quest for
revenge in which the son attempts to kill every surviving member of
the squad.
</P>
<P>
   That makes Aaron Longbaugh by far the novel's most intriguing
character, if for no other reason than that he fails to be easily
classified as the good or bad guy. He is the victim as much as he
is the assailant, so condemning him as a murderer is tempered by a
feeling that his victims' fates are deserved.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Longbaugh's character is a shade of gray not shared
by others in the novel. The only other major characters with levels
of complexity approaching Longbaugh's are the Army investigators,
who find out about Longbaugh's killing spree and must decide
whether to stop him, and, if so, how.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, an otherwise solid story line gets bogged down by
thin subplots. One involves a carjacker who is shot and killed by a
police SWAT team. A wrongful-death lawsuit filed on behalf of the
carjacker results in a relationship between a female insurance
investigator and a mysterious member of the SWAT team that the
insurance company represents.
</P>
<P>
   What happens is predictable, no matter how hard Silver, who
works for an insurance company, tries to avoid it. In another
subplot, Silver heads to the other extreme, using a series of
coincidences that eventually lead to the discovery of Longbaugh's
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the various plots advance in a manner comparable to
one of Longbaugh's bullets: You know where it's going before it
gets there. And just like the result of the sniper's shot is
expected, so is the book's ending. In effect, Silver sets up the
story for a decent kill shot. And then misses. &QL;

THE COOK'S PEAK: CLIMBING MOUNT CASSOULET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the perfect union of meat and bean, and as humble as
bread. And it is quite possibly the most filling dish ever created.
But when cassoulet, a slow-cooked French country stew of plump
beans, broth and succulent meats, is right, it can be one of the
most memorable, most satisfying dishes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Making cassoulet, however, isn't simply a matter of good
culinary skills. In the ranks of classic dishes, it is the
equivalent of scaling Everest. It takes good planning and great
ingredients, but most of all, it takes stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, every component _ the beans, the stock, the duck
confit _ is prepared separately. And not one is a small task. The
stock is slowly reduced and carefully seasoned, so that it is rich
and gelatinous but not too salty. The beans are soaked, then
simmered for hours. The duck legs are salted and cured, then cooked
in fat.
</P>
<P>
   Then it must all come together. The meats and beans are
combined, a last dash of liquid is added and bread crumbs are
rubbed over the top in a rough layer. Then, while it bubbles away
in the oven, you are left with nothing but mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Not until it reaches the table and you break through the
bread-crumb crust do you know if the cassoulet is warmed through,
if the meats are tender, if the sauce is liquid but not soupy _ if
all your hard work is rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   I have always seen it as the perfect challenge, a culinary test
of womanhood. And when winter came in, the idea of staying in my
apartment cooking for hours had definite appeal. The peak beckoned;
the moment of truth had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   First I sought out restaurants where chefs had taken the plunge.
I didn't need to look very hard. As it turns out, a surprising
number of chefs _ many with large, busy restaurants _ still take
the time to make this labor-intensive dish.
</P>
<P>
   I stopped in at Judson Grill in Manhattan, where I heard that
Bill Telepan, the chef, was making a lamb cassoulet. Thin rods of
lamb sausage, bits of lamb bacon, lamb confit and velvety soft lamb
shank lay in a fragrant pool of lamb stock and white beans.
</P>
<P>
   I went downtown to Le Gigot on Cornelia Street. There, the
cassoulet is at the other end of the spectrum. It is as rich and
thick as chili and about as subtle. I salvaged the blood sausage
and duck confit, but was so full afterward that I had to postpone
my research for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Later there was lobster cassoulet with tiny navy and shell beans
at 11 Madison Park and cassoulet, believe it or not, as a side dish
to lamb shank at Alison on Dominick Street.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered plenty of weird cassoulets out there, too. The one
at Cafe Boulud, is, of all things, vegetarian. Cassoulet is all
about meat and fat, but on the Upper East Side, the diners are
apparently delighting in one made with only beans, vegetables (the
carrots cut to look like slabs of sausage) and a judicious
sprinkling of oil. It was impressive how much flavor and succulence
the cooks managed to eke out of such pure ingredients. But purity
was not what I was after.
</P>
<P>
   I tasted my favorite cassoulet at Gertrude's, just before the
restaurant closed. Laurent Manrique, the chef, made a deeply
flavored, robust stew. The beans _ a variety called Tarbais, from
southwest France _ were plump and seething, the duck confit had
slackened and was falling off the bone. You could eat it with a
spoon.
</P>
<P>
   There were fat pork sausages and hearty slabs of garlic
saucisson, and the only aromatics were whole roasted garlic and a
little thyme. Best of all was the lump of salty, tender gizzard.
</P>
<P>
   With gluttony looming, I decided it was time to face the beast
and get to work.
</P>
<P>
   I called up Telepan for some coaching. He was more than willing
to share his recipe. ``Four days ahead of time, you cure the lamb
bacon,'' he said. ``You rinse it off and let it rest for two days
to dry out. Then on the fourth day, you could cold smoke it. Then
when that's done, and after you make the lamb confit and cook the
shanks, you can start the cassoulet.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefs, I had forgotten, have an altered sense of reality. He
chattered on and I wondered if the whole thing wasn't just a bad
idea. Maybe the best cassoulet experience involves going to a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Telepan was somewhere between rendering duck fat and soaking
sheep casings when I began to visualize exactly what I wanted:
soft, fat beans, some garlicky pork sausage, a little gizzard like
Manrique's, duck confit, a broth like Telepan's with a light scent
of garlic and thyme and a coarse crust.
</P>
<P>
   I was determined to conquer this dish without it conquering me:
I would soak the beans and make the duck stock, but there was going
to be no smoking of bacon in my apartment. And it was going to be
filling enough that if I made it for a dinner party, I would need
to serve nothing else but a green salad and an earthy red wine.
</P>
<P>
   I took such liberties because French cooks do, too. In southwest
France, the cassoulet _ named for the cassole, or glazed
earthenware dish it is typically cooked in _ varies from village to
village, even home to home. It is a country dish made with locally
grown beans _ like the Tarbais in the Pyrenees and , farther east,
the lingot _ and various sundry parts of lamb, duck or pig. And it
is meant to halt any quivers of hunger. Few fail to.
</P>
<P>
   Some cooks use tomato, some do not. Some add a bread-crumb
crust, bake it, press it down into the liquid, and do this several
times to make a serious, stick-to-your-ribs cassoulet. Others skip
the bread crumbs altogether.
</P>
<P>
   I plotted my attack. Modeling my recipe technique after
Manrique's. I would begin four nights ahead, doing a little bit
each night to spread out the workload. This had another good
consequence: as with any stew, each day the flavors would further
meld and improve.
</P>
<P>
   The first night, I soaked the beans and made a simple duck
stock. I bought a small Muscovy duck and removed its wings and
backbone, reserving the rest of the bird to roast later. Then in a
stockpot I combined the backbone and wings with a chopped onion,
four cloves of garlic and a few sprigs of thyme, filled it with
water and put it on the stove. While it simmered and reduced for an
hour or so, I sat on my sofa.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work comes on the second day, when you cook the
beans and establish the flavor base of the dish. I browned the pork
and lamb sausages in the braising pan, then added the onions and
garlic, and eventually the beans, stock, some thyme and a slab of
prosciutto skin _ conned from a friendly butcher _ for extra
flavor, and put it in the oven to let slow heat work its magic on
the beans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In two hours, during which I was far from the kitchen, the beans
softened and the flavors of the cooking juices intensified with
touches of pork, lamb, salt and herbs. I let it cool overnight and
went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   The third day was a breeze. I took the cassoulet from the
refrigerator and added the duck confit and gizzards. Once more I
put it in a low oven and let it simmer, melding the flavors. My
cassoulet was within grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, I did a bit of experimenting, too. I made duck
confit and added one leg to the cassoulet to compare it with a
prepared confit. For those obsessed with purity, making confit is a
gratifying process: Moulard duck legs are packed in salt and
aromatics for a day, then rinsed off and simmered in duck fat or
lard. But the duck legs must be specially ordered, duck fat is
about as expensive as gold and lard is ridiculously difficult to
find in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   I also tried a version with small round navy beans and water.
Navy beans are pleasant but seem too delicate when mingling with
such hearty meats. And water is fine but no match for even a light
duck stock. Store-bought chicken stock would be a better
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the trick to good cassoulet is distinguishing between
ease and compromise. Choosing not to smoke bacon makes the job more
painless and you can find good bacon and sausage to substitute. But
choosing water over flavorful stock is a compromise. And not a very
good one.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I served the cassoulet, I stayed out of the kitchen
and instead went shopping. Fairway was brimming with people
frantically filling their carts so they could get home and start
cooking. I whisked through, picking up some salad greens and
escaped the madness in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   My guests were arriving at 7 p.m. At 6:45, I spooned the
cassoulet into a roasting pan, paved the top with bread crumbs, and
put it in the oven. I was close to the summit and there was no
turning back. Without anything else to do and just a single unknown
on the horizon, I poured a glass of wine and joined my guests.
</P>
<P>
   When the moment came and I broke through the crust, a burst of
heat billowed up from the hot broth. The dark, rustic sausages were
still tender and the rich, salty duck had mellowed in the herbal
broth. It was just what I had imagined.
</P>
<P>
   I had arrived, and was even still hungry. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASSOULET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 4 1/2 hours, spread over 4 days &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 cups Tarbais beans or navy beans
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon duck fat or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound garlic pork sausage, cut into 12 slices
</P>
<P>
   1 pound lamb sausage, cut into 12 slices
</P>
<P>
   2 onions, cut into 1/4-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   8 cloves garlic, crushed with the side of a chef's knife
</P>
<P>
   8 sprigs thyme plus 1 tablespoon chopped thyme
</P>
<P>
   3 quarts duck stock (made without tomatoes) or water
</P>
<P>
   1 6-inch by 2-inch piece of prosciutto skin or 1 6-inch bone of
Bayonne ham
</P>
<P>
   Coarse sea salt
</P>
<P>
   Coarsely ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 duck legs confit, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   1 pound duck gizzard confit
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups coarse bread crumbs (some should be the size of peas)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons coarsely chopped parsley. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Four nights before serving, place beans in a large bowl and
cover with vinegar and 8 cups water.
</P>
<P>
   2. Three days before serving, drain and rinse beans. Preheat
oven to 325 degrees. In a large, heavy braising pan, melt duck fat
or oil over medium-high heat. Add pork sausage and saute until
browned. Remove from pan and set aside. Add lamb sausage and brown
on all sides. Remove from pan and set aside with pork sausage. Pour
off all but 2 tablespoons fat. Lower heat to medium and add onions
and garlic. Saute until lightly browned, about 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add thyme sprigs, stock, prosciutto skin (or ham bone) and
beans to pan. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Bring stock to a
boil, cover loosely with aluminum foil, then place in the oven and
simmer for 1 1/4 hours. Add sausages and continue cooking 45 to 55
minutes, until beans are tender. Remove from oven and let cool.
Refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   4. The day before serving, preheat oven to 325 degrees and bring
beans to room temperature. Add duck leg and gizzard confits to the
beans (they should be immersed in the liquid) and bake, uncovered,
in the oven for 1 1/4 hours. Remove from oven. Season to taste with
salt _ this is the last time you will season the dish before
serving. Let cool completely. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   5. The day you are serving, preheat oven to 425 degrees and
bring cassoulet to room temperature. In a small bowl, combine bread
crumbs, chopped thyme and parsley. Transfer cassoulet to a large
earthenware casserole or deep 12-inch by 15-inch roasting pan, so
that all the meats lie in a single layer. The liquid should come up
just to the top of the meat and beans, but should not cover them.
It should be loose with liquid but not soupy. Adjust accordingly,
adding stock or water if neccessary. Sprinkle the bread crumb
mixture over top. Bake uncovered until heated through, bubbling and
lihgtly browned on top, about 30 to 40 minutes. Serve.

MANY POOR LACK INSURANCE DESPITE HEALTH PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Hundreds of thousands of California
children and their parents remain without health insurance, despite
two virtually free programs that give coverage to the state's
poorest residents.
</P>
<P>
   After seven months of operation, only about 70,000 of an
estimated 325,000 qualified children have been enrolled in Healthy
Families, a low-cost health insurance program supported mostly by
the state and a federal tax on tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide study released Tuesday shows almost half of
California's working poor parents lack insurance because the state,
like most others, isn't expanding coverage under the 1996 federal
welfare changes.
</P>
<P>
   California lawmakers have begun looking at changing Medi-Cal,
the state's insurance program for the poorest residents, to make it
easier for an estimated 600,000 uninsured children and their
parents to get coverage.
</P>
<P>
   There also is an aggressive effort to expand the
state-administered Healthy Families so another 145,000 children can
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $21 million advertising budget for Healthy Families,
many parents don't know they can enroll their children for as
little as $7 a month, don't understand the complicated application,
which is being streamlined after numerous complaints, or don't
trust the government enough to ask about it.
</P>
<P>
   Child welfare advocates and Democratic lawmakers blame former
Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, for restricting Healthy Families to
a select group of poor parents, despite a huge amount of money
available from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   They also say the promotion campaign relies too heavily on
flashy television advertising rather than energizing community
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, an estimated 7 million Californians lack health
insurance, despite a booming economy now producing nearly $1
trillion in goods and services. About 1.2 million of the uninsured
are children, although most of them could get immediate low-cost
coverage under Healthy Families and Medi-Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all talk about HMO reform, as well we should, but there is
a more critical issue facing California, and that's access to
care,'' said Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A study released Tuesday by the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities shows changes in welfare and the robust economy have
caused more and more parents to leave welfare _ and to leave the
health insurance program that goes with it. They end up with jobs,
but at low wages and without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that California had one of the worst records in
the nation when it came to people without health insurance. Out of
2.2 million working parents with incomes at 200 percent of the
poverty level _ $24,675 a year for a family of four _ or below,
about 901,000 are without health insurance, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, some lawmakers want to remove the stigma of being
on welfare that often is attached to Medi-Cal. One change would
allow Medi-Cal applications to be mailed instead of filled out at
county welfare offices.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, is preparing a bill that
would streamline the Medi-Cal application process and eliminate a
rule that forbids two-parent families from working more than 100
hours per month, even if it is at minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups want to expand who qualifies for Medi-Cal. Although
new welfare laws allow people to work and still keep Medi-Cal, only
the very poor qualify for benefits. Children can get coverage by
Medi-Cal while their parents often cannot, depending on income
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current rules are out of step with welfare reform, which
is pushing parents to take a job rather than a welfare check,''
said Lucy Quacinella of the San Francisco-based National Center for
Youth Law.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy Families is funded by a 50-cents-per-pack federal tax on
cigarettes, and was designed to cover children whose parents make
too much money to qualify for state medical coverage and too little
to buy quality health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa has introduced a measure, which has tentative
support from Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, to raise the income level
to 250 percent of the poverty level, adding about 145,000 children
to the system.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill would take the state's legal settlement with
tobacco companies and expand Healthy Families to parents, not just
their children. There appears to be plenty of money: The tobacco
settlement is about $12.5 billion, and the federal government is
standing ready with another $859 million a year in Healthy Families
money if California wants it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; EXPECTING ADAM &QL; 
 &UR; Martha Beck (Times, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   To say this book is about a woman who had a baby with Down
syndrome is like saying Mary Karr's ``The Liar's Club'' was about a
little girl from a dysfunctional family _ no short description
allows for the storytelling. And Martha Beck does love to tell a
story. She and her husband were graduate students at Harvard,
shouldering grueling schedules, juggling a young daughter, pursuing
prestige and demanding perfection of themselves even by the
competitive standards of the university. It went against all logic
for Beck, who was then 25 and staunchly pro-choice, to continue an
unplanned pregnancy, and it made even less sense later, when tests
revealed that her unborn child had Down syndrome. But continue she
did, for reasons she did not fully understand, and along the way
strange, metaphysical things happened that could be explained, she
writes here, only as Adam ``helping me prepare to become his
mother.'' This book is not Adam's story, but his mother's tender
memory of how he changed her life while she waited for him to be
born. As a writer, Beck is funny, irreverent, chatty and
intelligent (although she indulges in too many side stories _ she
spends two whole pages discussing the unusually large size of the
veins in her arms). ``Expecting Adam'' is not a warm and fuzzy
book, although it probably will make you cry anyway. It also will
make you very happy for Beck, who has followed Adam into a new life
full of joyful exploration and uncommon grace. Beck and Adam, who
is now 10, live in Phoenix with the rest of their family. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; TOYER &QL; 
 &UR; Gardner McKay (Little, Brown, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Gardner McKay once appeared in a television show called
``Adventures in Paradise,'' in which he looked good, acted badly
and took long, long voyages to exotic places on a pretty sailboat.
Now, he has written a long, long, (begin itals) long (end itals)
book about a psychopath called Toyer, who drugs women and puts them
into eternal comas by making incisions in their necks and cutting
the nerves to their brains, rendering them mentally dead for the
rest of their lives. Maude Garance is the doctor who has cared for
all of Toyer's victims, and she is nearing a breakdown as Toyer
steps up his evil toll. There's also a newspaper reporter (as
usual, an embarrassment to the trade) and an editor who is so
shoddy that he happily publishes Toyer's accounts of his dreadful
deeds and lets Maude analyze Toyer's psychological troubles in a
column of her own. The final showdown between Maude and Toyer is
mind-numbing. This might have been a decent thriller at half the
length, but at 453 pages it is McKay's longest voyage. We suggest
that you jump ship, or stay on the dock and count yourself the
smartest sailor of all. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FOREVER SISTERS &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Claudia O'Keefe (Pocket, $23)
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if she is not the type to share confidences, every woman
possesses a (begin itals) secret self (end itals) that only a
sister will understand,'' editor Claudia O'Keefe writes in her
introduction. Is this true? New &AMP; Notable has never had sisters,
has never felt scarred by the omission, and is, in fact, bewildered
by the fuss _ so we congratulate ourselves on our good nature in
mentioning this book to you. It's an anthology of stories and
essays about sisters, most of them previously published.
Contributors include Whitney Otto, Caroline Leavitt, Ann Beattie,
Fay Weldon, Rita Dove, Cristina Garcia, Marly Swick, Marilyn
French, Olivia Goldsmith, Alice Walker and others. We are
especially partial to Dove's story, ``Under the Rose,'' in which
she takes the voices of a mother and her three daughters _ The
Eldest, The Middle One (her contribution is a small paragraph that
moves effortlessly from complaint to adjustment _ ``what a freedom
to be the ampersand,'' she says) and Beauty, who is, of course, the
youngest, the spoiled one, the one who talks on and on. Some family
dynamics are familiar even to those of us whose secret selves will
always remain a mystery. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HEAVY WATER &QL; 
 &UR; Martin Amis (Harmony, $21)
</P>
<P>
   Martin Amis is back from his American experiment (his last
novel, ``Night Train,'' was about a hard-boiled, tough-talking
female detective) and into familiar territory _ withering satire
that is dazzlingly funny despite the obvious affection at its
heart. Amis has great fondness for his characters even when they
behave badly, or perhaps because of it. The laughs come in small
doses in these nine stories. In ``Career Move,'' he spins a
literary fantasy in which poetry is the big-selling commodity and
screenplays are the stuff of obscure pamphlets and low-paying
journals (the screenwriter here is Alistair, whose woeful
insecurities will remind you of the failed novelist of Amis' very
funny novel ``The Information''). In ``Let Me Count the Times,'' a
staid businessman becomes a human calculator as he tallies up the
episodes of his sex life. In ``Straight Fiction,'' homosexuality is
the norm and heterosexuals are in the closet. Amis is brilliant,
witty and frequently, for the faint of heart, offensive. There's no
one else quite like him. &QL;

MAKING TEA IN A FRENCH COFFEE PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When presented with a cup of nondescript brownish
liquid at dinner, Mark Twain said, ``It's inferior _ for coffee _
but it is pretty fair tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he ordered tea at Maratti, a new Italian seafood restaurant
on the Upper East Side, he would have found it better than pretty
fair, but served in a coffee pot. Though not touted for tea, the
French press, the classic plunger coffee maker, is surprisingly
effective. It brews loose tea with less fuss, paraphernalia and
mess than a teapot with a tea strainer. The glass pot even makes it
easier to tell when the tea is strong enough, and the plunger keeps
the leaves from flowing into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   To make tea in a coffee press, place a heaping tablespoon of
good loose tea in the bottom of a single-serving plunger pot (12
ounces, enough for two cups). Add boiling water, and put the cover
in place, with the plunger up. Allow the tea to steep, then gently
push down the plunger, just enough to restrain the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Attilio Fragna, the owner of Maratti, said he got the plunger
pots from his tea supplier.
</P>
<P>
   But Miriam Novalle, the owner of the T Salon and Emporium in the
Flatiron district, said she did not approve. ``You can crush the
leaves,'' she said. ``You can release bitter oils, and it adds
anxiety, and that's not good.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're more sanguine about it, though, you'll find that
dumping the used tea leaves is also easier than cleaning them out
of the crevices of a traditional English teapot. But if you want
your fortune told, you're out of luck.

A SHRIMP DISH WHERE THE REAL STAR IS BUTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the second of eight columns by Rick Moonen, the executive
chef and an owner of Oceana in Manhattan. His collaborator on these
columns is Dorie Greenspan.)  
 (HLW)  
 By RICK MOONEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I think the biggest compliment you can pay a chef is
to grab a piece of bread and use it as a sponge for every last drop
of sauce on your plate. Whenever I serve escargots, I love to hear
the mmmm's and aah's (and the slurps) of people as they polish off
the last of the butter _ the real star of the dish _ with hunks of
bread.
</P>
<P>
   It's high praise, and it's the praise you'll get when you serve
these jumbo shrimp filled with a butter that's just as garlicky and
even more herby than the one normally used for escargots.
</P>
<P>
   I created this dish to showcase the rich flavors of that butter,
since everyone loves it, even though not everyone loves the snails
in which it's usually stuffed. Escargot butter, traditionally a
combination of sweet butter, lemon juice, shallots, parsley and
lots of garlic, isn't meant to be subtle, and this recipe is even
bolder.
</P>
<P>
   I bumped up the herbs. Playing off the theme of fines herbes _ a
classic mix of parsley, chervil, chives and tarragon _ I
substituted dill for the hard-to-find chervil and added thyme. I
also gave it a shot of cayenne, kept the garlic flavor up front and
made enough of it so that each shrimp could be covered with a
generous amount.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp are the perfect stand-ins for escargots. They're meaty,
moist, sweet, just a little briny and a natural with butter. Look
for the biggest shrimp you can find. I use what are known as U-8
shrimp, the designation for shrimp that weigh in at fewer than
eight to a pound. (You can use any large shrimp, but if you can
find head-on white shrimp, labeled Gulf, Mexican or Panamanian,
you've hit pay dirt.) Jumbo shrimp are great for broiling, but
remember to keep the broiler door open when you broil so that the
heat comes only from the top; if you close the door, you'll be
roasting, not broiling.
</P>
<P>
   I serve the shrimp on toasted country bread, with the pan juices
(the butter drippings mixed with white wine) poured over them. Then
I add a crunchy, peppery watercress salad dressed with lemon juice
to play against the richness of the dish.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway you eat this, you'll be happy, but here's the way I think
you should go at it. Pull the shrimp, glistening with melting herb
butter, out of their shells, and really savor them. Don't be afraid
to get in there and use your fingers. Put the shells on a side
plate, and enjoy your salad. Then pay the cook a compliment: take
your fork, and give the bread a sleigh ride through the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Broiled Jumbo Shrimp with Herbed Escargot Butter
</P>
<P>
   Total time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces (2-1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup fresh breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   1-1/2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons finely chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped dill
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped chives
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped tarragon
</P>
<P>
   12 jumbo shrimp, head on, if possible
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons white wine
</P>
<P>
   4 slices 1/2-inch-thick toasted country bread, or 8 slices
toasted brioche
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches watercress, stemmed, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges
</P>
<P>
   1.) Put the butter, salt and cayenne in the work bowl of a food
processor and process until the butter is satiny and doubles in
volume, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the fresh breadcrumbs, shallots, garlic
and chopped herbs and process to blend. Set aside for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   2.) With a pair of scissors, cut away the small legs on the
shrimp. With the shrimps on their backs, use a serrated knife to
cut each in half lengthwise. Open the shrimp halves and remove the
center veins and the small black sand sacs that are inside the red
tomalley near the head. Place the shrimp, shell down, in a single
layer on a metal baking tray or metal pie plate. Pipe or spoon an
equal amount of the herb butter down the center of each shrimp
half, then dust with the dry bread crumbs. Cover and refrigerate
the shrimp for 20 minutes (or for up to six hours) to set the
butter.
</P>
<P>
   3.) Preheat the broiler with the rack close to the heat. Uncover
the shrimp and, keeping the oven door open, broil them 3 to 4
minutes, or until the bread crumbs are golden and the shrimp are
cooked through. Pull the tray from the broiler and immediately pour
the wine around the shrimp so that it mingles with the pan juices.
Keep the tray aside while you toast the brioche and toss the
watercress with the lemon juice, oil, salt and pepper. To serve,
put a slice of country bread or two slices of brioche at the top of
each plate and arrange six shrimp halves in the center of each
plate leaning on the bread. Put a mound of salad at the bottom of
the plates. Stir the pan juices, pour them over the shrimp and
bread and serve with lemon wedges.

<P>
   Yield: 4 appetizer servings

IS IT TIME FOR THE FAMED AGING TENOR TO QUIT? (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How long can he keep singing?
</P>
<P>
   How long ``should'' he keep singing?
</P>
<P>
   Luciano Pavarotti, the world's favorite tenor, the world's most
famous tenor and, to some, the world's best tenor, is back in North
America this month for four of those overhyped arena shows,
including one in Texas. He'll sing into a microphone, flourish a
handkerchief as big as Sicily and emit charisma for thousands of
fans in oversized stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   What Roller Derby is to hockey, what Pac-Man is to chess, what
professional wrestling is to baseball _ that's what a Pavarotti
arena show is to opera.
</P>
<P>
   I've attended five Pavarotti arena shows, the most recent one
five years ago. I always dreaded going, but I always had a great
time once I got there; whatever divinely granted chemical Pavarotti
has, it somehow wafted over the crowd and hypnotized us all. If I
ever go to one again, I'll dread going and probably end up having a
great time again.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, indeed, there's a new edge of excitement to a
Pavarotti arena performance: This could be the last time.
</P>
<P>
   Singing depends on some of the body's most fragile and age-prone
organs. At 63, Pavarotti is well beyond the age at which most
singers retire.
</P>
<P>
   Part of me agrees wholeheartedly with one of my heroes, the
acerbic British commentator Norman Lebrecht, author of ``Who Killed
Classical Music?'' and the pithy ``Companion to 20th-Century
Music,'' the most readable encyclopedia ever published. I called
Lebrecht at his office in England last week, and he held nothing
back in his opinions of Pavarotti's arena shows, which he
characterized as ``a travesty of the art that he (Pavarotti) was
trained to produce. It's devastating to opera. It's the cornerstone
of a culture of greed that's ruining opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebrecht's only hope is that Pavarotti may be on his last legs
as a singer, and that the arena shows will end with Pavarotti's
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously coming to the end of his career,'' Lebrecht
said. ``He has physical and vocal problems.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of facts to back up Lebrecht's conjecture, and
plenty of signs of a life in crisis. Divorce at the end of a long
marriage. Hip surgery. Multiple cancellations. Fluctuations in
weight and health.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when he sang in Fort Worth in 1992, that divine voice
was already at less than full force.
</P>
<P>
   But the audience is voting for Pavarotti to stay.
</P>
<P>
   William Walker, general director of the Fort Worth Opera, says
that the key to knowing when to retire is knowing when the audience
no longer responds _ or when the audience is there more for your
reputation and celebrity than for your musical ability. Walker, who
earned his name recognition across America as a frequent guest on
Johnny Carson's ``The Tonight Show,'' jokes that you know it's time
to quit ``when you get a standing ovation at the beginning of the
concert, but that turns out to be the most applause you get all
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who sang his last season as a principal baritone at the
Metropolitan Opera in 1977 at age 46, obeyed his own rule, and is a
good example of an artist who quit while he was well ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are audiences still clamoring for Pavarotti shows, so
are the local sponsors. The Fort Worth Symphony cleared $125,000
and wiped out its deficit for the year by co-sponsoring his
performance in 1992; the Dallas Opera raised $200,000 as co-sponsor
of Pavarotti's last appearance in these parts, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Even the toughest critics still hear praiseworthy singing from
Pavarotti.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were moments of beautiful singing to savor, flashes of
Mr. Pavarotti in his prime, when he combined an unsurpassable sense
of language with an instinctive understanding of style and sheer
vocal charisma,'' Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times wrote in
November after the gala concert celebrating the 30th anniversary of
Pavarotti's Metropolitan Opera debut.
</P>
<P>
   The folks in the Pavarotti industry aren't eager to see him go,
either. When I asked if there had been discussion of Pavarotti
retiring, Hans Boon at Herbert H. Breslin management firm,
Pavarotti's American manager, said, ``No. Only from the press, and
that's been going on for five years. He's in fabulous voice. I
heard him in Madrid recently, and he was just sensational.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Pavarotti alone will decide when it's time to quit.
And he'll probably know when that time comes.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Blumenthal of The New York Times dared to bring up the
question of retirement in an interview with Pavarotti in 1997.
Pavarotti mentioned April 29, 2001, as the 40th anniversary of his
operatic debut, and Blumenthal asked if that might provide a target
date for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti replied, ``If I am in this condition, certainly not.
If I am worse and I am having problems, certainly yes.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, I'll join the minority that says that the arena shows
probably never should have happened, no matter how much money
they've made.
</P>
<P>
   As for the serious opera and concert engagements, it's true that
there aren't really many good tenors out there today, but whether
Pavarotti is singing won't make any difference in the pool that is
available to most opera companies. Ideally, Pavarotti should follow
the example of his friend Joan Sutherland: appear in a limited
number of productions for a season or two or three, follow that
with a few seasons of limited concerts, then reign as an operatic
philosopher from some warm Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that's how the world should remember him: as an artist
whose exit was as graceful as his singing was at the apex of his
career.

   For Cupid, a Romantic Night Must Have Olives and Caviar
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Add olives to the Valentine's Day cornucopia. Huge,
meaty, mildly salted Cerignola olives, packed in heart-shaped jars,
are $12.99 for 10.5 ounces at Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Ave.
(71st Street). Typically, they are a vibrantly jealous green, a
color achieved with the addition of chlorophyll. But they also come
tinted an appropriately blushing rose, with a coloring agent
labeled natural but identified as red E 127.
</P>
<P>
   Caviar is a Valentine indulgence. Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the
Americas (Ninth Street), is the only place in Manhattan selling
excellent, osetra-style American Sterling sturgeon caviar from
Stolt Sea Farms in Sacramento, Calif. It is $30 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta Alla Vespa
</P>
<P>
   With Italian flair, Vroom Pasta Room, a new food shop and cafe,
is preparing to set Vespa motor scooters loose in the streets to
deliver pastas, sandwiches and salads this spring. The owners,
Fabio Moscoloni, Michele DeNegri and Daniele Bonetti, already have
a pair of vintage Vespas decorating their corridorlike place, at
685 Third Avenue (with entrances just east of the avenue, on both
43rd and 44th Streets). Now, they are awaiting delivery of Vespas
from Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Vroom has filled, fresh or dried pastas, with a choice of
sauces, $4.50 to $7.25. It also has some excellent sandwiches, like
grilled chicken, onions and zucchini ($4.50 to $5.95), and salads
($5.95 to $6.25). Posters of movie stars on Vespas line the walls.
And alfresco dining is planned for the 44th Street side.
</P>
<P>
   New Chocolates and Sweets
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Callebaut, who left his family's high-quality Belgian
chocolate company in 1982 after it was sold, continues to make fine
Belgian-style chocolate in British Columbia. Because of trademark
restrictions in the United States, he cannot use the Callebaut name
and is selling them as Bernard C. Chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the label, they are well worth seeking out. Last year,
the company opened shops in Westchester County, at 81 Purchase St.
in Rye and 10 Spencer Place in Scarsdale, and in Connecticut, at 16
Greenwich Ave., in Greenwich, and 179-A Main St., in Westport. The
assortments start at $15 for a small box. Most of the chocolates
are $36 a pound. Mail orders, with shipping charges extra, from
(800) 526-6553 or www.bernardcchocolate.com.
</P>
<P>
   Another source of excellent Belgian chocolates is Nirvana. There
are no fixed assortments, so shoppers can design their own from 32
choices, at $30 a pound. Mail orders, with shipping charges extra,
from (877) 463-8543 or www.nirvanachocolates.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss chocolates made by Neuchatel, with shops in the Plaza
Hotel and on Wall Street, are merely decent, but at least they give
the Upper West Side an alternative to Godiva. A shop has opened at
311 Columbus Ave. (76th Street). They are $36 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who do not insist on chocolate, Francois Payard is
making long strips of marshmallow tinted peony pink ($4 a package)
and splendid little raspberry macaroons filled with raspberry jam
(90 cents each). They are sold at Payard Patisserie, 1032 Lexington
Ave. (73rd Street), and on the seventh floor at Bergdorf Goodman.

VOLVOS BECOME FORDS; CLASS LINES BLUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tuesday Feb. 16)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some Swedes are reportedly upset about Volvo being bought by
Ford. But what about the Americans, the ones still known in some
circles as yuppies, who tell you that they drive a Volvo because
it's safe as a tank and will last forever, but also enjoy being
identified as Volvo people.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of us, they don't own just any good old car that
works every morning and holds the road. They own a Volvo. Not
flashy, not even washed a lot, but sensibly hip.
</P>
<P>
   Someone said Volvos are what liberals buy when they get rich. An
ACLU kind of car. ``You drive a Volvo?'' someone inquires and the
eyebrow goes up and the head nods positively.
</P>
<P>
   Fords don't have the status of a Volvo. Fords are just regular
cars. Decent, but they don't get the eyebrow lift of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Fords are vanilla ice cream and Volvos are Cherry Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   But now they will marry and eventually someone will boast about
driving a Volvo and some mischievous person will say, ``It's really
a Ford though, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   In the other direction, it could be a plus. Your Ford wagon may
get more respect, now that it runs with the Volvos, although not
exactly. It's a distant connection to glamour, like your
sister-in-law's friend knowing Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   But when mergers happen, distinctions start to fade. Images are
altered. The prince marries a commoner and a few generations later
the kids have high foreheads but also freckled noses.
</P>
<P>
   This must be troubling for some, this odd co-mingling of
different lines, the parties so different from each other that you
would never expect to see the two of them in the same singles ads.
</P>
<P>
   But there they are. One hip and one square. Surprisingly
coupled.
</P>
<P>
   This could mean trouble, however, for status symbols as a
primary consumer choice.
</P>
<P>
   If the name is crucial and you mess with the name, then what is
it? Ford has a better idea. It will get to use the Volvo name on
its products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sacre bleu!'' or the Swedish equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   With a high end brand name you expect a little panache. This
works for turtlenecks and toasters and everything in between. You
buy a St. Laurent toaster and it shows the world that you not only
spent a lot of money but you know how to ferret out value and
style.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all you really need is a credit card to take care of
the money and an outlet mall to provide the designer labels and
anyone can be a big name shopper.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another shopper, too. This is the one who finds it
worthwhile to drive to a pricey store where she can go to the
cosmetic counter, feel pampered and pay $35 for a tube of lipstick.
It's expensive and it may not look any better than one that is a
third of the price but it makes her feel special.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if that certain high-priced brand of lipstick is purchased
by the maker of a common brand found in grocery stores and they
blend their identities, the extra trip may no longer be worth it.
Easier for her to grab a lipstick when she goes out for cat food
and laundry soap.
</P>
<P>
   The lipstick always had dubious value but it had cachet. When it
merged with the common lipstick it stayed the same product but gave
up its cachet and $35 is a lot to pay for just lipstick. On the
other hand, getting rid of status symbols could be a great benefit
to society. If you could get the maker of the brand of athletic
shoes that kids beat each other up for to link with the
manufacturer of a shoe preferred by math students who want to
become missionaries it might reduce the false glamour of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Status labels are not new. Our mothers try to tell us that a
person who likes herself on the inside doesn't need extras on the
outside. But the same mother who told me that very thing also
switched labels on a sweater I took to college when I was a
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   She brought me home a black sweater from Montgomery Ward, cut
out the label and sewed in a label taken from her Pendleton jacket,
probably trying to demonstrate how silly I was to protest wanting
something more upscale. I went along with it.
</P>
<P>
   I've told that story a lot as a kind of anti-snob penance but it
took me years before I stopped being embarrassed for trying to pass
as a Pendleton person. I think it took until my kids were going
through a Ralph Lauren period and I was giving them my
anti-designer lecture.
</P>
<P>
   I think my mother would have wanted to buy me a Pendleton, but
either it didn't work in the school clothes budget or she, who
really did have an eye for such differences, didn't think the
Montgomery Ward version was inferior. But she did think the label
was and didn't want to wreck my college debut by starting off with
the wrong brand.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out I ended up rooming with a person whose closet
was full of Villager labels and had far more status than mine.
</P>
<P>
   My mother thought that was a good joke and she would probably
laugh now at the idea of a Volvo turning into a Ford overnight, her
people being Ford people.

 TV NOTES: `THE '60s'; LINDA TRIPP; FOX SHAKEUP  
 (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC Basking In `'60s' Success
</P>
<P>
   After scoring a ratings triumph with its mini-series ``The
'60s,'' what does NBC do next?
</P>
<P>
   Do you believe ``The '70s''? Lindy DeKoven, the executive vice
president for NBC's movies and mini-series, said the network took
one look at Sunday night's ratings for ``The '60s'' and immediately
set in motion a plan to do a follow-up two-part film on the next
decade in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all ready to go,'' Ms. DeKoven said. The idea to do a
follow-up was already in place, as was the entire production team
that made ``The '60s,'' led by the executive producer, Lynda Obst,
and the writer, Jeffrey Fiskin.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeKoven said she spent a sleepless night Sunday in
anticipation of how the film, which received almost exclusively
negative reviews, would fare.
</P>
<P>
   The results were beyond even NBC's best expectations. Sunday's
first part of ``The '60s'' was the highest-rated movie on
television this season, beating NBC's big hit from November _
coincidentally, another trip back to the same era _ ``The
Temptations.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ratings were almost as good, giving NBC its biggest
Monday of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Most gratifying for Ms. DeKoven and NBC was the support for
``The '60s'' among younger viewers. The network did not want to do
a movie that would appeal only to aging baby boomers, mainly
because it still values young adult viewers far more than anyone
over 50.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The '60s'' pulled in plenty of viewers under 35 and even
teen-agers, reaching more than 30 percent of that age group who
were watching Sunday night. Perhaps the biggest feat for the film
Sunday night was beating a much publicized episode of ``The
X-Files'' on Fox among that show's strongest audience, viewers
between 18 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``The '60s'' had plenty of publicity as well, much of
it generated by NBC's now near-legendary promotion machine. The
team of John Miller and Vince Manzi, who run the NBC promotion
department, have proved numerous times in the last five years that
they can mount an event-oriented promotion campaign that is
irresistible to viewers.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's executives even take some pride in defying critical
assaults. Referring to the bad reviews for ``The '60s,'' Ms.
DeKoven said, ``I have two words: `Providence' and `Lateline.' ''
The former series was slammed this winter by critics and the latter
was praised, but after a huge publicity campaign by NBC,
``Providence'' became an instant ratings hit, while ``Lateline''
has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had movies like `Asteroid' and `The Beast' that critics
hated, and they did well,'' Ms. DeKoven said. ``And we've had
others like `Merlin' that were hailed, and they also did well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeKoven said she had considered a movie based on the '60s
for five years. Finally she decided the time was right and got in
touch with Ms. Obst, turning the idea over to her.
</P>
<P>
   But a crucial element in NBC's plan from the beginning, Ms.
DeKoven said, was heavy use of music from the period to help tell
the story. ``The music was critical,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was also critical to NBC's plan to make ancillary revenues
from the film, which NBC owns. NBC made a deal with the Home
Shopping Network to sell the special CD of music from the film,
which includes hits by '60s icons like the Beach Boys, Marvin Gaye,
Cream and Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   NBC is also selling videocassettes of the film. Both CD and
video were pitched _ for $29.95 _ through an 800 number during the
broadcast of the ``The '60s'' Sunday and Monday nights. Don
Ohlmeyer, the president of NBC's West Coast division, said the
network had more than 30,000 sales of the video CD as of Tuesday.
He also noted that 85 percent of the people who called were taking
the offer, a figure he said was far above standards for call-in
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the show will inspire more than another
decade-themed movie, Ms. DeKoven said. NBC is going to commit to
making more multipart movies, she said, perhaps as many as 10 per
season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp's Turn
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp, the woman who launched a thousand talk shows, will
finally talk herself Friday morning on the ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp, who initiated the process that resulted in the
impeachment of President Clinton by secretly taping her (now
former) friend Monica Lewinsky, will give her first television
interview to Jamie Gangel of NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'' executive producer Jeff Zucker said the interview with
Ms. Gangel was part of a mini-media blitz by Ms. Tripp, who will
speak with Larry King of CNN on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said that there were no preconditions attached to the
interview and that he expected Ms. Gangel to ``ask all the obvious
questions.'' He said, ``It is certainly not going to be a puff
interview.''
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said NBC might have enjoyed some advantage at least over
one of its television news rivals because ``I don't think Linda was
going to talk to ABC because they're doing Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barbara Walters has been waiting to do her interview
with Ms. Lewinsky for months, but that interview has been blocked
by Kenneth Starr and the Office of Independent Counsel, which has
prevented Ms. Lewinsky from speaking to the press under her
immunity agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp also signed an immunity deal with Starr, but she is
apparently not being prevented from speaking to the press by
Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   Most exclusive interviews with newsmakers now take place on the
prime-time magazine shows, and Zucker said the interview with Ms.
Tripp would be repeated on Friday night's edition of ``Dateline
NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that ``of the three major women in this case,
Hillary Clinton, Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, two of three have
given their interviews to the `Today' show.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lauer of ``Today'' interviewed Mrs. Clinton last January,
when she memorably accused a ``right-wing conspiracy'' of being out
to get her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Turnaround
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual turnaround of program executives, Peter Roth, who
began the current television season running the Fox's network
entertainment division, only to be removed because the network had
not generated enough hits, is moving to take charge of the Warner
Brothers television studio.
</P>
<P>
   The man he is replacing there, Tony Jonas, is being removed,
said senior Warner Brothers executives, because the studio had not
generated enough hits.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement of the change is awaiting only Jonas'
decision on whether to accept an offer to stay at Warner Brothers
in a deal that would make him a program producer.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Roth said he would start at Warner
Brothers on March 1. ``This is a great opportunity for me to be
close to the product of making television shows again,'' Roth said.
``That's always been my passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth left Fox in November after just two years as that network's
chief programmer. His ouster at Fox has been criticized in several
corners of the television industry _ including executives with
David E. Kelley Productions, which turns out such hits as ``Ally
McBeal'' and ``The Practice'' _ as being unjustified, given the
growing strength of Fox's prime-time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading the network's entertainment division, Roth was in
charge of the 20th Century Fox television studio. In one way it has
been the increasing success of that studio, now under the
leadership of Sandy Grushow, that contributed to the change at
Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, Warner Brothers has generated more
prime-time series every year than any other Hollywood studio. But
since the departure of Leslie Moonves to CBS, Warner has been less
successful, and this year 20th Century Fox television has all but
overtaken it. It was widely expected that in the new season to be
announced in May, 20th Century Fox television would surpass Warner
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem for Warner in the last few years, studio
executives said, has been a lesser roster of shows, some of which
have been given the best time periods of television _ Thursday
night on NBC, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas also ran into some opposition from Jamie Kellner, the head
of Warner Brothers' growing new network, WB. In January, Kellner
criticized the Warner studio for not generating shows ``good
enough'' to get onto WB.
</P>
<P>
   The other most important network relationship the studio has is
with NBC, where many of Warner Brothers' biggest hits are shown,
including ``ER'' and ``Friends.'' But it is widely expected that
NBC will soon hire Garth Ancier to take over its entertainment
division, and Ancier is coming over from WB.

`DUCASSE: FLAVORS OF FRANCE': GREAT RECIPES, NO SHORTCUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ready to trim and clean three-quarters of a pound of girolle
mushrooms, and if they are more than half an inch wide, cut them
into halves or quarters? How about carefully peeling the outer
layers from five small fennel bulbs, coring them and slicing them
on the diagonal? Or setting aside seven hours to prepare 28
ingredients for a first-course casserole of fall vegetables and
fruits to serve four?
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of exacting tasks required for some of the
recipes in ``Ducasse: Flavors of France'' by Alain Ducasse with
Linda Dannenberg (Artisan, $60).
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just a matter of Ducasse's playing kitchen
martinet. Shortcuts or compromises really can diminish the results,
as I discovered when I prepared the leek and potato gratin with big
fat leeks, not the medium ones the recipe specified. The gratin was
delicious, with alternating rows of tender potato slices and chunks
of leeks baked in broth on a bed of mellow sliced onions and leeks.
But the rows would have been in better proportion had I found
smaller leeks in my market.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, capturing the flavors of France on an American dinner
plate takes more than just careful shopping. When Ducasse writes
that ``there is no such thing as genius in the kitchen; there is
only the work,'' he isn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   This lavish new cookbook doubles as a brochure for three of his
restaurants: Louis XV in Monaco, Restaurant Alain Ducasse in Paris
and the Bastide de Moustiers, his luxurious country inn in
Provence. And it explains, through the recipes and text, how his
menus shift, in terms of their ingredients and the complexity of
the preparation, to reflect the different locations.
</P>
<P>
   In Monte Carlo the lavishness depends on the bold Mediterranean
flavors of the south of France. In Paris the food is more
traditionally elegant, and at Moustiers Sainte-Marie it is simpler
and countrified. Recipes from all three share Ducasse's particular
passion for using a single ingredient in several ways _ raw, cooked
and in confit, for example _ in one recipe. The goal, he says, is
to ``respect the natural flavors of foods, to reveal their truest
natures.''
</P>
<P>
   Although this is not Ducasse's first cookbook, it is the first
written in English for an American publisher. So I found it hard to
understand why so many of the recipes required ingredients that are
difficult to find on this side of the Atlantic, like fresh cepes,
langoustines, fresh sour cherries, sea scallops in their shells and
European sole. The appendix suggests substitutes for some, but not
all.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the uncommon raw materials, combined with preparations
like the deceptively elaborate stuffed chicken in the pot with its
35 ingredients, suggest that the book was written as much for chefs
with brigades at their disposal as for home cooks. Some recipes
also call for just a few ounces of raw foie gras, which is only now
becoming available for home cooks.
</P>
<P>
   But for every one of these tours de force there are alluringly
simple dishes, like buttery fork-mashed potatoes, peppered slices
of sauteed pumpkin, swordfish with citrus, exquisite chocolate
tartlets, fruit tartlets with a fromage blanc filling, and a homey
pear and honey cake made with big chunks of pear. A multi-layered
omelet to cut into squares and spear on toothpicks makes for an
easy and savory snack to serve with drinks.
</P>
<P>
   I picked up some excellent tips, like how removing the tiny
leaves from asparagus stalks before peeling them makes the stalks
smoother and peeling white turnips twice removes the hard white
film under the purple-tinged outer skin. Putting a bottle of olive
oil in an ice bucket for about an hour before using it thickens it
a bit, making it a better coating in a salad dressing or to drizzle
on food. As for whipped cream in a risotto, it's not for purists,
but it's one way to know you're eating sumptuous three-star food.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions for a few of the recipes, including the rich
sugar pastry and the tomato and lettuce tart, are somewhat confused
and could have done with sharper editing.
</P>
<P>
   It always pays to be ready to adapt. The delicious recipe for
fillet of cod with white bean puree and baby squid called for too
much squid _ more than a pound for four servings to go with a pound
and a half of cod. I served only about half the squid with the fish
and used the rest the next day in an impromptu salad of my own.
</P>
<P>
   FILLET OF COD WITH WHITE BEAN PUREE AND BABY SQUID
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Ducasse: Flavors of France''
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 1/2 hours, plus overnight soaking
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dried cannellini beans, rinsed, soaked overnight in water
to cover, then drained
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 small rib celery with leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 large garlic cloves, unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   10 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 fresh sage leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 branch fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound cleaned baby squid or squid tentacles
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   4 6-ounce pieces codfish fillet, about 2 inches thick,
preferably with skin
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf parsley.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the soaked beans, carrot, onion, celery and garlic in a
heavy saucepan. Cover with water to a depth of 3 inches, bring to a
boil, lower the heat to medium and cook until the beans are tender,
about 1 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid, and return them to the
pan. Add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, 1/4 cup of the reserved
liquid, the sage, rosemary and salt and pepper to taste. Set aside
20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
</P>
<P>
   3. Discard the carrot, onion, celery, garlic and herbs. Remove
1/2 cup of the beans, and reserve. Puree the rest in a food
processor, adding several tablespoons of the cooking liquid as
needed. Force the puree through a fine sieve, and transfer to a
small nonstick saucepan. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil,
the sherry vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Heat gently,
adding extra cooking liquid to give the puree the consistency of
very creamy mashed potatoes. Keep over very low heat. Place the
reserved beans in a small skillet with 3 tablespoons of the cooking
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   4. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a cast-iron skillet.
Add the squid, and saute over high heat about 2 minutes until it
begins to turn golden. Season with salt and pepper, stir in the
lemon juice, transfer to a bowl, and cover to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   5. Place a clean cast-iron skillet over high heat, add the
remaining 4 tablespoons of olive oil, and place the cod in the pan,
skin side down. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and cook
about 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until just cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   6. Spoon some of the bean puree into each of 4 large, deep,
warmed dinner plates. Place a cod fillet, skin side up, in the
center, quickly reheat the reserved beans, and scatter them, and
the squid, around the cod. Strew with parsley, and serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

TESTIMONY CONTINUES IN MALAYSIA SEX AND CORRUPTION TRIAL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ For a few brief moments in a courtroom
here on Tuesday, Anwar Ibrahim provided a rare glimpse into the
debates that raged in the Malaysian capital last year as the Asian
financial crisis devastated the country's currency and throttled
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the second day in his sex and corruption trial,
Anwar, the former deputy prime minister, said that he and his boss,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, had major differences about how to
respond to the ``financial convulsion engulfing the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar said that during this period of escalating tension, the
police initiated an aggressive investigation into his personal
life.
</P>
<P>
   Before Anwar could elaborate, however, the judge cut him off,
declaring that Anwar could not could cite evidence of a political
conspiracy to defend himself from charges that he abused his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Augustine Paul knocks out a central plank of
Anwar's defense and leaves his legal prospects looking bleak.
Anwar, who was ousted and imprisoned last September, contends that
the corruption and sex-related charges against him were trumped up
by his political enemies after the bitter policy disputes with his
long-time mentor, Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   ``A political conspiracy, if any, against the accused is not
relevant,'' said the judge, rejecting an impassioned plea by
Anwar's lead lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and lawyers here said Tuesday's ruling was a
potentially grievous setback because the trial of Anwar is as much
a political battle as a criminal case. If Anwar is not allowed to
discuss the conduct of Mahathir and other Malaysian officials, they
said, he will have to defend himself against narrow charges that he
sought to quash a police investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have preferred to have the conspiracy included
because Anwar would have had a lot to say,'' said C.V. Prabhakaran,
a lawyer who sat in on the hearing as a representative of one of
the defense witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Anwar's lawyers could marshal an effective defense
in light of the ruling, he said, ``Looks like no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's lawyers insisted their client still had a case. They
said they would use other avenues to publicize the information that
Anwar was prepared to discuss on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't show it to the court, we'll show it to the
people,'' said Gurbachan Singh, one of Anwar's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   But in this country of tightly-controlled news media, getting
Anwar's message out is not easy. While local newspapers carry ample
coverage of the trial, they tend to dwell on the lurid nature of
the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the prosecution has been able to wage a powerful
campaign in the court of public opinion. The corruption charges
against Anwar originally linked his purported cover-up attempts
with his alleged sexual misconduct. And for weeks, the prosecution
ostentatiously placed a mattress in the courtroom, which they said
contained semen stains from Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   After the prosecution wrapped up its case two weeks ago, the
judge amended the charges to drop the alleged sexual misconduct. As
a result, the government now only has to prove Anwar meddled in the
police investigation. It also means Anwar's lawyers cannot
challenge the sex charges, even though the local papers carried
blanket coverage of them for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The sex case against Anwar seemed to be weakening in any event.
On Tuesday, one of the five men allegedly sodomized by Anwar issued
a statement retracting his earlier admission. The man, Mior Abdul
Razak, said he was ``forced and threatened by the police after his
arrest'' to make false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the other five men also retracted claims that they were
sodomized by Anwar, while a third has given conflicting testimony.

LOW-KEY LODGING ON BARBADOS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Choosing a room via the Internet? Really? Like accepting candy
from a stranger, I thought at first after learning that some people
do indeed pick out a hotel or apartment by tapping into cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   But in July I found myself doing just that _ wandering around
the Internet, searching for a hotel room on Barbados. The
off-season rates were tantalizing, and, according to the Barbados
Tourism Authority's Web site, the climate was not unreasonable,
with highs in the mid- to upper 80s.
</P>
<P>
   My price range was under $100 a night, and I wanted my hotel to
be a convenient base for touring Barbados' many cultural treasures,
its graceful historic houses and tropical gardens. Island Web sites
were plentiful and hotel choices bewildering.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the computer screen came alive with a spirited
discussion of Barbados' beach resorts on a message board of America
Online. No idle ramblings, these were declamations of loyalty to
one gorgeous spot or another. The comment about Casuarina Beach
Club _ ``I'll never stay anywhere else'' _ didn't equivocate.
</P>
<P>
   But who was the commentator _ a gabby satisfied repeat guest,
the hotel marketing director or the owner's best friend?
</P>
<P>
   Two guidebooks gave the 160-room apartment hotel in Barbados'
St. Lawrence Gap district pleasant reviews along with favorable
comments about a neighboring resort, describing both in much the
same way: good beaches, comfortable rooms. I called Casuarina and
negotiated an off-season nightly rate of $82 plus 17.5 percent tax
and service, for a studio with a garden view.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, the taxi from the airport pulled up to a
low-slung coral stone building in a tropical landscape that had the
look of a manicured jungle, an anomaly on Barbados' busy,
much-developed south coast, where the hotel is situated and where
deforestation began centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rocking chairs lined the driveway. The reception desk sat in
front of a small lush courtyard. In the late afternoon light the
lobby felt pleasantly cavelike. Comfortable couches and chairs were
clustered in corners. Ceiling fans stirred the air. Vines tumbled
out of large ceramic planters.
</P>
<P>
   My husband, Bernard, and I followed a walkway that meandered
around two swimming pools and through tall trees and flowering
shrubs, until we reached a four-story building. Room 325 had fresh
white walls, white lamps and white tile floors brightened with a
prim pink flowery bedspread. The matching curtains trimmed with a
knife-pleated valance were suitable for a genteel English cottage
in Devon but not out of place on British-flavored Barbados, where
afternoon tea is a tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The white tiled bathroom was spotless, stocked with ample white
towels and a hair dryer. There were no little bottles of lotions,
no shower cap, just two fragrant bars of soap made in Dominica. The
kitchenette was equipped with cutlery, crockery and cooking pots.
</P>
<P>
   The spacious balcony that overlooked the garden on the other
side of our room's sliding glass doors was screened by palm fronds
arching from trees in front of the building. The walls of the
bedroom, kitchenette and bath were decorated with regional art,
tropical pastel scenes and a ceramic relief of a woman's back.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lawrence Gap teems with night life but Casuarina's tranquil
main dining room, filled with folk art, seemed just right after a
bumpy plane ride. Bernard and I walked into the open-air restaurant
under a tall roof sheltering pierced ceramic lanterns, aquariums,
fish mobiles and wood carvings of octopus, seahorses and other
creatures. Bernard commented that his grilled shrimp might have
spent time in a freezer, but my grilled red snapper served with
mashed potatoes and green beans was outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning as we ate breakfast, an iridescent blue-green
hummingbird hovered among red hibiscus a few feet away. The moist
banana bread and strong coffee were delicious. The 1,500-foot-long
beach beyond the dining room was clean and beguiling, with
turquoise water and mild surf. (Sometimes the waves are bigger, I'm
told, and at other times it is very calm.)
</P>
<P>
   Tucked here and there in clearings in the luxuriant garden were
chaise longues, a crib placed near one swimming pool, and a
children's playhouse. We had wondered whether the hotel would have
a gloomy, off-season air, but were reassured by the sounds of
splashing and by the stream of guests _ Europeans, Canadians and
Americans _ we met on the paths. The Casuarina, it turned out, was
full.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletin boards announced some of the hotel's activities _
nature walks, bike rides, gallery visits, history lectures, water
polo and bocce, among many others. But with just three days to
explore the island, we hurried off to tour Sunbury Plantation
House, built more than 300 years ago and rebuilt recently after a
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Behind its two-and-a-half-foot thick walls, there was an
appealing mix of antiques, maps, family heirlooms such as old
christening gowns, and in the cellar, a collection of carriages.
Before and after, we gawked at new hotel and condominium
development in the south of the 166-square-mile island and along
the more fashionable west coast.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the day was a walk through the Sunbury's
grounds, a popular spot for island celebrations, where we stopped
to sit in the shade of two giant bearded fig trees.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two days we visited Tyrol Cot Heritage Village,
a fascinating small-scale version of Colonial Williamsburg, with
artisans in reproductions of plantation workers' movable chattel
houses, and strolled through the lovely Andromeda Botanic Gardens,
with its winding paths and Egyptian papyrus, bromeliads and
thousands of tropical plants.
</P>
<P>
   We looked at the newly restored wind-powered Morgan Lewis Sugar
Mill, observed more hotel development and admired weathered old
churches like St. John's, built in 1836, with Gothic arches and
views of the rugged east coast.
</P>
<P>
   We lunched on one of the national dishes, tasty flying fish at
the open-air Barclays Restaurant beside the beach. On all three
days we returned to Casuarina too late for afternoon tea and too
tired even to inspect the hotel's two tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tuesday night party as we stood in line waiting for the
free rum punch, we met Casuarina's energetic manager and co-owner,
Sonia Cole-Wilson, when she sprinkled nutmeg into our tumblers. At
the same time, sounding like a mother, she suggested we might want
to dilute the rum with a bit more fruit juice. We did.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief chat about the hotel's eight-acre grounds, she told
us the garden was her attempt to re-create a corner of her native
Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening as a live band played and the party
progressed, we shared a table with two German tourists, a teacher
from Frankfurt and her mother. They were staying at the hotel three
weeks. Why Barbados? we asked. And if they preferred warm places,
why not someplace closer to Germany, such as Spain or Sicily?
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the tropics,'' the teacher said. ``A friend who used
to live on Barbados told us about Casuarina. We've stayed here six
times.''
</P>
<P>
   One our last evening, we walked through the garden for a last
look at the sea. On the dark beach we stumbled into a large
telescope in front of a circle of chairs filled with children and
their parents listening to an astronomer.
</P>
<P>
   We'd happened upon one of the hotel's regular lectures. Parents
and children were asking questions about Chaos and peering through
the telescope at the Milky Way. The scenario felt oddly familiar _
not too different from choosing a room via the Internet. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Casuarina Beach Club, St. Lawrence Gap, Dover, in Christ Church
Parish, (246) 428-3600 or (800) 742-4276 for toll-free
reservations, fax (246) 428-1970, can be previewed on its Web pages
at www.bajan.com (clicking on Barbados, then Hotels).
</P>
<P>
   Casuarina Web pages can also be reached through
www.barbados.org, the official site of the Barbados Tourism
Authority. Casuarina appears on a list that's billed as the
island's ``finest hotels,'' with links.
</P>
<P>
   Summer rates begin at $105 for a studio with a view of the pool
or garden, plus the 17.5 percent tax and service charge. (I was
able to pare that to $82, plus 17.5 percent, by calling the resort
directly and asking for the corporate rate.)
</P>
<P>
   The same room rents for $190 during winter (until April 15) and
$110 in spring (April 16 to May 31) and fall (Nov. 1 to Dec. 15).
Beachfront rooms are $115 in summer, $125 in spring and fall, and
$205 in winter. The 17.5 percent tax and service is additional.
Larger units are also available. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meals are extra. The average cost of a dinner with a modest
wine, dessert and coffee, was $28 including tax but not tip. Each
morning, we skipped the tempting breakfast buffet, $16, to choose
from the menu. We paid about $6 for a pot of coffee and two orders
of the excellent banana bread.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Rum Punch Bar and Restaurant, (246) 422-9213, is a
rustic beachfront spot on the east coast road. The flying fish
special served with rice and peas, salad and vegetables cost around
$11. Lunch only. Open daily from around 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.

   MONEYTALK _ ATLANTA _ Waymon Moore had a fairly common
aspiration: to teach his younger relatives the discipline and
rewards of investing. The 70-year-old has succeeded. Five years
ago, he formed an investment club made up entirely of kinfolk. Some
24 eligible relatives _ nieces, nephews and their older children _
joined the club right away. All are still members. Their annual
returns have been close to 20 percent, and their portfolio is now
worth $250,000. Moore's story is not uncommon. Family investment
clubs have become increasingly popular in recent years. Readers
frequently ask me for advice on how to start a club. Across the

   IMPEACHMENT
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ After listening quietly for weeks to
testimony and argument, senators are ready to debate President
Clinton's fitness to remain in office. But first they must decide
whether to hold their historic deliberations in public or behind
closed doors. Before senators begin debating perjury and
obstruction-of-justice charges today, they were deciding whether to
change a Senate rule requiring closed deliberations. (Foskett, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   w/IMPEACH-POLITICS _ WASHINGTON _ Democrats are already
predicting that the
</P>
<P>
   failed impeachment drive against President Clinton could give
them a major

White House.

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ Fate arranged a cruel irony for the U.S. Senate
on the day it allowed Monica Lewinsky's videotaped image and voice
into its presence. Legislative clerk Scott Bates, who conducted
most Senate roll call votes, including those during the impeachment
trial, was killed in an accident Friday night. So as the Senate
gathered to at last hear from Lewinsky, the voice with which the
institution itself has come to be identified was silent. The moment
of silence for Bates set a somber mood for a session that many
senators have for months worried would upset the Senate's dignity.
Those concerns appear to have been overwrought. Whatever momentary
fascination may have come with the opportunity to study someone who
has been silent through so much speculation, Lewinsky's excerpted
testimony did nothing to lower this process further than it has
sunk. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   RUSSIA-YELTSIN _ MOSCOW _ An ailing President Boris Yeltsin
dragged himself from recuperation at a sanitorium to lead the
Russian delegation to Amman for the funeral of Jordan's King
Hussein. However, his performance on international television has
fueled the loudest questions yet about his health and led to calls
for his resignation on Tuesday in Russia. From the media to the
parliament, Yeltsin's less-than-sturdy visage among the other world
leaders on Monday was largely viewed as embarassing by most
Russians. Developing. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

Commission complaining about how a legislatively inflicted prize
cut tore into ticket sales, state records show that Texas'take on
its game of chance decreased by less than 3 percent last year while
ticket sales were down by 18 percent. Percentagewise, lottery

about 22 percent. The numbers raise this question: Who would
benefit most from restoring the prize cut _ Texas or Gtech?

   TEX-LEGIS-FORDSUIT _ The Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday hears a
class-action case that symbolizes the legislative fight over class

sometimes are the only way to get manufacturers to fix problems too
small to make getting a lawyer for one suit worth the expense.

FRENCH COMIC-BOOK HEROES BATTLE HOLLYWOOD'S HORDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In their 30 comic-book adventures to date, Asterix and
Obelix have repeatedly outfoxed the Roman invaders of 50 B.C.,
thanks to a magic potion concocted by a Druid elder. But now far
more is at stake. In their first screen outing, ``Asterix and
Obelix Against Caesar,'' the feisty Gallic villagers have again
been called on to save France, but this time from Hollywood and its
marauding blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it could be said the war has already been lost. But
although French movies accounted for only 27 percent of tickets
sold here in 1998, their worst performance in years, the entire
French industry is counting on winning at least one battle.
</P>
<P>
   And for this the Gauls have even been given an extra dose of
Hollywood's own magic potion: money. Opening in a record 764
theaters last week and costing $48.3 million, ``Asterix et Obelix
Contre Cesar'' is the most expensive French-language movie ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   Directed and co-written by Claude Zidi, it is produced by Claude
Berri, long a successful director and now a mini-mogul of the
French movie scene. French investors have put up half the money,
with Italians and Germans providing the balance.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action film also has a strong cast, with Christian
Clavier as Asterix, Gerard Depardieu as Obelix, Roberto Benigni as
Detritus, Caesar's treacherous sidekick, and the model Laetitia
Casta as Falbala, Obelix's love interest.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the battle has not started well, with the film being
struck first by friendly fire. In the weeks preceding its release
it was enormously promoted by French newspapers, which uniformly
exploited the Rome-Hollywood analogy. It was, Le Monde proclaimed,
``the image of resistance to American cinematographic
imperialism.'' But when the reviews came in, many French movie
critics forgot their patriotic duty and were plain rude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I confess it; I am a traitor to French cinema,'' Andre
Bercoff wrote in France Soir. ``After a few minutes full of hope, I
ended up bored senseless by Asterix and Obelix.'' Le Parisien
asked, ``Where did the magic potion go?'' And Liberation's verdict
was no less negative. ``The move from comic book to film has
fatally put an end to a dream,'' it said. ``The bubble has burst.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Hollywood endlessly demonstrates, blockbusters with
troubled scripts and lively special effects can easily survive bad
reviews. In fact the big-budget Hollywood films that do well here
year in year out are routinely savaged by French critics. And, as
it happens, everything indicates that ``Asterix and Obelix Against
Caesar'' has started well at the box office and is particularly
liked by children under 14, who are usually accompanied by adults.
</P>
<P>
   The film has some strong points. With its 60 actors bolstered by
no fewer than 1,500 extras, the heroic Gauls do indeed seem to be
taking on the entire Roman army. Clavier and Depardieu look their
parts, while Benigni adds a touch of genuine Roman humor (``I am
Etruscan, not Roman,'' Benigni protests).
</P>
<P>
   But the best scenes come thanks to special effects, as when
Asterix is tossed into a Roman circus and successively confronts
snakes, lions, tarantulas, crocodiles and an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's strongest selling point, though, is the
extraordinary popularity of the Asterix books, which have sold some
280 million copies in 85 languages since the first comic strip was
published by Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo in 1959 ( Goscinny
died in 1977, and Uderzo has published the last six books on his
own.)
</P>
<P>
   France is Asterix's biggest market, with 95 million books sold
to date, followed closely by Germany with 88 million sold. Some 20
million copies have been sold in Britain, but the books have not
been marketed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, like Superman and Batman before them, Asterix and Obelix
have a huge following outside their home territory, and this augurs
well for foreign sales of dubbed versions of ``Asterix and Obelix
Against Caesar.'' ``I cannot see anything less than 10 million
viewers,'' Berri told Liberation. France, unlike the United States,
traditionally measures a movie's performance by the number of
tickets sold rather than the box office take.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle against Hollywood, of course, what really counts
is how well the film does in France. Last year, although total
movie attendance here rose to 170 million, largely as a result of
``Titanic'' (21 million), the French industry's share of the
domestic market fell to 27 percent from 34.5 percent in 1997. Three
French films did well _ ``Le Diner des Cons'' (8.5 million), ``Les
Couloirs du Temps'' (8 million) and ``Taxi'' (6.2 million) _ but
significantly, all were comedies aimed at a mass market. The most
acclaimed art house film of the year, Erick Zonca's ``Dreamlife of
Angels,'' did far more modestly (1.2 million).
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Asterix and Obelix Against Caesar,'' 5 million
tickets sold at home and another 5 million abroad will take it
safely out of the red, but that may not suffice to claim victory
over Hollywood. More likely, the seemingly endless debate about why
French movies do not do better at home and abroad will continue.
And if the debate does not change, it is because the structure of
the French movie industry resists change.
</P>
<P>
   French productions must account for 40 percent of films shown on
television here, while Canal-Plus, the pay-television movie and
sports channel, is required to invest heavily in French movies.
Thus, 120 to 140 new French films are released here every year, far
more than the domestic theater market can absorb. Add to that the
distributors' preference for Hollywood blockbusters over low-budget
local fare and it is easy to see why many French films _ even good
ones _ can go almost unnoticed here.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of cases, then, ``Asterix and Obelix Against
Caesar'' may be among the most popular French movies of the year.
But alone, it seems, these hardy Gauls are unlikely to strike fear
in Hollywood. France likes to boast that it has the only European
movie industry that has so far avoided being totally crushed by
Hollywood, but increasingly it resembles a resistance movement
inside an occupied country.

TRYING TO SHAKE A STEREOTYPE BUT KEEP ON BEING ROSIE PEREZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)  
 (bl)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a water-logged day in Brooklyn, everything seems
muted and muffled _ the grays and browns of the buildings, the
soggy drumbeat of the rain, the leaden thwock of the car wheels
shooting out sprays of oily water as they rumble over manhole
covers.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Rosie Perez, who, rain or shine, is about as
muted and muffled as a stick of dynamite on a short fuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time, all the time,'' she shot back when asked if she
worries about being stereotyped as a feisty, foul-mouthed,
working-class Latina, the Rosie Perez character she has played in
most of her films. ``Sometimes I really want to ask the studio
heads, `Did you earn your college degree or did you pay for it? Are
you stupid?' Just like a white person can come from trailer trash,
be a candidate for the Jerry Springer show, but you put them in a
suit and their background becomes nonexistent. But you take someone
of color from Brooklyn and it sticks with them day and night. `She
can't do that. She's Latin. She's from Brooklyn.' It's the most
asinine thing I've ever heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Very few actors and even fewer actresses these days seem as if
they're from anyplace recognizable in terms of geography, class and
ethnicity, if they can help it. When she started acting, Ms. Perez
was advised to take classes to lose her Brooklyn inflections and
mannerisms. Instead, she has built an improbable acting career,
which began with a chance encounter with director Spike Lee, on
being pretty much what she is: an intense, voluble, working-class
Puerto Rican from Bushwick who is indelibly from her own
unfashionable patch of turf.
</P>
<P>
   In her new film, ``The 24-Hour Woman,'' written and directed by
Nancy Savoca, she plays a familiar character but with a twist. She
is definitely Ms. Perez, but she is also a successful television
producer, rather than a kid from the streets, trying to balance
work, marriage and motherhood. It is something of a real life, less
the Hollywood take on the issues raised and then conveniently
smoothed over and kissed off in Diane Keaton's 1987 film ``Baby
Boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a sympathetic female director like Ms. Savoca, getting
the part took some doing. And whether she can attract the range of
roles she would like remains to be seen. But so far, Ms. Perez has
managed to put together an eclectic palate of films and earned a
measure of respect and visibility while finding herself in an
intensely conflicted relationship with the powers that be in the
film business. Even she is not sure where the road leads from here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a martyr thinking I only do independent films,'' she
said, sipping her afternoon cafe con leche and picking at a scone
at Tillie's, a comfortable neighborhood hangout near the border
between Fort Greene and Clinton Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take `White Men Can't Jump.' I loved that movie. I loved the
fact that Fox put the dollars into promoting it. I loved that the
paycheck was nice and fat. I loved that everyone in the world went
to see it. But then I get so mad when a brilliant film like
``Somebody to Love,'' which I did with Alexandre Rockwell, didn't
stand a chance because there were no marketing dollars behind it. I
do independent films because the material is great. I need to be
challenged. I need to do good work. It makes love to my heart like
nothing else. But if there was a commercial film that had great
material and money behind it, I'd do it in a heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   She's wearing a gray zippered jogging jacket from the Gap, a
darker gray ribbed shirt from the Banana Republic, black slacks and
black Sketchers boots, and goes on like an animated wind-up doll
with a voice from the streets, talking of Knickerbocker Park
(Knick-a-bocka Pawk) or mimicking the singsong Puerto Rican street
talk of the neighborhood where she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I look at the movie business and see racism and classism
and all the other isms, but mostly what I see is the power of the
dollar,'' she continued. ``Take `Men in Black.' Money. Money. They
should have called it ``Money in Black.'' Will Smith is, hello,
black. But they got the money behind it and every person in America
from Brooklyn to Wichita, Kansas, knew that movie was out there. I
think it's great. I'm glad for him, that he's getting the money. I
just hope he takes that money and does something like ``Six Degrees
of Separation.'' Bring it back home.''
</P>
<P>
   A blushing, deferential flower Ms. Perez is not, but given the
path to her film career, it is no surprise. Ms. Perez is
obsessively closemouthed about anything other than the broad
outlines of her upbringing. A few questions about things as
innocuous as where she went to high school or the year of her birth
generated icy accusations of tabloid journalism and an angry call
from her publicist. She was born in 1964 or '65 _ she declines to
be more precise _ in the middle of a family of 11 children in
Bushwick. Her father was in the merchant marine and her mother had
been a singer in Puerto Rico before moving to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   She apparently spent much of the time living in group homes or
with relatives, particularly an aunt with whom she lived while in
high school.She apparently got into her share of trouble, but looks
back on a place that for all its rough edges was definitely a
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought of it as a tough neighborhood, because the
people in my neighborhood were my friends and neighbors,'' she
said. ``I never thought I was poor until someone told me I was. I
don't like to talk about my past because I start to include people
who don't want to be included in the storytelling. I made an
agreement not to do it. But it's funny how people think you're born
into a certain level of ignorance and stupidity because you were
born into a certain level of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her first artistic interest was dance, not film. But after high
school, she moved to Los Angeles to study marine biology at Los
Angeles City College and West Lost Angeles College. One night, a
talent coordinator for the television show ``Soul Train'' picked
her out at a club and signed her up to dance on the show. Before
long, she was choreographing a video and stage show for the singer
Bobby Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Her big break came, in a contemporary variation of an old
Hollywood legend, when Lee met her while celebrating his birthday
in 1988 at a Los Angeles club called the Funky Reggae. He told her
to call him, and when she did _ a month later _ he ended up casting
her as his girlfriend in ``Do the Right Thing,'' which begins with
her gyrating and shadowboxing to Public Enemy's ``Fight the
Power.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent films have included Jim Jarmusch's ``Night on
Earth,'' ``White Men Can't Jump'' and ``Fearless,'' Peter Weir's
film about the survivors of an airline disaster, which earned her a
1993 Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   She has also continued dance and choreography work. She has
produced several shows, including a 1993 HBO series called ``Rosie
Perez Presents Society's Ride,'' featuring live performances by
rap, rhythm-and-blues and reggae acts. She has begun writing and
doctoring scripts herself. And she carries on a heavy schedule of
benefit work, like a recent appearance on behalf of an innovative
writing program in which she participates at the Bedford Hills
Correctional Facility for Women.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her age _ she was 19 when Lee found her _ she has stood
out as an obsessively entrepreneurial actress. Ms. Savoca said what
struck her most about Ms. Perez was the unlikely combination of
elements in her work. Ms. Perez, she said, is an untutored actress
who works out of great gut instincts. She is a choreographer, Ms.
Savoca continued, whose acting is informed by the timing and
discipline at the heart of dance, and as a producer she is animated
by shrewd calculation that is in a way precisely the opposite of
her trash-talking, street-kid image.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our first meeting, I was struck by the way she thinks
like a producer,'' Ms. Savoca said. ``A lot of actors only see
their own roles. She's not that way at all. She's very interested
in where things fit into the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``The 24-Hour Woman'' is another example of why Ms. Perez
probably needs all the feistiness she brings to her career. Ms.
Savoca, whose family background is Argentine and Italian, and who
grew up in the Bronx, brings strong feminist instincts to her
films. She originally thought of Ms. Perez's character, Grace, as a
Hispanic woman, but the idea got such a cool reception that she
rewrote the script to make her Italian. She initially offered Ms.
Perez a secondary role as a production secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `No thanks, I've done that role before,' '' Ms.
Savoca said. ``It embarrassed me. Here was this actress, an Academy
Award nominee, who had done wonderful work, and I was falling into
the same trap as everyone else. Then I got word that Rosie wanted
to meet with us. She said, `I've read the script, and I really like
the main character, and I want you to consider me for it.' And my
mouth dropped open. I felt in an instant as if I'd come full circle
and I was back to the movie I wanted to make.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another admirer, the casting director Sheila Jaffe, said Ms.
Perez at times may risk being perceived as too outspoken and
aggressive for her own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire people who have the courage to be honest and open
about their feelings, but I also know the industry we're in,'' she
said. ``Sometimes you have to use other people to make your points
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   But she thinks even if Ms. Perez does not conform tothe
Hollywood norm of user-friendly, blue-eyed blondes, she is smart
enough and talented enough to make things work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take someone with a vision to take a chance on her in a
big role, but, if not, she'll probably take the bull by the horns
and make it happen herself,'' she said. ``I have a lot of faith in
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Perez's career for now figures to branch in different
directions. She has recently finished ``King of the Jungle,''
directed by her fiance, Seth Rosenfeld, and also featuring her
friends John Leguizamo and Marisa Tomei (``I play a pothead
lesbian,'' she said. ``It's not a comedy.'') She also finished work
on the Dreamworks animated film: ``El Dorado: City of Gold,'' which
also features the voices of Kevin Klein and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   If the path of Ms. Perez's career could go down various roads,
the path of her life seems to lead inevitably toward Brooklyn.
Whether she's getting her Greek salad at the Clinton Hill Diner or
walking across the street for coffee at Tillie's, Ms. Perez is
greeted with a matter-of-fact ``Hey, Rosie'' whenever she walks in
the door. She keeps an apartment in Los Angeles, but spends most of
her time in New York, a balance she would like to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, you can be who you are,'' Ms. Perez said, as she
got ready to leave for her karate lesson. ``If I want to be sad,
I'm sad. If I want to be angry, I'm angry. If I want to be loud,
I'm loud. If I want to be quiet, I'm quiet. In L.A., you just be
yourself and people are always asking, ``What's wrong?'' It drives
me crazy. I feel sorry for L.A. I really do. No one's got any
roots, which is why people are so disposable out there. And there
are a lot of dog-eat-dog people in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Aren't there plenty of dog-eat-dog people in New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, maybe,'' she said. ``But in New York it's dog-eat-dog
with a heart.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain fell in the San Francisco Bay region Tuesday morning
as a strong Pacific cold front came ashore. By the afternoon, the
heavy rain changed to showers and isolated thunderstorms as a
trailing jet stream disturbance followed on the heels of the cold
front. Wednesday, the stormy tandem will head toward the Rockies,
setting the stage for heavy mountain snows.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest snows will likely fall in the mountains of western
Colorado to the north of the path of the disturbance. Heavy snows
will also blanket the mountains of northern Arizona, Utah and
eventually northern New Mexico as moist winds blowing from the
northeast behind a cold front are forced to rise over the sloping
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the system, the pace of moisture streaming north from
the Gulf of Mexico will quicken, paving the way for moderate to
locally heavy rains to develop Wednesday night across parts of
northern and eastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma and eastern Kansas.
Rain will arrive in the Missouri Valley by Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Partly cloudy to sunny and seasonably mild conditions will
prevail across much of the Northeast. However, cooling winds from
the northwest averaging 15 to 25 mph will detract from the relative
mildness of the air. Meanwhile, cloudy weather with scattered snow
showers will persist in some of the mountains of northwest New
England, a region caught in the cyclonic wake of a low-pressure
system retreating toward the Canadian Maritimes.
</P>
<P>
   Splotches of light to locally moderate rain and snow will
accompany a disturbance across the upper Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Quillayute Snow
</P>
<P>
   Snow fell at the Quillayute Airport on the coastal plain of
northwest Washington on Monday night. Though much of Quillayute's
bountiful winter precipitation falls as rain, the airport's annual
average snowfall is 15 inches. In many cases where it would
otherwise snow, low-level cold air in the wake of cold fronts is
modified during transit over relatively tepid Pacific waters,
tipping the scales toward rain. Indeed, offshore sea-surface
temperatures average 45 degrees in February. Monday night, however,
an exceptionally cold Arctic air mass offset the moderating
influence of the Pacific.

 &HT;    Survey shows young women, older men suffer more sexual
dysfunction
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (L) lifestyle and (A) general news
categories.)By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forty-three percent of women and 31 percent of men regularly
have little interest in sex, can't have an orgasm or suffer from
physical problems related to intercourse, according to researchers
who conducted what they say is the most comprehensive sex survey
since the famed Kinsey Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings are particularly important because every sexual
dysfunction _ with the exception of premature ejaculation _ had
adverse effects in the respondents' lives,'' said Edward Laumann, a
University of Chicago sociologist and the study's lead author.
``Invariably, they also reported being unhappy with themselves and
unsatisfied in their relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   David Woodsfellow, an Atlanta psychologist specializing in
marital therapy, said the study reflects much of the unhappiness he
witnesses in his practice. But, among married couples, he said he
sees more conflict surrounding ``different levels of desire,'' than
any other sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the whole, men and women approach sex differently,'' he
said. ``Men think sex is a way to connect emotionally, and women
have to connect emotionally before they have sex. They have a
different rhythm. . . and I see mismatches fairly often.
</P>
<P>
   Young women and older men reported the most problems, according
to the study, which was published in today's Journal of the
American Medical Association. In the case of young women, the
dysfunction could be explained by their single status and higher
rates of ``partner turnover,'' as well as periodic spells of sexual
inactivity. In older men, the factors are tied to being unable to
achieve or sustain an erection and a lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers based their findings on the 1992 National Health
and Social Life Survey, a compilation of personal interviews with
1,749 women and 1,410 men. The study has a margin of error of plus
or minus 5 percentage points in most categories. The participants,
ages 18 to 59, were asked if they had experienced sexual
dysfunction over several months in the previous year. Dysfunction
was defined as a regular lack of interest, pain during sex,
persistent problems reaching orgasm, achieving an erection or
sustaining lubrication.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also found that those in the nation reporting the
least problems were, by a few percentage points, educated, married
or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this certainly is a good argument for staying in
school,'' said Dr. Sujatha Reddy, assistant professor of obstetrics
and gynecology with the Emory Clinic in Atlanta. Reddy also said,
however, that the study was useful in encouraging patients to seek
medical help if they were experiencing physical pain during
intercourse.

<P>
   A: One likely group is the 1,300 members of the McDonald's
Collectors Club.
</P>
<P>
   Most McDonald's items are not expensive, club founder Linda
Gegorski said. ``People can have a really nice collection for a
couple hundred dollars,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Club members, who can take out free classified ads in a
quarterly newsletter, pay yearly dues of $20 in the United States
and $25 elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, send a self-addressed, stamped No. 10
envelope to McDonald's Collectors Club, 1153 S. Lee St., Suite 200,

<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Larry Hagman? I'm a big ``Dallas'' fan
and would like to find out if another reunion movie is planned.
</P>
<P>
   _ J.O., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Although ``Dallas'' fans on the Internet are expecting a
third TV movie, no more will be made after last year's ``War of the
Ewings,'' according to Richard Grant, Larry Hagman's publicist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no further place to go,'' Grant said. ``He doesn't
want to do `Geritol Dallas.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hagman does not accept mail through his publicist or agent at
this time. You may be able to contact him through the National
Kidney Foundation _ Hagman has been its honorary chairman since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Send your letter to Larry Hagman, National Kidney Foundation, 30
E. 33rd St., New York, NY 10016.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I find a Show 'n Tell? My kids had one and we put
it in a shop to be repaired and never got it back. I'd like for my
grandkids to enjoy one.
</P>
<P>
   _ A.R., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Show 'n Tell Viewers sold by GE or Child Guidance didn't show
up in several antique stores specializing in toys.
</P>
<P>
   They do show up regularly for auction on the eBay Web site at
www.ebay.com. Filmstrips and records for the TV-and-phonograph toy
also come up for bid.
</P>
<P>
   Sale prices ranged from $35 to $105 in January, depending on the
condition of the viewer.

 &HT;    BUSINESS SAVVY, REFUGEE BACKGROUND MAY ENDEAR PRINCESS RANIA TO
NEW GENERATION OF JORDANIANS

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ As a Palestinian refugee and former bank teller,
Jordan's Princess Rania has the hint of a Cinderella past.
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with her contemporary tastes and mind for business,
and she could someday make a very popular queen for a new
generation of Jordanians.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, thin, striking beauty, she's hard to miss driving around
town in her own car, having coffee with the 20-something crowd at
one of Amman's trendy Internet sandwich shops or picking up her two
children -- 4-year-old Hussein and 2-year-old Iman -- from
preschool.
</P>
<P>
   But, that will change. Her husband, 37-year-old Abdullah, became
King of Jordan this week after the death of the legendary King
Hussein. Hussein, died after a seven-month battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Rania, 28, stood in a receiving line with the other
women in Hussein's extended family.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching a tissue in one hand, she looked tired and downcast as
she kissed the cheeks of hundreds of women coming to offer
condolences. Towering over most of her well-wishers, she wore a
dark suit and her brown hair poked out from the front of her white
head scarf, which is customary wear for women in Moslem mourning
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Near her was Hussein's widow, Queen Noor. They are friends, but
it is too soon to tell whether Rania will someday be a queen
herself.
</P>
<P>
   While there can be two queens -- as in England, or in Jordan
before the death of Hussein's mother -- it is a decision for the
king and the royal family.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein was married four times and three of his wives were
designated as queens. The last two could be instructive examples
for Rania.
</P>
<P>
   The blonde, American-born Noor has acquired fame internationally
but been coolly received in Jordan's traditional culture. Before
her was Queen Alia, who died in a helicopter crash in 1977. She is
still recalled fondly, in part because she was Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians make up a majority of Jordan's 4.4 million people.
Rania's family, considered well-known and well-educated, left its
town in the West Bank after Israel captured the territory in the
1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million of Jordan's Palestinians still live in
refugee camps, but just as many are well-integrated into Jordanian
society. Indeed, some help form its upper classes. Rania's father,
for example, is a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Her family members have a double-refugee experience. They
originally left the West Bank for Kuwait, where Rania grew up. When
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat sided with Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, more than 300,000 Palestinians were expelled and
many went to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Rania, with degree in business from the American University in
Cairo, worked in marketing at a computer company and as a teller
for a bank in Amman. She had a reputation for being friendly and
ambitious.
</P>
<P>
   Marwan Juma worked with Rania at the computer company. Like most
Jordanians, he declined to be interviewed Tuesday while still
mourning Hussein's death. He did say, however, that Rania is ``a
smart business woman and is career-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Rania met Abdullah at a business reception. The prince fell for
the beautiful woman especially hard, friends say, because she did
not throw herself at him as did so many others.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Jordanian television would show King Hussein drive
Abdullah to the apartment building where Rania lived with her
parents. It was an upper middle-class building, but neighbors still
hung laundry on lines to dry. There, in the king's presence,
Abdullah asked her parents' permission to marry. The wedding was in
1993, and is remembered by guests for an Army buddy of Abdullah's
parachuting into the palace garden and cutting the wedding cake
with a sword.
</P>
<P>
   Rania is now the president of an organization that helps small
businesses and rural women generate income from handcrafts. She
also helped form a special police unit that handles spouse and
child abuse -- sensitive topics in conservative Jordan.

ACADEMY NODS COULD DOUBLE GROSSES OF SOME MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By DAVE MCNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Shakespeare in Love,'' basking in the glow of 13
Academy Award nominations, and ``The Thin Red Line'' should see the
biggest box-office boost from Tuesday's Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the pair, both nominated for best picture, could
more than double their current domestic grosses, now $36.2 million
for ``Shakespeare'' and $30.4 million for ``Line.'' ```Shakespeare
in Love' has clearly seen its value enhanced, even though having
`Shakespeare' in the title limits its audience a little bit,'' said
movie analyst Arthur Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   The film played last weekend in only 833 theaters, or less than
a third of those allocated to box-office leader ``Payback,'' and
its screen count will rise to 1,900 in coming weeks. ``The best
picture nomination benefits movies like `Shakespeare' that haven't
gone into the mainstream yet by up to 150 percent,'' said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service.
``Everyone loves to see those five before they watch the
telecast.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomination for ``The Thin Red Line'' should save the war
drama from obscurity following a lukewarm box-office performance.
``It can ride `Saving Private Ryan's' coattails,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' already the 27th-highest domestic
grosser ever with $194.6 million, moved back into wide release last
weekend on 1,027 screens and will probably add another 100 this
weekend. ``It was smart to pull it in November and then relaunch
it,'' said Bucksbaum, who predicts it will finish between $225
million and $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful,'' currently with $18.6 million, could reach
$50 million, despite the drawbacks of being in Italian and focused
on a concentration camp. ``For moviegoers, `Life Is Beautiful' is
new and refreshing,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth,'' with $21.3 million, will see its screen count
grow from 418 to over 600 in the next two weeks. Gramercy
spokeswoman Claudia Gray said the acclaim for ``Shakespeare in
Love'' will help ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominations also represent a huge benefit for smaller
distributors, such as Lion's Gate with five, including best actor
nods for Nick Nolte in ``Affliction'' and Ian McKellen in ``Gods
and Monsters.'' ``Affliction, which played in only a dozen theaters
last weekend, grossing $635,750 overall, will be on 300 screens by
Feb. 19; ``Monsters,'' with $3 million so far, will go from 86 to
about 150.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lighting candles and saying mantras today to express my
gratitude to the Oscar gods,'' said co-president Mark Urman.

 &HT;    Telephone companies vary in readiness
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth and AT&AMP;T say their services will be alive
and well after the millennium hits. With much less public
visibility, lots of little Georgia telephone companies are also
scrambling to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   The companies range in size from Norcross, Ga.-based Alltel,
which has more than a half-million access lines, to Glenwood
Telephone Co., operating out of Glenwood, Ga., which serves fewer
than 1,000, said John Silk, who heads the Georgia Telephone
Association, an industry group.
</P>
<P>
   The group currently has 31 member companies, and its Web site is
http://www.gta.org, Silk said.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site doesn't chronicle the companies' Y2K readiness, but
lots of such information is contained in Public Service Commission
data filed with Gov. Roy Barnes and legislative leaders last month.
</P>
<P>
   The report, Silk said, is entitled ``RE: Impact of the Year 2000
(Y2K) Computer Problem on Public Utility Service Providers in
Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   More information can be obtained from the PSC's Web site
(http://www.psc.state.ga.us).
</P>
<P>
   Readiness varies. For instance, Accucomm Telecommunications,
based in Irwinton, is 75 percent finished with its testing of
information technology systems, embedded systems and network
elements, while Bulloch Telephone Cooperative of Statesboro is only
50 percent of the way home with these categories, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   All of the companies say they'll have the work completed in
time. And all were asked to report when they would be ready for the
Y2K problem. Most expect to have all the work complete by this
summer, and the latest of the expected readiness dates is the
middle of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The companies were also required to state worst-case scenarios.
These range from ``not being able to produce accurate billing,''
reported by Brantley Telephone of Nahunta, to the possibility of
``total system failure,'' recorded by Pembroke Telephone of
Pembroke.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that any system failure at small phone
companies probably won't cause outages for customers of the giant
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that our network would not be taken down
with interconnection problems no matter where they occur, whether
they be a local carrier, an international or a long-distance
carrier,'' said BellSouth spokesman Clay Owen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some telephone company does have Year 2000 problems, that
could affect connections to that particular company, but not to the
system as a whole. But most any problems are more likely to be on
the billing side than on the connection or dial tone side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our companies have been addressing the issues related to Y2K
readiness for several years now,'' Silk said. ``I am confident that
the steps they have taken and continue to take will enable them to
successfully address the Y2K problem.''
</P>

   NEW YORK _ When finished, it should be visible for 28 blocks,
punctuating the southern terminus of Park Avenue South as Grand
Central Terminal and its clock punctuate the northern. It's
``Metronome,'' exploring the relationship between the city and
time, and billed as one of the largest private commissions of
public art in the city's history.

<P>
   Construction of this so-called artwall, with a 100-foot-high,
60-foot-wide central component, on the facade of One Union Square
South, a residential and commercial complex on 14th Street between
Fourth Avenue and Broadway, began this week and is expected to end
in mid-May. Costing $3 million, ``Metronome'' was designed by
Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel, and was chosen in a national
competition organized by the Public Art Fund for Related Cos.,
developers of the complex.

   Retailing forever changed, thanks to NCR
</P>
<P>
   By Ernest Holsendolph
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nothing so eloquently recalls the old corner store
better than the big solid steel or brass cash register. Its bulk
alone embodied permanence. Its familiar ch-ching sound as the big
handle was cranked told everybody a sale was made, business was
moving, it was a great day.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, nothing today symbolizes the retailing change of the
second half of this century better than the gradual disappearance
of the cash register, along with the family store, and the
emergence of the supermarket that evolves, expands and becomes more
varied every year, punctuated only by the quiet beep-beep of the
sensing devices at the electronic checkout center.
</P>
<P>
   NCR Corp., which once laid claim to 60 percent of the cash
register market, wisely dropped the phrase ``cash register'' from
its historic name. Now the Dayton, Ohio-based company itself
embodies the change represented by the evolution of retailing.
</P>
<P>
   It bears watching again. Far and away the most exciting
development about the old-line company, analysts say, is that NCR
is showing the strongest signs of new life since it was spun off by
AT&AMP;T two years ago. New directions, which harken back to its close
ties with merchants, indicate the diversified company's future lies
within the world of retailing.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.5 billion company now designs and sells computers, ATMs
and information systems, mostly with an eye to handling
transactions and storing and managing huge amounts of retail
information in a rapidly evolving sales economy.
</P>
<P>
   And a major part of that effort is based right here in Atlanta,
in the NCR Retail Solutions Group in Duluth, appropriately placed
right in the neighborhood of Gwinnett Place mall, one of the
state's busiest shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the name implies, Retail Solutions holds hands with
shopkeepers big and small and helps them manage the changes in
their business. Preferring to work cheek-to-jowl with their
clients, NCR has other retail solutions offices overseas, three in
Japan alone.
</P>
<P>
   NCR has 11 offices of various types in metro Atlanta, including
a major logistics office in Peachtree City.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics center employs some 600 people, who manage and
warehouse more than 50,000 different items used in the repair and
maintenance of NCR machines around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That work in logistics is critical to the success of our
retail solutions program because it maintains the service and helps
maintain loyalty among our customers,'' said Randy Weil, vice
president for worldwide service logistics.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the merchant's needs were simple: He needed a
secure machine that added up the sales, displayed the total charge
and opened the cash drawer to complete the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business unit, the Retail Solutions Group, helps retailers
transform transactions into relationships, a concept we refer to as
`neighborhood retailing','' said Tony Fano, senior vice president
of NCR's Retail Solutions Group.
</P>
<P>
   One example of an NCR service that engenders ``relationships''
with customers is the NCR Teradata warehouse solution recently
purchased by Harrah's, the gaming and entertainment company.
</P>
<P>
   That company's roster of some 14.5 million guests and customers
who patronize 18 casinos in eight states is tracked by a
sophisticated data warehouse that records the favorite games, meals
and other preferences. It provides rewards to customers for
patronage, and gives clues as to how to appeal to them for repeat
business.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers love to increase their pull on new friends and
patrons. But they are especially gratified when they build loyalty
and repeat business, patronage they can cultivate and depend upon.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are watching NCR's bet on Teredata systems closely.
While NCR has a strong position, powerful computer players like
Oracle, Unisys, Sun Microsystems and others are edging their way
into the market for major customers such as department stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that NCR or Teradata won't be around in 10 years, but
you're absolutely sure that Oracle will,'' warns Jon Oltsik, a
software services analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One of NCR's strategies is to cultivate smaller customers who
may also need the big data storage systems.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, NCR is working to give consumers greater
freedom to do things their way. One of the latest ideas is a
self-checkout system that allows customers to scan their own items
and charge them to cards and depart.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is being tested in other cities, but NCR has not put
one to work in metro Atlanta, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly all of the customers who use the self-checkout system
feel that they are getting out of the store faster than if they
waited in lines for clerks to check them out,'' said Bob Bruggeman,
manager of the briefing center at NCR's retail showroom in Duluth.
</P>
<P>
   He implied that the technology actually may take a bit longer,
but improvements may alter that pattern.
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, NCR is successfully focusing company efforts
following its sojourn as a subsidiary of AT&AMP;T. The company, like
Lucent, is two years into its new period of independence, and it
has impressed Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The larger NCR strategy these days has been to farm out the
actual manufacturing of equipment and concentrate on the
intellectual work, the actual design of equipment and systems. It
is a business NCR feels fits with its long history of dealing with
the habits and needs of the retail industry.
</P>
<P>
   The particular needs of the retail industry customers vary, said
Fano, and could include hardware, machines or new ways of doing
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We help them design the best total solution, which may include
hardware, application software, database technology and the
services needed to make those solutions work,'' said Fano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this (approach) as vital to our long-term success,'' he
continued, ``and we think our financial results are a good
indication that this strategy is working.''

 &HT;    Petty proves you can go home again
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Kyle Petty seems to be very intelligent,
even though he spent his early adult years on NASCAR's Winston Cup,
not in the Ivy League.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about NASCAR's tradition of third- and fourth-generation
drivers, and he'll tell you about a tribe of nomad Eskimos in
Alaska. Ask him about returning to his hometown of Level Cross,
N.C., for the `99 Winston Cup season, and Petty quotes Thomas
Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Wolfe said you can never go home again,'' Petty said.
``Well, I'm going home and taking my whole family with me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Petty did before this season, returning to Petty
Enterprises, the Winston Cup operations of his father, NASCAR
legend Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling on NASCAR's highest series for 14 seasons _ he
finished fifth in points in 1992 and `93, but hasn't moved above
15th the past five years _ the prodigal son knew it was time for a
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't hurt going home,'' Petty said. ``I was so far down
last year that there isn't but one way to go and that's up. Can it
help? Yeah, it helps. It helps right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty's past two seasons were especially frustrating. As owner
and driver of the No. 44 Pontiac, Petty struggled to a 30th-place
finish in points in 1998. He had only two top-10 finishes and
didn't complete eight races.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just never got on track,'' he said. ``The group I had
working for me last year was a great group of guys. But as a group,
we just never caught on to it. We lost our motivation, and we lost
our focus. We just kind of fell away by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you lose that, then you've got to go somewhere else and
start something different or start with new people. I probably let
everybody down from the leader perspective, and that probably hurt
us. I wasn't the leader I should have been last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty isn't expected to be a leader at Petty Enterprises, where
he'll team with John Andretti, who replaced Bobby Hamilton in the
storied No. 43 car last season. When he owned his own car, Petty
got technical support and engines from his father's team, but the
teams were still separated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both cars are housed in the same buildings and share the
same engines and cars. Petty Enterprises added 20,000 square feet
to its shop and hired 22 new employees, including Doug Hewitt, the
crew chief for Derrike Cope for most of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Petty has come out of the box relatively well. After posting the
third-fastest testing times at Daytona in January, he finished 20th
in first-round qualifying for the Daytona 500 at 193.162 mph.
Andretti was 25th at 192.439 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Petty has shifted the financial resources of his Cup venture
into a Busch Grand National team for his son, Adam, who becomes the
sport's first fourth-generation drive. Richard Petty owns both
Winston Cup teams, as well as Jimmy Hansley's Craftsman Truck team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really spawned me going back to the (Petty Enterprises)
shop was Adam,'' Petty said. ``He just advanced a lot quicker and
became a lot better driver a lot faster than what I anticipated.
When I sat back and looked at it, I said, `If I'm ever going to
start a Busch team for him, now is the time.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When Adam's ready to go to Winston Cup, hopefully we'll have
two good Cup teams and we can be teammates some day. It was more a
family decision than a business decision.

 &HT;    Charlotte's race track to be named for Lowe's
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Charlotte Motor Speedway on Tuesday became
the first NASCAR venue to sell its name. Atlanta Motor Speedway
might be the next to bow to corporate dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Motorsports, Inc., sold the Charlotte track's name to
Lowe's Companies Inc., the nation's second-largest home-improvement
retailer, located in North Wilkesboro, N.C. According to SMI
chairman Bruton Smith, Lowe's paid $35 million to rename the track
Lowe's Motor Speedway for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   SMI also owns the Atlanta, Las Vegas, Bristol, Texas and Sears
Point tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great deal that we did with Lowe's,'' Smith said.
``I think that maybe the next two might be for a higher dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Schumacher, vice president of public relations for Home
Depot, said the Atlanta-based home-improvement retailer was
approached last year by SMI about purchasing naming rights for
either the Atlanta or Charlotte track, but the company declined.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot has a three-year contract with NASCAR as the sport's
official home-improvement warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard that (SMI) is shopping around all of their
tracks,'' Schumacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Atlanta-based Coca-Cola said the company has not
been contacted by AMS, but AMS president and general manager Ed
Clark said Tuesday that track officials will continue the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to sell the rights here,'' Clark said. ``How long it
takes, I don't know. It's going to happen in time, though.''
</P>
<P>
   AMS would be the second sports venue in Atlanta to sell its name
to a corporation. Officials announced last week that the city's new
basketball and hockey arena, under construction on the site of the
old Omni, will be named Philips Arena after a deal worth an
estimated $180 million was reached with Philips Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Charlotte-based Speedway Motorsports hasn't targeted
a specific corporation for AMS, and that the search wouldn't be
limited to Atlanta-based companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking to someone specifically,'' Clark said. ``We
haven't gotten to the first step with anybody, where we're ready to
go to the second step.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Motor Speedway hosts two Winston Cup events _ the
Cracker Barrel 500 on March 14 and the season-ending NAPA 500 on
Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   SMI's president Humpy Wheeler said tracks in Atlanta and Fort
Worth, Texas, are the most likely properties to be selling their
naming rights in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Charlotte) opens the flood gates,'' Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Motor Speedway has led innovation on the Winston Cup
circuit, adding lights above the 1.5-mile oval. It was the first to
build luxury suites and trackside condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``This type of thing was probably inevitable,'' Winston Cup car
owner Michael Kranefuss said. ``Cities have been selling name
rights to their stadiums and arenas for years; why not racing
tracks? I see little negative in it, other than understanding
exactly where you are going. Instead of racing at Charlotte, we'll
be racing at Lowe's. Hopefully, this will help us all as it brings
new revenues into the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   One NASCAR track that probably won't be selling its name is
Daytona International Speedway, site of Sunday's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never say never,'' Daytona president John Graham said,
``but Daytona International Speedway is such terrific tradition and
equity in itself that we would think long and hard about putting an
corporate name on (the track).

 1940s AND 16th CENTURY VIE FOR TOP OSCAR  
 (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Maybe directors and screenwriters are finally
struggling with grand historical themes. Perhaps filmmakers in
their 50s are looking back at the defining events of their
childhood. But in an unusual turn, World War II dominated the
nominations on Tuesday for the 71st annual Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Three films dealing with the war _ ``Saving Private Ryan,''
``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' _ were among the
five nominated for best picture. The other two, about one other era
of history, were ``Elizabeth'' and ``Shakespeare in Love.'' In
addition ``The Last Days,'' about Holocaust survivors recalling
their lives in the camps, was one of five nominees for best
documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Why the plethora of World War II films? ``We're at the end of
the century, and the Second World War has not been acknowledged in
a serious way in many decades,'' said Steven Spielberg, director
and a producer of of ``Private Ryan,'' which received 11
nominations. ``Better late than never.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ziskin, one of the executives responsible for another of
the war films vying for best picture, ``The Thin Red Line,'' said:
``There are certain ideas that exist in the Zeitgeist. As you
approach the millennium you think of the defining events of the
century. And World War II was one of them, particularly for
filmmakers who didn't go through it but see it, in one way or
another, as influencing the world we've lived in.'' Ms. Ziskin is
president of Fox 2000, a division of 20th Century Fox that released
and produced ``Red Line'' with Phoenix Pictures. The Terrence
Malick film is set on Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, the Disney-owned
company that dominated the Oscars with 23 nominations _ including
13 for ``Shakespeare in Love'' and 7 for ``Life Is Beautiful'' _
said of World War II: ``Something's in the air. It's more than 50
years. People are looking back at history to see what they can
learn. Of course they're looking way back, too. You have
`Elizabeth' being nominated and `Shakespeare in Love.'''
</P>
<P>
   The last time so many movies with World War II themes were
nominated was 1942, when 4 of the 10 best-film contenders dealt
with war issues, said Robert Osborne, author of ``70 Years of the
Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several surprises about this year's Oscar
nominations, announced in Hollywood before dawn Tuesday at the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The biggest surprise
was that Peter Weir's comedy-drama ``The Truman Show'' was not
nominated for best picture, as expected, nor was its star, Jim
Carrey, nominated in the best-actor category. Weir, however, was
nominated for directing the film.
</P>
<P>
   The other directors nominated were Spielberg, Malick, John
Madden for ``Shakespeare'' and Roberto Benigni for ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' about a Jewish man who struggles to protect his son
when they are rounded up by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni, who also starred in the film and wrote it with Vincenzo
Cerami, said from Rome that he was astounded to learn that his
movie had been nominated for best picture and best foreign-language
film. (The last movie nominated in both categories was the
Costa-Gavras drama ``Z'' in 1969. It took home the foreign-film
Oscar.)
</P>
<P>
   Benigni's movie is ``about three little clowns _ myself, my wife
and the boy _ in the most terrifying place in the world,'' he said.
``It's a movie about how to protect your innocence, your purity, in
the face of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Some actors learned of the nominations in unusual ways. Ian
McKellen, nominated as best actor for ``Gods and Monsters,'' was
nervously waiting in his dressing room at the Yorkshire Playhouse
in Leeds, where he is appearing in ``The Tempest.'' No one called
at first. ``I thought I hadn't been nominated,'' he said. ``So I
went to the Oscar Web site. They had the news. I was stunned. Then
the phone began ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, directed by Bill Condon, McKellen plays James
Whale, the real-life Hollywood director, in his final, sad days.
``It's more than just a tender gay love story; it's about love and
friendship and companionship,'' McKellen said. ``I like to think of
it as a comedy weepie for the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides McKellen and Benigni, the other nominees for best actor
were Tom Hanks in ``Private Ryan,'' Edward Norton in ``American
History X'' and Nick Nolte in ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolte said he was awakened by his publicist with the news. ``I'm
thrilled for me and Jimmy Coburn,'' said Nolte. James Coburn, who
plays his father in the film, was nominated in the supporting
category. ``This was a little independent film, a dark piece that
really explores the violence in us all,'' Nolte said. ``We never
anticipated anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Watson, who was nominated for Anand Tucker's ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' about the cellist Jacqueline du Pre, whose life was cut
short by multiple sclerosis, said she was at her London home
``pretending to read a book about gardening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so nervous,'' she said. ``My husband was upstairs
listening to the radio. He called me and said yes. I jumped up and
down and screamed.''
</P>
<P>
   The other nominees for best actress were Meryl Streep, for ``One
True Thing,'' Gwyneth Paltrow for ``Shakespeare in Love,'' Cate
Blanchett for ``Elizabeth'' and Fernanda Montenegro for ``Central
Station.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Montenegro, one of Brazil's top actresses, played a bitter,
lonely woman who develops a friendship with an orphaned boy. She
was watching the nominations on television in a Manhattan hotel
room with her husband, Fernando Torres, an actor, and Walter
Salles, the director of ``Central Station.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard my name,'' said Ms. Montenegro excitedly. ``I had to
think. All of a sudden my director kissed me. I kissed him. We
cried. You can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blanchett said she was too nervous to stay at home in
London, so she went to a restaurant with a friend for lunch. Her
agent called her as the meal began. ``I became giggly,'' she said.
``You make an obscure English film, and nobody expected it to spark
so much interest and accolades in so many corners of the world.''
She continued, ``Women really seem to connect to this film. It's
about fulfilling one's destiny, about the choice you make between
your head and your heart and where you find the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of Elizabeth I was unusually popular last year. Judi
Dench was also nominated in the supporting category for playing the
Queen in ``Shakespeare in Love.'' Other supporting actress nominees
were Kathy Bates for ``Primary Colors,'' Brenda Blethyn for
``Little Voice,'' Lynn Redgrave for ``Gods and Monsters'' and
Rachel Griffiths for ``Hilary and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   With 13 nominations, ``Shakespeare in Love'' came only one short
of the record, held by ``Titanic,'' last year's big winner, and the
1951 ``All About Eve.'' The most Oscars for a single film was 11,
achieved by ``Titanic'' and by ``Ben Hur,'' in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   The winners will be announced from the Los Angeles Music Center
on March 21, a Sunday night, instead of the traditional Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Spielberg was especially triumphal this year. Not
only did ``Private Ryan'' earn 11 nominations, but the Holocaust
documentary ``The Final Days'' was also selected. Spielberg was
executive producer of that film, made by the Shoah Foundation,
which he created with profits from his movie ``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg received the news of the nominations for the two films
after arriving in Berlin for a film festival. ``When I heard about
it, I thought, how appropriate it is to get the news about the two
films while I'm in Berlin, he said.

   GERMANY-HOLOCAUST (Washington) _ The German government will
establish a huge compensation fund financed by titans of German

<P>
   OLY-SALTLAKE (Salt Lake City) _ Describing a program of gifts
that ranged from trips to the Super Bowl to furniture,
refrigerators, and draperies, the Salt Lake City Olympic committee
made public a report on how the city won the 2002 Winter Games. The
report implicates an additional six Olympic delegates in the
unfolding scandal, which began last year when a Salt Lake City
television station disclosed that the daughter of IOC member had
received a college scholarship. By Jere Longman.
</P>
<P>
   VA-GUN-SWEEP (Richmond, Va.) _ Authorities here contend that a
new program, backed by the NRA, to enforce gun laws already on the
books has helped drop the rate of homicides by firearms in Richmond
last year by 36 percent, to 78 from 122 in 1997. The program has
proved so successful that other cities, including Phildelphia and
Rochester, N.Y., have implemented versions of it, and a dozen more
cities are considering it. By Michael Janofsky. With graphic.

   NY-SUSPECT-SHOT (New York) _ As more than 1,000 people gathered
for the second demonstration in three days against the police
killing of an unarmed African immigrant, the victim's mother
returned to New York City to mourn her son. With no sign that anger
over the killing was fading, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani canceled a trip
to Texas to meet with the parents of the slain man, Amadou Diallo,
and attend a memorial service. By Elisabeth Bumiller.

</P>
<P>
   ROSIE-PEREZ-FILMS (New York) _ Rosie Perez has built an
improbable acting career, which began with a chance encounter with
the director Spike Lee, on being pretty much what she is: an
intense, voluble, working-class Puerto Rican from Brooklyn who is
indelibly from her own unfashionable patch of turf. In her new
film, ``The 24-Hour Woman,'' written and directed by Nancy Savoca,
she plays a familiar character but with a twist. She is definitely
Ms. Perez, but she is also a successful television producer, rather
than a kid from the streets, trying to balance work, marriage and
motherhood. By Peter Applebome. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKING-BARRELS-FILM (London) _ ``Could every one of you stop
getting shot?'' a particularly hapless character asks well into
``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' the cheeky London gangland
film that opens on March 5. This request comes out of a desperation
at once comic and fearful, as befitting an alternately funny and
violent tale of London criminality from the lunatic to the thuggish
_ which is to say, from dope-addicted, well-spoken public school
boys (known as ``trustafarians'' for their ready access to trust
funds to finance their habit), to seasoned tough guys with
Runyonesque names like Big Chris and Hatchet Harry. By Matt Wolf.

<P>
   BRITISH-FILMS-SPEECH (Undated) _ Moviegoers on these shores have
long been baby-powdered by British actors who pamper every line as
if the English language were a newborn's bottom. If we weren't
savoring the plummy consonants in stuffy Merchant-Ivory
productions, we were relishing the plumped vowels in stifling
Elizabethan costume dramas. Lately, though, British movies have
become both less mannered and less manored. And the grittier the
fiction, the muddier the diction. The British cinema isn't dead,
it's just not speaking as clearly. By Franz Lidz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THINGS-FALL-APART-THEATER (Undated) _ ``Things Fall Apart,'' is
a drama with music now at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in
Newark. Adapted from the classic 1958 novel of the same name by the
Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, the production chronicles the rise
and fall of a Nigerian leader who watches his beliefs and
traditions unravel with the arrival of missionaries and other white
foreigners in Africa in the early 1900s. By Rachel L. Swarns.

   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Reviews of ``You're a Good Man,

<P>
   651-ARTS-DANCE (New York) _ One of the best-kept secrets in the
performing arts in New York City is 651 Arts. The Brooklyn-based
producing and presenting organization is often confused with the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, a separate corporation that helped found
651 Arts nearly 10 years ago and has maintained a symbiotic
relationship with it. Today, 651 is a major developer, producer and
presenter of contemporary performing-arts works by black artists
like Donald Byrd (``Harlem Nutcracker'' and ``Jazz Train''), Anna
Deavere Smith (``Fires in the Mirror'') and Randy Weston (a
production of his rarely performed 1961 ``Uhuru Afrika''). This
month, 651 is one of 13 organizations citywide that is
participating in a salute to the documentary ``I'll Make Me a
World.'' By Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KIRCHNER-MUSIC (New York) _ On Saturday evening, at Merkin
Concert Hall, a group of fine musicians will gather to pay tribute
to one of America's finest composers: Leon Kirchner. Kirchner
turned 80 last month, and the retrospective concert is a kind of
birthday present. The real beneficiaries, though, will be the
members of the audience, for Kirchner's music has always been
outgoing, strong, challenging, glorious to hear. He is a big man,
and he makes big music. By Paul Griffiths. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SWENSEN-VIOLINIST (Undated) _ As a young violinist, Joseph
Swensen had a rapidly blossoming international career and top
management: ICM Artists booked him for some 100 events a season. He
had an exclusive contract with a major label, BMG/RCA, which
promised at least six recordings. Having studied with the world's
most revered violin pedagogue, Dorothy DeLay, at the Juilliard
School, he had a blistering technique second to none. He also had
something infinitely more precious: a restless, probing, highly
personal musicianship. But in 1991, at 31, Swensen did something
shocking if not heretical, abandoning the violin and announcing
that he would accept engagements only as a conductor. Eight years
later, violin cognoscenti still shake their heads at mention of his
name, whether in sad or admiring disbelief. By K. Robert Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-CLASSICAL-CDs (Undated) _ Back when the LP still
reigned, long before the classical CD glut, a new recording of
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique'' would
inevitably draw some critic's weary sigh, ``Do we really need
another one?'' Now, as CD bins groan _ and the browser's mind reels
_ with choices beyond number, a new wave of mainstream classical
CDs from England washes on these shores. And the old refrain
echoes: do we really need this? Not to milk the suspense, the
answer in this refreshing case is yes. Well, mostly yes. At hand is
a boxful of budget-price CDs offering a potpourri (or is it a
hodgepodge?) of composers and works, all performed by the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra of London with various conductors. By
Lawrence B. Johnson. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-ART-SONGS (New York) _ Since Aristotle, and on through
Newton, Baudelaire and Scriabin, progressive thinkers have linked
the aural sensation of music to the visual sensation of color. But
is the color of the composer ever audibly discernible? The
distinguished American mezzo-soprano Florence Quivar explores that
question Sunday afternoon, when she and the pianist Wayne Sanders
present a recital of art songs by black composers at the 92d Street
Y.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Quivar has long wished to mine the rich but
little-known lode of black American art songs, this is only the
third opportunity she has had to do so. By Cori Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-LABELS-MERGER (Undated) _ Two weeks ago, two of the seven
recording imprints that comprise the major-label jazz industry _
Verve and Impulse! _ merged. They came together under the umbrella
of the Verve Music Group, a subsidiary of the new, expanded
Universal Music Group. (They will still be kept separate as
imprints, but they will be presided over by the same marketing and
sales department and general manager.) Aside from the lost jobs,
it's a sure thing that plenty of artists will be dropped from the
rosters. With fewer major-label jazz records coming out, and many
great musicians without contracts, it's now or never for for the
independent label to become an important force in jazz again. By
Ben Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-ART (Undated) _ The proposal sent by e-mail seemed
typical enough, full of talk about ``digital genetics, autonomous
robotics, recursive chaotic algorithms and knowbots.'' Anyone who
has ever waded past the low breakers of America Online's chat rooms
and taken a dunk in cyberspace has bumped into the same scientific
jargon, into the discussion groups and Web sites of geeks at work.
But what was startling was the proposal's subject: not an
engineering conference but ``Life 2.0,'' an international art
competition mating digital media with a high-tech project of
simulating evolution. Recursive chaotic algorithms? Digital
genetics? Welcome to an entirely new art world. Welcome to the next
century. By Steven Henry Madoff. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-ART (New York) _ Artists are a voracious lot. They take
from everywhere, even if they misuse, abuse or only partly
understand what they borrow. In the last three decades _ ever since
Minimalism and Conceputal Art declared open season on reality _
science has played an increasingly prominent role in art. Donald
Judd used the Fibonacci series of natural numbers as a
compositional device and Robert Irwin's installations examined the
nature of visual perception. Robert Smithson embraced entropy as
the underlying principle of his art. Alan Sonfist, playing the
botanical historian, reconstructed a bit of primeval Manhattan
forest, still standing at the corner of West Broadway and Houston.
By Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-MUSEUM (Karlsruhe, Germany) _ The Media Museum is one part
of the Center for Art and Media Technology (Zentrum fur Kunst und
Medientechnologie), an institution that has no exact parallel in
the world and not even a recognizable echo in America. Founded in
1989 and opened to the public in October 1997, the ZKM has more
than 48,000 square yards of usable space. It houses, in addition to
the museum, an Institute for Visual Media, an Institute of Media
and Acoustics, a media library, a media theater, a Museum for
Contemporary Art and, under different direction, the State Academy
of Design and the Municipal Gallery of the City of Karlsruhe.
Touring the Media Museum is like roaming an electronic theme park,
a futuristic playground for grown-ups where miniature theaters,
videos and oversize images morph, dance, respond to questions and
urge visitors along on fictive journeys. By Vicki Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   GARDNER-ART-EDUCATION (Cambridge, Mass.) _ Howard Gardner, a
psychologist, studies the arts, the mind and human development. He
spent two decades working with brain-damaged patients and is a
founding member and has for many years been a director of Project
Zero at Harvard, a research group started in the 1960s by Nelson
Goodman, the philosopher, to study cognition and the arts.
Increasingly. Gardner and Project Zero have become involved with
arts education and school reform. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VINYL-RECORDS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ For years, a market in
vintage records has quietly flourished among a small but dedicated
group of collectors. They buy and sell through an informal network
of used-record stores, mail-order houses, magazines and, more
recently, Web sites. Some call it the vinyl underground. Of late,
however, even the auction houses have begun to take notice. With
rare albums now commanding as much as five figures, the William
Doyle Galleries in New York is betting that the time is right. On
Tuesday, Doyle will hold what it's billing as
``Rockin'/Rhythm-and-Blues: The Fine Vinyl Auction,'' the sale of a
collection of some 50,000 45s, LPs, CDs and memorabilia that span
the history of post-war popular music, from rockabilly and early
rhythm to rock, country, jazz and blues. By Fletcher Roberts.

   &UR; THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST  &LR;  Four Catholic ladies are having

<P>
   The second Catholic woman chirps, `My son is a bishop. Whenever
he walks into a room, people say, 'Your Grace'.`

   The third Catholic woman says smugly, `My son is a cardinal.
Whenever he walks into a room, people say, 'Your Eminence'.`
</P>
<P>
   The fourth Catholic woman sips her coffee in silence. The first
three women give her this subtle `Well...?`

<P>
   Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush flew to Jordan with
Bill Clinton. But the plane, in their honor, wasn't renamed Air
Force Once.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says King Hussein ``made us all a little better.''
The same could be said of him _ if you change the first vowel in
better to an i.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't having not only Bill Clinton, but also Ford, Carter and
Bush attend the Hussein funeral setting a president precedent?
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from around the world attended the Hussein funeral. It's
important for them to go, if only to make sure someone shows up at
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect King Hussein's son Abdullah to continue his
policies. At least until he's overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   The new king of Jordan is 37 years old. If he hasn't already had
his midlife crisis, he may have to wait now until the next monarch
takes over.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Hussein,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``lived his life on a higher
plain.'' And often on a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Mr. Clinton's consistency in the Monica Lewinsky
matter. When he was first in trouble he went to Vernon Jordan. Now
near the end of that trouble, he went to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   There's talk of a GOP filibuster against a Senate motion to
censure the president. If this sounds confusing, maybe you've paid
too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   The only impeachment mystery left is whether even a majority of
senators will vote to convict Mr. Clinton. Well, that and what
Chief Justice Rehnquist will do with his afternoons.

   &UR; GEEZERS ON THE GO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;  &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While you were napping, the United Nations declared 1999 the
International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who is hurtling toward Older Person status at the
speed one normally associates with rogue asteroids, this
declaration does not come a moment too soon. If the United Nations
had waited much longer, I might have whizzed right past Older
Person status and gone directly to Gibbering Geezer or, worse yet,
Lawn Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota, of course, is absolutely lousy with Older Persons to
the point that you can hardly throw an empty Metamucil bottle out
your car window without smacking one in the head. (Lame joke: If
you want to start a stampede in a Sarasota movie house, you don't
yell ``Fire!'' You yell ``Viagra!'')
</P>
<P>
   Older Persons, at least of the Sarasota variety, are quite
active and engaged and much too busy to give the United Nations a
day of their time, much less a year. If your idea of an alert Older
Person is someone who can rock and drool at the same time, you need
to get a load of the old folks from Sarasota. They run marathons,
play championship golf and tennis, write novels, play in jazz
bands, go to college and just generally make us younger folk feel
like soggy Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   I used to look forward to being an Older Person, but now I'm not
sure if I have the stamina. As someone who gets dizzy bending over
to pick up the morning newspaper, it's hard to imagine turning 65
and suddenly feeling the urge to skydive, water-ski or scuba-dive.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement, Sarasota-style, is a lot more than wandering around
in your bathrobe mumbling to yourself; it's a full-time job that
requires energy and commitment. The situation is only going to get
worse once the United Nations' message of empowered
senior-citizenship gets around.
</P>
<P>
   The way I look at it, there is already too much pressure on
Older Persons without the United Nations getting into the act. The
first question that's asked of a person approaching his or her 65th
birthday is, ``What are you going to do when you retire?''
Somewhere along the line the definition of retirement changed from
``to stop doing'' to ``to start doing'' and the whole idea of
retirement has been a lot less attractive ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The old notion of retirement as ``long days of nothing special
interrupted by frequent naps'' has no relevance in today's society.
Retirees often find themselves working harder for longer hours
(and, of course, lower pay) than they did when they held the
stressful, full-time jobs they were so anxious to quit.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to think of retirement as a time when the most
strenuous thing you have to do is scuff out to the kitchen for a
fresh cup of tea, but the reality is far less relaxed. In Sarasota,
many Older Persons fill their time doing volunteer work, performing
in community theater, becoming active in local politics or
otherwise flitting about in a decidedly un-old-fogeyish way. While
I have no quarrel with Older Persons who wish to remain active to
the point of carrying their own coffins, I don't think there should
be a stigma attached to Older Persons who prefer that their
retirement years proceed at a more leisurely pace.
</P>
<P>
   Although the folks at the United Nations may think otherwise,
there is nothing wrong with an Older Person going through an entire
day without doing anything that promotes his or her physical or
mental well-being or results in the betterment of mankind. If all
you managed to do in the last 24 hours was feed yourself and hit
the mute button when the Jerry Springer show came on, you should
not feel that you squandered your time.
</P>
<P>
   Life, after all, can be very pleasurable if you don't let your
retirement get in the way.

 &HT;    Defense takes helm in Baptist leader's trial
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARGO, Fla. _ After two weeks of testimony about luxury shopping
sprees, hidden love affairs and secret bank accounts, lawyers for
the Rev. Henry Lyons open their defense of the embattled Baptist
leader today.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, 57, and his alleged mistress, Bernice Edwards, are
charged with swindling more than $4 million from corporations that
hoped to do business with the National Baptist Convention USA, one
of the country's largest African-American denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons is president of the group, while Edwards served as its
public relations director.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons took the stand briefly Tuesday after the jury was
dismissed for the day, testifying about a convention membership
list he allegedly tried to sell.
</P>
<P>
   His attorneys have claimed Lyons made legitimate efforts to
market credit cards, life insurance policies and burial services
for several companies, capitalizing on his leadership role to give
what amounted to a celebrity endorsement for their products.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors put on dozens of witnesses to show that Lyons
used the millions he got from the companies to finance a posh
waterfront home, expensive cars, and a huge diamond and other
luxury gifts for several women who allegedly were his lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons purchased a mink coat and hat for the convention's
director of meetings, Brenda Harris, with whom he was having an
affair, one former convention aide testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day that I came to work for Brenda, she was giving
me an overview of what it was she did,'' Renee Fagans testified.
``Her exact words were: `I'm having an affair with the president
and we're in love.'''
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony, a St. Petersburg, Fla. jewelry store owner
testified that Lyons bought Edwards a $36,000 diamond ring. The
5.56-carat ring was ``the size of a dime,'' the jeweler testified,
prompting courtroom spectators to examine their own rings.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the most dramatic testimony, Bonita Henderson,
another former Lyons aide, said Lyons was her lover and that he
paid her $150,000 from a secret account after she quit her job and
ended their affair.
</P>
<P>
   When Lyons was campaigning to become the convention's president
in 1994, Edwards told Henderson a victory would mean ``we were
going to make a lot of money,'' Henderson testified.
</P>
<P>
   After Lyons won, he struck a deal to sell a list of the
convention's members to the Globe Life Insurance Co. of Oklahoma,
which hoped to market policies to the membership, Henderson
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons told the company the membership was 8.5 million, although
the only lists on hand contained about 15,000 names, Henderson
testified. The pair solved the problem by compiling a phony list
using a computer program that contained telephone numbers and
addresses from around the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort back-fired when the company received lots of
complaints from people who received the mailings, including an
imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the quickest and most negative response that I have
ever received in my 27 years of direct marketing,'' Globe vice
president George Burke testified. The company paid Lyons $400,000
for the list, then another $600,000 for a second list that did not
work well either, company executives testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons also took nearly $250,000 from the Anti-Defamation League,
saying the money would go to rebuild black churches that were being
burned down across the South in a rash of hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Jewish group testified that Lyons claimed six
churches received $35,000 each. In fact, prosecutors produced
evidence showing Lyons gave less than $40,000 to burned churches,
while depositing $60,000 in a personal savings account, spending
part of the money on two alleged love interests, as well as to
redecorate his home and pay off credit card debts.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the key to the case, Pinellas County State
Attorney's investigator David Kurash testified that Lyons routinely
took checks from the corporations made out to the National Baptist
Convention and deposited them in a secret bank account which he
guarded carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``That money belongs to the corporation, in this case, the
National Baptist Convention,'' Kurash told jurors. ``The president
of the organization has no more right to dig in and take possession
of the funds for his own personal use than the janitor does.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons' alleged misdeeds came to light in 1997 when his wife set
fire to a $700,000 waterfront home Lyons had purchased with
Edwards. Deborah Lyons told police she suspected her husband was
having an affair, but later changed her story and has since stood
by him.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons faces up to 30 years in prison, and also must stand trial
on federal charges later this spring. His attorneys would not say
whether he will testify before the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be decided toward the end of the defense's case,''
attorney Denis de Vlaming said.

   Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush flew to Jordan with
Bill Clinton. But the plane, in their honor, wasn't renamed Air
Force Once.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says King Hussein ``made us all a little better.''
The same could be said of him _ if you change the first vowel in
better to an i.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't having not only Bill Clinton, but also Ford, Carter and
Bush attend the Hussein funeral setting a president precedent?
</P>
<P>
   Leaders from around the world attended the Hussein funeral. It's
important for them to go, if only to make sure someone shows up at
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect King Hussein's son Abdullah to continue his
policies. At least until he's overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   The new king of Jordan is 37 years old. If he hasn't already had
his midlife crisis, he may have to wait now until the next monarch
takes over.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Hussein,'' says Mr. Clinton, ``lived his life on a higher
plain.'' And often on a higher plane.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Mr. Clinton's consistency in the Monica Lewinsky
matter. When he was first in trouble he went to Vernon Jordan. Now
near the end of that trouble, he went to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   There's talk of a GOP filibuster against a Senate motion to
censure the president. If this sounds confusing, maybe you've paid
too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   The only impeachment mystery left is whether even a majority of
senators will vote to convict Mr. Clinton. Well, that and what
Chief Justice Rehnquist will do with his afternoons.

   &UR; GEEZERS ON THE GO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;  &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While you were napping, the United Nations declared 1999 the
International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who is hurtling toward Older Person status at the
speed one normally associates with rogue asteroids, this
declaration does not come a moment too soon. If the United Nations
had waited much longer, I might have whizzed right past Older
Person status and gone directly to Gibbering Geezer or, worse yet,
Lawn Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota, of course, is absolutely lousy with Older Persons to
the point that you can hardly throw an empty Metamucil bottle out
your car window without smacking one in the head. (Lame joke: If
you want to start a stampede in a Sarasota movie house, you don't
yell ``Fire!'' You yell ``Viagra!'')
</P>
<P>
   Older Persons, at least of the Sarasota variety, are quite
active and engaged and much too busy to give the United Nations a
day of their time, much less a year. If your idea of an alert Older
Person is someone who can rock and drool at the same time, you need
to get a load of the old folks from Sarasota. They run marathons,
play championship golf and tennis, write novels, play in jazz
bands, go to college and just generally make us younger folk feel
like soggy Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   I used to look forward to being an Older Person, but now I'm not
sure if I have the stamina. As someone who gets dizzy bending over
to pick up the morning newspaper, it's hard to imagine turning 65
and suddenly feeling the urge to skydive, water-ski or scuba-dive.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement, Sarasota-style, is a lot more than wandering around
in your bathrobe mumbling to yourself; it's a full-time job that
requires energy and commitment. The situation is only going to get
worse once the United Nations' message of empowered
senior-citizenship gets around.
</P>
<P>
   The way I look at it, there is already too much pressure on

Somewhere along the line the definition of retirement changed from
``to stop doing'' to ``to start doing'' and the whole idea of

</P>
<P>
   The old notion of retirement as ``long days of nothing special
interrupted by frequent naps'' has no relevance in today's society.
Retirees often find themselves working harder for longer hours
(and, of course, lower pay) than they did when they held the
stressful, full-time jobs they were so anxious to quit.
</P>

   It's nice to think of retirement as a time when the most

fresh cup of tea, but the reality is far less relaxed. In Sarasota,
many Older Persons fill their time doing volunteer work, performing

 &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;  &QC;  &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While you were napping, the United Nations declared 1999 the
International Year of Older Persons.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who is hurtling toward Older Person status at the
speed one normally associates with rogue asteroids, this
declaration does not come a moment too soon. If the United Nations
had waited much longer, I might have whizzed right past Older
Person status and gone directly to Gibbering Geezer or, worse yet,
Lawn Bowler.
</P>
<P>
   Sarasota, of course, is absolutely lousy with Older Persons to
the point that you can hardly throw an empty Metamucil bottle out
your car window without smacking one in the head. (Lame joke: If
you want to start a stampede in a Sarasota movie house, you don't
yell ``Fire!'' You yell ``Viagra!'')
</P>
<P>
   Older Persons, at least of the Sarasota variety, are quite
active and engaged and much too busy to give the United Nations a
day of their time, much less a year. If your idea of an alert Older
Person is someone who can rock and drool at the same time, you need
to get a load of the old folks from Sarasota. They run marathons,
play championship golf and tennis, write novels, play in jazz
bands, go to college and just generally make us younger folk feel
like soggy Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   I used to look forward to being an Older Person, but now I'm not
sure if I have the stamina. As someone who gets dizzy bending over
to pick up the morning newspaper, it's hard to imagine turning 65
and suddenly feeling the urge to skydive, water-ski or scuba-dive.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement, Sarasota-style, is a lot more than wandering around
in your bathrobe mumbling to yourself; it's a full-time job that
requires energy and commitment. The situation is only going to get
worse once the United Nations' message of empowered
senior-citizenship gets around.
</P>
<P>
   The way I look at it, there is already too much pressure on
Older Persons without the United Nations getting into the act. The
first question that's asked of a person approaching his or her 65th
birthday is, ``What are you going to do when you retire?''
Somewhere along the line the definition of retirement changed from
``to stop doing'' to ``to start doing'' and the whole idea of
retirement has been a lot less attractive ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The old notion of retirement as ``long days of nothing special
interrupted by frequent naps'' has no relevance in today's society.
Retirees often find themselves working harder for longer hours
(and, of course, lower pay) than they did when they held the
stressful, full-time jobs they were so anxious to quit.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to think of retirement as a time when the most
strenuous thing you have to do is scuff out to the kitchen for a
fresh cup of tea, but the reality is far less relaxed. In Sarasota,
many Older Persons fill their time doing volunteer work, performing
in community theater, becoming active in local politics or
otherwise flitting about in a decidedly un-old-fogeyish way. While
I have no quarrel with Older Persons who wish to remain active to
the point of carrying their own coffins, I don't think there should
be a stigma attached to Older Persons who prefer that their
retirement years proceed at a more leisurely pace.
</P>
<P>
   Although the folks at the United Nations may think otherwise,
there is nothing wrong with an Older Person going through an entire
day without doing anything that promotes his or her physical or
mental well-being or results in the betterment of mankind. If all
you managed to do in the last 24 hours was feed yourself and hit
the mute button when the Jerry Springer show came on, you should
not feel that you squandered your time.
</P>
<P>
   Life, after all, can be very pleasurable if you don't let your
retirement get in the way.

ISRAELIS HOTLY DEBATE PRESIDENT'S HANDSHAKE WITH PALESTINIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli delegation to the funeral of King
Hussein theoretically united political foes in mourning, but
nicey-nice only lasts so long among Israeli politicians. By the
time darkness fell over the king's fresh grave Monday, they were
warring over their comportment among the Arab officials at the
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, there was a battle over a handshake. In a country
where men grant or withdraw handshakes as a matter of high
principle, the reverberations extended through Tuesday, when the
handshake was the top of the news and the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in Amman on Monday. Israeli President Ezer Weizman
shook the hand of Nayef Hawatmeh, the Syria-based leader of a
radical Palestinian faction, greeted him in Arabic and broached his
own interest in making peace with Syria and Lebanon. Whether
Weizman or Hawatmeh initiated the handshake was a matter of fierce
contention on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Following the event, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who makes a public point of
refusing to shake the hand of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
denounced the president's handshake with a man they regard as an
inveterate terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should talk to those who want us on earth rather
than buried beneath it,'' said Netanyahu, scornfully, on Israeli
radio.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the public debate over the handshake revealed
profoundly different attitudes toward peacemaking among those who
may seem to agree on paper. It also pointed up a potential for
absurdity in Israeli political machismo.
</P>
<P>
   The choreography of the moment, who approached whom and whose
hand was extended at what angle, was sketched and resketched by the
Israeli media throughout the day. Hawatmeh himself, whose
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine opposes the peace
effort, joined in, making an extraordinary appearance on Israeli
radio.
</P>
<P>
   With great crustiness, Weizman pounced back, declaring all the
objections ludicrous in an era of peacemaking. After all, he said,
Arafat, whom the Israelis once considered the arch-enemy, is now
supposedly their partner in a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was Arafat, an angel?'' he asked. ``A dove of peace? He
murdered and did all sorts of things. Yet he reached a point where
he decided that for the good of people he needed to make peace.
Yitzhak Rabin shook his hand. And Prime Minister Netanyahu shakes
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for shaking the hand of every person who is willing to
shake my hand,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   After Netanyahu signed a peace agreement in Washington in
October, analysts proclaimed the differences between Netanyahu's
Likud Party and the Labor Party to have shrunk; both camps of
Israeli politics now supported the peace effort, it was said.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu continued to be hostile to Arafat, and the
progress in carrying out the agreement was frozen, with accusations
that the Palestinians were not complying with their obligations. A
clear difference of tone emerged between the prime minister and his
opponents, who seem far less suspicious of the Palestinians and
more comfortable in developing relationships with them.
</P>
<P>
   As Weizman's remarks made clear, the handshake brought these
differences into sharp focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, Hawatmeh murdered, but he was willing to extend to me a
hand and to speak with me,'' said the president, a longtime
advocate of dialogue with Arab nations. ``It is not a pleasure to
speak with him, but through him it is possible to arrive at all
kinds of things.''
</P>
<P>
   His encounter with Hawatmeh occurred in the Palace chambers,
where world leaders were waiting to express their condolences to
the royal family of Jordan. An aide to Weizman, Ahmed Tibi, says
that an Israeli-Arab aide to Arafat approached the president to
introduce Hawatmeh, and the Palestinian put out his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hawatmeh said Weizman made the advances and extended his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said he noticed Hawatmeh and instantly recognized him
from the days when Netanyahu served in an army unit that fought
against Hawatmeh's men. ``They wanted to murder Jews then, and
today he remains committed to the murder of Jews,'' he said. ``With
such a person I don't shake hands.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, though, Weizman had no second thoughts. ``On the
day after the extraordinary shock, I'm completely at peace with
myself,'' he said. He then alluded to Vladimir Jabotinsky, who led
the revisionist Zionist movement that was a precursor of
Netanyahu's Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just read what Jabotinsky wrote many years ago, when he said
that he's ready to meet Satan if it will help the Jewish people,''
the president said.

EX-MORTICIAN WHO STUFFED WIDOW'S BODY IN FREEZER FOUND GUILTY

<P>
   SAN AUGUSTINE, Texas _ Jurors in the Bernie Tiede murder trial
deliberated one hour Tuesday before finding the one-time Carthage
mortician guilty of murdering his best friend, 81-year-old
millionaire widow Marjorie Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   Although he openly wept during final arguments Tuesday morning,
Tiede, 40, appeared emotionless as the verdict was read. The
trial's punishment phase, which could result in Tiede being sent to
prison for 99 years, will begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to put him in the freezer for nine months,'' Panola
County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson said after the verdict
was returned. ``That would give us time to decide what to do with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiede had been accused of shooting Nugent in the back four times
with a .22-caliber rifle Nov. 19, 1996, then hiding her body in a
chest freezer. The body, wrapped in a bloody sheet, remained in the
freezer beneath frozen vegetables nine months until her out-of-town
relatives grew suspicious and authorized police to search her home.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Clifton ``Scrappy'' Holmes rested his case
Tuesday morning without calling a single witness. Placing his
client on the stand, he said, would have been ``redundant'' as
Tiede had signed a confession and two of his friends had testified
that he detailed the killing to them.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Nugent of Dallas and Shanna Nugent of Houston,
granddaughters of the victim, told reporters they were pleased with
the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot hinging on the punishment phase,'' Shanna Nugent
said. ``We hope he gets 99 years. We know they will try to pull the
focus away from Bernie, though, and place it on our grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Nugent said the family would be ``very disappointed'' if
jurors grant Tiede probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should let everyone kill one person and then get
probation,'' Davidson derisively observed. ``I'm just trying to
figure out how to be the killer and not the killed. Obviously, I
don't think probation is appropriate for a crime this horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said he ``likely'' will allow Tiede to testify on his own
behalf during the punishment phase.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing arguments earlier in the day, Holmes, who had
admitted in opening arguments that his client had killed Nugent,
warned jurors of prosecution attempts to ``stampede'' them into
emotional decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, last year, Nov. 19, every waking minute, second,
(Tiede) has known his responsibility for Marjorie Nugent's death,''
he said. ``Bernie Tiede has known every day what your sure verdict
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes then reviewed key testimony with the jurors, suggesting
that witness after witness had been called by prosecutors just to
buttress the state's case with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution witnesses, he contended, were jealous of Tiede, who
had become a pivotal figure in Nugent's life as business manager
and traveling companion after the 1990 death of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes attacked, too, Tiede's written confession, suggesting
that armed police officers indirectly coerced the suspect, then
overtly ignored his request for a lawyer before continuing with the
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason (prosecutors presented inflammatory testimony) was
that it makes you feel that Bernie is a monster,'' Holmes charged.
``A monster. Through and through an evil person and not a human
being. One witness said Bernie was `an angel' with kids. You can't
fight that. So what do they do? Bring on the innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to picture us using a technicality to slip things
through, slip Bernie Tiede out the door. I stood up in opening
statements and said Bernie killed her.''
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict, Davidson laughingly noted that ``Scrappy
already began his punishment phase speech in his final arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his closing remarks, Davidson agreed that Tiede's confession
wasn't in itself sufficient grounds for a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be corroborated with evidence,'' he said. ``You have
to have more evidence than just his attorney's admission of his
guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking up the murder weapon, a Browning rifle, Davidson said:
``This is it. This is our most important evidence. With this he
shot her in the back. Shot her more than once. . .
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he have to do? Number 1, he had to load. Two, he had
to put a bullet in the chamber. Three, he had to take it off
safety. Four, he had to point it. Five, he had to _ not pull _ but
exert three or four pounds of pressure on the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who did that? The defendant.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we know? He confessed in a statement.''

 &HT;    Supermarkets 'neglecting customers,' critic says
 &HT;    By Patti Bond

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't grocers get it?
</P>
<P>
   Consumers don't have the time or energy to pore through 27,000
products and compare prices. Or wait in line 15 minutes in the
``express'' lane. And why are milk and eggs in the back of the
store?
</P>
<P>
   ``The (supermarket) industry is too busy squeezing out money in
distribution expenses'' and as a result is neglecting customers,
said Phil Lempert, food correspondent for NBC's Today Show and
renowned supermarket critic. Lempert's remarks came Tuesday during
a Food Marketing Institute convention at Atlanta's Hyatt Regency.
</P>
<P>
   A pep talk it wasn't. From takeouts to checkouts, Lempert's
grocery list is long on complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Take prepared meals, for example. Today's frazzled workforce is
eating out more and cooking less. And supermarkets have responded
with an explosion of takeouts, but they've got a lot to learn about
fast food, Lempert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge opportunity, but it goes beyond putting
whatever you want in a black plastic plate,'' Lempert told a group
of a hundred or so retailers, food manufacturers and distributors.
``And for the supermarkets that put takeouts in the back of the
store by the meat case, shame on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers want convenience items near the front of the store,
and better yet, brought to their doorsteps. Savvy food retailers
that offer home delivery could win the fight for the consumer's
stomach. In metro Atlanta, it could be a big seller for Eatzi's and
Harry's Farmers Market, for example. Both heavily rely on gourmet
food-to-go in a market-like setting. ``They need to go more toward
the home delivery model if they're going to expand and succeed,''
Lempert said.
</P>
<P>
   Roswell, Ga.-based Harry's has earned national kudos for its
concept, but Lempert is a tough sell. ``Harry's is good, but not
great,'' he said. ``The concrete floors have got to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Harris Teeter at Toco Hills bombed with Lempert, too.
``It's a beautiful store, but you don't put a second floor on a
supermarket,'' he said. ``A second floor is not easy and
convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate meeting, grocers got some good news from Emory
University's Jagdish Sheth, a marketing professor. Some of the
highest profit products are wildly popular with consumers. Look for
more over-the-counter drugs, cosmetics, fresh flowers and greeting
cards.
</P>
<P>
   And we've only seen the beginning of non-food outlets like
cellular phone kiosks in grocery stores, Sheth said. With the
rising popularity of health-care products, large supermarkets will
likely open their doors to optical shops and eyeglass stores, he
said.

 &HT;    A better way to shop via the internet
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Nova Information Systems and Savannah,
Ga.-based Go Software have developed a technology aimed at making
financial transactions on the Internet quicker, cheaper and more
secure.
</P>
<P>
   Developers say the technology can help unleash the Net's
enormous potential, which has been hampered somewhat by a lack of
confidence in the security of doing business over the worldwide
computer network.
</P>
<P>
   The companies say their solution can be used by Windows-based
personal computers, is cheaper than alternatives and is encrypted
effectively enough to make it secure. It would allow a merchant to
check credit with Nova without using a separate phone line, the way
it is done now.
</P>
<P>
   Nova handles payment and other business information for
retailers, banks and financial institutions. The company in the
last four quarters had revenues of more than $700 million but
clearly sees dramatic growth potential on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 3 percent of Nova's new customers are Web merchants,
``but I think that is going to accelerate,'' said Cato Carpenter,
analyst with BT Alex Brown. ``It's not easy to assess it though.
There are 10 million merchants. Who knows how fast they will switch
over to Nova?''
</P>
<P>
   In the day after Monday's announcement, shares of Nova were
traded more heavily than usual, but rose only slightly, closing up
93.75 cents at $30.25. Go Software is privately held.
</P>
<P>
   The process developed by the companies can happen in ``real
time'' over the Net, eliminating the need for a merchant to use a
separate phone line to check the credit of the buyer with Nova.
That cuts processing times from more than 15 seconds to less than 5
seconds, according to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made real-time transaction processing over the
Internet a reality for our merchants,'' said Pamela Joseph, Nova's
chief information officer.

`MY PILGRIM'S PROGRESS': DOWNHILL FROM HONOR TO DERISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first thing to note about George W.S. Trow's new book is
that, as with his best-known previous work, the cult classic
``Within the Context of No Context,'' there is something
interesting on every page and something brilliant on many of them.
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Pilgrim's Progress,'' Trow, who was a staff writer at
The New Yorker for almost 30 years, continues his jazzy,
epigrammatic love-hate relationship with the contemporary culture.
</P>
<P>
   The main idea, largely developed by Trow's examination of
``Mainstream American Cultural Artifacts,'' is that the protective
solidity of the American culture that existed at midcentury has
vanished, even if we do not realize just how complete the
disappearance was.
</P>
<P>
   He meanders through the cultural and political landscape, making
penetrating, knowledgeable and entertaining observations and
evoking a stark cleavage in the culture that began forming around
his chosen base-line date of 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Trow uses many ways to describe what came after the cleavage:
``our national culture of irony and anger,'' the esthetic dominance
of an ``unreal, speeded-up violence,'' ``a desperate, dissolving
situation,'' a rock-and-roll culture whose triumph over the old
esthetic was so complete that ``it obliterated any real sense of
the context to which it was juxtaposed.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, you get the picture: what's happened is not good,
though it is very interesting. It can be observed in numerous
``Mainstream American Cultural Artifacts.'' And it has something to
do with television, that new thing that lurked almost invisibly in
the shadows of 1950 and grew into a victorious monster.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Trow's analysis is crystal clear. Some of it is
downright obscure. This comes in part from the very richness of his
cultural references and the dizzying way in which his mind leaps
through associations. It is also a product of Trow's Beat-inspired,
cool, complicity-laden writing style. (``The other day I had a
thought, and then after I had the thought, I thought, `Well, this
can't possibly be true.'')
</P>
<P>
   Trow's manner of expression is in its way as much a ``Mainstream
American Cultural Artifact'' as the movies, books and musical
productions that he analyzes so acutely. It, too, marks a cultural
cleavage, between the studied informality of the second half of the
century and the formal discourse of the rest of literary history.
</P>
<P>
   ``So let's rock and roll with this,'' Trow writes as he makes a
transition from one point to another. ``Not quite free-associate;
my mind doesn't work that way. I just trust the circularity of it.
Let's start anyway: The Beatles, 1965.''
</P>
<P>
   The transition that Trow is making at that point is between the
demise of the Churchillian esthetic of the 1950s, Churchill being
the dominant figure of the century up to that point, and the
appearance of ``Dionysian avatars'' like the Beatles' tragic hero,
John Lennon.
</P>
<P>
   As always the argument is rich and suggestive, like many others
in this book. Indeed, the temptation in reviewing ``My Pilgrim's
Progress'' is to list a few of Trow's many interesting points. For
example, he attributes the increase in violence in the movies to an
underlying and ever increasing commercial need for what he calls a
``hyperactive quality'' that is most easily satisfied in violence
and car chases. He then adds a brief history of movie car chases,
beginning with Steve McQueen's in ``Bullitt'' (1968).
</P>
<P>
   Or there is his wonderfully despairing vision of television
production in which a straight line can be drawn from ``Howdy
Doody'' (the ``sub-basement of a Shirley Temple movie'') and the
``awareness-of-evil-and-cynicism business of `The Simpsons.''' Not
only are Howdy Doody and the Simpsons linked in this linear history
of television, but the qualities that link them are juxtaposed with
other cultural products, specifically the David Letterman show,
whose stock in trade is irony. (Trow calls it irony, though
derision might be a better word.)
</P>
<P>
   But there is a deeper, connecting point here as well, one worth
bearing in mind. If derision (or irony) is a sensibility of the
age, where does it come from? Trow finds its origins in the very
cultural disjunction that is his main subject. We have, he writes,
repudiated ``the Old World of masculine honor'' that was itself
linked to a hard core of struggle. We live at a time, he observes,
when there have never been more people on earth and less
starvation. Pampered as we are, unacquainted with a ``moment of
true physical exhaustion after a day of work in the mines,'' we
``were going to have to grow up to be entirely ironic in our
visceral reactions to our own manhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Trow studies the career of Faye Emerson, the subject
of a lengthy profile in The New York Times of 1950, a time whose
headlines were about the national coal strike, Churchill's memoirs
of World War II and the hydrogen bomb. Faye Emerson enters the
picture as ``our first personality known for being a personality.''
She represents in this sense the disjunction between the old world
of 1950, grounded in the bitter fights against the Nazis and the
Depression, and the lightweight world of television in which
neither historical nor cultural contexts exist. Trow's comment on
this is a marvel of sardonic clarity:
</P>
<P>
   ``My overview of the civilization as presented in The New York
Times of Feb. 1, 1950,'' he writes, ``is that in World War II, the
Germans lost, and Faye Emerson won.''
</P>
<P>
   As he slices transgressively through the decades, Trow gives
himself away. He is an old-fashioned curmudgeon who writes with
hip, new-fashioned flair. His tour of the media and the politics of
the last half century is solidly grounded in a moral tradition that
we are in danger of losing, which is reason enough for lingering
and contemplating this original, provocative and possibly prophetic
book.

JAPANESE CHARGE MAN IN SALE OF ENGINEERING DEVICES TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A former executive of a precision-instrument
manufacturer has been arrested in Japan for allegedly flouting laws
prohibiting the sale to communist countries of certain types of
equipment that could be used to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Isao Sasaki, who retired last year as senior managing director
at Ryokosha KK, an affiliate of the electronics giant Hitachi Ltd.,
was arrested on Saturday and charged with responsibility for
selling telecomparators to China by way of South Korea.
Telecomparators, measuring devices that are accurate to less than
two-thousandths of a millimeter, are used in precision engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The company also sent employees to install equipment and train
workers at a plant in Harbin, China, in 1997 without obtaining
approvals required from the International Trade and Industry
Ministry. That agency administers the foreign exchange and foreign
trade law, which governs the export of tools and machinery that
could be used to make nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese press is reporting that police are pursuing similar
charges against Hitachi Electronics Ltd., another Hitachi affiliate
that made the instruments using Ryokosha's designs.
</P>
<P>
   Teruhito Koizumi, a Ryokosha spokesman, said the company had
known that machines it sold to a South Korean agent were destined
to be incorporated into a larger project that was headed for China.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the agent, whom Ryokosha has declined to identify,
assured Ryokosha that he would make the appropriate applications
for permission to export the telecomparators on to China. Japan has
far less restriction on exports to South Korea than to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake regarding export procedures,'' Koizumi said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Ryokosha spokesman, Kazushige Kamiyama, said the company
had realized its mistake and tried to get the South Korean agent to
give it time to make the appropriate requests for permission to
export the machines, but that ``he did not accept our requests and
explanations.''
</P>
<P>
   Kamiyama said the company had sent personnel to give only the
most basic instruction on the equipment, thinking that such minimal
level of disclosure fell outside the parameters established under
the law. He said the company now realized that its interpretation
of the law was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi Electronics could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The case brought back memories of a similar matter in the 1980s,
when Toshiba Machine Co., an affiliate of another electronics
giant, Toshiba Corp., was penalized by the United States for
selling equipment to Russia that helped it silence the propellers
on its submarines.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Toshiba Machine was barred for three years from
exporting to the United States, and Toshiba was banned for one year
from bidding on American government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Japan Aviation Electronics Industry, a company
controlled by yet another Japanese electronics titan, NEC Corp.,
paid the United States $10 million to settle a case alleging that
the company had sold navigational equipment for fighter planes to
Iran without authorization.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Japan are party to multilateral agreements
on export controls for potentially sensitive equipment. There was
no indication Tuesday that American officials intended to act
against any of the companies involved in the latest instance in
which a Japanese company's technology ended up in the wrong hands.

 &HT;    FEDS ASSAIL MICROSOFT'S BROWSER DISTRIBUTION POLICY
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Suppose,'' said the Microsoft Corp. sales
executive, ``you ran a cosmetics company and you had a new shampoo
called 'Slime.' Somehow, you were able to hang a sample on the
doorknob of every home in America. But people didn't like your
shampoo. Then that great distribution system wouldn't have done you
any good.''
</P>
<P>
   In offering this example, Microsoft's Cameron Myhrvold sought
Tuesday to make a vital point in defending the beleaguered software
giant at its marathon antitrust trial in federal court. As he put
it: ``In the business world, distribution is a necessary but not
sufficient condition of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold, the Microsoft vice president in charge of relations
with public network vendors, was being grilled on the witness stand
about Microsoft's deals with such vendors as America Online Inc.,
which require the vendors to load the dice heavily in favor of
Microsoft when shipping Web browsers to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about that policy,'' Myhrvold told David
Boies, the government's lead lawyer, after Boies showed him his
1996 e-mail quoting a company rule that vendors who signed up for
``eye-ball'' exposure on the Windows desktop were limited to a 15
percent quota when shipping Navigator, the rival browser produced
by Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold said it was ``absolutely untrue'' that first-time
Internet users who reached Microsoft's vendor distribution site,
known as a ``referral server,'' would be dealing with Internet
service providers bound by the 85-15 percent Microsoft/Netscape
distribution rule.
</P>
<P>
   When Boies noted that AOL had signed just such a contract with
Microsoft, Myhrvold replied that another executive, Brad Chase, was
in charge of that arrangement. As the seventh of a dozen Microsoft
defense witnesses, Chase is due to follow Myhrvold to the witness
stand later this week.
</P>
<P>
   It was not at all clear that the judge, who is trying the case
without a jury, bought Myhrvold's shampoo analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name (Slime) couldn't have helped,'' U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told the witness.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also appeared unimpressed by Microsoft video that
purportedly showed that it takes a personal computer four times as
long to connect to the Internet with Windows 3.1 as it does with
Window 98, which, much to the government's discomfort, has a
browser built into the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   When queried by Boies, Myhrvold, who had supervised the
demonstration, said he wasn't sure whether the modems in both
demonstrations were comparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be happy to check,'' Myhrvold said. ``It would make me
feel better, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Microsoft official Tod Nielsen called
Microsoft Redmond, Wash., headquarters on his cell phone. He was
told that the Windows 98 computer did in fact have a faster modem
than the Windows 3.1 computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in speed between the two modems is academic,''
said Microsoft counsel William Neukom on the courthouse steps. A
Microsoft spokesman said using the same modem would have knocked 22
seconds off the test.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's credibility issues aside, it appears as if the
trial, now in its 15th week, will halt for a four- to six-week
recess, beginning in early March. Originally, the case was expected
to take six to eight weeks to complete.
</P>
<P>
   In a bench meeting with lawyers, Jackson said he will call the
long break to allow John Warden, Microsoft's lead attorney, to
retain his vacation plans and to allow Boies to attend another
previously scheduled trial, expected to last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told the lawyers not to talk about the delay with
reporters. According to a transcript of the informal meeting,
Jackson said: ``Simply tell them that you have no comment about it
because I have not made any definitive determination yet, other
than the fact that you'll get your vacation. And Mr. Boies will get
to Philadelphia (for his trial) by March 15.''

``eye-ball'' exposure on the Windows desktop were limited to a 15
percent quota when shipping Navigator, the rival browser produced
by Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold said it was ``absolutely untrue'' that first-time
Internet users who reached Microsoft's vendor distribution site,
known as a ``referral server,'' would be dealing with Internet
service providers bound by the 85-15 percent Microsoft/Netscape
distribution rule.
</P>
<P>
   When Boies noted that AOL had signed just such a contract with
Microsoft, Myhrvold replied that another executive, Brad Chase, was
in charge of that arrangement. As the seventh of a dozen Microsoft
defense witnesses, Chase is due to follow Myhrvold to the witness
stand later this week.
</P>
<P>
   It was not at all clear that the judge, who is trying the case
without a jury, bought Myhrvold's shampoo analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name (Slime) couldn't have helped,'' U.S. District Court
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told the witness.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also appeared unimpressed by Microsoft video that
purportedly showed that it takes a personal computer four times as
long to connect to the Internet with Windows 3.1 as it does with
Window 98, which, much to the government's discomfort, has a
browser built into the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   When queried by Boies, Myhrvold, who had supervised the
demonstration, said he wasn't sure whether the modems in both
demonstrations were comparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be happy to check,'' Myhrvold said. ``It would make me
feel better, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Microsoft official Tod Nielsen called
Microsoft Redmond, Wash., headquarters on his cell phone. He was
told that the Windows 98 computer did in fact have a faster modem
than the Windows 3.1 computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in speed between the two modems is academic,''
said Microsoft counsel William Neukom on the courthouse steps. A
Microsoft spokesman said using the same modem would have knocked 22
seconds off the test.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's credibility issues aside, it appears as if the
trial, now in its 15th week, will halt for a four- to six-week
recess, beginning in early March. Originally, the case was expected
to take six to eight weeks to complete.
</P>
<P>
   In a bench meeting with lawyers, Jackson said he will call the
long break to allow John Warden, Microsoft's lead attorney, to
retain his vacation plans and to allow Boies to attend another
previously scheduled trial, expected to last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson told the lawyers not to talk about the delay with
reporters. According to a transcript of the informal meeting,
Jackson said: ``Simply tell them that you have no comment about it
because I have not made any definitive determination yet, other
than the fact that you'll get your vacation. And Mr. Boies will get
to Philadelphia (for his trial) by March 15.''

TEXAS FUNERAL BOARD FIRES DIRECTOR 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Funeral Service Commission has fired
an executive director who tried to investigate possible political
links between Gov. George W. Bush and Service Corporation
International of Houston, the nation's largest funeral home chain.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for fired director Eliza May said the investigation she
had run last spring played a major role in her dismissal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Derek Howard of Austin said May plans to file a
whistleblower lawsuit against the agency. He also said political
pressure was brought to bear to halt May's investigation of SCI.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was getting pressured by certain politicians, including
Gov. Bush, to limit the investigation of SCI,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's acting Executive Director David Richards said
May's dismissal had nothing to do with the investigation of SCI or
May's use of a state employee to go through Bush's campaign files.
</P>
<P>
   Richards said the commission lost confidence in May after a
former employee filed a grievance against her in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (commission members) determined she had lost their
confidence and trust to lead the agency,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Richards declined to say what was included in the former
employee's grievance, other than the fact that he was the person
sent to investigate Bush's political files. Richards said no
campaign contributions from SCI or its officers to Bush were found.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's investigation of SCI ``had absolutely nothing'' to
do with May's firing, Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the governor's office had
nothing to do with May's dismissal, and SCI spokesman Bill Miller
called her allegations ``preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency recommended a $450,000 fine against SCI last year for
embalming bodies in unlicensed locations and allowing unsupervised
apprentices to embalm bodies. The company has appealed that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Richards said May came to believe SCI was exerting undo
influence on the agency after a meeting was held with her and SCI
officials at the governor's office last April. He said that meeting
did not go as well as May wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Richards said after the grievance was filed against May, she
offered to resign. But he said she made some demands that were not
acceptable to the board, which unanimously voted to fire her.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said board Chairman Dick McNeil of Fort Worth had
authorized May's investigation of SCI's political contributions.
Richards said McNeil denies that allegation.
</P>
<P>
   May's lawyer said May was fired because she was trying to
uncover conflicts of interests between having funeral home
directors run the commission while investigating their own
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to drive a stake through the heart of this
agency,'' Howard said. ``It's a joke.''

<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Here on the streets of Virginia's capital,
Melvin Douglas Smith was known for his luck as much as his
troublemaking. For all the charges brought against him in state
courts over a decade, from larceny and resisting arrest to illegal
firearms and murder, none stuck. He never served a day in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Then Smith's luck ran out. When a patrol officer pulled him over
for a traffic violation in 1997, the officer looked in the car and
found 12 grams of crack cocaine, a 12-gauge shotgun and a
9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. The combination of guns and
drugs was his undoing: Under a new program aimed at gun offenders
called Project Exile, prosecutors were able to charge Smith in the
tougher federal system. He is now serving 16 and a half years in a
federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   As cities across the country sue the gun industry or buy back
handguns as last resorts to get them off the streets, Project Exile
is being credited for helping reverse a decade of rising crime
rates in Richmond by moving gun offenses into the federal system,
where bond is less available, sentences are longer and convicts are
sent out of state to serve their terms.
</P>
<P>
   Project Exile has not only helped to reduce crime in Richmond,
but it has also brought together officials from other cities and
the National Rifle Association in an expanding experiment to see
whether violent crime can be reduced by aggressively enforcing laws
already on the books, rather than fighting over new laws.
</P>
<P>
   While the Justice Department, long an adversary of the rifle
association over gun control, has held back from recommending
Project Exile as a cure-all, and a panel of federal judges in
Richmond has criticized it as a federal intrusion into state
matters, Philadelphia and Rochester, N.Y., have adopted versions of
the program, and more than a dozen other cities are considering it.
</P>
<P>
   While homicide rates have dropped across the country for a
variety of reasons, the authorities in Richmond contend that
Project Exile helped cut their rate of homicides by firearms by 36
percent last year, to 78 homicides from 122 in 1997, one of the
steepest declines in any city.
</P>
<P>
   The program has also helped the authorities solve older cases.
Once Smith was sentenced, for example, witnesses no longer afraid
of him came forward with enough information to charge him with six
murders, including two that could bring the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Richmond, there has been an intense need for people to
become believers in their own community,'' Mayor Timothy M. Kaine
said. ``High crime has been our psychological downer. But Project
Exile is driving the crime rate down, and that is starting to make
Richmonders believers again.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after federal efforts to fight illegal drug
activities, the program evolved from a determination to prosecute
gun charges in federal courts, where the stakes are higher for
defendants than in state courts, even though federal courts
generally regard gun violations as low-level crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Many gun offenses become federal as well as state crimes when
they are coupled with other offenses like drug possession or when
the person arrested is a convicted felon, an illegal alien, a
mental patient, a drug addict, a fugitive, the subject of a
criminal indictment or a person convicted of misdemeanor domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   As a key element of Project Exile, a coalition of business and
civic leaders has cooperated with the police by saturating the area
with radio and television messages, billboards and posters, warning
that anyone caught with an illegal weapon faces a jail term of five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Project Exile is so well known on the street, said David E.
Boone, a criminal defense lawyer here, that ``the first thing I
hear now when I talk to a client is, `Can you keep this from going
Exile?' A lot of them can't add two and two, but they know a gun
plus drugs equals five.''
</P>
<P>
   Some do, anyway. S. David Schiller, an assistant U.S. attorney
here who conceived the program, said the first two years of Project
Exile have led to the recovery of 475 illegal guns, indictments
against 404 people on gun charges, a conviction rate of 86 percent
through trials and plea bargains, and an average prison term of
more than four and a half years.
</P>
<P>
   And Richmond police officers say the program is convincing some
would-be criminals to leave their weapons at home. ``We're now
finding more guns in houses than on the street,'' said Michael J.
Shamus, an acting lieutenant on the police department's Rapid
Mobilization Team. ``The streets are safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everyone is convinced that Project Exile is the
appropriate means to attack the gun problem. In a recent court
ruling, all three judges of the federal District Court here
criticized the program as ``a substantial federal incursion into a
sovereign state's area of authority and responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Justice Department has remained reluctant to promote it
as a national solution to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said recently that
department officials ``take issue with the notion that there is a
cookie-cutter approach to reducing gun violence'' and added,
``Exile worked in Richmond and can work in other places, but you
have to look at the local situation, the situation in every city,
to decide exactly what will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder also said the department had sent additional federal
marshals, agents and prosecutors ``to make Exile a successful
program.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schiller conceded that more federal agents had been sent to
Richmond. But he insisted that the only federal participants
dedicated to Project Exile outside of the U.S. Attorney's office
are two agents on loan from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms and one from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the involvement of the NRA, which has opposed federal
gun control laws, has tempered the Justice Department's interest.
The rifle association has contributed $125,000 to Richmond's
efforts and has lobbied Congress to get $2.3 million for programs
in Philadelphia and Camden, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Schiller's boss, Helen F. Fahey, the U.S. attorney for the
Eastern District of Virginia, said, ``I can't answer that as a
fact, but I suspect it is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne R. LaPierre Jr., the association's executive director,
minced no words. ``They consider these nuisance cases, and the last
thing federal judges want are armed felony cases in their courts,''
he said. ``That's shameful. Killing people is wrong, and regardless
of the NRA, it needs to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Mayor Edward G. Rendell led the effort to
establish a Project Exile after a challenge last summer by the NRA
to ``give us one major American city'' to prove that aggressive law
enforcement can make a bigger difference than more laws that
restrict gun ownership. Just two days after the city's version of
Project Exile, called Operation Cease-Fire, was announced, 15
indictments were returned.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, where a program similar to Richmond's was begun in
late September to supplement other new crime-fighting initiatives,
no homicides were reported in November and just two in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that everything is attributable to our Project
Exile _ it's a little early for that,'' said Denise E. O'Donnell,
the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York. ``But we're
very enthusiastic about the program. We are seeing our crime rates
come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officers on Richmond's streets seem thankful for the
help, no matter who provides it. When Jerry A. Oliver was hired as
chief of police in 1994, Richmond had had a decade of increasing
numbers of homicides, peaking that year at 160.
</P>
<P>
   ``We desperately needed a home run, something to celebrate,'' he
said. ``As police chief, I see Project Exile as one of those
programs that is working.''

   PHOENIX - You've gone the roses route.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate is such a staid old standby it has grown stale.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a different kind of Valentine's Day gift,
you might try a little barbershop.
</P>
<P>
   Not as in a haircut. As in a barbershop quartet. You know, four
guys singing a cappella, with harmonies tighter than Pamela
Anderson's sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't remember the smell of the rose or the taste of
the chocolate,'' Jerry Fox, who sings bass in the Lamplighters,
said. ``But they remember the feeling. That's what we deliver, the
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some other chapters, the Lamplighters _ the Mesa, Ariz.,
chapter of the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of
Barbershop Quartet Singing in America Inc. _ are taking orders for
the ``Valentine's Experience.'' Arrange a day and time (Friday,
Saturday, Sunday or Monday), and a quartet will show up and sing
for the object of your affection. (Prices start at $30; call
969-1419 or 832-1678 for details.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had real good experiences,'' Bob Shaffer, the president
of the Lamplighters, said, ``especially if the wife is there.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Serenades of love &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or the husband or boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sang for a gal who worked at the grocery store in the
bakery department,'' Bill Schuldt, who sings lead, recalled. ``We
got her from the back, where she was all covered in flour. We sang
two songs, and she said, `I guess I better marry the guy. He must
love me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Warning: Results this successful are not guaranteed though
Schuldt said most folks end up pretty happy after the serenade.
</P>
<P>
   The favorites are what you might expect, Schuldt said _ ``Heart
of MyHeart,'' ``I Love You Truly,'' ``Let Me Call You Sweetheart,''
``Wild Irish Rose'' and ``Honey Lil' Liza.'' Although th ere was
the woman who requested ``Just a Gigolo'' as a gift to her husband
(they complied).
</P>
<P>
   Along with an annual show, the ``Valentine's Experience'' is one
of the Lamplighter's big events. But its 40 or so members file into
a room tucked into a Mesa Salvation Army complex every Thursday
night to practice, big event or not.
</P>
<P>
   That's where I found them recently. As you might expect, the air
was filled with song. As one man placed folding chairs in a
semicircle, he belted out, ``By the light of the silvery moon . . .
'' Others warmed up their voices before practice began.
</P>
<P>
   Barbershop singing is uniquely American and should be preserved,
Shaffer said. Passing it along to younger people is important
because frankly most of the members of the Lamplighters looked as
if they qualify for a senior-citizen discount. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A love for singing &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the notable exception of Dusty Schleier. He's the
Lamplighter's director _ and he's 19. He easily could pass for the
son or even a grandson of some of the other members. So why was he
there _ when a guy his age should be out smashing guitars in
smoke-choked bars on the indie-rock circuit?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing barbershop my whole life,'' Schleier said from
underneath a baseball cap. ``There's just something interesting
about it, the way it's structured. There's a feeling you get that
you don't get with any other type of music.''
</P>
<P>
   And what feeling is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Just singing four parts, creating
an orchestra effect just with voices.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove the point, three other Lamplighters gathered by
Ed Wycoff, who sings bass. He pulled out his pitch pipe, blew a
note and, appropriately in tune, the quartet started singing ``Wild
Irish Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   It was impromptu, but they sounded great. The sound of people
singing just for the love of it was refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't even Valentine's Day. &QL;

NEW FINDINGS ON SEX SHATTER OLD BELIEFS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite what the magazine covers at the supermarket checkout
line may suggest, it is far from true that everyone is having more,
better, hotter sex than you, according to a new medical study.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of US women women aged 18 to 59, and nearly
a third of men, report some sort of sexual dysfunction such as
lacking interest in or enjoyment of sex, performance anxiety, or
inability to achieve or hold off orgasm, according to a report in
the current Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by University of Chicago researchers, is being
billed as the most comprehensive look at Americans' sex lives since
the Kinsey Report of the late 1940s, which has since been
discredited because of Alfred Kinsey's use of
far-from-representative samples of interview subjects.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more striking findings, according to study leader
Edward O. Laumann, a University of Chicago sociology professor, was
that aside from erectile difficulty in men, the rate of sexual
problems is not closely correlated with age.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, women aged 18 to 39 were slightly more likely than
women in their 40s and 50s to report a lack of interest in sex,
anxiety about performance, pain during intercourse, or an inability
to achieve orgasm. More than 1 in 4 women aged 18 to 29 said they
do not find sex pleasurable.
</P>
<P>
   And across all age brackets, consistently about 30 percent of
men reported problems with premature ejaculation and about 15
percent reported a lack of interest in sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that there is youth and lust and then it all fades
away as you age _ that's just a fantasy,'' Laumann said. ``A lot of
us are facing these problems at an early age. To the 25-year-old
out there . . . it might be somewhat of a relief to discover they
are not alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Study co-author Raymond C. Rosen of the Center for Sexual and
Marital Health at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New
Jersey said that too often people's perceptions of what their sex
lives should be like are shaped by articles in magazines like
Cosmopolitan that suggest everyone else is having great sex all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a scientist, it makes my hair stand on end,'' Rosen said.
``It's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   While the explosive growth in sales of Viagra to treat male
impotence has focused national attention on the physiological
causes of sexual dysfunction, the study suggests that stress,
poverty, traumatic sexual events in one's past, and even lack of
education may all be more significant factors.
</P>
<P>
   The data were derived from the government's 1992 National Health
and Social Life Survey, involving more than 3,160 people aged 18 to
59. Other researchers have concluded the survey generally yielded
honest answers from people interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The new study was limited to about 1,750 women and 1,410 men who
reported having sex with at least one person in the 12 months
before they were interviewed, or about 90 percent of all survey
respondents.
</P>
<P>
   The study authors acknowledge that omitting the other 10 percent
of people might understate rates of some sexual dysfunctions by
excluding ``respondents (who) may have avoided sex because of
sexual problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims of rape or child molestation reported much higher rates
of sexual dysfunction. Male victims of ``adult-child sexual
contact'' were three times more likely to experience erectile
dysfunction, and women who were ever ``sexually forced'' by a man
were twice as likely to have arousal disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traumatic sexual acts continue to exert profound effects on
sexual functioning, some effects lasting many years beyond the
occurrence of the original event,'' the study authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Education and wealth appear to help people enjoy better sex
lives. Women whose household income dropped by more than 20 percent
in the three years before the survey, for example, were about 60
percent more likely to have low sexual desire or problems becoming
aroused than those whose income went up.
</P>
<P>
   Higher levels of education were associated in women with having
higher rates of enjoying sex and being able to have orgasms, in men
with avoiding climaxing too early, and in both genders with lower
levels of ``performance anxiety'' about making love.
</P>
<P>
   Among other findings from the study:
</P>
<P>
   --Between 22 and 28 percent of women in different age categories
said they are unable to achieve orgasm during sex, with the rate
steadily declining as women's education level increased.
Thirty-four percent of women high-school dropouts said they are
unable to achieve orgasm, compared with 18 percent of women college
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   --Thirty-two percent of women between 18 and 39 said they lacked
interest in sex.
</P>
<P>
   --Seven to 9 percent of men of all ages said they are unable to
achieve orgasm during sex.
</P>
<P>
   --The percentage of men who have trouble maintaining or
achieving an erection was 7 percent among those aged 18 to 20, 9
percent among those in their 30s, 11 percent among those in their
40s, and 18 percent of those aged 50 to 59.
</P>
<P>
   --The percentage of women who have trouble becoming aroused was
18 to 19 percent among women aged 18 to 39, compared with 21
percent of women in their 40s and 27 percent of women in their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   --Among men, daily alcohol consumption was associated with lower
rates of premature ejaculation, but 60 to 120 percent higher rates
of erectile dysfunction and low desire. Women who drink daily were
much less likely to experience low sexual desire, arousal problems,
or pain during sex.

OSCAR SPRINKLES A FEW FIRSTS AMONGST THE STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The list of nominations for the 71st annual Academy Awards is
littered with an unusual number of intriguing little Oscar oddities
and small ``firsts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian-language tragicomedy, ``Life is Beautiful,'' is
nominated for best picture and best foreign-language picture _ the
first time this has happened since 1969. And the film's seven Oscar
nods make it the most nominated foreign-language film ever.
</P>
<P>
   Two actresses _ Cate Blanchett of ``Elizabeth'' and Judi Dench
of ``Shakespeare in Love'' _ are nominated for playing the same
character, Queen Elizabeth I, in different movies. (Actors have
been nominated for playing the same character in different movies,
but never in the same year. Gloria Stuart and Kate Winslet were
nominated last year for playing the same character, but it was in
the same movie, ``Titanic.'')
</P>
<P>
   The best picture category is split between two World War II
combat movies _ `Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Thin Red Line'' _
and two Elizabethan epics _ ``Elizabeth'' and ``Shakespeare in
Love'' (ironically, the latter two both co-star Geoffrey Rush and
Joseph Fiennes).
</P>
<P>
   The best picture nomination for ``Life is Beautiful,'' the best
actor and director nominations for that film's Roberto Benigni, and
the best actress nomination for Brazil's Fernanda Montenegro
(``Central Station),'' combined represent an Oscar first: a
foreign-language film nominee in each of the top four categories _
picture, director, actor and actress.
</P>
<P>
   There is one huge surprise: a best actor nomination for Edward
Norton, as the swastika-covered, minority-bashing, skinhead racist
of ``American History X.'' Norton, who grabbed the spot expected to
go to one of the two Golden Globe best actor winners, Jim Carrey
and Michael Caine, was not even considered a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Norton aside, the 71st nominations went pretty much as
expected, and reinforce the growing charge that the Oscars have
become a virtual rubber-stamp for the earlier awards presentations.
The best director nominations perfectly match the Director's Guild
nominations released Jan. 25; and the supporting actress
nominations mirror the Screen Actors Guild list of Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, with the exception of Norton (replacing Fiennes),
Montenegro (replacing Jane Horrocks of ``Little Voice'') and Ed
Harris of ``The Truman Show'' (replacing David Kelly of ``Waking
Ned Devine'') the names in the other three Oscar acting categories
also match the Screen Actors' Guilde nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees also continue the '90s Oscar trend of alternating
years in which the bulk of nominations go to heavily favored
Hollywood studio efforts (``Schindler's List,'' ``Forrest Gump,''
``Titanic'') with years in which Hollywood masochistically snubs
itself, rewarding independent, foreign and ``niche'' films.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the nominations announced yesterday can be largely read as
a reaction to last year's history-making sweep by ``Titanic.'' Only
one of this year's five best picture nominees _ Fox's ``The Thin
Red Line'' _ was a wide release by an old-line Hollywood studio,
and independents and foreign films bagged 35 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is actually very close to the 69th Oscar
nominations _ that infamous year of Hollywood self-loathing in
which ``Jerry Maguire'' was the only wide-release studio picture
nominated for best picture, and so-called ``outsider'' films _
``The English Patient,'' ``Fargo,'' ``Secrets and Lies'' etc. _
accounted for the overwhelming majority of nominations and swept
all the major categories.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the situation strikingly different from that 1996
race _ and harder to understand _ is that Hollywood produced an
unusual number of bold, edgy or accomplished studio efforts in
1998, films like ``The Truman Show,'' ``Bulworth,'' ``Out of
Sight,'' ``Primary Colors'' and ``The Horse Whisperer'' _ any one
of which could comfortably fill a best picture berth.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the Oscar voters once again showed their
traditional prejudice against comedy and comedians _ hence no
nominations for Cameron Diaz, who won the New York Film Critics'
best actress award for ``There's Something About Mary,'' or Bill
Murray, who won the New York and L.A. Film Critics' best supporting
actor awards for ``Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   And the voters showed their usual penchant for heavy drama,
hence the nominations for the two gut-wrenching combat films, the
two acting nominations _ Nick Nolte and James Coburn _ for the
dysfunctional family theatrics of ``Affliction,'' and the knee-jerk
nomination of Meryl Streep as the dying cancer victim of ``One True
Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Which will be named best picture and win the bulk of the awards?
More than any recent year, that seems hard to predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is still the front-runner: it definitely
could make a mini-sweep, and Tom Hanks could well become the first
actor to win three best-actor Oscars. (Jack Nicholson and Walter
Brennan each have three Oscars, but Brennan's are in the supporting
category, and Nicholson has two best actor prizes, one supporting.)
</P>
<P>
   But the film was released way back in early summer and memories
are notoriously short in Hollywood. ``Ryan'' has already lost in
the nomination race (its total of 11 nominations puts it second to
``Shakespeare,'' with 13), and its rival WWII picture, ``The Thin
Red Line,'' has been gaining momentum since its December-January
release. The two war films could cancel each other.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, ``Elizabeth'' and ``Shakespeare in Love'' have
so much in common _ they strangely exist in my mind as a single
film _ that they could also cancel each other. If this happens, the
beneficiary in the best picture race will be Robert Benigni's
``Life is Beautiful,'' which also has that most favorite of Oscar
subjects _ the Holocaust _ going for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the actor sweepstakes, Ian McKellen of ``Gods and Monsters''
looks hard to beat, if not for his great performance, then for his
minority status (he's openly gay) in a field otherwise devoid of
racial or sexual minorities. In the actress contest, Gwyneth
Paltrow of ``Shakespeare'' was so radiant she seems destined to
outshine her rivals on the sheer strength of her movie-star power.
</P>
<P>
   However the race goes, the Oscar folks are promising that the
upcoming, century-ending Oscar-cast will be the splashiest ever.
Its theme will be a ``celebration of great movie genres.'' Whoopi
Goldberg will serve as host for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony is on Sunday (not Monday, as in most past years),
March 21, starting at 5:30 p.m. PST.

GALLERIES ARE LABS OF A SORT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Artists are a voracious lot. They take from everywhere, even if
they misuse, abuse or only partly understand what they borrow.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three decades _ ever since Minimalism and Conceptual
Art declared open season on reality _ science has played an
increasingly prominent role in art. Donald Judd used the Fibonacci
series of natural numbers as a compositional device and Robert
Irwin's installations examined the nature of visual perception.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smithson embraced entropy as the underlying principle of
his art. Alan Sonfist, playing the botanical historian,
reconstructed a bit of primeval Manhattan forest, still standing at
the corner of West Broadway and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the AIDS crisis, concern for the environment
and the development of new technologies are only a few things that
have inspired references to science in art. Consider Ross
Bleckner's paintings, with their evocations of the body's cells;
Mark Dion's laboratorylike tableaux; Matthew Barney's sculptural
excursions into biogenesis, or Matthew Ritchie's paintings, which
convert theories of astrophysics into warring gods.
</P>
<P>
   Old science is as present as new, as attested to by the rage for
taxidermy in current sculpture. And the history of science is a
subject unto itself: Alexis Rockman's panorama paintings, with
their dystopic view of evolution, and Zoe Leonard's photographs of
cadavers are examples.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, three different uses of the scientific are on
view in Manhattan galleries. In a group show at Andrew Kreps in
Chelsea, Julian LaVerdiere is exhibiting ``Hydrogen Bed,'' a
helium-filled mattress that floats near the ceiling. At David
Beitzel in SoHo, Michael Lucero's elaborate ceramic totems include
pots shaped like chemists' beakers, which evoke the chemical basis
of firing and glazing ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   Also in SoHo, at American Fine Arts on Wooster Street, Dennis
Balk is inviting viewers to use his ``Photo Magnetic Receiver,'' a
machine that transforms the viewer's aura into light rays.
</P>
<P>
   Science has taken artists in many new directions. Terry Winters
bases his semi-abstract paintings on natural forms and structures
and over the years has moved from botanical subjects to linear
networks that are simultaneously micro- and macrocosmic.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Smith reveals some of the body's unseen beauties by making
large blood molecules from handblown red glass. Fred Tomaselli
comments on society's pharmaceutical obsessions by making
beautifully patterned paintings out of over-the-counter pills
embedded in resin.
</P>
<P>
   And Gary Schneider is one of a number of artists interested in
the most infinitesimal measure of human uniqueness, DNA,
photographing his own to create a new kind of self-portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no scientific invention, principle, fact, technique or
technology seems immune to the artistic appetite. Given the nature
of art, science and reality, more of the same surely follows.

NORWEGIANS DOMINATE WORLD ALPINE CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ It's hard to say just when the point of the World
Alpine Ski Championships became to beat the Austrians at all costs,
but few opponents missed hearing the endless refrains of
(itals)``Immer Wieder, Immer Wieder Oesterreich''(unitals) (``Once
More Austria'') from the finishing stadium at the men's combined
slalom Tuesday. For the first time in these games, the Austrians
were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least the red-and-white freight train was momentarily
derailed as Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt, perhaps the best
all-around skier in the world, put in as strong a slalom run down
the Giant Steps course as he did a downhill the day before on the
Birds of Prey course at Beaver Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Next came teammate Lasse Kjus. Gold and silver medals to Norway.
The bronze went to Swiss ace Paul Accola.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind Aamodt and pushing through all three runs (one
downhill and two slalom) was Kjus, a super giant slalom specialist
who tied Austrian Hermann Maier for the gold medal in that event
last week. Kjus won the Olympic gold in the 1994 Lillehammer Games,
and Aamodt won the gold at the Sestriere worlds two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Aamodt was inspired from the start Monday. Down the
treacherous Birds of Prey course, he finished just four-10ths of a
second behind Swiss leader Bruno Kernen and just ahead of Kjus.
</P>
<P>
   His first run down the Giant Steps was good enough to slide him
past Kernen, who finished the day fifth. But after leading the pack
into the afternoon run, Aamodt could have eased off and minimized
his risks. A DNF in any of the three runs takes a racer out of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play it too safe,'' said Aamodt, ``other racers can
overtake you. It is not good to try to be too tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire race was run in dazzling sunshine under deep blue
skies, and another crowd of 15,000 lined the course.
</P>
<P>
   But by the afternoon run, a deep shadow had enveloped the
toughest part of the course _ Pepi's Face _ where skiers plunge
down a deep drop-off to the finish. Several skiers lost their way
or crashed on this face, and others struggled to stay high enough
to make the gates. But Aamodt shifted gears flawlessly down Pepi's
Face and posted a time no other skiers seriously challenged.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for the United States, Bode Miller of Franconia
Notch, N.H., and Carrabassett Valley Academy in Maine, crashed on
the downhill course Monday when his K-2 ski delaminated and fell
apart halfway down Birds of Prey. Miller was on a run that would
have put him in contention with a strong slalom, which is his
forte.
</P>
<P>
   The combined event gets much criticism, mainly from racers who
are not good enough to muster the flexibility to win at both the
speed and technical ends of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Since the inception of combined slalom and downhill in 1982,
only the best all-around skiers in the world have come close to
winning medals. Some have argued that the event waters down each
extreme _ the speed skiing and technical gate racing. The event is
not run in World Cup but only at Olympics and world championships.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in the 17 years since the combined was first run in
Schladming, Austria, the winners' board reads like a Hall of Fame,
including names such as Pirmin Zurbriggen, Hubert Strolz, Stephen
Eberharter, Aamodt, Kjus, and Marc Girardelli, who won three times.
</P>
<P>
   In these championships, the Austrians have won 10 of 18 medals
so far. Norway has won five, all by Aamodt and Kjus.
</P>
<P>
   The next event is a women's giant slalom Thursday, followed by
men's GS Friday and the two slaloms over the weekend. The games
close Sunday.

TEXAS SENATE VOTES TO GIVE SMALL OIL PRODUCERS $45 MILLION TAX
BREAK 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Senate voted 25-1 Tuesday to give a
$45 million tax break to owners of small oil and gas wells _ the
first piece of legislation to pass either chamber this session and
one that the industry hails as a life preserver for foundering
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, Senate Bill 290, now moves to the House, which is
expected to act quickly on the measure, according to Lt. Gov. Rick
Perry. Gov. George W. Bush declared the matter an emergency,
meaning it would take effect immediately upon passage by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Shunning skeptics' description of the bill as welfare for rich
oil barons, bill sponsor Sen. J.E. ``Buster'' Brown said the
measure, which provides only temporary tax relief, would help shore
up marginal wells, save jobs and benefit schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil industry is hurting,'' said Brown, citing a 40 percent
plummet in oil prices last year and a 22 million barrel drop in
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the state does not have the financial dependence on
the energy industry that it once did, this industry is still a
foundation of our state's economy,'' Brown added later. ``We are
trying to send a message to these small producers to `hold on' and
stick out this rough period without capping wells.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Layton of Equinox Oil in Houston called the Senate action
``a great step in the right direction,'' but he added that it would
be a mistake to think that it will solve the oil price problems the
industry faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state was in jeopardy of losing many, many of those wells
and still is in jeopardy of losing them because of low prices,''
Layton said. ``But this is a help. I hope that the action the
Senate has taken will send a message to policy makers at the
federal level that the federal government needs to do something ...
because they're the only ones with the power to address this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Dingmore of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty
Owners Association, or TIPRO, said the bill is ``a good bold step''
that helps marginal well owners in the worst slump in prices the
industry has ever seen. ``We're talking about trying to hold on
until things get better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, cast the only vote
against the measure, saying it ``targeted (a) tax cut'' for the oil
industry, while the state has done nothing to help ailing cattle,
cotton and copper industries.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would exempt owners of small wells _ those producing 15
barrels of oil or less per day _ from paying severance taxes when
the monthly average closing price of West Texas Intermediate crude
oil is below $15 per barrel, as recorded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, for three consecutive months. The tax relief would expire
Aug. 31, the end of the fiscal year, or when the state has waived
$45 million in taxes, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have been below that mark for several months, so
operators of marginal wells would qualify immediately for relief
retroactive to Feb. 1 when it is signed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $11.69 Tuesday; at that
price, oil well owners would save 54 cents a barrel. While that
savings might seem small, Allen Mesch, director of the Maguire Oil
and Gas Institute at southern Methodist University, said
independent producers operate on margins of profit as low as 12
cents and that getting another 54 cents could well mean the
difference between staying in business or shutting down wells for
many producers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said owners of about 138,000 wells, or 83 percent of the
wells, which produce about 38 percent of the state's crude, would
be affected. ``That's a significant number,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption also would apply to gas wells producing 90,000
cubic feet or less of gas per day when prices fall to less than
$1.80 per thousand cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   But with gas prices well above the trigger price of $1.80 per
thousand cubic feet and projections that it will remain there for
some time, Brown acknowledged that gas producers likely will be
unable to avail themselves of the tax break.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Anderson of Houston-based Anderson Oil Corp., and one of
those who stands to benefit from the measure, said the bill ``is
going to help a lot of our marginal well operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the tax relief, however small, ``is appreciated''
and that it sends the message that ``maybe somebody cares'' about
the plight of owners and producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oil and gas industry has been the stepping stone for taxes
for years and getting worse,'' Anderson added.
</P>
<P>
   His company, which operates wells primarily in South Texas, was
on the verge of shutting some of its wells, Anderson said, but with
tax exemption on the horizon, ``we're going to wait another
month.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the bill's major impacts, according to its
proponents, will be on local school districts and public colleges
and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Property tax levies, which provide the major source of funds for
public schools, would decline drastically in many areas should
marginal wells close down, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller Carole Keeton Rylander has estimated that school
districts across the state will lose $150 million to $160 million
as a result of low oil and gas prices. That revenue would decline
even more if wells are shut in.

FRANCE TRIES EX-OFFICIALS IN HIV CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France put a former prime minister and two other former
Cabinet members on trial Tuesday on charges of manslaughter and
criminal negligence in a scandal over HIV-tainted blood.
</P>
<P>
   They are accused of involuntary homicide, the equivalent of
manslaughter, and ``involuntarily attacking the physical integrity
of others'' in the cases of seven people who contracted AIDS after
receiving blood containing the virus that causes the disease from
government stocks in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The three, former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius and two Cabinet
ministers who served under him between 1984 and 1986, denied the
charges when they appeared Tuesday before a specially constituted
tribunal, the Court of Justice of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,400 people who got transfusions in the 1980s were
infected with the virus, and experts later termed at least 300 of
the cases ``avoidable.'' About 40 percent of the infected people
have since died.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius and the two other former ministers contested all the
charges, including the accusation that they delayed testing of
blood for the AIDS virus in order to give a French-designed test a
chance to compete commercially with an American-made one that was
available months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this necessary trial will allow us to establish that
from what we knew, we acted in good conscience,'' Fabius said in a
statement to the court, which has no permanent building and sat in
a state-run conference center near the Arc de Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   Georgina Dufoix, who was minister of social affairs, and Edmond
Herve, secretary of state for health in Fabius' government, also
said they had not delayed action for commercial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dufoix and Herve are accused of letting unsterilized blood
and blood products remain in stocks used to treat hemophiliacs for
several months in 1985 even though they knew, it is charged, that
the untreated products could be infected with HIV. They will also
answer to charges of negligence in enforcing regulations on
screening donors to exclude those with a higher than average
probability of having AIDS, like homosexuals and prison inmates.
</P>
<P>
   At least a thousand people who were infected by blood
transfusions under government auspices, many of them hemophiliacs,
have since died, including five of the seven victims named in the
case. Agnes Cochin, whose baby boy, Charles-Edouard, got a
transfusion for jaundice after birth and died of AIDS at the age of
5, appeared as a witness Tuesday and angrily asked if the three
officials were not ashamed of the suffering they had caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you no shame, Sirs, Madame?'' she said. ``I've been
waiting for years and years for this day to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabius, 52, a Socialist who is now speaker of the lower house of
Parliament, stepped aside from the post but did not resign in
advance of the trial, which is expected to last three weeks. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to up to three years in prison;
the other two face possible sentences of up to five years, plus
fines of up to $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Fabius, once considered a leading contender for the
French presidency, say that he is being unfairly made a scapegoat
for a tragedy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The court that is trying them was established in 1993 after a
wave of public indignation, in the midst of a sea of political
corruption cases, about the effective immunity of government
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the president of the Republic, now Jacques Chirac,
is immune from criminal prosecution for any reason during his
seven-year term of office, a privilege affirmed last month by the
country's highest administrative tribunal, the Constitutional
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Justice is the first in the 40-year history of the
Fifth Republic that can try government ministers for alleged crimes
committed while they were in office. It consists of 12 legislators,
5 from the governing Socialist Party and 7 from opposition
conservative parties, plus three professional judges.
</P>
<P>
   Other courts have convicted four lower-ranking officials in
previous trials, and 32 people are awaiting trial on various
charges relating to deaths or illness after transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Fabius say the prime minister was not informed by
his subordinates until April 29, 1985, about the possibility of
systematic testing of blood and blood products for the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   He was not aware then of discussions about delaying a decision
so that Diagnostics Pasteur, a French laboratory, could market a
test that could compete with an American one that Abbott
Laboratories was ready to introduce in France the previous month,
his defenders say.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius announced in June 1985 that systematic testing would be
obligatory from Aug. 1, 1985, a few months after the United States,
The Netherlands, Norway, Austria and Italy but ahead of Belgium,
Luxembourg, Britain, Germany, and other European countries, the
defense says. Health authorities approved the Pasteur test for use
June 21 and the Abbott test a month later.

SENATE VOTES TO KEEP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL DELIBERATIONS CLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators began secret deliberations in President
Clinton's impeachment trial Tuesday, hoping that a closed-door
debate would move quickly and improve chances that the five-week
trial would end Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 18 senators spoke during the 4 1/2 hour session.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry E. Craig, R-Idaho, said senators were respectful,
politely asking each other questions with most of them not using
their full 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a few points you could hear the pressure rising, but I
would not say there was heated debate,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said some senators spoke from notes while others had
prepared texts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, described the atmosphere behind the
closed doors as ``very honest and open, I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, characterized it as ``a
great debate. I think the American people would have been very
proud to see it. People were alert and attentive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., said the closed session ``is
more collegial, it's basically no grandstanding, no playing to the
media. I think there's a lot of sincerity on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the speeches ``have been
thoughtful. There's a recognition that this is a heavy
responsibility and we're getting to the judgment hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said ``It's not as shrill as I
would expect it to be if there were TV cameras.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Herbert H. Kohl, D-Wis., said the mood in the deliberations
was ``somber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are standing up and giving their reasons,'' he said.
``At this point the senators are taking it pretty seriously because
this is the moment of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in U.S. history that senators voted to
keep such deliberations secret. In 1868, deliberations that fell
one vote short of removing President Andrew Jackson from office
were closed, with no record kept of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-41 vote in favor of opening the deliberations fell eight
votes short of the two-thirds majority or 67 votes needed to change
Senate rules requiring closed deliberations in impeachment
proceedings. Fourteen Republicans joined 45 Democrats in voting to
open the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we won't just have speeches, that in fact we will
have deliberations,'' Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said
after the vote. Lott opposed opening the session.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will vote in public later this week on the two
articles of impeachment that the House approved in December. The
articles charge the president with perjury before a federal grand
jury and conspiring to obstruct justice in connection with the
cover-up of his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of senators taking full advantage of their moment
in the limelight led Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., to argue against
opening the deliberations in order to save time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not take a math wizard to figure out that if 100
senators are offered 15 minutes each to make statements in open
session, it will result in 1,500 minutes or up to 25 hours of
speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Closed sessions ``will indisputably result in a fast conclusion
to this trial,'' Chafee said.
</P>
<P>
   Senators were sworn under oath not to divulge what they heard
inside, although they were allowed to tell reporters the substance
of their own comments. However, the Senate authorized the
publication of individual senator's remarks in the Congressional
Record, if they want to, after the trial has finished.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, who sponsored the unsuccessful motion to open the
debate, afterward complained that ``a written transcript is not the
same as seeing the full debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said the decision to allow
senators to submit their remarks for the record represented ``a
great leap sideways, not a step forward. This is very much a vote
against representative democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said the floor of the Senate ``is not a
private club.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are public servants and I believe the public has every
right to see how we deliberate, how we reach the conclusions we
do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, efforts were continuing behind the scenes to find a
way to censure President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., who has helped Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., search for the winning language in a censure
resolution, said there was growing support for censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to end in a unifying statement of national
values,'' Lieberman said. ``We're all yearning for finality here
and to move on with the rest of our work. It's important to make
this final statement.''
</P>
<P>
   However, censure advocates faced the likelihood of a filibuster
by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who opposes censure. It would require
60 votes to end such a filibuster and, more critically, it would
require a two-day gap from the time a motion was filed to end the
filibuster and the time the vote could be taken.
</P>
<P>
   This would push the schedule well into the weekend that some
senators had planned for the start of their 10-day February recess.
Many lawmakers said they wanted to put the entire impeachment
controversy behind them before leaving town.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, one of the authors of a prominent
censure resolution, conceded that ``parliamentary roadblocks on
censure seem to be rather high.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said, ``I would suggest you would not see a censure vote
before the recess.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., an opponent of censure, said he was
worried about the precedent that censure would set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party that controls Congress ought not to be in the
business of censuring the president of another party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Sen. Peter G. Fitzgerald, R-Ill., said censure would be
``extraconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know what they're going to censure him for if he
didn't perjure himself or obstruct justice,'' Fitzgerald said. ``I
would question what the purpose would be. It seems to me that
they're trying to censure him for having had a reprehensible
extramarital affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said censuring the president would
amount to ``calling him names. We're not paid to do that.''

   Earlier in the day, Lott sent a 128-word letter to the office of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr asking him to investigate reports
of the existence of White House tapes of telephone conversations
between Clinton and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's spokesman John Czwartacki said Lott was responding to a
news report by Fox News Channel that the White House Communications
Agency had made such tapes and also to Republican senators who
expressed concerns about the reports.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart denied the White House has
such tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that (Lott) wanted to notify the independent
counsel who has the proper authority to look into the veracity of
these reports,'' Czwartacki said. ``The sense here is that it would
be unfair to the president and to history to let this hang out
here. The sense is you want to pursue every dangling chapter.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan _ Murderous and macabre, Karachi is a patch
quilt of robust commerce and urban detritus, where modern seaside
high rises loom above mud-caked squatter colonies and much of the
water supply is delivered by donkey cart.
</P>
<P>
   Common thugs moonlight as political operatives, and a
Kalashnikov rifle is easy to rent for $10 a week. With 10 million
people, it is one of the world's largest and most dangerous cities.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, two predatory political factions with
terrorist elements _ the Muttahida Qaumi Movement and its rival
offshoot, the Haqiqi _ have fought each other and, very often, the
police and the army.
</P>
<P>
   Karachi has slipped back and forth between times of deadly
mayhem and brutal crackdowns, the one a disease that is crippling
the city and the other a temporary remedy that many here say only
insures more violence ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Right now is a period of crackdown. Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has used his constitutional powers to turn over
control of Sindh province, which includes Karachi, to his appointed
governor, Moinuddin Haider.
</P>
<P>
   ``What choice was there, with terrorists killing people every
day, mutilating their bodies, cutting them up, stuffing them in
sacks and dropping them around the city?'' asked Haider, a recently
retired and well-respected general.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pakistan, not just Karachi, suffers from lawlessness.
While Sharif's get-tough tactics may combat crime, it is commonly
believed that he also wants tighter control over his economically
troubled country at a time when his popularity has plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   In Karachi, police officers and paramilitary troops were
unleashed to capture people accused of being terrorists, and
thousands of people were taken into custody like minnows in a
seine.
</P>
<P>
   Workers of the MQM, Karachi's main political party, have been
particular targets of the crackdown. The party successfully
competes in elections and ruthlessly kills and extorts in the
streets. Its support comes from Urdu speakers known as Mohajirs,
whose families migrated from India a half-century ago and formed
much of the city's business class.
</P>
<P>
   For ``the speedy and inexpensive justice'' that he insists is a
must, Sharif had little faith in the existing courts and their
overwhelmed, often intimidated civilian judges. In December, citing
conviction rates of less than 1 percent, he enlisted military
officers to try criminal cases, a strategy he says he now hopes to
expand to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Under the procedures in Sindh, Haider chooses cases for
three-judge military tribunals, and the time between a trial and an
execution is measured in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The near-hanging of Mohammad Saleem, 14, is an example of how
this refashioned justice is working, though whether these workings
are a horror or a triumph is in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the military's swiftly held trials, Mohammad, an
illiterate carpet weaver, was convicted along with several others
in the terrorist murder of three policemen. No defense was
presented for the teenager, though he had a solid alibi and
witnesses to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Ignored as well was his age. He was too young to be legally
tried as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the young man lives, and to many here that
shows that the system is fair as well as fast. Though Mohammad had
but three days to appeal, an outcry from the shanties where he
lived was enough to alert human- rights lawyers to his case. A
second military panel set him free, sending him home from the
central jail's Death Cell 14, a stark cement room where he awaited
the noose with only a blanket and a pan.
</P>
<P>
   In two months, 13 have been sentenced to death, though after a
murderer and a rapist went to the gallows, the Supreme Court
suspended further executions and is considering whether the prime
minister had the authority to set up this parallel system of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the legality, the effects have been tranquilizing. The
number of murders in Karachi, by official statistics, has fallen
sharply. Last June's monthly total was 139; December's was 37.
</P>
<P>
   Such statistics are encouraging to Sharif, who has increasingly
relied on the military for civilian chores. Soldiers now run the
government's water and power company. They conducted the census in
this, the world's eighth-most-populous country, and are repairing
the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown in Karachi involves political calculation on
Sharif's part, some say. ``Sharif had an alliance with the MQM, and
when the deal came apart he did what any cutthroat would do,'' said
Ardeshir Cowasjee, an acerbic political commentator and retired
businessman. ``In this country everything is possible in the name
of power and greed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sharif was elected in February 1997, his party, the
Pakistan Muslim League, made a deal with the Muttahida Qaumi
Movement. Together they held enough legislative seats to form a
coalition to head Sindh's provincial government.
</P>
<P>
   In the bargain, Muttahida Qaumi was granted several ministries,
the release of thousands of its jailed workers and the payment of
reparations for government's excesses against the party in 1992 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, the two partners bickered about how the deal
was being fulfilled. Political violence again menaced the peace.
Muttahida Qaumi terrorists, including some newly sprung from jail,
were taking revenge against the rival Haqiqi faction and law
enforcement, occasionally using rockets and grenades.
</P>
<P>
   When the coalition finally came apart, the police, who had been
held back while the MQM shared power, were pleased to be set loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to retake control,'' said Farooq Amin Qureshi, the
deputy inspector general of Sindh's police and a man with a wall
calendar that shows some of the 422 officers killed in action in
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The police dragnet, he said, extends far beyond the two feuding
political factions. Thousands of people suspected of being
criminals have been detained, and while the inspector insisted that
torture was never employed in questioning, some of his ranking
assistants, exchanging anonymity for candor, admitted the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without sophisticated forensics, these are our tools of
investigation,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   These days, the headquarters of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement,
known as Nine-Zero for the numbers in its address, seems a nerve
center for a disaster area. People straggle in, reporting new
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Farooq Sattar, a physician and a party leader, said 650
party workers or their family members remained in detention, though
3,000 more had been able to buy their freedom with bribes ranging
from $5 to $5,000. He estimated that 10,000 were in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   In the anterooms of Nine-Zero, videos of past torture victims
are shown even as the newly-abused arrive. Methods described
include the customary catalog: the leather straps, the extracted
fingernails, the hanging upside down. A more unusual, though
highly-practiced technique is called cheera, or tearing, and it
involves the yanking apart of legs until the joints are dislocated.
``As they do this, they tell you they are making you impotent,''
said Mohammad Zubair, 27, who claimed to have endured the torture.
</P>
<P>
   Little, however, is said of the MQM's own storied infliction of
terror, notable for dismemberment and the use of electric drills.
Sattar, grasping for absolution, said, ``This is done by cadres out
of control, and the tragedy is that when we throw out these
anti-social, criminal elements, they merely join the Haqiqi and are
given guns to point at MQM.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an irony of the current crackdown _ and a terrible
reminder of those before _ that MQM members see the police's
current activities as being notably restrained.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an element of carefulness this time,'' said Sattar,
recalling that in 1995, under the government of Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, dozens in the party were killed with such dispatch
by security forces that it is commonly viewed here as a campaign of
extermination.
</P>
<P>
   Haider said such ``overindulgence by law enforcement'' has not
been allowed under his stewardship. He said he suspects that only
three recent prisoners have died in police custody due to what he
termed ``over-torture,'' and he said he is investigating every
case.
</P>
<P>
   With crime down, citizens are feeling relief. Even in the worst
slums, people mill about in ways they would not have dared a few
months ago. Shopkeepers report a decline in habitual extortion, the
prevailing means of support for every organization with a cache of
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party activists skipped me last month, though the police
still took their share,'' Qamar Uddin, a tailor, said with a casual
shrug. ``This is the nature of Karachi.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the city's problem, like that of the nation itself, is
the unwillingness of its ethnic components to assume a larger
loyalty. A shared Islamic faith was supposed to be enough to unite
Pakistanis, but other identities _ Baluch, Pathan, Sindhi, Punjabi
_ still take precedence. In Karachi, there is the added element of
the Mohajir.
</P>
<P>
   A half century ago, as both Pakistan and India became
independent, millions of Muslims fled Hindu-dominated India, a good
share seeking refuge in their adopted land's commercial hub and
only seaport, where the Indus River meets the Arabian Sea. Within a
few years, half of Karachi's population were Urdu-speaking
newcomers who were known as Mohajirs, or immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the relatively-prosperous Mohajirs replaced
middle-class Hindus who had fled in the opposite direction. Their
power, however, was challenged in the decades ahead as Karachi
swelled with other migratory waves, including Pathans from the
rugged hills on the Afghan frontier and Biharis from Bangladesh.
The never-ending scramble for jobs pitted one community against
another. The resentful had rifles. Bullets bore vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, a Mohajir student movement sank the roots of
today's MQM and led it into local politics, where it has had
success. Its leader, then and now, is Altaf Hussain, a man who so
many would like to murder that he has prudently taken self-exile in
London. He runs the party _ exactingly, most say _ by phone and
fax. His long-distance orations are amplified to rapt audiences at
Nine-Zero with garlands strung over the loud speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the MQM has been courted into alliances with
both of the country's major national parties only to end up at
loggerheads. By now, it is a long-running drama where each scene
involves an interplay of betrayals.
</P>
<P>
   Jameel Yusuf, a prominent Karachi business man, has devoted his
recent years to running a citizens campaign against crime. Like
many others here, he is pleased with the pacifying results of
governor's rule and military justice but doubts they are a means to
prolonged calm: violence only begats violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under one government, the terrorists are heroes, and then
under the next, they are terrorists again,'' he said. ``How long
can we keep doing this?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the violence seems an unending loop, retracing old scars
of hurt and provoking new cries for vengeance. In the slum called
Liaquatabad, Mairaj Bano recently mourned her son, a policeman shot
seven times in the head by terrorists. ``If it can be done, I want
the murderers brought to me and I will chew their fingers in my
mouth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Saleem, the 14-year-old who narrowly escaped the noose,
also lives with dismal repercussions. He still suffers pain from
the torture applied during interrogations. And then there is
financial debt. He paid a worthless lawyer $2,000 to defend him in
his first trial. To get the money, the young carpet weaver had to
borrow from his employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now a bonded laborer,'' he said, grimly estimating the
length of his indenture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years. I think, 20 years tying knots at the loom.''

 &QL; 
Shakespeare in Love: Got most nominations (13) plus period piece

appreciates funny or literate minus won wrong Golden Globe (for
comedy) equals ``Love's'' labours not looking lost. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Thin Red Line: Nice nature photography plus some consider it a
more thoughtful war movie than ``Private Ryan'' minus which doesn't
necessarily make it coherent minus has driven more viewers out of
theaters than the Marines drove Japanese off Guadalcanal equals
AWOL at the awards podium. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST ACTRESS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth''): Wore corset plus took it off minus

conviction to standard role of old crab with heart of gold plus
face has gloriously high mileage, and she knows how to use every
inch of it divided by performed in Portugese (last foreign language
acting winner: Sophia Loren, 1961) equals in this case, language
should be no barrier. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gwyneth Paltrow (``Shakespeare in Love''): Wore corset plus took it
off plus wasn't discreet about it at all plus while speaking iambic
poetry, yet plus struck a blow for repressed, 16th-century aspiring
actresses minus won wrong Golden Globe (for comedy) equals the
accent could be on Gwynie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meryl Streep (``One True Thing''): Character got cancer, died minus
character was also a ninny times Meryl got a few honest moments out
of her anyway plus this is her 11th nomination divided by but if

more than two Oscars by now? equals dead in the water. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Emily Watson (``Hilary and Jackie''): Character was a classical
musician plus mentally unbalanced plus got a deadly disease times
Watson uncannily imitated real-life cellist's unique physical

members) offended by warts-and-all portrayal of national culture
hero equals could be making beautiful music come Oscar night.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST ACTOR &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Roberto Benigni (``Life Is Beautiful''): Brilliant physical comedy

winner: Sophia Loren, 1961) equals well, Sophia spoke Italian, too
... &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tom Hanks (``Saving Private Ryan''): Portrayed the epitome of the
World War II citizen soldier divided by the movie's acting was
drowned out by its barrage of formal brilliance times there is some
evidence that Oscar likes him minus he's already won two, and he's
not quite Jack Nicholson yet equals he'll really have to earn it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ian McKellen (``Gods and Monsters''): Illuminated every complex
aspect of a dying man's soul plus played a real-life filmmaker
times the academy kind of likes gay characters now minus it's never
rewarded an openly gay actor for playing one equals this one could
very well go to Sir Ian, with love. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nick Nolte (``Affliction''): The guy's done this role, it seems, a
thousand times before times he's never done it better minus it's as
grim as New England winter nights are long plus nobody does grim
better equals the race's pre-eminent dark horse, emphasis on the
dark. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edward Norton (``American History X''): Made a neo-Nazi human, sort
of divided by though he still seemed much more engaged by the
hateful stuff than the repudiation of it x reportedly recut film to
emphasize his role (though apparently an egomaniacal minus in
reality a plus, since every actor dreams of doing it and they make
up the academy's biggest voting bloc) equals won't win, but points
for inspiring another round of loony protest stunts by disgruntled
director Tony Kaye.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST DIRECTOR: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Roberto Benigni (``Life Is Beautiful''): Auteur behind the little
movie that everyone loves plus nominee you'd most like to hug minus

John Madden (``Shakespeare in Love''): Directed the most-nominated
film plus has a name that appeals to moviegoers and football fans
alike minus has a film that doesn't appeal to moviegoers who are
football fans divided by his name isn't Spielberg equals Oscar,
Oscar, wherefore art thou, Oscar? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Terrence Malick (``The Thin Red Line''): Made the nature lover's
favorite World War II film plus can count on film school vote plus
mysterious, Salinger-like aura minus said aura means he has few
friends in the Academy divided by his movie has as many detractors
as it does admirers equals a loser, but who cares ... he wasn't
going to show anyway. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Steven Spielberg (``Saving Private Ryan''): Already won the Golden
Globe plus tremendous respect for maturing artistic accomplishments
plus tremendous respect for continuing box-office accomplishments
minus petty jealousy over all his success equals another likely
victory in the award campaign. &QL;

 &QL; 
Peter Weir (``The Truman Show''): Directed brilliant satire of
television medium minus who gets satire? divided by has no chance
because picture didn't get nominated divided by has no chance
because picture is set in modern times equals good morning, good
afternoon, good evening, bad night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR:  &QL; 
James Coburn (``Affliction''): Portrays an alcoholic minus but an
irredeemable one x it's his first nomination after nearly 100
movies minus nobody has seen this particular movie equals don't
expect him to be buying anyone drinks after the show. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Robert Duvall (``A Civil Action''): Highly respected for being an
actor's actor plus turned in a workmanlike performance as a
curmudgeonly, hair-splitting attorney minus general contempt for

equals case dismissed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ed Harris &UR;  &LR; (``The Truman Show''): Highly respected for being an
actor's actor plus already won the Golden Globe minus his movie

mantle. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Geoffrey Rush (``Shakespeare in Love''): Plays a character with a
disability (those teeth!) plus part of what could be a
Shakespearean sweep minus already won an Oscar and not all that
long ago equals could be another night to ``Shine'' for Geoffrey. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Billy Bob Thornton (``A Simple Plan''): Convincingly plays a dumb
bumpkin, but a deep one minus kind of already did that with ``Sling
Blade'' plus well-liked by academy members who envy his
across-the-board talents and creative control minus but you can't
imitate this character's vocal inflections (mmmm-mmmm) &UR; equals &LR; 
found buried treasure in movie, but probably not on Oscar night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;

BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Kathy Bates (``Primary Colors''): Played a liberal sorely
disillusioned by a Clinton-like president plus liberal academy

go with a wild card in this category equals likely to be anonymous
on Oscar night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Brenda Blethyn (``Little Voice''): Three years ago, she was a
little-known nominee with a little-known film (``Secrets &AMP; Lies'')
plus now she's a well-known nominee minus but still with a movie
few have seen divided by the fact that her insufferable character
plays like nails on a chalkboard equals one ``Little Voice'' that
could still be heard from. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Judi Dench (``Shakespeare in Love''): An essential part of year's
most-nominated film plus memorably played Queen Elizabeth I minus
but so did Cate Blanchett, and she had a lot more scenes x people
think Dame Judi should have won last year for ``Mrs. Brown'' equals
possible royal treatment at the podium. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rachel Griffiths (``Hilary and Jackie''): Found unique balance of
sibling jealousy and affection minus didn't play the famous,
tormented sister minus didn't come down with a disease divided by
category often goes to an unknown equals Oscar more likely to
indulge other sister. &QL;

LOTS OF SEX, LITTLE RESPONSIBLITY IN TV CONTENT, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As any regular television watcher knows, sex is not exactly
taboo on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But one subject seems to be largely off-limits, according to a
major new study released Tuesday that deals with the ``risks and
responsibilities'' of sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 1,351 randomly selected shows by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation found that 56 percent of all TV programs _ and 67
percent of all prime-time shows _ contained sexual content in word
or deed over the course of one week. Yet only one in 10 such shows
mentioned contraception, safe sex, or the possibility of delaying
sexual activity, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   After narrowing their focus to only the 88 scenes in which
sexual intercourse was either ``depicted or strongly implied,''
researchers discovered that not one program in the smaller sample
``made even a passing reference'' to safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   With teenage pregnancies reaching 1 million per year and
sexually transmitted diseases annually striking more than 3 million
teenagers, the sexual messages sent by TV are a matter of growing
significance, according to Vicky Rideout, director of the
foundation's Program on the Entertainment Media and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveys indicate that TV is one of the top sources of
information for young people about sex,'' Rideout said in an
interview. ``Obviously, parents and sex-ed classes in schools are
important, but TV is a part of the sexual socialization of young
people. It shows how men and women relate to each other, and what
the norms of sexual behavior are.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone was still in doubt, the study makes clear
just how preoccupied television has become with sex. Fully 85
percent of soap operas were found to contain sexual content; TV
movies, 83 percent; talk shows, 78 percent; dramas, 58 percent;
newsmagazines, 58 percent; sitcoms, 56 percent; reality shows, 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study defined TV sex broadly, counting everything
from passionate kissing to flirting to ``intimate touching'' to
sexual intercourse depicted or implied. Only 7 percent of programs
fell into the latter category.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in detailing the extent of sexual content on TV,
the study sheds a statistical light on the dramatic turnabout in
recent years from the repressive attitude toward sex that
characterized television's early years.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `I Love Lucy' in the '50s, Lucy and Ricky didn't share the
same bed, even though they were married,'' observed TV historian
Steven D. Stark. ``Sex on television was fairly nonexistent until
fairly recently. In the '80s, with `Hill Street Blues,' it really
opened up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's everywhere,'' he added. ``It's even in the ads and
promos all the time. There are no barriers anymore.'' (In this,
Stark noted, television mirrors the movies.)
</P>
<P>
   But television's preoccupation with the subject does not extend
to sexual precautions, the study found. In general, the subject of
safe sex is treated in a grudging and perfunctory fashion. For
instance, even when shows did make references to sexual ``risks and
responsibilities,'' half the time they were ``minor or
inconsequential.'' In addition, only 1 percent of the shows with
sexual content made sexual risks and responsibilities a primary
emphasis of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers did find that on shows with sexual content involving
teenage characters, the shows were twice as likely to make
reference to safe sex or delaying sex. However, that still amounted
only to fewer than one in every five shows, and Rideout noted that
many shows popular among teenagers feature young adults, programs
in which safe-sex messages were rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unprotected sex in this day and age? Where are they coming
from, with AIDS a major life-and-death disease?'' remarked Peggy
Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation's study also encountered some criticism
Tuesday within hours after it was released. Privately, some network
executives complained that studies like the Kaiser foundation's
apply a quantitative measure to a qualitative issue, that simply
counting the number of sexual remarks or acts does not convey the
subject's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Robert J. Thompson, head of the Center for the
Study of Popular Television, said it is unrealistic to expect
sitcom repartee to include safe-sex messages, and objected to what
he saw as attempts to ``mandate what television ought to be
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As uncomfortable as I am that every time I turn on a sitcom at
8 o'clock there's an erection joke, we also have to look at the
potential positive role television may be playing in sexuality,''
said Thompson. ``Some of the shows are beginning to talk about sex
in a sophisticated way. It can be done crudely or very well; `Ally
McBeal' is doing it very well, Howard Stern may not be doing it
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideout emphasized that the Kaiser foundation, a
California-based, independent philanthropy that has recently begun
including the entertainment industry in its studies on public
health issues, is ``not approaching this from a moral or
ideological point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see ourselves as sex police,'' she said. ``We're not
blaming TV for teen pregnancy. We're saying that when one out of
every two shows is communicating something about sex, it's a great
opportunity for people in the television industry to play a
positive role, to inform at the same time they're entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's a lot of people in the television business who
care very much about the impact they have and are trying to
incorporate responsible messages into their shows,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rideout praised the WB network's popular ``Dawson's
Creek'' for depicting two teenagers ``talking about wanting to be
prepared with condoms if they have sex.'' She also lauded the UPN
network's ``Moesha'' and the WB's ``Felicity,'' two other shows
popular among young people, for incorporating discussions of safe
sex into story lines.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also acknowledged that sex is more talked about than
consummated on most shows, citing racy banter on ABC's ``Spin
City'' and ``Dharma and Greg''; NBC's ``Friends,'' ``Veronica's
Closet,'' and ``Working''; and the WB network's ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rideout said the consequences of sex should be
``part of the picture'' even when it's just talked about, because
``the way people talk about sex is communicating important
information about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 88 shows that depicted or ``strongly implied''
intercourse without any discussion of safe sex, the study singled
out a pair of daytime soap operas, CBS's ``The Young and the
Restless'' and NBC's ``Sunset Beach,'' along with TV's top-rated
show, NBC's ``ER,'' and one of its most talked about, Fox's ``Ally
McBeal.'' The study also cited Fox's ``Party of Five'' and CBS's
``Chicago Hope'' as shows that have tried to convey safe-sex
messages.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that some in the TV industry have grown uneasy
with the medium's increasing preoccupation with sex. Scott Sassa,
the new president of NBC Entertainment, recently told TV critics he
has directed NBC writers and producers to cut down on the amount of
gratituitous sexual banter and situations.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Chris Ender, while saying the network would
reserve comment on the study until officials have a chance to read
it, said that ``overall, we believe we're very responsible in our
portrayals of sex.'' Spokespersons for NBC, ABC, Fox, and the WB
said network officials would have no comment until they see the
study.

AT GRINNELL COLLEGE, THEY'RE ALWAYS WILLING TO TAKE A SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 ort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three significant facts about Grinnell, Iowa (population,
10,000):
</P>
<P>
   It has been listed as one of the 100 best small towns in
America.
</P>
<P>
   It is home to Grinnell College, a prestigious liberal arts
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five years ago today, I, your humble servant and Vaunted
Hoop Expert, was born there. (OK, so I bribed our editing staff;
they let this paragraph in as long as I promise to buy them
T-shirts from the Final Four.)
</P>
<P>
   Other than birthplace trivia, Grinnell is home to a basketball
team that has been turning NCAA Division III games into track
meets. Six years ago, Grinnell College coach Dave Arseneault was
concerned that his players were losing interest in the game. A
legitimate concern considering the school had not had a winning
season in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   There are no scholarships in Division III. It's volunteer
basketball. And Grinnell's talent pool is limited. Students are
required to make a 1320 on the SAT (1600 is a perfect SAT score).
Basketball was a low priority for student-athletes majoring in
pre-med and pre-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had players quitting and I wanted to do something from the
participation angle,'' said Arseneault, who has won 58 percent of
his games at Grinnell. ``When I went to this system, my thought
wasn't winning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Arseneault's system turns basketball into a numbers game. He
sets the following ``meaningful statistical goals'' for each game:
Take 94 shots, half of those 3-pointers. Offensive rebound one
third of the missed shots. Take 30 more shots than the opposition.
Force 32 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   And while this style hasn't translated into national
championships or 20-win seasons, it has set 77 individual or team
NCAA records while helping Grinnell's player retention rate. All 17
Pioneers play. Arseneault substitutes like a hockey coach, sending
five-man ``lines'' into the game.
</P>
<P>
   This is basketball on speed. Grinnell averages 116 points per
game. (Division I leader Duke averages 93.4; Division II Central
Oklahoma averages 100.5).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ultra-aggressive on defense,'' Arseneault said. ``We
force the other people to play with us. You can't hold the ball
against us. Some coaches don't even prepare for us. They just play
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pioneers shoot first, last and always. Especially from
behind the 3-point line. Grinnell has attempted 1,143 3-point
shots; its opponents have tried 74. The Pioneers willingly trade
two points for a chance to shoot the three. Which helps explain why
the 8-10 Pioneers allow 120 per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to watch,'' said 5-foot-10 senior guard Jeff Clement.
``It's like a tennis match.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement, a hometown boy, is leading Division III in scoring with
33.9 points per game and on his way to his second consecutive
scoring title. A year ago, he set Division III single-game records
with 77 points and 19 3-pointers. In that game, he attempted 68
shots. (Point of reference: Texas averages 56 shots per game.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a shooter and coach Arseneault gives me a free rein,''
Clement understated. ``We're allowed to be creative, try anything
and everything. I've had fun for the four years I've been here.
It's been a blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys on the teams we play are jealous. They tell me they wish
they could play this style.''
</P>
<P>
   Grinnell's offensive possessions rarely last more than 15
seconds. The 35-second shot clock buzzer went off in a recent game,
but it was a timing error. Arseneault can never remember his team
having a shot-clock violation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most overpaid guy in our gym,'' said Arseneault, ``is the
shot-clock operator.''

 &HT;    Diller puts focus on Internet shoppingBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ People want to shop online. They want to shop more
than they want to read articles Republican-bashing articles in
Salon, more than they want to ogle models from Victoria's Secret
and more than they want to check stock prices on eTrade.
</P>
<P>
   What today's Web surfers really want to do is buy books from
Amazon, CDs from Music Boulevard, sweaters from J. Crew and jeans
from the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   So, get out your credit cards and take a good look at the future
of the Internet. It's brought to you by media visionary Barry
Diller _ with a little help from number three Web portal, Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Diller's track record of media trend bandwagon jumping is
impressive and legendary. He may lag somewhat on follow through _
but for now that's beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Diller saw the future of television as
serving a nation of couch potatoes buying jewelry and computers
from 24-hour cable shopping channels. He ditched his job running
Rupert Murdoch's embryonic and cutting edge Fox network to snap up
the QVC cable shopping channel in a move many thought was career
suicide. And by the way it was Diller who originally coined the
phrase ``the 500 channel universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, now it's the Web that holds the promise of millions and
millions of unique channel offerings, not cable. In 1999, Diller
looked into his fairly reliable crystal ball and saw the future
again. This time it was time-crunched Web surfers using the Web to
buy everything from groceries to concert tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Diller's vision for the Web is a world where commerce not
content is king, something analysts agree is a pretty shrewd idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to shop online _ that's what people want to do,''
says Forrester analyst Bill Bass.
</P>
<P>
   This deal really is different from other media company/portal
mergers according to Bass. ``Diller is the only media guy who has
focused on commerce as content and online that's what wins,'' Bass
says.
</P>
<P>
   Casting a clear eye to the new millennium, Diller has assembled
his own Internet network of information, entertainment and
commerce. It's exactly the kind of thing America Online's Bob
Pittman has been talking about for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a period of new convergence,'' Diller said in a
conference call with Lycos CEO Bob Davis, ``information,
entertainment and direct selling. ``We believed we needed a
national portal to link to our local portals,'' he said displaying
command of Web jargon and business acumen. ``We needed an
aggregation of eyeballs. Together with Lycos, we could lay down
these paths for commerce we were so deeply involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger with Lycos (http://www.lycos.com) one of the last
independent Web portals and the third largest Internet search
directory with a growing network of Web sites in its own right,
creates a new Internet entity to be called USA/Lycos Interactive
Networks. And it will include a staggering collection of Web sites.
From Diller comes Ticketmaster Online, the local Web portals from
the CitiSearch Network and the Home Shopping Club. Diller's USA
Network and the Home Shopping Club cable channels will also
contribute to the promotion and commerce aspects of the new
company. From Lycos, comes the Lycos Web portal, Wired News, the
Hot Bot Search Engine and the Tripod network.
</P>
<P>
   This aggregation of Web sites and products and Diller's
involvement in the project is yet another signal that the Web is no
longer a toy. It's a big business where, with the right business
model and the right aggregation of content there is a lot of money
to be made.
</P>
<P>
   The Diller/Lycos deal really is a different kind of portal/media
alliance. The combination of the Lycos portal hooked up with
Ticketmaster and Home Shopping. ``You now have a major portal
hooked up with Ticketmaster and Home Shopping,'' Bass says. ``It's
a blend of internet and commerce that really is a different kind of
deal from the deals the other portals made with major media
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last July, Lycos' Davis said his company would remain
independent, but the sheer size and reach of the Lycos/Diller
combination would be too much for even the most high-minded portal
player. ``This is a way for Lycos, to become bigger and better in a
hurry,'' Bass says. ``Yahoo and AOL were extending their reach
through deals with CBS and FOX respectively and Lycos had to do
something dramatic.'' Recent media mergers such as Disney and
Infoseek, Excite and At Home, NBC and Snap made it impossible for
Lycos to go it alone. ``They had to partner with someone,'' Bass
says. ``This still doesn't put Lycos even close to AOL or Yahoo but
it still keeps them in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like that old saying, no politician looks in the mirror
and sees a dog catcher. They all see the president of the United
States. It's the same with portals. They don't look into the mirror
and see niche markets. They see AOL or Yahoo, and it will be a
while before anybody admits that those two are going to be hard to
catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass and his fellow analysts say the portal shakeout is still
far from over, but Diller's vision of an e-shopping nation set the
wheels in motion for a new wave of acquisition frenzy in an
environment where media companies and their customers will shop
till they drop.

ADVERTISING: COCA-COLA REWORKING CAMPAIGN FOR SURGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to bolster the ``urge'' in Surge, the
Coca-Cola Co. is revamping its advertising and marketing approaches
for the fledgling soft-drink brand.
</P>
<P>
   Surge was introduced in early 1997 as the second Coca-Cola entry
in the so-called heavy citrus segment of the soft-drink market,
which is dominated by the Mountain Dew brand sold by the Pepsi-Cola
Co. unit of Pepsico Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Dew commands about two-thirds of the heavy citrus
category, which accounts for about $5 billion of the estimated $55
billion in soft drinks sold annually. That dwarfs brands like Mello
Yello, the first Coca-Cola effort to lure drinkers of citrus soda
with more caffeine and calories than colas.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are intended to heighten Surge's appeal to the
intended core audience of males ages 12 to 24, who now consider
Mountain Dew, in the parlance of youth, all that.
</P>
<P>
   To amplify the message, Coca-Cola will spend about $40 million
this year on Surge, about 10 percent more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   There will be new television commercials by the Surge agency,
the Leo Burnett USA unit of the Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago, which
are less dark and edgy than the original spots. The brand's initial
theme, ``Feed the rush,'' is being replaced with a less complex
line, ``Life's a scream.'' And the logo and package graphics are
being redesigned to be lighter and brighter.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to ``energize the brand for the next phase of
growth,'' Doug Jackson, senior brand manager for Surge at Coca-Cola
in Atlanta, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've listened to our consumers,'' he added, ``and learned
what we think is a better way to articulate'' the attributes and
personality of the brand.
</P>
<P>
   The reworking of the pitch for Surge embodies the moves that are
often necessary to freshen brands in competitive consumer product
categories. That's particularly true when a brand confronts a
dominant challenger that is also continually changing; Pepsi-Cola
last month redesigned the graphics for Mountain Dew and ran a
humorous new commercial for the brand just before the start of
Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain Dew is a formidable competitor,'' said John D.
Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, a newsletter based
in Bedford Hills, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think Coca-Cola will stay with Surge? Absolutely,'' he
added. ``Do I think it will grow? Absolutely. But it will be a slow
build.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surge is a newborn, an infant; we've got to nurture it,'' he
said. ``We're committed to a long-term sight line for this brand.
Our focus is to really build drink by drink, month by month.''
</P>
<P>
   That is an approach Coca-Cola has taken in other niche segments
of the beverage market where its products face larger rivals:
Fruitopia, competing against Snapple; Nestea, competing against
Lipton, and Powerade, competing against Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   After many years, Coca-Cola has succeeded in dethroning 7Up, the
leader in lemon-lime soft drinks, with its Sprite brand.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, though, is that Coca-Cola's forays into such niches
are measured against its superior standing in the cola, diet cola
and lemon-lime categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making Surge a success is a real challenge for Coca-Cola,''
said Gary A. Hemphill, vice president at the Beverage Marketing
Corp., a consulting company in New York, because ``it's in the
unenviable position of battling an established brand, Mountain Dew,
that has been on a sales juggernaut for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson acknowledged that ``because we are Coca-Cola, the
expectation on the part of a lot of people is that we hit the home
run, have the category leader in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``With Surge, as with all our brands, we're never
satisfied. We can always do better.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Coca-Cola conducted research indicating that the
previous Surge campaign, centered on large groups of grungy
teen-age males engaged in intense sports in dark, moody settings,
was off kilter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign was grounded in the two core teen values of
action and sociability, but was initially focused on the intensity
more than the sociability,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a more balanced communication,'' he added, because
``the research we conducted showed that when we effectively
communicate social bonding, our advertising is 10 times more
persuasive.''
</P>
<P>
   So in three new commercials, the teen-agers are in smaller
groups and there is much more interaction among them. In one spot,
for instance, two friends play a prank on a third. It's no
coincidence that spot is set outside a convenience store, which is
the primary outlet for sales of heavy citrus soft drinks along with
stores attached to service stations.
</P>
<P>
   In a second spot, a young black man spends a frantic night out
with his posse of multicultural friends. A third spot seems to be a
younger, hipper version of the popular ``Da Da Da'' commercial for
Volkswagen, showing an interracial pair of teen-age guys driving
aimlessly around a test track, watching a can of Surge slide from
one side of the dashboard to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The casting of those spots is meant to give them ``a more urban
feel,'' Jackson said, ``and with urban kids today, there's more of
a melding of the races.'' That is, by the way, a trademark of the
hit campaigns for Tommy Hilfiger apparel, a hot brand among the
``Generation Y'' youth market that also adores Mountain Dew.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials will begin running on Monday with what Jackson
described as ``a youth-targeted media spike'' through Wednesday,
during which ``62 percent of all males 12 to 24 will see this
advertising approximately three times.'' The spots will appear on
series like ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ``Dawson's Creek,''
``Moesha,'' ``Party of Five'' and ``Sister, Sister.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also radio commercials; some print advertisements with
hockey themes, pegged to Surge's designation as the ``official soft
drink'' of the National Hockey League, and an extensive promotional
campaign centered on roller coasters at the Six Flags chain of
amusement parks.

SORTING OUT THE PLAYERS AT THE KOSOVO PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ In the bush of Kosovo, Hashim Thaci is
known as ``the snake.'' No-one seems to be quite sure why, but some
suggest that the 29-year-old political science graduate of a Swiss
university has the ability to slither away from battles, just in
time.
</P>
<P>
   For the negotiators at the Kosovo peace talks, Thaci is a key
figure: tough, smart, ambitious and arrogant.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats who know Thaci as the head of the political
directorate of the Kosovo Liberation Army say it is hard to figure
out exactly how he thinks or where he stands. One diplomat said he
believed that Thaci was open to Western ideas and democratic
institutions; another said he believed that he could well be
influenced by Marxist thought.
</P>
<P>
   Such uncertainties about the characters in the 16 member
Albanian delegation to the peace talks, and to a lesser extent on
the Serbian side, is one of the many factors that make the outcome
of the negotiations at a chateau here unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 member Serbian delegation, there are three known
quantities _ men who are adjutants to the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who has stayed in Belgrade, is the missing man at
Rambouillet because, the negotiators acknowledge, he will be the
sole arbiter of whether the Serbs accept a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But of the top Serbian delegates, Western diplomats are quite
familiar with Nikola Sainovic, 50, a deputy prime minister of
Yugoslavia, the point man for Milosevic in Kosovo, and Ratko
Markovic, 54, a Serbian deputy prime minister, is a lawyer who
drafted the 1990 Serbian constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The intimate involvement of Sainovic in Kosovo was illustrated
last month after telephone conversations he had with a Serbian
general, Sreten Lukic, were listened to by Western diplomats. They
showed that Sainovic tried to cover up the circumstances of a
massacre of ethnic Albanian civilians last month at the Kosovo
village of Racak, the diplomats said. A report by international
monitors concluded that the killings were an act of revenge by
Serbian forces for the killing of four of their men.
</P>
<P>
   But in the conversations, Sainovic could be heard asking if it
would be possible to make the killings look as if they were the
result of a battle between the Kosovo Liberation Army and the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested to the general that Louise Arbour, the chief
prosecutor of the international court for war crimes in the Hague,
Netherlands, be prevented from entering Kosovo. A few days later,
Ms. Arbour was stopped at a border crossing as she attempted to
enter Kosovo from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Sainovic is known around Belgrade as ``Saya Patton'' _ a
nickname intended to show his preference for scorched earth tactics
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Markovic, a law professor, represents Milosevic by
managing to ordain as legal whatever political maneuver Milosevic
needs, according to Serbian politicians. Markovic found the legal
justification for overturning the local elections that the
opposition parties won in Serbia in 1996, a ruling that produced
more than eight weeks of student demonstrations in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But as the negotiators deal with the two sides sequestered here,
the complexities of the ethnic Albanian delegation are the most
important to grasp. Before coming here, the delegates showed
varying signs of willingness to agree to autonomy for Kosovo _
instead of independence _ in exchange for a NATO-led ground force,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Rugova, who has been twice elected president of Kosovo
by the ethnic Albanians, is known well to the negotiators for his
decade-long campaign of passive resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But more vital to the negotiators will be the figures from the
insurgency and Veton Surroi, 37, a prominent newspaper publisher,
who presents himself as an independent in the murky world of ethnic
Albanian politics.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Yugoslav diplomat to Mexico and Bolivia, Surroi,
37, speaks excellent English, learned at an American school in La
Paz, and is a favorite of diplomats visiting Kosovo. But his blunt
manner and often contrary opinions have not won him favor in some
quarters of the State Department, where, as an occasional visitor,
he has not always shown deference to American policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clinton administration officials have recognized him as
perhaps the best bridge between the militant Kosovo Liberation Army
and the fairly ineffective Rugova. Surroi can often be found in the
restaurants of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, cell phone at hand,
and as the publisher of Koha Ditore, the largest-circulation paper
in Kosovo, he has an important platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can play a very positive role if he chooses,'' a Western
diplomat said of Surroi. ``He is someone the KLA will listen to.''
So far, Surroi has shown a sort of urbane disdain for the
negotiations, but colleagues say he has made little secret of his
ambition to be president of Kosovo, a factor that could shape his
decisions here.
</P>
<P>
   An important Kosovo Liberation Army official in the delegation
is Jakup Krasniqi, who is in his 50s and was held by the Serbs for
eight years as a political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats in Kosovo who dealt with Krasniqi during a
recent crisis, involving the release of eight Yugoslav soldiers
captured by the guerrillas, described him as fair. He is part of
the political directorate that holds together a network of the
KLA's regional warlords. In the last few months, Krasniqi has made
a point of traveling in many regions of Kosovo, diplomats said, and
seems to have concluded that the fighting should stop. ``He knows
the rank and file don't want more fighting,'' an American who knows
him said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost unknown to the negotiators is Xhavid Haliti, a key
organizer for the KLA. He has been based in the Albanian capital of
Tirana, and appears to have been in charge of overseeing the arms
flow over the northern Albanian mountains and into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   From outside Kosovo, Bujar Bukoshi, 51, a urologist based in
Germany, has been the major fund-raiser for the money that flows
from the Albanian diaspora. Since November, Bukoshi has been under
considerable pressure from Thaci, the head of the political
directorate of the KLA, who published an open ``declaration''
saying that Bukoshi had until Feb. 10 to put his funds entirely
behind the Kosovo Liberation Army.

 &HT;        SPECTER SUPPORTS OPENING FINAL DEBATE IN CLINTON TRIAL,
SANTORUM OPPOSES   By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 9, -- Sen. Arlen Specter supported a motion
that would have opened to the public the final debate in President
Clinton's impeachment trial, while Sen. Rick Santorum voted against
it.
</P>
<P>
   The motion gained a majority, 59-41, but failed to get the 67
votes needed to alter Senate rules. It was the first of several
votes on the issue of open government. Specter was one of 14
Republicans to join 45 Democrats in backing the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specter thought the final deliberations were an appropriate
time to open the doors,'' said John Ullyot, a Specter spokesman.
``It would allow constituents to witness the process that led their
Senators to vote the way they vote on the verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum, R-Pa., supported closing the doors, because he thought
it would bring the trial to a speedier conclusion, said his
spokesman Robert Traynham.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senator has maintained closed door deliberations are best
for the Senate,'' Traynham said. ``Opening the debate would have
encouraged Senators to politicize the process and drag it out even
longer. Santorum wants to take the politics out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of an open process won a compromise that made it
possible for Senators to voluntarily place their own statements in
the Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
   Another vote was taken, which forced Senators to approve closing
its doors.
</P>
<P>
   This time, most of the 14 Republicans who supported open debate,
chose to approve the closed door debate. If the motion failed to
get 51 votes, it could have forced the Senate to skip the debate
and go directly to a vote on whether to convict.
</P>
<P>
   Specter and Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison were the only two
Republicans to hold out in their desire to see the debate opened to
the public.

 &HT;    Super Show 'between rock and hard place' in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Atlanta prepares to welcome the 1999 Super Show,
convention officials are hoping next year won't be the last time
it's held in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Show, which begins Friday and ends Monday, is by far
the city's largest convention. But it is leaving after the year
2000. Although it is not open to the public, the sporting goods
industry show draws between 90,000 and 100,000 retailers,
manufacturers, sales agents and distributors. The Atlanta
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau estimates the show will have an
economic impact of $104 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Florida-based Sporting Goods Manufacturers
Association, which owns the Super Show, announced last year they
are moving the show to Las Vegas in 2001, 2002 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The problem boiled down to space. And not enough of it at the
Georgia World Congress Center, where the Super Show has been held
since 1986. Since then, the Super Show has nearly doubled in
attendance, from 55,000 to 100,158 last year. Demand for space also
has continued to grow, from 220,900 to 1.4 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The show had grown to the point that it was using temporary
structures in the parking lot, and rumors had circulated for some
time that a new home was being considered. It did not come as a
surprise when officials announced the show would be leaving
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were between a rock and a hard place,'' said SGMA President
John Riddle. ``It's a space problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has a number of things in its favor, including good
convention facilities, hotels, transportation and ``strong Southern
hospitality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very pleased with our relationship with Atlanta,''
Riddle said. ``We have a lot of friends there.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the GWCC is expanded, there is a chance the Super Show
will return.
</P>
<P>
   Riddle said no timetable has been set to made arrangements
beyond 2003. ``We will have ongoing discussions with the people in
Atlanta _ the Congress Center and the convention bureau,'' he said.
``There's no reason to put a deadline on it. It doesn't need one.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta convention officials hope to lure the show back to the
city in 2004 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we have not closed the door for Super Show, and we
are most anxious to bid on future Super Shows once our facilities
have been expanded to accommodate their growth,'' said Bill Howard,
vice president of public relations and tourism for the Atlanta
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``We maintain a very close
friendship, and contact, with Super Show decision-makers and will
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta's favor is a proposed $225 million expansion that
would include adding 420,000 square feet of exhibit space to the
GWCC, bringing the total to 1.4 million square feet. There would be
additional square footage added for ballrooms and meeting rooms.
Funding could be voted on by the Legislature ``in a matter of
weeks,'' said Dan Graveline, executive director of the GWCC. If
that occurs, construction could begin this spring, and the enlarged
facility could be available by summer of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, officials are working to draw other conventions to
fill the void. ``Obviously, we haven't wasted much time in going
after and soliciting other major shows'' to fill the space vacated
by the Super Show, said Howard.
</P>
<P>
   While getting the Super Show to return is a goal, Graveline said
an expanded GWCC would be beneficial in luring other conventions
and meetings here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not justify building an expansion just on the Super
Show,'' he said. ``That would be like building a church just for
Easter Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting Super Show to return will take lots of work.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's most likely competitors are Orlando and New Orleans,
both of which have either recently undergone or plan expansions at
their convention centers.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center has
undergone two expansions since it opened in 1985. At the end of
February, the center will have 1.1 million square feet of
contiguous exhibit space, two ballrooms, 140 meeting rooms and
4,000-seat conference auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is expansion,'' said Bettie Mebane, a
spokeswoman for the convention center.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently Orlando's Orange County Convention Center, located
about 15 minutes from Disney World, has 1.1 million square feet of
exhibit space and 350,000 square feet of meeting space. During the
first quarter of 2003, the center plans to expand its exhibit space
by a million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando convention center spokeswoman Kathy Canning said the
city has long been interested in luring the Super Show, one of the
nation's top conventions in terms of attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Show would be a major booking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely booking for the show could be on an east-west
rotation basis. The show could move to an eastern city one year and
back to the west the next. Or the time between rotations could be
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Samuels, sales executive of the Las Vegas Convention &AMP;
Visitors Authority, said SGMA officials ``have already asked us for
some (information on ) additional dates in 2007, 2008 and 2009.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition is fierce because the show has such a large economic
impact. It ripples through all segments of Atlanta's business
community _ from hotels and restaurants to caterers, limousine
services and shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Brewer said the show's absence will be a major loss.
Brewer, owner of Tony Brewer &AMP; Co., a special events planning and
decorating business, said he typically hires between 15 and 20
free-lancer stylists to work during the show. Over the last decade,
his company has decorated booths and reception areas for such
clients as Nike, Reebok and K-Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Without Super Show, his company ``will look at other things that
we may have turned down for this period and also get revved up for
our next busiest months, which are March and April,'' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes the year 2000 won't be his last Super Show. But
he has spoken to clients about working for them in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Show is one of the best conventions of the year,'' said
Randy Cook, general manager of The Cheesecake Factory restaurant.
``It gives us a huge opportunity to increase sales and volume.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook estimates that volume increases as much as 10 percent for
the week, compared to a typical week in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to miss this show,'' he said.

BIPARTISAN CENSURE PLAN GAINS STEAM, BUT STILL FACES HURDLES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators who favor rebuking President Clinton said
Tuesday that the Senate's decision to close its final deliberations
may speed the debate and buy them time to consider censure before a
holiday recess begins this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan draft censure picked up new support Tuesday from
two moderate Republicans, Olympia Snowe of Maine and Jim Jeffords
of Vermont, after the measure's authors added new wording that
urged future Congresses to honor the reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   The new language, added at Snowe's insistence, says: ``The
United States Senate recognizes the historic gravity of this
bipartisan resolution, and trusts and urges that future congresses
will recognize the importance of allowing this bipartisan statement
of censure and condemnation to remain intact for all time.''
</P>
<P>
   President Andrew Jackson was censured in 1834, in a policy
dispute involving the nation's finances, but that reprimand was
repealed three years later when Jackson's allies took control of
the Senate. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, is fond of reminding
colleagues that Jackson's image now graces the $20 bill.
</P>
<P>
   Two conservatives who initially opposed censure, Sens. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., and Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., inched closer to
backing the reprimand, after reviewing the revised version written
by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But the big hurdle remained bringing the resolution to the
Senate floor for a vote in the face of a double-barreled obstacle:
a threatened filibuster from Gramm, and the Senate's scheduled
February recess, which is scheduled to begin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it's got some rocky sledding,'' said Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., who backs censure. ``Everyone agrees we have to get
it up this week, and that itself presents problems.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate closing its final deliberations to public
viewing, censure supporters may have picked up a valuable day to
build support and overcome procedural roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott had scheduled votes on the two
impeachment articles for Friday. But with some senators not
expected to use all of their 15-minute allotments, if any at all,
Lott told reporters that the decisive votes could come Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Thursday conclusion leaves a crucial period of time at the
end of this week,'' Chafee said, ``during which we can deliberate
and vote on a tough, bipartisan censure resolution.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lott, however, still has not signaled whether he supports
censure, much less a vote on it before the recess. He has been
adamant about not addressing the issue until after the final
impeachment votes.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, about 40 of the 45 Democrats are likely to endorse
the proposed censure resolution as a way to express their
condemnation of the president's misconduct with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The measure needs only a simple majority, or 51 votes, to pass.
But to overcome Gramm's filibuster threat, supporters need to
muster 60 votes. That means 20 of the 55 Republicans would have to
line up behind the rebuke for it to prevail. Many of them,
including McConnell, do not want acquittal to be the last word on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a fiercely committed bloc of Republicans who say
censure is an unconstitutional political ploy wielded by Democrats
who want political cover for their likely votes to acquit the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of like Dracula,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.,
who opposes censure. ``You think you've put a stake through its
heart, but it's still there. The bottom line is, at this hour,
censure's not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., said the censure draft failed to
rebuke the president for lying under oath and obstructing justice,
the two impeachment articles. ``If he didn't perjure himself or
obstruct justice, then it would seem to me that they're just
condemning an extramarital affair,'' said Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans say Bennett's arguments, in party caucuses and
in private conversations, have been persuasive. ``I started out not
being supportive of it, but I'm moving to being more open,'' said
Coverdell. ``Anything that's bipartisan is historically useful.''
</P>
<P>
   And senators from both parties took jabs at Gramm's
obstructionist tactics. ``No real purpose is served by denying
Democrats the vote, and there could well be something in it for us
as well: Not leaving this with an acquittal,'' said McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., expressed the frustration of
many Democrats: ``I wish people like Senator Gramm would just
content themselves with voting against censure instead of depriving
the rest of us in both parties who favor censure, from expressing
our point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to end in a unifying statement of national
values,'' Lieberman added, ``instead of another petty procedural
Senate fight.''

 &HT;    Medical conditions illustrated in 3-D

<P>
   ATLANTA _ ADAM Internet Health has acquired a library of videos
that can be used to illustrate _ in three-dimensional animation _
various medical conditions as they appear inside the body. The
announcement of the purchase from an Austrailian development
company came Tuesday from the Atlanta-based company.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM's use of the Net is aimed at exploiting the growing use of
``streaming'' technology that lets computer users download and
watch video, said Robert S. Cramer Jr., ADAM's chairman and chief
executive. The company also depends on increasing use of broadband
technologies like digital subscriber lines and cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   But ADAM also will work CNN Newsource Sales, a Time Warner
company, to distribute the new video content to television
stations, which can use it to illustrate health and medical news
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ADAM recently announced a change of its name to reflect its new
Net-reliant strategy.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T and Bells square off for National Press Club
 &HT;    By Mary Beth Regan
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long-simmering battle between long-distance
giant AT&AMP;T Corp. and the regional Bell telephone companies may boil
over today as the companies hold dueling events at the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, the chairman of AT&AMP;T, is slated to give
the club's luncheon speech, recapping the company's bold moves in
recent months to regain its status as the nation's dominant phone
company.
</P>
<P>
   That event will be followed quickly by a news conference
featuring the U.S. Telephone Association's president, Roy Neel, who
plans to discuss the Bell companies' position that they have been
unfairly locked out of long-distance competition.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back events underscore the competition within the
telecommunications industry as companies scramble to offer
customers integrated services including voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has sent shivers down its rivals' spines in recent weeks,
announcing a partnership with Time Warner Inc. and its intent to
buy Tele-Communications Inc., both major cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by regulators, these deals would enable AT&AMP;T to sell
local and long-distance telephone service directly to consumers,
rather than relying on the networks of the regional Bells.
</P>
<P>
   The deals also would give AT&AMP;T access to millions of cable
customers across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The regional Bells, consumer groups and Internet service
providers such as America Online Inc. have argued that an AT&AMP;T-TCI
conglomerate should be required to share its cable lines with
competitors. Their reasoning is that regional Bell companies must
make their telephone networks available to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, expected to approve the
AT&AMP;T-TCI merger in coming weeks, is not likely to take that
position. On Thursday, FCC Chairman William E. Kennard said he
would not require AT&AMP;T to share its cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   The press club's decision to feature Armstrong as a luncheon
speaker hit a nerve with the regional Bells. At first, the
companies demanded a similar lunch appearance, club officials said,
but then settled for a separate event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Press Club refused to give us the same venue as AT&AMP;T,''
said BellSouth's spokesman John Schneidawind. ``But we'll be there
to respond to what's likely to be a Bell-bashing session.''

AFTER JORDAN TRIP, CRITICS SAY YELTSIN'S TOO ILL TO RULE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Boris Yeltsin's decision to attend the funeral of
Jordan's King Hussein was supposed to be a vivid demonstration that
the 68-year-old president is still capable of ruling Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But the trip ended up as a showcase for Yeltsin's frailty, and
it gave fresh ammunition to critics who say he is too ill to
govern.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed an ailing president, who shuffled
along with the help of his aides. Unlike other world leaders,
Yeltsin cut his visit short and did not file by the king's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   And while Kremlin officials sought to put the trip in the best
light, they acknowledge that Yeltsin made the decision to go to
Amman, Jordan, late Sunday evening against the recommendation of
doctors and members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors were against it,'' Dmitry Yakushkin, Yeltsin's
spokesman, said in an interview. ``Even his family was not very
happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yakushkin said that te trip proved nonetheless that Yeltsin is
in charge and that Russia intends to remain an active player in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president knew that King Hussein was an important figure
and wanted to express his personal regrets,'' Yakushkin added.
``Gestures count, and the Arab leaders really appreciated it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian press, however, took a dimmer view, casting the
mission as a dubious and even embarrassing effort by Yeltsin to
reassert his authority at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin did not make it to the grave, but was very close to
it,'' said the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, alluding to
Yeltsin's decision not to file past the king's coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Yeltsin has every reason to want to show that he is
still fit enough to govern Russia. His adversaries contend that he
is too ill to serve and have demanded that he step down.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's pugnacious mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, has taken to flaunting
his physical vigor by skiing and playing soccer on weekends before
the television cameras. He tells journalists that Russia needs an
active, vigorous president and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's own prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has sought to
expand his own authority to fill the void at the Kremlin. Primakov
recently went so far as to send a letter to the Parliament
proposing a political truce with the Communist-led body without
securing Yeltsin's consent in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, Yeltsin would have relinquished his
authority to disband the Parliament. In return, the legislature
would have shelved threats to take a ``no confidence'' vote on the
Yeltsin government or to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin objected to giving up his powers, however. And Primakov
worked out a watered-down version of the compromise on Friday at
the president's instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov was back in the news early Sunday, when Russian news
agencies reported that he would represent Russia at Hussein's
funeral. It was only fitting, Primakov's supporters said, given his
long involvement in the Middle East, first as a reporter for Pravda
and then as a diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   But that would only have strengthened the view that the prime
minister, not Yeltsin, was running Russia.
</P>
<P>
   So Yeltsin used Hussein's death to remind the world that it is
too soon to speak of his own, Russian analysts say. He went to
Jordan even though, after his recent hospitalization for a bleeding
ulcer, his doctors had advised him against flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin flew to Amman not only to pay his last
respects to the Jordanian monarch,'' noted the newspaper Kommersant
Daily. ``The Russian president undertook the arduous journey in
order to straighten things out at home.''
</P>
<P>
   If that was the purpose, the effort fell short.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The anti-Primakov press hailed the trip as a sign that Yeltsin
had come back to life. Nezavisimaya Gazeta, which is controlled by
the financier Boris Berezovsky, said that the visit represented the
``political resurrection'' of the president. Primakov has sought to
neutralize Berezovsky, by ordering police raids of his major
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But that was very much a minority view. The dominant assessment
was that Yeltsin had succeed mainly in parading his infirmities in
front of Russian television and the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was not in particularly good form,'' said
Vladimir Lukin, a member of the Liberal Yabloko party and a leading
legislator. ``We all observed that.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip even assumed a Keystone Kops quality when a Russian
plane full of presidential communications equipment returned from
Amman and taxied into the parked plane of the visiting Italian
prime minister at Moscow's airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin, however, was not deterred. It insisted that Yeltsin
had made a good accounting of himself and would demonstrate his
vigor again in March by going to Paris.

 &HT;    Gulfstream profits sky-high
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Profits at high-flying Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. rose
sharply in the fourth quarter, and the Savannah, Ga.-based
jet-maker said it will boost production in 1999 to meet a growing
order backlog.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream posted a $64.5 million profit, or 87 cents a share,
for the quarter, vs. a pro forma $44.4 million, or 58 cents a share
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat expectations by about 3 cents and pushed
Gulfstream stock to $52 a share, up 89 1/2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $741.3 million, from $540.9
million, as Gulfstream delivered 17 new jets, up from 14 a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, the company posted profits of $225.3 million,
or $3 per share, compared with $243 million, or $3.12 a share, in
1997. The prior-year results were affected by a one-time tax
credit. Revenue rose to $2.43 billion for the year, from $1.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream said it will boost production to 65 aircraft this
year, up from 61 delivered in 1998. The company said it took orders
for 90 planes, up from 46 a year earlier. That boosted the order
backlog to 119.

   Gulfstream, controlled by New York financier Theodore J.
Forstmann, builds two jets, the GIVSP and the larger GV.

   KARACHI-CRIME (Karachi, Pakistan) _ Murderous and macabre,
Karachi is a patch quilt of robust commerce and urban detritus,
where for nearly a decade, two predatory political factions with
terrorist elements have fought each other and, very often, the
police and the army. Karachi has slipped back and forth between
times of deadly mayhem and brutal crackdowns, and now is a period
of crackdown. Much of Pakistan, not just Karachi, suffers from
lawlessness. While the get-tough tactics of Pakistan's Prime
Minister, Nawaz Sharif, may combat crime, it is commonly believed
that he also wants tighter control over his economically troubled
country at a time when his popularity has plummeted. By Barry

JORDANIANS GRIEVE LOST KING, HOPE CONDITIONS IMPROVE UNDER NEW
MONARCH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ Thousands of Jordanians from desert camps, urban
shacks and sleek modern villas made their way to the royal palace
Tuesday to offer sympathy to King Abdullah and prayers for his late
father, King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Noor, the widow of Hussein, and other women in the royal
family prayed separately for the first time at the king's grave.
</P>
<P>
   A day after a remarkable state funeral, Tuesday's pageants were
suffused with a personal touch that reflected the emotional bond
that since 1923 has helped to hold Jordan together as a kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe Abdullah will be fine,'' said Sheik Samir Aroumti,
57, who waited with others from all across Jordan to meet with the
new, 37-year-old king in the throne chamber of Raghadan Palace.
``This cub is from the lion king.''
</P>
<P>
   The events of the day were rooted in tradition _ tribal shows of
fealty to a monarch, along with calculated modern tributes to a
court that in one way or another remains Jordan's dominant force.
But they also clearly reflected true grief, as well as a hope that
a new generation on the throne might bring fresh attention to
problems at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The late king, God protect him, was loved by the world,'' said
Khalid al-Magaab, 28, who was among the crowd. ``We know that
Abdullah will be loved as well, especially if these hard times can
be made lighter.''
</P>
<P>
   For most Jordanians, the immediate concern is unemployment,
which private economists say has soared to a rate far higher than
the official figure of 15 percent. Most salaries have remained
stagnant, even as inflation has cut deeply into the paychecks of
most government workers.
</P>
<P>
   But a sense of pride still echoed Tuesday in the words of many
Jordanians, from Cabinet ministers to Bedouin tribesmen. They took
satisfaction not only in the numbers of leaders who came to the
funeral on Monday but also in the fact that the occasion prompted a
warm gesture from Syria, a powerful neighbor generally regarded
more often as threat than friend. The Syrian president, Hafez
Assad, made a surprise trip to Jordan for the funeral and was the
first in line to pay tribute to Abdullah, who was just 8 years old
when Assad took power.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Jordan have been at odds, off and on, even before the
new king was born. In 1958, at a time of anti-Western ferment,
Syrian jets tried to force from the skies an aircraft carrying
Hussein to Europe. In 1970, Syria sent troops into Jordan as
Hussein's forces sent Palestinian guerrillas fleeing, but it did
not intervene. In 1980 it massed troops along the Jordanian border,
accusing Jordan of supporting a campaign of violence by the Muslim
Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   And since 1994, when Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel,
relations have been all but frozen by Syria, which has not made
peace with Israel and has objected vehemently to the unilateral
accords signed by other Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had not visited Jordan since 1994, and he last met with
King Hussein in 1996. At the state funeral on Monday, he was
accompanied by his foreign minister, Farouq al-Sharaa. After
passing through the receiving line, he was among those who spoke at
length with the new king in the plush gold couches of a royal
salon.
</P>
<P>
   From Damascus, Syrian officials have also sent conciliatory
gestures, expressing hope that the change of leadership might mark
a new chapter between the countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, as Hussein lay dying, Sharaa sent an important
signal, saying in a lecture in Damascus that Syria no longer
intended to make much of an issue of the Israeli-Jordanian peace.
Syria remains opposed to the accord, said Sharaa, but does not want
to see Israeli-Jordanian ties supercede those between Jordan and
fellow Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The overtures may reflect a softening of the fury felt by
Damascus toward the Israeli-Jordanian peace. But more likely,
diplomats said Tuesday, it reflects a hope that a younger, more
malleable Jordanian ruler might prove less bold than Hussein, and
more inclined to toe a pan-Arab line.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, which to Jordan is another powerful, sometimes worrying
neighbor, has also expressed hope for a change in tone. The two
countries have been bitterly at odds in recent years, since Jordan,
having tilted toward Iraq during the Persian Gulf war of 1991,
reversed course in 1995. At that time, the Jordanian government
provided refuge to two powerful defectors and called for the first
time for a change in the Iraqi government. A cousin of Hussein
ruled Iraq until 1958 when he was overthrown and killed, adding to
the delicacy of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hussein's death the Iraqi government has issued no
official comment. Unlike its neighbors in the Arab world, Iraq's
state television did not cover the funeral except as part of
regular new reports. Still, Iraqi newspapers reported Tuesday that
Abdullah had told an Iraqi emissary at the funeral that his country
was prepared to consider ``means of enhancing'' Iraqi-Jordanian
ties, which are important to both countries' economies.

OSCAR NODS GO TO `SHAKESPEARE,' `RYAN,' `LIFE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fickle Oscar smiled on Shakespeare and Steven Spielberg, dissed
Jim Carrey, and turned Roberto Benigni, the Italian Charlie
Chaplin, into an American household word Tuesday. Which is another
way of saying that ``Shakespeare in Love'' received 13 Oscar
nominations, Spielberg's ``Saving Private Ryan'' was nominated 11
times, and Benigni's ``Life Is Beautiful'' became the first film
since ``Z'' to be nominated for best film and best foreign film,
and more besides.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Shakespeare in Love'' nods from the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences included best picture, director, actress
(for Gwyneth Paltrow), supporting actress (for Judi Dench),
supporting actor (for Geoffrey Rush), and original screenplay (for
Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard). The record for nominations is 14,
held by ``All About Eve'' in 1951 and ``Titanic'' last year. The
record for most Oscar wins is 11, shared by ``Ben-Hur'' and
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' is the odds-on favorite to win the best
picture and best director awards for Spielberg, and possibly a
third Oscar for Tom Hanks as best actor. Speaking by phone from
Berlin, where he flew to accept an award Tuesday night, Spielberg
told the Globe: ``This kind of news, I had to find a wall to lean
against. I was relieved and joyful. I was told about the
nominations because I didn't want to camp out around a TV set. I
couldn't take the anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Continuing in a vintage Woody Allen vein, Spielberg added: ``I
can make good pictures, but I'm not a very self-confident person.
I'm always dubious about whether my own branch of the Academy is
going to nominate me. I'd never predict. I'd never prepare an
acceptance speech. I'd rather prepare for not winning. It worked
better that way with `Schindler's List.' I'm just happy I'm getting
a ticket and a seat and a nice-looking person will sit in it if I
have to go to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Weinstein, whose little giant, Miramax Films, released
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Life Is Beautiful,'' said from New
York: ``The double shock was too good to be believed. We have this
ritual, my family and I. We watch the nominations at home in bed on
``The Today Show.'' Every time we get one, my two daughters, 4 and
1, jump on my bed. This year they broke the mattress.'' Weinstein
had predicted a ``Saving Private Ryan'' sweep, but now says his
hopes for a ``Shakespeare'' versus ``Ryan'' race have been newly
enkindled.
</P>
<P>
   The best picture nominees are either about men with guns in
World War II (``Saving Private Ryan,'' ``The Thin Red Line,'' and
``Life Is Beautiful'') or men in tights during the Elizabethan era
(``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Elizabeth''). Cate Blanchett's young
Elizabeth is facing off against Paltrow's stagestruck romantic in
``Shakespeare in Love,'' Meryl Streep's cancer-stricken mom in
``One True Thing,'' Felicia Montenegro's surrogate mom in the
Brazilian ``Central Station,'' and Emily Watson as cellist
Jacqueline du Pre in ``Hilary and Jackie.'' It was Streep's 11th
nomination, tying her with Jack Nicholson and leaving her one shy
of Katharine Hepburn's record-setting 12.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Dench's best supporting actress nomination as the
highhanded and mischievous Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in Love''
means that for the second year in a row different actresses will
have been nominated for playing the same character. Last year Kate
Winslett and Gloria Stuart were nominated for playing the same
woman in ``Titanic.'' Other best actress nominees include Kathy
Bates for ``Primary Colors,'' Brenda Blethyn for ``Little Voice,''
Rachel Griffiths for ``Hilary and Jackie,'' and Lynn Redgrave for
``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing with Hanks's rescue mission leader for best actor are
Benigni's father who plays games to shield his young son from the
horrors of a concentration camp, Nick Nolte's struggling small-town
cop in ``Affliction,'' Edward Norton's neo-Nazi who sees the light
in ``American History X,'' and Ian McKellen's tormented
``Frankenstein'' director, James Whale, in ``Gods and Monsters.''
The best actor category produced the most conspicuous omissions _
Jim Carrey struggling to escape from TV into real life in ``The
Truman Show'' and Bill Murray's depressed tycoon in ``Rushmore,''
his best performance in years.
</P>
<P>
   In the best supporting actor category, James Coburn got his
first nomination for his abusive alcoholic patriarch in
``Affliction,'' throwing him up against Robert Duvall's shrewd
lawyer in ``A Civil Action,'' Ed Harris's godlike string-puller in
``The Truman Show,'' Geoffrey Rush's beleaguered theater owner in
``Shakespeare in Love,'' and Billy Bob Thornton's soulful sibling
in ``A Simple Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful,'' ``The Thin Red Line,'' and ``Elizabeth''
received seven nominations apiece. The recognition of ``The Thin
Red Line,'' including a best director nomination, was a vindication
for Terrence Malick, who hadn't made a film in 20 years.
Ironically, Malick's film about the Battle of Guadalcanal happened
to be the campaign in which the five Sullivan brothers _
inspiration for the ``Saving Private Ryan'' script _ lost their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``Elizabeth'' nominations did not include one for director
Shekhar Kapur, although Peter Weir got one for the underrecognized
``The Truman Show.'' John Madden (``Shakespeare in Love'') was the
other nominated director, along with Spielberg, Malick, and
Benigni. Other highly regarded candidates snubbed by Oscar, in
addition to Carrey and Murray, include Joan Allen and William H.
Macy as befuddled '50s TV sitcom parents upended by the intrusion
of two '90s teens in ``Pleasantville,'' and ``Out of Sight,'' a
sophisticated crime caper smiled upon by critics _ but few others.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the year's big prestige productions were all but
ignored, too _ ``Primary Colors,'' ``Beloved,'' and ``A Civil
Action.'' So was John Travolta, who gave impressive performances in
two of them, and Kimberly Elise and Thandie Newton, the very
different but equally spectacular daughters in ``Beloved.'' ``Out
of Sight,'' from an Elmore Leonard novel, got a best adapted
screenplay nod. The best original screenplay category pits the
nimble, witty ``Shakespeare in Love'' script by Norman and Stoppard
against the politically audacious screenplay by Warren Beatty and
Jeremy Pisker for ``Bulworth,'' another overlooked film.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest controversy this year is that attached to the
special lifetime achievement Oscar, usually considered a stately
ritual. The naming of this year's recipient, Elia Kazan, has
generated dissent because Kazan named names during the HUAC Red
scare era and remains a magnet for animosity. Meanwhile, this
year's Boston component of the Oscar race will consist of a
scientific and technical award to Avid Technology Inc., of
Tewksbury. The awards show will be tweaked this year, too. The
statues will be dished out on a Sunday night, March 21, on ABC,
with Whoopi Goldberg as MC.

 &HT;    Auburn director claims options explored before Tuberville got
job
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Auburn announced last Friday night that it was
buying its way out of a Sept. 2 football game with Florida State,
school officials hoped the controversy would die down in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Auburn's decision to pay $500,000 to get out of the
nationally-televised, and the ACC's threat of legal action,
continued to generate a lot of
</P>
<P>
   criticism and a lot ofquestions:
</P>
<P>
   In his public statements, Auburn athletics director David Housel
said the school started exploring its options concerning this game
last November. New coach Tommy Tuberville was hired on Nov. 30. Was
Tuberville promised, as part of his agreement to come to Auburn,
that the Florida State game would not be played?
</P>
<P>
   Housel said this week that at no time during their negotiatons
did he discuss scheduling with Tuberville. But there are strong
indications that someone connected to Auburn, most likely Trustee
Bobby Lowder, the school's infamous power broker, promised
Tuberville he would not have to play the Florida State game.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted Tuesday, Tuberville denied that anyone had promised
him that the game would not be played if he took the job at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought seriously about getting out of the game until
David (Housel) and I got back together at the first of the year,''
said Tuberville, who was previously the head coach at Mississippi.
``Then it was a matter of doing what both of us thought best for
Auburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 48 hours after Auburn said it was pulling out of the
Florida State game, the school announced that it had replaced it
with a home game against Appalachian State.
</P>
<P>
   How was that deal made so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Applachian State athletics director Roachel Laney said Tuesday
that he received an E-mail several weeks ago from Southern
Conference Commissioner Alfred White that a Division I school might
be looking for a game on Sept. 4. White did not identify the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Appalachian State had an opening because Wake Forest had dropped
the Mountaineers for this fall. Laney told White at that time that
he would be interested but said he had no personal contact with
Housel until last Friday, when Auburn made its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a coincidence that the Florida State game went away
exactly two days after national signing day and did Auburn coaches
use the game as a recruiting tool?
</P>
<P>
   Florida State coaches would not talk for the record, but
privately claim that Auburn used the game in recruiting knowing it
would not be played. Seminole coaches apparently countered by
telling recruits that Auburn did not want to play them.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville pointed out that as an assistant at Miami, he faced
Florida State nine times and was 7-2 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not afraid to play Florida State or anybody else,''
Tuberville said. ''That's not what this is about. This game doesnt
need to be played. Florida State had a lot of things to say about
Auburn during recruiting, things that weren't right.''
</P>
<P>
   Could Auburn's decision hurt the school in terms of future home
games on
</P>
<P>
   television?
</P>
<P>
   ESPN officials spent months putting the Florida State-Auburn
game together and are not happy that the Thursday night contest the
network was going to use to kick off its 1999 schedule is now gone.
Starting in October, ESPN select its games on a 10-day advance
basis and each week it will choose from several games for its
prime-time broadcasts on Saturday night. There have been
suggestions in athletics circles that given two equally attractive
home games, an Auburn home game could lose out.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN officials chose not to comment when asked about such a
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville said he knew the school would catch some heat for
this decision, but thinks the anger generated by this event is
unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I was hired to take care of the Auburn football program
and that's what I'm going to do,'' said Tuberville. ``Nobody at
Alabama is going to look out for Auburn. Nobody at Florida State is
going to do it. We have to do it. We determined that the best thing
for our kids was not to play the game. The people who are mad about
this thing are just thinking about themselves.''

   BOSTON _ If the state moves ahead with plans to add four new
area codes in eastern Massachusetts, it is likely that only
residents and businesses that get new phone numbers will get new
area codes, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Telecommunications and Energy is still hearing
testimony on the matter and hasn't taken a formal position yet, but
sources say the agency is leaning toward an approach that would
overlay new area codes over the existing ones. That would mean
existing customers would keep their area codes and phone numbers,
while any new numbers would be drawn from the overlay area codes.
</P>
<P>
   At four public hearings on the issue, including one Tuesday at
the agency, support for an overlay was unanimous from lawmakers,
business groups and homeowners. Everyone hoped new area codes could
be avoided by distributing existing numbers more efficiently, but
if that effort failed they favored an overlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not heard a single person stand up and say they're in
favor of a split,'' said Paul Vasington, the DTE commissioner
specializing in telecommunications issues.
</P>
<P>
   A split is the traditional approach to area code creation. The
DTE adopted that approach two years ago when 617 and 508 were
sliced in half to create 781 and 978. The overlay approach was shot
down then primarily because it would require everyone to dial 10
numbers instead of seven to complete a local call.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of another split so soon after the last one
appears to have made the dialing issue moot. Business groups
testified Tuesday that they favor an overlay because they wouldn't
need to change their signs and stationery again. Alarm companies
said an overlay would cause them far less disruption than a split.
</P>
<P>
   And residents of East Boston, who fear a split would squeeze
them right out of 617, said being placed in a new area code would
have the effect of removing them from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's already a misperception out there that we're not part
of Boston,'' testified Regina Marchi of East Boston. ``The last
thing we need is to have our neighborhood have a whole new area
code.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of telephone companies seeking to break into the local
market here favor a split instead of an overlay. They say an
overlay would give a competitive advantage to Bell Atlantic because
it has the most numbers in the existing area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Elena French, a spokeswoman for MCI WorldCom, also pointed out
that the overlay approach can be confusing. It would mean next-door
neighbors could have phone numbers with different area codes. It
could also mean a home seeking a second phone line could end up
with two phone numbers with two different area codes.
</P>
<P>
   The DTE is expected to decide how to create four new area codes
sometime this spring or early summer. At the same time, the agency
is reviewing various options that might lengthen the life of the
existing area codes and postpone the need for the new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The area codes are running out of numbers not because consumers
are using so many more of them, but because telephone companies are
gobbling them up in a wasteful manner. Numbers are currently
distributed in blocks of 10,000 and companies seeking to compete in
all of eastern Massachusetts often need to draw hundreds of
thousands of numbers even though they need only a tiny fraction of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Under current forecasts, the 508 area code is expected to run
out of numbers in the second quarter of next year, while 781 and
978 are due to expire in the third quarter. Forecasts call for 617
to run out of numbers in the first quarter of 2001.

IMPEACHMENT DELIBERATIONS OF 1868 REMAIN A `BLACK HOLE' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a political cliffhanger of the highest order until well
into the fateful roll call, and still, nearly 131 years later, the
final Senate deliberations over the impeachment of Andrew Johnson
remain a historical black hole.
</P>
<P>
   For two and a half months, as the visitors' gallery filled and
emptied according to the drama of the arguments, Johnson's
presidency was picked apart in public. Had he humiliated the office
and the nation by showing up for official functions drunk and
speaking rudely of the Congress? Had he tried to undermine the
military? And most important in terms of the 11 articles of
impeachment brought against the president by defiant House
Republicans in late February 1868, had Johnson scorned the law
itself by firing Secretary of War Edwin Stanton?
</P>
<P>
   That late winter and spring, the nation heard the views of the
House impeachment managers and the president's lawyers. But in
keeping with their own rules, the senators never debated the case
in public. Except for the leaders of each camp, most did not
express their opinions on the evidence and arguments until after
the trial _ and only then, in written statements for the
congressional record.
</P>
<P>
   On issues of both procedure and substance, up to and including
their deliberations after closing arguments in the trial, they
consistently retreated to the ladies' parlor off the Senate floor
or ordered everyone out of the chambers for their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Only their votes were conducted in public.
</P>
<P>
   They maintained their silence so well that the verdict was in
doubt until the last moment. On the afternoon of May 16, during the
roll call vote on the central article of impeachment, seven
senators from the majority Republican side crossed over to join
Johnson's Democratic backers. The president survived because the
35-19 vote in favor of conviction was one vote short of the
necessary two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
   Although the brief House debate on impeaching Johnson had been
sometimes raucous and emotional, the senators appeared concerned
with upholding an ideal of decorum in their chamber and assuring
that the trial not badly irritate the still-raw wounds left by the
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson himself, the wartime vice-president who ascended to the
presidency after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, provoked strong
emotion. Sen. Charles Sumner of Massachusetts called the president
``the impersonation of the tyrannical slave power'' and Johnson's
resistance to the Republicans' stern Reconstruction policy put him
at constant loggerheads with the postwar Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Senate trial, which featured fiery arguments
from the House managers, there were hints that some of those
passions could erupt from the visitors' galleries.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-day summation of the anti-Johnson case by Rep.
John Bingham of Ohio, on May 6, people in the galleries began to
applaud and did not stop even as Chief Justice Salmon Chase, who
had presided over the trial with a firm hand, repeatedly called for
order. It took a contingent of police officers and ushers to clear
out the clapping and hissing crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, the Senate met in secret and reaffirmed its
intent to keep its deliberations not only private, but unrecorded.
</P>
<P>
   The senators announced that they had voted down a motion to have
a Senate note-taker at their closed-door discussions. Even motions
to permit senators to file written explanations of their views
after the votes were rejected again and again, until some of the
leading Republicans relented.
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, on May 11, the Senate met for a final time,
for about eight hours, before voting. No one other than the
senators, their aides and Chase was permitted inside the chamber,
leaving journalists and House members alike in a desperate search
for information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inquiry was made of everybody coming from the direction of
the Senate, `What's the latest news?' or `Who has last spoken, and
what course had he taken?''' The New York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   The leading historians of the Johnson impeachment say they have
never run across any accounts of what went on behind those closed
doors, even in the memoirs of senators who participated in the
political drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closest anybody came to a discussion of what went down in
there was one of the senators writing about 15 years later about
both the impeachment and the establishment of black suffrage,''
said Michael Les Benedict, a political scientist at Ohio State
University. ``He wrote that in the discussion in general, they were
afraid of the Senate acting like a mob.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the moment came to decide Andrew Johnson's fate, the
fear seemed misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   In the galleries, reporters wrote at the time, House members
were pale and nearly prostrate with anxiety. Friends of Sen.
Benjamin Wade, the president pro tem who would have taken Johnson's
place in the event of a conviction, jammed the press boxes,
excitedly speculating on who Wade might select for his Cabinet.
Police officers carrying clubs and revolvers patrolled the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, the Senate adjourned quickly, reconvening as an
impeachment court only once more, 10 days later, to vote on two
more of the articles. The vote was the same. The trial was declared
over. At the White House, Johnson threw a party that lasted for
days.

AMAZON.COM SAYS IT WILL STOP TAKING ADS FROM BOOKSELLERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.) (nk) 
By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with e-mail rebukes from its customers, the online
retailer Amazon.com on Tuesday revised its new advertising policy,
pledging to disclose every time when book publishers pay to feature
titles on its electronic bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company said it was still figuring out the
mechanics of this new policy, but it will take effect March 1. In
the meantime, Amazon has expanded its book-return policy to
demonstrate its faith in its recommendations, vowing to accept
titles from dissatisfied customers ``no matter how dog-eared or
worn it is,'' in the words of the company's chief executive and
founder, Jeff Bezos.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy comes after The New York Times reported Monday
that Amazon had fashioned an ``e-merchandising'' program for book
publishers that sought advertising dollars for featured treatment
of titles in categories that range from ``What We're Reading'' to
``Destined for Greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon did not disclose the advertising fees, which ranged from
$250 to $12,500, to its customers. The bookseller contended that
its sites were not for sale because editors screened and vetted
books worthy of highlighting.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's change in policy signaled a recognition that Amazon _
with its reviews, recommendations and friendly interaction with
customers _ is a hybrid, both bookseller and electronic adviser,
somehow different from bookstore chains or supermarkets that
commonly sell shelf space for products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always listening to our customers and it was clear that
our customers had a higher expectation for us than the physical
bookselling world,'' said Bill Curry, a company spokesman, who said
that customers had sent electronic mail expressing surprise at
Amazon's advertising approach.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said that Amazon would continue to offer the advertising
program to publishers, but that it would create a system indicating
which features have been paid for. Amazon started the program last
June and then expanded its scope and prices in January, attracting
money called ``cooperative advertising allowances'' from many major
publishers including Random House, Simon &AMP; Schuster, HarperCollins,
Warner Books and Penguin Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon had offered the program to about 20 to 50 publishers, and
planned to extend the same opportunities to more publishers later
this year. The program drew a mixed response from publishers,
ranging from smaller presses that feared they would not be able to
afford to play to larger publishers who considered the promotions
equivalent to the front table space or shelf-end caps offered for
co-op advertising dollars by bookstore chains.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Random House, now owned by Bertelsmann A.G., paid
Amazon for featured treatment of Peter Jennings' best seller, ``The
Century.'' Simon &AMP; Schuster, a unit of Viacom, backed titles on
Amazon ranging from Stephen King's ``Bag of Bones'' to a seasonal
Valentine's promotion for ``Best American Erotica.''
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive category for promotion was computer books,
critical placement that resulted in significant sales increases for
IDG Books Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Laurence J. Kirshbaum, chairman of Time Warner Trade
Publishing, which includes Warner Books and Little, Brown &AMP; Co.,
called Amazon's new policy of openness ``a sensible step'' that
will only enhance the credibility of the online bookstore and
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   His own company had paid to feature more than a dozen titles,
some of which experienced significant sales increases such as Roy
Blount Jr.'s photo book of dog poetry, ``If Only You Knew How Much
I Smell You: True Portraits of Dogs'' or Tom Grace's first novel,
``Spyder Web.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kirshbaum said he did not believe that Amazon's change in
policy would have an impact on future promotions subsidized with
advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customers will respond to the new system because
the publishers can muster very effective advertising concepts that
will appeal to them,'' he said. ``All we really want as publishers
is a chance to display our wares and this will give it.''

 &HT;    The rookie and the champ take pole
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Two-time defending Winston Cup champion
Jeff Gordon and rookie Tony Stewart will hold the pole positions
for Thursday's Gatorade 125 qualifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Although both drivers earned spots on the front row of Sunday's
Daytona 500 field with the fastest first-round qualifying speeds _
Gordon was the fastest, to win his first 500 pole _ both will run
in the qualifying races.
</P>
<P>
   The real test is for the drivers near the back of the pack in
the twin races to make up ground. The Daytona 500 field will
consist of Gordon and Stewart, the top 14 finishers from each
qualifier, the drivers with the top six speeds from qualifying who
didn't make the field and seven provisional qualifiers, based on
last year's owner-standing points.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure, but when hasn't there been?'' said
Ricky Craven, who will start 21st in the second qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon will have the pole in the first qualifier, with veteran
Ken Schrader on the outside pole. Notables starting near the back
in Thursday's first race are Bill Elliott (17th), Darrell Waltrip
(19th), Buckshot Jones (20th) and Steve Park (27th).
</P>
<P>
   In the second qualifier, Stewart will have the pole, with Mike
Skinner beside him on the front row. Kenny Irwin, last year's
rookie of the year, will have to make his way up from the No. 16
position, while rookie Elliott Sadler starts 17th.
</P>
<P>
   NAPA 300 starting lineup
</P>
<P>
   Schrader won the pole for Saturday's NAPA Auto Parts 300 Busch
race with an average speed of 189.865 mph. It was the third Busch
pole for Schrader, who runs a full Winston Cup schedule, along with
a select Grand National slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the Busch rules are now, there's not a lot of stuff
that you can really take back and forth between the Cup cars and
the Busch cars,'' Schrader said. ``Now, when you go to Rockingham,
Darlington, Charlotte, all of those places, there is a lot of
information we can use back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But your Busch testing here doesn't really help your Cup
effort here. I just figured, hell, we've gotta be here anyway, so
we might as well run the Busch race, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy LaJoie, who finished fourth in the Busch point standings
last season, will start the NAPA 300 on the outside pole. He
finished only .051 seconds behind Schrader in covering the 2.5-mile
oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lap was pretty good,'' LaJoie said. ``We just didn't hit
nothing. That's the main thing I wanted to do was come back and not
hit anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hamilton, Jr., the son of Cup driver Bobby Hamilton, had
the sixth-fastest average speed at 188.949. Larry Pearson, who
drives Buckshot Racing's No. 00 Pontiac, was eighth, while Dale
Earnhardt Jr. qualified 17th. Adam Petty was 22nd at 187.778 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Now, boys
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup veteran Derrike Cope qualified 12th for the Busch
race, but his average speed of 188.265 mph was disallowed after
NASCAR inspectors found unapproved parts in his shock absorber.
Blaise Alexander, who qualified 47th at 185.517 mph, had his time
disallowed for having the bleed holes in his shocks below the
mandatory minimum standard. Both drivers will be allowed to
requalify today.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot improves
</P>
<P>
   Although he'll have plenty of work to do in Thursday's
qualifier, Buckshot Jones of Tucker, Ga. did get some encouraging
signs in Tuesday's practice session.
</P>
<P>
   Jones lapped the track in 47.197 seconds, an average speed of
190.690 mph. That mark was two-tenths of a second faster than
Saturday's first-round qualifying, and more than four-tenths
quicker than Monday's practice, when Jones turned in his slowest
speed of Speed Weeks after switching to a setup recommended by
Hendrick Motorsports, which owns Gordon's team.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart turned in the fastest time during Tuesday's practice at
191.734 mph. Mark Martin was second at 191.461, while Dale
Earnhardt was third at 191.176 mph. Terry Labonte (191.038) and
Chad Little (191.002) rounded out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets remaining at Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Motor Speedway officials say they're 21 percent ahead of
last year's pace on ticket sales for the Cracker Barrel 500 on
March 14. The race isn't sold-out yet, and plenty of tickets
starting at $20 remain.
</P>
<P>
   AMS also has tickets remaining for the Yellow Freight 300 Busch
race on March 13. That will be Adam Petty's first race at AMS. For
the first time, the track is offering parking for motor homes next
to Champions Grandstand atop turn one this season. Only 45 spots
remain. Call 770-946-4211 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   Unser, Jr. out of IROC series
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr. has pulled out of the IROC Race of Champions Series
after his 12-year-old daughter Cody became ill during a school
basketball game on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Unser Jr. will be replaced in Friday's IROC/True Value XXIII at
Daytona International Speedway by NASCAR driver Bobby Labonte, the
pole sitter for last year's Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Labonte's second IROC appearance after replacing the
injured Robby Gordon at California Speedway in 1997. Labonte
started 10th in that race, led 20 of 25 laps, and finished second
behind Mark Martin in race three of the inaugural IROC event.
</P>
<P>
   Cody Unser underwent tests Tuesday in an Albuquerque, N.M.,
hospital. Her illness had not yet been determined, but IROC
president Jay Signore said Unser Jr. will sit out the series to
concentrate on his family and other racing.

 &HT;        SPECTER'S REQUEST TO INVESTIGATE BLUMENTHAL DENIED   By Lisa
Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 9,-- The Senate Tuesday denied a last-minute
request by Sen. Arlen Specter for more witness testimony to
investigate whether White House Aide Sidney Blumenthal lied in his
deposition in President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, R-Pa., asked the Senate to allow the House Impeachment
Managers to take further testimony from Blumenthal, along with
three new witnesses who dispute an assertion made in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle objected, Specter's
request, which he said addressed ``possible fraud on the Senate by
alleged perjury,'' was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, Blumenthal denied saying to reporters that
Monica Lewinsky was a ``stalker.'' But several journalists have
challenged that assertion in sworn affidavits. One affidavit claims
Blumenthal had allegedly been quoting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Specter asked that depositions be taken from journalist
Christopher Hitchens, his wife Carol Blue, a writer, and Washington
journalist Scott Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens and Blue have signed affidavits saying Blumenthal told
them at a lunch last March that Lewinsky was considered a
``stalker'' at the White House. Armstrong signed an affidavit
saying soon after that lunch the couple told Armstrong of their
``stalker'' conversation with Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   Specter offered the motion because he was the presiding Senate
Republican during Blumenthal's deposition last week. His request
would have required all 100 senators to agree to hear more
testimony, which could have prolonged the trial beyond its expected
conclusion Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blumenthal issue may linger. Several lawmakers are
considering whether to ask the Justice Department to investigate
the issue after the trial ends.
</P>
<P>
   The Blumenthal issue had gained momentum because one allegation
against Clinton is that he plotted to obstruct justice by allowing
others to make damaging statements about Lewinsky to a federal
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Specter has not made up his mind on whether to pursue an
investigation after the trial, his spokesman John Ullyot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not made any firm plans on how to pursue this or
whether or not to pursue this beyond the trial,'' Ullyot said.

 &HT;    LPGA's new Hall rules qualify Alcott, Daniel
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to qualification numbers that no longer crunch them, Amy
Alcott and Beth Daniel have gained entrance into the LPGA Tour Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   New selection criteria approved by the LPGA Tournament Division
and announced Tuesday in Los Angeles pushed Alcott, 42, and Daniel,
42, into the Hall of Fame through a revised points system.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, a player had to win at least 30 official events,
including two major championships; 35 wins plus one major; or 40
wins. Now a player makes the Hall of Fame with 27 points _ one
point for each official LPGA win; two for each major; one for each
Vare Trophy earned; and one for each Player of the Year Award
earned.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, who will be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in
St. Augustine, Fla., next year, won 31 times from 1979-99,
including one major. Alcott, from 1975-99, compiled 24 wins,
including five majors. Under the new guidelines, a retired player
also can be voted in by a veterans committee.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 players prior to Alcott and Daniel had qualified for the
LPGA Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the new criteria will give the current players a
chance to make this Hall of Fame,'' Daniel said. ``I think it will
make it a better Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they (the committee members) have been struggling with
this for 10 to 15 years,'' said Kathy Whitworth, who won 88
official LPGA events. ``I'm glad they finally worked it out.''

BAY STATE STUDY LINKS PHARMACY ERRORS TO HASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Most pharmacy errors occur when a too-busy pharmacist
dispenses the wrong drug or the wrong dose of a new prescription _
sometimes with disastrous consequences _ according to a first-ever
look at the problem unveiled Tuesday by Massachusetts officials.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of medication errors committed by 51 Bay State
pharmacists found that almost 90 percent involved the wrong drug or
the wrong dose.
</P>
<P>
   Most mistakes could be averted, state officials said, if
pharmacists followed a law that requires them to counsel
prescription drug consumers. If pharmacists took pills out of the
bottle to show the consumer _ the recommended practice _ ``most
pharmacists would be able to detect if the wrong pill was put into
the bottle, or the wrong strength,'' said William G. Wood, who
oversees the Board of Registration in Pharmacy and 32 other
licensure panels.
</P>
<P>
   However, an undercover investigation of 74 pharmacies, also
released Tuesday, found that nearly two out of three Bay State
pharmacists are not complying with the counseling law.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators posing as consumers went to the community
pharmacies with prescriptions for Nardil, an antidepressant that
should not be taken with certain drugs or foods. Of the 47
pharmacies that stocked Nardil, 30 failed to offer counseling on
how to take it, as required by law, or ``gave inadequate or
erroneous counseling,'' the state report said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 offending pharmacies, 14 were part of the CVS Pharmacy
chain, according to the state report.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy groups criticized the undercover investigation as ``a
sting,'' although Wood said the state intends only to issue a
warning to the pharmacists who did not counsel properly. The
spokesmen for the Massachusetts Pharmacy Association and the Boston
Association of Retail Druggists did not object to the board's
campaign against medication error.
</P>
<P>
   ``One medication error is too many,'' said Bill Frisch,
president of the Massachusetts Pharmacy Association. ``The more
information on medication errors we can gather, the more we can
start homing in on some of the root causes. But this shouldn't be
cause for panic. We believe patients are very well served by
pharmacists and pharmacies.''
</P>
<P>
   State licensure officials are proposing new legislation to
stiffen the counseling requirement and allow the board to fine
pharmacists who don't comply with this and other regulations. The
board also wants authority to regulate pharmacy technicians,
arguing that upgrading technicians's skills would free pharmacists
to do more counseling of consumers and quality control.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, as many as 2.4 million pharmacist-associated
``adverse events'' occur in Massachusetts annually, out of over 60
million prescriptions filled. Only a tiny fraction cause harm to
patients, but when they do, the results are sometimes disastrous,
state officials said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one 13-year-old girl died after a pharmacist
mistakenly dispensed too much of an asthma medication called
Ventolin. The girl, thinking that more medication was better, died
from an overdose. Officials declined to give more details, since
the case is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One infant who was supposed to receive the painkiller Motrin got
the antipsychotic drug Mellaril instead, and ended up in intensive
care. Another child who should have received Ventolin in syrup form
for asthma got an opiate drug and had become ``somewhat addicted,''
a pharmacy board official said, by the time hospitalization was
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Sparrs, president of the pharmacy board, said that
pharmacy-related medication errors are uncommon, compared to the
enormous volume of prescriptions filled. However, he noted that the
number reported to the board has increased, from 41 in 1992 to 77
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think consumers are becoming more aware of what they should
do'' in reporting pharmacy errors, Sparrs said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the study of medication errors, led by R. Rebecca
Couris of the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Allied Health
Sciences, unearthed problems similar to those discovered in
national studies and other states.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 88 percent of medication errors involved
the wrong drug or the wrong dose, and 63 percent involved
first-time prescriptions rather than refills.
</P>
<P>
   Although 45 percent of the errors involved handwritten
prescriptions, illegibility was a factor in only 26 percent of
errors, according to the pharmacists. When a pharmacist is unsure
about a doctor's prescription, for whatever reason, he or she is
legally obliged to call the physician for clarification.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most common reasons cited by pharmacists for their
mistakes involved work overload or distractions. Among these
factors were ``too many telephone calls'' (cited by 62 percent),
``unusually busy day'' (59 percent), ``too many customers (53
percent), ``lack of concentration'' (41 percent) and ``staff
shortage'' (32 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists said they offered consumers counseling in 88 percent
of the cases, but actually counseled 65 percent of patients,
because the others refused advice. However, when researchers
interviewed 34 patients involved in the medication errors, 30 of
them said they did not recall any offer from the pharmacist to
counsel them.

HONG KONG LEGAL DECISION ON CITIZENSHIP UPSETS MAINLAND CHINESE
OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials and scholars are publicly attacking
a groundbreaking decision handed down by Hong Kong's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the court declared on Jan. 29 that four
children born in mainland China to parents who are Hong Kong
residents have the right to live in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling has injected a new sense of tension and uncertainty
into the relationship between China and Hong Kong, the former
British colony that was reunited with the mainland 19 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court decision is a mistake and against the Basic Law,''
Zhao Qizheng, director of the public information office of China's
State Council, the country's cabinet, told reporters who had
gathered on Monday for a party for the Chinese New Year. ``This is
a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the case narrowly involved immigration policy, the
judges seized the opportunity to make broader statements about the
independence of Hong Kong's judiciary and Hong Kong autonomy in
general.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time Hong Kong officials have so openly clashed
with mainland authorities over gray areas in the Hong Kong Basic
Law, which both sides had agreed would serve as the legal
foundation for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region when it
reverted to China from Britain on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And, after the charges and the countercharges of the last two
days, it is clear that there are major differences of opinion about
the meaning of ``One Country _ Two Systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The case that sparked the debate was simple enough, concerning
the status of tens of thousands _ if not hundreds of thousands _ of
mainland Chinese with parents who are legal Hong Kong residents.
The ruling opening the way to admission of thousands of
illegitimate children of Hong Kong residents and children born
before their parents lived in Hong Kong, even people who are now
adults.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the position that Hong Kong courts have full autonomy
to make the decision. the justices sailed headlong into uncharted
and treacherous waters. They also implied that Hong Kong's Basic
Law _ not the laws or policies of the mainland _ should decide the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there was the intention among the judges to set out a
landmark case,'' said Wang Chenguang, an associate professor of law
at the City University of Hong Kong, who was formerly at Beijing
University. ``It reflects a desire to use this formal document to
reinforce and assert the autonomy of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region and also the independence of the Hong Kong
judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Zhao of the China State Council set off a round
of dire predictions and paroxysms of dread among politicians,
scholars and diplomats in Hong Kong, who have long feared that
Beijing would try to force its values on their turf. Thus far, Hong
Kong remains a freewheeling place whose newspapers are quick to
pick up hints of mainland scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do indeed try to overturn the court's ruling or
undermine the ruling, that would be the most serious threat since
the handover,'' said one Western diplomat in Hong Kong, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear what, if anything, the Chinese government
plans to do about the situation. Many Hong Kong legal scholars said
the decision by the Final Court of Appeals is just that _ final.
And China's leaders are savvy enough to know that any direct
interference with Hong Kong's judiciary would cause foreign
investors to flee from this slumping but still vibrant metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The most fundamental issue is how to interpret two somewhat
contradictory clauses in the Basic Law. Article 22 of Chapter 2,
which deals with relations between Hong Kong and the mainland, says
that Chinese residents wishing to go to Hong Kong must first gain
the permission of China's authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But Article 24 of Chapter 3 _ dealing with Hong Kong citizens'
rights _ says that children of Hong Kong citizens who are born
outside of Hong Kong will enjoy the rights of citizens. ``According
to this,'' said one legal scholar, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, ``these kids have an inalienable right of abode and
don't need a permit.''
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the judges put article 24 above article 22,
effectively proclaiming that mainland rules that interfere with the
constitutionally protected rights of Hong Kong citizens are
invalid, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   In narrow terms, that decision meant that Hong Kong will now
accept children of residents whether or not they have the blessing
of the mainland authorities to leave and giving thousands of
mainland immigrants already in Hong Kong illegally a potential
legal mechanism for staying. But to many liberals in Hong Kong, the
significance of the decision is much broader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court asserted in this way both the self-government of
Hong Kong and the necessity of rights and the rule of law,'' wrote
Yash Ghai, a law professor the University of Hong Kong, in The
South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
   China has yet to explain its objections fully, and Zhao said the
government would present its formal opinion at ``an appropriate
time.'' At a previously scheduled Foreign Ministry briefing on
Tuesday, a spokesman said only that the central government was
``concerned'' about the issue, adding that the opinion of mainland
legal scholars ``is worthy of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   One Sunday, the state-controlled news agency featured interviews
with four legal scholars who helped draft the Basic Law, contending
that the Hong Kong court could not disregard Chinese legislation
and that its jurisdiction is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Wu Jianfan of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the
authority to interpret the law ``rests with the National People's
Congress Standing Committee.'' Some mainland scholars contend that
the Chinese Congress should have been called upon to clarify any
contradiction in the Hong Kong Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities have also said they are worried about a
possible large-scale influx of immigrants into Hong Kong at a time
unemployment is rising. For the same reason, the court's decision
provoked criticism from both many Hong Kong residents and the Hong
Kong government.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the government decision may not be fully enforceable
anyway. The court instructed the Hong Kong government to meet with
mainland authorities to devise a new system to process immigrants.
But mainland officials may be less than eager to cooperate.

IT'S WWII VS. THE RENAISSANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It sure seemed like some of last year's good
movies weren't about World War II or 16th-century England.
</P>
<P>
   But in their infinite wisdom, the voting members of the Academy
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences have said not so. Of the 71st
annual Academy Awards best picture nominees announced Tuesday,
three _ ``Life Is Beautiful,'' ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The
Thin Red Line'' _ are war stories and two _ ``Elizabeth'' and
``Shakespeare in Love'' _ are, well, Elizabethan.
</P>
<P>
   They are by no means an unworthy lot. Indeed, there are good
aesthetic arguments to be made for all five films, and that's a
rare enough occurrence in Oscar history to be worth celebrating.
Furthermore, the movies that had fair shots at nominations but
didn't fit the historical pageant mold _ ``The Truman Show'' and
its TV satire twin ``Pleasantville,'' ``Bulworth,'' ``Gods and
Monsters,'' ``Hilary and Jackie'' _ weren't necessarily
artistically superior, nor less flawed, than those that made the
cut.
</P>
<P>
   But these films weren't any worse than most of the nominees,
either. So why not a little variety in this grandest of all
entertainment contests?
</P>
<P>
   It's long been a running joke that academy members will vote for
anything in a corset or a helmet, but by relentlessly doing so this
year, they've pushed the tendency into tragicomic territory. The
results reinforce notions that academy voters think inside a very
narrow box. And boxes restrict sightlines _ hardly the way to judge
a film year marked by some of the boldest and most accomplished
barrier-breaking seen since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Some vision was provided, however, by the academy's actors
branch (nominations are chosen by the artists in their field; all
members are polled for the best picture nominees). They rewarded
actors who did great work in parts that could be considered too
demanding for the academy's mainstream tastes (James Coburn, Ian
McKellen, Nick Nolte, Edward Norton, Lynn Redgrave). Conversely,
they relaxed their traditional prejudice against comedy, citing at
least one funny performer (Roberto Benigni, Geoffrey Rush, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Judi Dench) in each of their four categories. And they
recognized journeymen like Ed Harris, McKellen and Nolte, whose
consistent excellence is too often taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The actors also kept the star turns to an admirable minimum; too
minimum, according to Jim Carrey partisans. But shock over Truman
getting trumped _ Tuesday's most controversial omission, along with
the film's overall poor showing _ should really be about surprise,
not outrage. The actors recognized Carrey's work for what it was: a
promising transitional performance, but not the real goods just
yet.
</P>
<P>
   As for the star turns that made the cut, it's hard to think of
one that was more deserving than Tom Hanks', who was for many
people's money better in ``Ryan'' than in either of his two
Oscar-winning roles.
</P>
<P>
   But the acting categories are traditionally the ones in which
the academy offers up its best ``What were they thinking?'' fodder
as well, and they didn't disappoint on that dubious note, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that, of last year's two dying-mom divas, nominee
Meryl Streep put a lot more work into her ``One True Thing''
hausfrau than non-nominee Susan Sarandon did her ``Stepmom''
domestic goddess. Still, both characters were ill-conceived beyond
either great actress's capacity to repair, so why acknowledge
either?
</P>
<P>
   Because Oscar's a sucker for showy suffering _ and insufferable
showboating, which explains how Brenda Blethyn, the most irritating
element of the sporadically charming ``Little Voice,'' brayed her
way to the film's only nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the behind-the-scenes categories can't help but make
you look ahead: to March 21, specifically, when the Academy Award
winners will be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Things could change, but it's a pretty safe bet that that night
will be a shootout between top nomination-getters ``Ryan'' (11) and
``Shakespeare'' (13, the edge provided by two extra acting
nominations). Bizarre as it sounds, these two films, which are as
different from one another as two movies could ever be, are
competing in more categories than they're not: art direction,
cinematography, directing, film editing, makeup, best picture,
sound and original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   Sound? Cinematography? ``Shakespeare''?
</P>
<P>
   This makes you wonder whether the dialogue-heavy romance's
extraordinary challenge to ``Ryan's'' once impregnable front-runner
position could threaten its presumed hold on the technical
categories as well. The unexpectedly strong showings of the other
war movies weaken ``Ryan'' further, and there is now the astounding
possibility that Steven Spielberg may not win a directing Oscar for
his most masterful achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The academy distinguished itself in several of the craft
categories by recognizing not just the best picture nominees'
mostly deserving artisans but also ``Pleasantville'' and ``What
Dreams May Come's'' extraordinary production designers, ``Velvet
Goldmine's'' nutty glam rock costumes (designed by Sandy Powell,
who's also up for ``Shakespeare's'' frocks) and the writers of
``Bulworth,'' ``Out of Sight'' and ``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``Truman'' director Peter Weir, the odd man out of the best
picture contest.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bad habits that seem to recur every year, there were
pitifully few minority faces once again _ and no, that wasn't
mitigated by half of the acting nominees being foreign, nor by two
of them not speaking English.
</P>
<P>
   And while we're talking international, movies featuring poor
little kids dominate the foreign language film race yet again. The
foreign language nominating committee has been in this
embarrassing, easily manipulated rut for a long time now.
</P>
<P>
   This year's best picture roster indicates that a similar kind of
tunnel vision is spreading among the academy's general membership. &QL;

PILOT DISPUTE COULD DISRUPT TRAVEL PLANS NEWS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travelers may be forced to change winter vacation plans next
week because of an ongoing labor dispute over job seniority at
American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   First officer Andrew Engelke, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots
Association, the bargaining unit for American's pilots, said a
protest that began last weekend when pilots across the country
called in sick or refused overtime will likely continue if the
matter is not resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,500-member union wants 300 pilots from Reno Air Inc., a
low-cost carrier acquired for $124 million last December by
American's parent, AMR Corp., included on a seniority list that
determines the level of work and compensation pilots receive.
</P>
<P>
   The Reno pilots are represented by the 52,000-member Air Line
Pilots Association, or ALPA. They earn less than half the $150,000
average annual salary paid to American pilots, who fear the
lower-paid pilots might take some of their jobs and assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The seniority list remains a problem since both groups of pilots
must decide where the newcomers should be placed on the seniority
list. ``The Reno pilots just want to be integrated by date of hire,
and the least fair way to do that is to staple them onto the bottom
of the seniority list,'' John Mazor, a spokesman for ALPA, said.
</P>
<P>
   Mazor added that Reno pilots are seeking a transition plan that
would spell out how the two groups of pilots should operate, the
terms of pay, and work rules. ``Second, they need to come to some
kind of agreement with Allied over how to merge their seniority
list,'' said Mazor. ``That negotiation is between the two groups of
pilots, and the results will be whatever they agree to.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American continued its efforts to meet flight
schedules and referred some passengers to competitors such as Delta
Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 19 out of approximately 60 flights were canceled at
Boston's Logan International Airport Tuesday, raising some concerns
about cancellations during the upcoming winter vacation week for
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are expected to be heavy travel
days because people are getting ready to leave on their
vacations,'' said Jeremy Crockford, a spokesman for the
Massachusets Port Authority, which owns and runs the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``American is the third largest carrier so this is having an
obvious impact on us,'' said Crockford. ``We just hope it ends soon
because winter vacation is coming up.''

DEALS TO CASH IN ON INTERNET TAKE MANY FORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet's best-known companies are all jockeying for
greater influence and bigger audiences. But they're all doing it in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Internet legend Netscape Communications Corp. surrendered to the
overwhelming power of rival Microsoft Corp., and is selling out to
America Online Inc. The Snap and Infoseek Internet services are
teaming up with traditional media companies in a bid for greater
visibility. Lycos Inc. of Waltham, Mass. is joining with USA
Networks Inc. to establish a new electronic commerce empire. And
the most famous of the lot, Yahoo Inc., stands in proud isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Given Tuesday's brutal sell-off in Internet stocks, investors
are clearly having their doubts about the high market valuations of
many Internet companies. Some industry watchers think the Lycos-USA
Networks deal, announced Tuesday, carried a low premium that is
making many people rethink Internet stocks in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives investors a very clear look at how high the
Internet valuations are,'' said Frank Gens, Internet analyst with
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But with 70 million North Americans on line, rich rewards await
companies that do the best job of reaching the Internet audience.
The question is how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   One popular approach is alliance with a traditional broadcast
media company. The logic is simple enough, according to Melissa
Bane, analyst for the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 75 percent of the US population not on the Web, you have
to consider where your new customers are going to
</P>
<P>
   see your brand,'' Bane said. ``It won't be on the Web. They're
not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach these unwired consumers, portals are doing deals with
big media companies. That's part of the rationale behind CNet
Inc.'s decision to team up with NBC to promote CNet's Snap Internet
service. NBC has spent millions advertising Snap during its
prime-time programs.
</P>
<P>
   A similar promotional strategy is being pursued by the Walt
Disney Co., which acquired a 43 percent stake in the Infoseek
Internet service last summer at a bargain-basement price of $70
million. Disney already has a stable of well-known Internet sites
for its ABC and ESPN television networks, and Disney-branded sites
for children and families. The company has woven these properties
together with Infoseek's Web searching features to create its own
Internet brand, the Go Network.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Group's Bane says the prospects for Go Network have been
``extremely underestimated,'' noting that Disney's vast market
reach could catapult the firm to the top tier of Web sites.
``They're putting their money where their mouth is in promoting
that brand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gens of IDC isn't impressed by Go Network's present lineup:
``I don't really see anything all that unique in the Go Network
that would label it as a breakthrough bridging of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, America Online Inc., the world's top provider of
Internet access to consumers, can afford to follow a different
business model. Unlike the Web portals, AOL has 16 million paying
customers, and earned $92 million in profit last year on revenues
of $2.6 billion. AOL is already the best-known name on the
Internet, and its Web site is the most-visited.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is determined to reach beyond its paying customers to
the Internet at large. That's a big reason behind AOL's agreement
last November to buy Netscape Communications Corp. for $4.2
billion. Netscape not only brought along its strong Internet
software know-how, but also its Netcenter Internet portal, one of
the 10 most popular sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape is very popular in business, and AOL is not,'' said
Peggy O'Neill, Internet analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose,
Calif. ``The people who use Netscape tend not to be the people who
use AOL.'' By buying Netscape, AOL gets access to both these large
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial of the recent deals came last month, when
At Home, a firm that provides high-speed Internet access over cable
TV systems, agreed to pay $6.7 billion in stock for the Excite
Internet portal. The money-losing Excite went for nearly double its
already high market capitalization to At Home, a company that
presently has a mere 330,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that At Home is destined to become much bigger as
more and more consumers are able to receive high-speed cable
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   But IDC's Gens is skeptical. ``We're not very bullish on the At
Home-Excite deal. It's all potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yahoo, a company almost synonymous with the Internet,
is preserving its independence. It's moving to expand its outreach
by acquiring the GeoCities service for creating free Web pages. But
Yahoo president and chief operating officer Jeff Mallett says Yahoo
is big enough and rich enough to prosper on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're staying with our strategy,'' Mallett said. ``Our goal is
to have the broadest and best services once you get to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike USA/Lycos and other Web portals, Yahoo has no plans to
sell goods to its customers. Yahoo operates an on-line retailing
and auction service where other businesses can sell their wares.
Companies pay Yahoo for the right to sell products there, and
Mallett said his firm won't turn around and compete with its
business clients. ``It's never been our objective to do that,'' he
said.

SEARS FINED $60 MILLION IN BANKRUPTCY FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Giant retailer Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. has agreed to plead
guilty to criminal fraud and pay a $60 million fine for illegally
collecting credit-card debts from bankrupt customers, US Attorney
Donald K. Stern said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stern, the $60 million fine would be the largest
ever in a bankruptcy fraud case and one of the largest criminal
fines in the history of Massachusetts. The plea agreement must be
accepted by the US District Court of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Sears acknowledged its guilt and said the fine
would have ``no effect on Sears earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the many sides of Sears, this was the criminal side,'' said
Stern, who added: ``This was not the action of a few low-level
wayward employees. This charge reflects an outrageous company
policy, which plainly violated federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law
School professor who specializes in bankruptcy law. ``This says
that Sears, the mother store to middle America, not only didn't
follow the rules, but engaged in criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Misbehaving retailers have always been subject to civil
penalties, but Tuesday's action means that in egregious cases,
retailers may also face criminal charges, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement could end a three-year-old case that surfaced when
Carol J. Kenner, a judge in US Bankruptcy Court in Boston,
suspected that Sears had been skirting bankruptcy law.
</P>
<P>
   When a consumer files for bankruptcy, most credit-card debts are
erased. But that didn't stop Sears from pursuing bankrupt consumers
who had made purchases with a Sears credit card.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, Sears told these customers it would repossess
items they bought unless they agreed to pay off their credit-card
balances. Such agreements must be reported to the bankruptcy court,
but Sears routinely failed to do that.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a class-action lawsuit was brought against Sears by
its bankrupt customers. The suit was settled two years ago after
Sears agreed to pay those customers $158 million.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said it's unusual for federal investigators to go
after a company that has agreed to pay such a large settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But Stern's office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the
US Bankruptcy Trustee for Maine concluded that Sears's conduct
threatened the integrity of the bankruptcy system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conduct amounted to a calculated and systematic effort to
undermine the bankruptcy code,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   In civil lawsuits settled previously, Sears has paid more than
$180 million in restitution to 188,000 bankrupt customers and $40
million in civil fines, according to Stern's office.
</P>
<P>
   John Roddy, a Boston lawyer who represented Sears customers in
one of those suits, said Sears's agreement to plead guilty Tuesday
vindicated earlier claims that Sears had engaged in ``predatory''
practices in attempting to collect debts.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits for improper debt-collection practices have been
brought against other big retailers. When asked whether they too
might face prosecution, Stern said his office does not comment on
whether it is conducting criminal investigations.

A NEW REVUE FINDS DIGNITY IN THE DERIDED ART FORM OF BLACK
VAUDEVILLE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On one level, they were simply black men and women,
sometimes wearing burnt-cork makeup, who spoke in dialect and told
jokes, danced and sang about life's ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, the language and the routines of black
vaudevillians reflected an era in which most Americans considered
blacks inferior and black entertainers used their separate sphere
to escape the pain or create other meanings for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of that time, representing the place where history,
sociology and entertainment meet, have been resurrected in an
off-Broadway musical about the last days of black vaudeville,
``Rollin' on the T.O.B.A.,'' which opened nearly two weeks ago at
the 47th Street Theater in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The vaudevillians who worked the black circuit, called the
Theater Owners Booking Association, or T.O.B.A., played to black
theater audiences across the country, from the Regal in Chicago to
the Palace in Memphis to the Lafayette in New York, from the early
1900s until the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, the circuit, which was owned and managed by whites,
was where artists like Bert Williams and Bill ``Bojangles''
Robinson honed a style that whites copied and blacks used to
eventually enter the entertainment mainstream. At its peak in the
1920s, the circuit encompassed more than 40 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate it because we have to tell our own history,''
said Ronald ``Smokey'' Stevens, an actor, dancer, singer and
choreographer who stars in the show. ``It's education and it's
entertainment and it's a vanished art form. Vaudeville was
significant to the survival of black people. It was a way of
saying, `This is what others think of us, but let's take it and
make it our own.'''
</P>
<P>
   The three characters in ``Rollin''' _ Stevens, Stewart and
Bertha Mae Little _ take a tour of the circuit in 1931. Drawing on
music ranging from Duke Ellington to Fats Waller, the words of
Langston Hughes and Gwendolyn Brooks, and original bits by the
comedy team Miller and Lyles, Williams and others, the musical
shows how performers found dignity under harsh circumstances like
entering the stage through the orchestra pit, doing seven shows a
day and having their material and paychecks stolen.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent review, The New York Times called the two-hour show
``potent and instructive entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   As the comedy team Stevens and Stewart ride one day through the
segregated South, they are jubilant that they don't have to search
for a ``colored'' restaurant because Bertha has packed them a
lunch. Then, ruminating on segregation, they act out scenes from
Hughes' stories about his Everyman, Jesse B. Semple.
</P>
<P>
   Semple (or Simple) recounts a dream about a future in which soul
food is no longer available, evoking the fear that integration
ultimately means the decimation of black culture.
</P>
<P>
   Other vignettes simply summon the slap-happy pace of vaudeville.
Stevens and Stewart pantomime a chess game that turns into a fight.
Bertha sings about the secrets of love. Stewart sings about a lover
so fat that she has another boyfriend, unknown to him, kissing her
on the other side of her girth.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Watkins, author of ``On the Real Side'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster),
a book about African-American humor, said the antics of the old
vaudevillians might be viewed as demeaning through a modern lens.
But many black performers of that day turned the notion on its
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no other way of dealing with it except to make fun
of it and reverse the joke,'' Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performers were often using language whites did not fully
understand,'' he said. ``They reversed meanings of words. The word
bad for good is a simple example.''
</P>
<P>
   The cakewalk, denounced by the black bourgeoisie as vulgar, was
developed to make fun of a white dancing style, just as ragtime was
a response to European classical music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here Come de Judge,'' a popular Pigmeat Markham routine, was a
sly way of mocking a legal system that afforded no justice or
protection for blacks in an era of rampant lynchings. In the late
1960s, the phrase entered the mainstream as routine banter on the
``Rowan &AMP; Martin's Laugh-In'' television show.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical Markham routine, the man appearing before the judge
pleads for mercy, taking credit for having introduced the judge to
his wife. The judge responds, ``Introduced me to my wife? Life ...
you sonofagun!''
</P>
<P>
   Most often, humor offered a refuge for coping with the
vicissitudes of everyday life. The flavor was often bawdy, and
wordplay was vital: ``revolution'' for ``evolution'' (``I ain't
related to no monkey'') and ``amcestors'' for ``ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   The material and the folksy style were often imitated by white
performers like Abbott and Costello, Eddie Cantor, Al Jolson and
Jimmy Durante, who brought them to the white audiences to which
blacks were denied access.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, Williams, Ethel Waters and Sammy Davis Jr. were among
the first black stars to find an integrated audience beyond the
T.O.B.A., and they laid the foundation for other black
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   They paid a high price. Theater owners could be violent, public
accommodations were segregated and the performers had to make
concessions like paying their traveling expenses. The Southern
towns they played often had curfews for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That circuit was run almost like a theatrical plantation,''
Watkins said. ``There are stories about performers who wanted to
quit a show. When they'd go to the train station to buy a ticket,
they'd find out that a theater manager had put out the word that
they were not allowed to leave town. They just said, `No, boy.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all this, people had lives,'' Watkins continued. ``The
creativity did not just come from repression and depression. You
had comedy coming from folk tales that made fun of people in
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who created and choreographed the show with his late
partner, Jaye Stewart, is aware of how his production straddles the
arenas of entertainment and instruction. A slight, rubber-faced
man, he plays Stevens in this most recent incarnation of his
13-year-old labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that is not authentic is that we didn't do it in
blackface,'' Stevens said. ``That was demeaning. They had to do
that and we didn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Stevens and Stewart, who trained at the D.C. Black
Repertory Company, developed a show called ``Rollin' With Stevens
and Stewart,'' which had a national tour that included Washington
and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Like the current off-Broadway revue, it was a series of
vignettes, dance routines and songs bound by the story of the two
vaudevillians traveling from city to city.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart died four years ago at age 48 from colon cancer. The
role he originated is played in New York by Rudy Roberson, who made
his Broadway debut in 1997 as Silky in the original cast of ``The
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The third character, Bertha, a large woman with a voice to
match, is played by Sandra Reaves-Phillips, who made a name for
herself as Mama Younger in the Broadway musical ``Raisin.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberson said he was never concerned that the characters could
be construed as demeaning. He said the cast discussed the dialogue
to ensure that the language was not stereotypically insulting:
``Chicken Bone Express,'' a train transporting black entertainers,
for example, was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The response of older African-Americans to the show has been
especially encouraging, Roberson said, because some of them had
seen oldtimers do the material.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who is 47 and grew up in a working-class neighborhood
in Washington, said he found a way to express himself, and give
something back to other blacks, through acting.
</P>
<P>
   He has appeared on Broadway as the Time Man in ``Bubbling Brown
Sugar,'' Pretty Pete in ``Innocent Black,'' and MC and McMorgan in
``Dreamgirls,'' and toured nationally with ``One Mo' Time'' in the
role of Papa Du. He played the dancing crow in the film version of
the ``The Wiz'' and Butterbeans in the film ``Cotton Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Through his friendship with the tap dancer Honi Coles, Stevens
met some of the old black vaudevillians and began to understand the
extent to which they embodied the history of black entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in their 70s and 80s,'' Stevens said of performers
like John Bubbles and Stump and Stumpy. ``I never heard them voice
their displeasure. They were elderly men who dressed well and
carried themselves with dignity. They were proud that they worked
in a segregated society and they found a way to artistic
expression.''

times it's funny times highly literate, too divided by Oscar rarely
appreciates funny or literate minus won wrong Golden Globe (for
comedy) equals ``Love's'' labours not looking lost. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Thin Red Line: Nice nature photography plus some consider it a
more thoughtful war movie than ``Private Ryan'' minus which doesn't
necessarily make it coherent minus has driven more viewers out of
theaters than the Marines drove Japanese off Guadalcanal equals
AWOL at the awards podium. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST ACTRESS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cate Blanchett (``Elizabeth''): Wore corset plus took it off minus
very discreetly plus but for the best, most dramatically and
politically expedient of reasons plus located the passionate human
being behind the Virgin Queen image anyway equals could reign
supreme. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fernanda Montenegro (``Central Station''): Brought tough, credible
conviction to standard role of old crab with heart of gold plus
face has gloriously high mileage, and she knows how to use every
inch of it divided by performed in Portugese (last foreign language
acting winner: Sophia Loren, 1961) equals in this case, language
should be no barrier. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gwyneth Paltrow (``Shakespeare in Love''): Wore corset plus took it
off plus wasn't discreet about it at all plus while speaking iambic
poetry, yet plus struck a blow for repressed, 16th-century aspiring
actresses minus won wrong Golden Globe (for comedy) equals the
accent could be on Gwynie. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meryl Streep (``One True Thing''): Character got cancer, died minus
character was also a ninny times Meryl got a few honest moments out
of her anyway plus this is her 11th nomination divided by but if
the academy really loved her, wouldn't such a great actress have
more than two Oscars by now? equals dead in the water. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Emily Watson (``Hilary and Jackie''): Character was a classical
musician plus mentally unbalanced plus got a deadly disease times
Watson uncannily imitated real-life cellist's unique physical
manner minus many Brits (and there are many British academy
members) offended by warts-and-all portrayal of national culture
hero equals could be making beautiful music come Oscar night.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST ACTOR &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Roberto Benigni (``Life Is Beautiful''): Brilliant physical comedy
plus miraculously found the right balance of shrewdness, silliness
and gravity the role demanded times that face minus that hair
divided by performed in Italian (last foreign language acting
winner: Sophia Loren, 1961) equals well, Sophia spoke Italian, too
... &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tom Hanks (``Saving Private Ryan''): Portrayed the epitome of the
World War II citizen soldier divided by the movie's acting was
drowned out by its barrage of formal brilliance times there is some
evidence that Oscar likes him minus he's already won two, and he's
not quite Jack Nicholson yet equals he'll really have to earn it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ian McKellen (``Gods and Monsters''): Illuminated every complex
aspect of a dying man's soul plus played a real-life filmmaker
times the academy kind of likes gay characters now minus it's never
rewarded an openly gay actor for playing one equals this one could
very well go to Sir Ian, with love. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Nick Nolte (``Affliction''): The guy's done this role, it seems, a
thousand times before times he's never done it better minus it's as
grim as New England winter nights are long plus nobody does grim
better equals the race's pre-eminent dark horse, emphasis on the
dark. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edward Norton (``American History X''): Made a neo-Nazi human, sort
of divided by though he still seemed much more engaged by the
hateful stuff than the repudiation of it x reportedly recut film to
emphasize his role (though apparently an egomaniacal minus in
reality a plus, since every actor dreams of doing it and they make
up the academy's biggest voting bloc) equals won't win, but points
for inspiring another round of loony protest stunts by disgruntled
director Tony Kaye.  &UR;  &QL;

KERRY TO SPEAK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE IN MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US Senator John F. Kerry, who is mulling a presidential
campaign, will venture back to New Hampshire, site of the nation's
first primary, in March.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a frustrating month and a half for Kerry, who has
been pinned down in the US Senate by the impeachment proceedings
when he would rather be traveling the country, exploring a
presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But with the impeachment trial now winding to a close, Kerry's
office confirmed Tuesday that he has accepted one speaking
engagement in New Hampshire and soon hopes to confirm several
others.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, the Massachusetts Democrat plans to address a
citizens roundtable hosted by Citizens Bank and WMUR-TV (Channel
9), according to Lisa Mead, Kerry's state director. Kerry hopes to
speak at New Hampshire College in Manchester the same day. He is
also trying to work out a March date to speak to the Laconia
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said she did not know what topics Kerry would address.
</P>
<P>
   But if Kerry stays on his current timetable, he will probably
have decided whether to run by the time of the New Hampshire trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``His working goal is to have a decision by the end of the
month,'' said spokesman Jim Jordan. ``He wants to get impeachment
behind him and spend 10 days or two weeks doing some clearheaded,
rational thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people who have spoken recently with Kerry describe him
as conflicted, saying he realizes that Vice President Al Gore is
far ahead in the early campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination, but also worries that if he himself does not run in
2000, his presidential options might be foreclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say his heart is telling him run, while his head is
telling him don't run, that it would be an enormous uphill
battle,'' said one influential Democrat who spoke with Kerry
recently. ``I don't know which wins out.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kerry's plans have been put on hold, Gore has not been
similarly sidelined. He was in New Hampshire last week on what was
billed as an official government trip. Former New Jersey Senator
Bill Bradley is also running, and is said to be making some headway
in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, one plan briefly bandied about by the Kerry camp was
to forgo a 2000 campaign in favor of a concerted longer-term effort
to position Kerry for 2004 should a Republican win the White House
in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario would be problematic, however. If a Democrat wins
in 2000, Kerry could not realistically run in 2004; by 2008, when
the senator would be 64, time and politics might well have passed
him by.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the impeachment trial has dragged along, keeping Kerry
in Washington and delaying his decision, some associates say the
idea of focusing on 2004 rather than 2000 is again under some
discussion. ``That option has been resurrected with the delayed
start,'' is the way one adviser put it.

LOTS OF SEX, LITTLE RESPONSIBLITY IN TV CONTENT, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As any regular television watcher knows, sex is not exactly
taboo on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But one subject seems to be largely off-limits, according to a
major new study released Tuesday that deals with the ``risks and
responsibilities'' of sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 1,351 randomly selected shows by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation found that 56 percent of all TV programs _ and 67
percent of all prime-time shows _ contained sexual content in word
or deed over the course of one week. Yet only one in 10 such shows
mentioned contraception, safe sex, or the possibility of delaying
sexual activity, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   After narrowing their focus to only the 88 scenes in which
sexual intercourse was either ``depicted or strongly implied,''
researchers discovered that not one program in the smaller sample
``made even a passing reference'' to safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   With teenage pregnancies reaching 1 million per year and
sexually transmitted diseases annually striking more than 3 million
teenagers, the sexual messages sent by TV are a matter of growing
significance, according to Vicky Rideout, director of the
foundation's Program on the Entertainment Media and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveys indicate that TV is one of the top sources of
information for young people about sex,'' Rideout said in an
interview. ``Obviously, parents and sex-ed classes in schools are
important, but TV is a part of the sexual socialization of young
people. It shows how men and women relate to each other, and what
the norms of sexual behavior are.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone was still in doubt, the study makes clear
just how preoccupied television has become with sex. Fully 85
percent of soap operas were found to contain sexual content; TV
movies, 83 percent; talk shows, 78 percent; dramas, 58 percent;
newsmagazines, 58 percent; sitcoms, 56 percent; reality shows, 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study defined TV sex broadly, counting everything
from passionate kissing to flirting to ``intimate touching'' to
sexual intercourse depicted or implied. Only 7 percent of programs
fell into the latter category.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in detailing the extent of sexual content on TV,
the study sheds a statistical light on the dramatic turnabout in
recent years from the repressive attitude toward sex that
characterized television's early years.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `I Love Lucy' in the '50s, Lucy and Ricky didn't share the
same bed, even though they were married,'' observed TV historian
Steven D. Stark. ``Sex on television was fairly nonexistent until
fairly recently. In the '80s, with `Hill Street Blues,' it really
opened up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's everywhere,'' he added. ``It's even in the ads and
promos all the time. There are no barriers anymore.'' (In this,
Stark noted, television mirrors the movies.)
</P>
<P>
   But television's preoccupation with the subject does not extend
to sexual precautions, the study found. In general, the subject of
safe sex is treated in a grudging and perfunctory fashion. For
instance, even when shows did make references to sexual ``risks and
responsibilities,'' half the time they were ``minor or
inconsequential.'' In addition, only 1 percent of the shows with
sexual content made sexual risks and responsibilities a primary
emphasis of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers did find that on shows with sexual content involving
teenage characters, the shows were twice as likely to make
reference to safe sex or delaying sex. However, that still amounted
only to fewer than one in every five shows, and Rideout noted that
many shows popular among teenagers feature young adults, programs
in which safe-sex messages were rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unprotected sex in this day and age? Where are they coming
from, with AIDS a major life-and-death disease?'' remarked Peggy
Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation's study also encountered some criticism
Tuesday within hours after it was released. Privately, some network
executives complained that studies like the Kaiser foundation's
apply a quantitative measure to a qualitative issue, that simply
counting the number of sexual remarks or acts does not convey the
subject's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Robert J. Thompson, head of the Center for the
Study of Popular Television, said it is unrealistic to expect
sitcom repartee to include safe-sex messages, and objected to what
he saw as attempts to ``mandate what television ought to be
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As uncomfortable as I am that every time I turn on a sitcom at
8 o'clock there's an erection joke, we also have to look at the
potential positive role television may be playing in sexuality,''
said Thompson. ``Some of the shows are beginning to talk about sex
in a sophisticated way. It can be done crudely or very well; `Ally
McBeal' is doing it very well, Howard Stern may not be doing it
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideout emphasized that the Kaiser foundation, a
California-based, independent philanthropy that has recently begun
including the entertainment industry in its studies on public
health issues, is ``not approaching this from a moral or
ideological point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see ourselves as sex police,'' she said. ``We're not
blaming TV for teen pregnancy. We're saying that when one out of
every two shows is communicating something about sex, it's a great
opportunity for people in the television industry to play a
positive role, to inform at the same time they're entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's a lot of people in the television business who
care very much about the impact they have and are trying to
incorporate responsible messages into their shows,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rideout praised the WB network's popular ``Dawson's
Creek'' for depicting two teenagers ``talking about wanting to be
prepared with condoms if they have sex.'' She also lauded the UPN
network's ``Moesha'' and the WB's ``Felicity,'' two other shows
popular among young people, for incorporating discussions of safe
sex into story lines.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also acknowledged that sex is more talked about than
consummated on most shows, citing racy banter on ABC's ``Spin
City'' and ``Dharma and Greg''; NBC's ``Friends,'' ``Veronica's
Closet,'' and ``Working''; and the WB network's ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rideout said the consequences of sex should be
``part of the picture'' even when it's just talked about, because
``the way people talk about sex is communicating important
information about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 88 shows that depicted or ``strongly implied''
intercourse without any discussion of safe sex, the study singled
out a pair of daytime soap operas, CBS's ``The Young and the
Restless'' and NBC's ``Sunset Beach,'' along with TV's top-rated
show, NBC's ``ER,'' and one of its most talked about, Fox's ``Ally
McBeal.'' The study also cited Fox's ``Party of Five'' and CBS's
``Chicago Hope'' as shows that have tried to convey safe-sex
messages.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that some in the TV industry have grown uneasy
with the medium's increasing preoccupation with sex. Scott Sassa,
the new president of NBC Entertainment, recently told TV critics he
has directed NBC writers and producers to cut down on the amount of
gratituitous sexual banter and situations.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Chris Ender, while saying the network would
reserve comment on the study until officials have a chance to read
it, said that ``overall, we believe we're very responsible in our
portrayals of sex.'' Spokespersons for NBC, ABC, Fox, and the WB
said network officials would have no comment until they see the
study.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HE is seated at the right hand of the Chuckster.
</P>
<P>
   And there might be no better place for this garish disciple of
NBA wit and wisdom than at the locker stall next to Charles
Barkley's.
</P>
<P>
   Fans are going to love this novice Rocket, this Cuttino ``Cat''
Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   He is all bright-eyed and talented, unafraid to step into the
league with his East Coast swagger and lanky, athletic game. He is
a cat, all right, bouncing around the floor in bolts, stroking his
goatee, purring to the crowd and smiling a sneaky smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the crowds,'' Mobley said. ``I eat it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the first two times Mobley stepped under the
lights. There was last week's game-winning shot at Golden State off
an assist from Barkley and then a hustling double-digit effort
Monday, even when his shot (2-of-8) was not falling.
</P>
<P>
   In the debut, Barkley, the veteran who likes to keep rookies in
their place, gave Mobley the ultimate show of respect. He gave him
the ball. Then, Barkley was the first to jump all over Mobley
congratulating him. And later, he was the first to bring the rook
back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you've done is hit one shot,'' Barkley told Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   He is seated at the side of the master. And loving it.
</P>
<P>
   The constant, often biting attention Barkley has given Mobley is
itself a compliment. It means Barkley has noticed the rookie. One
moment, he playfully cuts Mobley to shreds; the next, he sternly
instructs him on a particular play or mistake.
</P>
<P>
   He hands down stiff kangaroo-court fines for things like getting
lost on the way to the airport before the Rockets' first preseason
road trip, or dressing like the Rhode Island Huckleberry that
Barkley insists Mobley is.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday night's game, Mobley walked past his mentor wearing
jeans rolled up on his ankles, an untucked knit shirt and old
sneakers. Barkley's voice cut through the locker-room air and
knifed into Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, haven't I told you to dress better than that?'' Barkley
screamed. ``You're in the pros now. This ain't Rhode Island
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley smiled nervously and began stuttering through an answer.
``But Chuck,'' he said, ``I asked coach! He said it was all right.
I asked! I asked!''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's response: ``Coach is not policing this team. Dress
better, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley laughed again and tried to tuck in his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The kid's learning. The kid is a walking, talking _ and talking
and talking _ Chuck Roast, always the brunt of Barkley's barbs and
always trying to answer with one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The kid's going to be fun to be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nuts, and he's the closest thing to me,'' Barkley said.
``They put him next to me so I could calm him down. I don't have to
talk about him, because he'll talk about himself. He's not a shy
young man. I like that, but I like all our rookies. They're all
going to help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has been Mobley and starting off guard Michael
Dickerson making the smoothest transition and the most noise on the
court thus far. Rookie guard Bryce Drew did have his best outing
Monday and certainly showed promise.
</P>
<P>
   But through his first two appearances, inevitably it has been
the second-round pick from Rhode Island whose bold, fearless game
has caught the eye. To say nothing of the ears.
</P>
<P>
   He chats with opposing players, talks to himself, looks into the
crowd during breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather say what I think, and maybe some people don't like
it. But I'd rather have that than people say I'm flaky or moody,''
Mobley said. ``That's just how I was brought up. To be lovable.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Dickerson, whose explosive game contrasts with his shy
off-court demeanor: ``With Cuttino, he's loud, and I'm quiet. When
we hang out, he talks. I listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley has a locker next to Barkley's and a front-row seat to
the NBA world according to the Chuckster.
</P>
<P>
   He hears Barkley's voice billow across the locker room and
smiles widely. Barkley asks for extra tickets to the game, and
Mobley begins scurrying through his locker looking for some extras.
</P>
<P>
   He watches how Barkley handles the daily grind, the media focus,
the game preparation and, most important, the games. And he learns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good for them,'' Barkley said of the rookies. ``We give
them a distinct advantage. But (Mobley) hasn't done anything but
hit one big shot. He talks a lot for just one shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Mobley is seated next to Barkley for reasons other than
simply limiting the noise in the locker room to one corner of the
room.
</P>
<P>
   He is constantly learning. And laughing, when he is not making
others laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking up to Chuck for a long, long time,'' Mobley
said. ``He's just being himself. I'm just being myself. And if some
people don't like it, so be it.''

DELAY BLAMES DEMOCRATS OVER POSSIBLE PERJURY ALLEGATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling himself ``the most investigated man in
America,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay blamed the Democrats
Tuesday for stirring up allegations that he may have lied under
oath about his former pest control business.
</P>
<P>
   Finally responding 10 days after published reports about the
possible perjury in the course of a lawsuit against a former
Houston business partner, the Texas Republican described himself as
the victim of a Democratic-orchestrated plot to ruin his reputation
because of his forceful advocacy of President Clinton's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay continued to dodge questions about discrepancies
between a sworn 1994 court deposition and the personal financial
disclosure statements he must file annually with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition, DeLay said he was no longer either an
``officer or director'' of Albo Pest Control; but in his disclosure
statements for the same year, he listed himself as ``chairman of
the board'' of directors of the Houston company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have answers for all of that, and it ain't worth talking
about,'' DeLay said, following a Capitol Hill news conference on
children's issues.
</P>
<P>
   He accused reporters of failing to examine the motives of
Democrats he insisted are out to get him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see y'all digging into Democrats' pasts,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the most investigated man in America,'' he added.
``They're trying to bring me down.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was brought in 1993 by DeLay's ex-partner Robert
Blankenship and his wife, Jacqueline, a well-known Republican
activist in Fort Bend County, which is southwest of Houston. The
Blankenships accused DeLay and a third Albo partner of wrongful
termination and financial fraud, contending that company funds were
used by DeLay to pay off a court judgment against him and other
personal debts, including campaign loans.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay in turn accused Blankenship of stealing company property
and diverting profits to his personal use.
</P>
<P>
   In a pretrial deposition in early 1994, DeLay was asked by
Blankenship lawyer Gerald De Nisco if he was ``presently still an
officer or director'' of Albo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so, no,'' DeLay replied, explaining that he had
verbally resigned any position he may have held in the company.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay later backed off the statement, but he went on to claim
that he had not had ``much to do with the company since I was
elected to Congress'' in 1984. In addition, he denied receiving any
pay for company-related services he performed after 1985.
</P>
<P>
   However, in disclosure reports filed with Congress, DeLay listed
himself as either the president of Albo or chairman of its board of
directors from 1985 through 1994. He also reported thousands of
dollars in company-related income from service fees and capital
gains. He was also listed as a ``registered agent'' of Albo in
state business tax filings from 1991 through 1994, meaning that he
had at least a 10 percent financial interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with the discrepancy, De Nisco and the Blankenships
say DeLay either lied in his deposition or on his financial
disclosure reports. DeLay's responses in the deposition, they
contend, were designed to be intentionally misleading and evasive
in order to limit his financial liability in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied in the deposition, plain and simple,'' Jacqueline
Blankenship said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about DeLay's assertion that the Blankenships are pawns in
a Democratic plan to ruin his reputation, she said, ``This man just
doesn't stop. ... He's nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason I've been speaking out is because reporters
have been calling me,'' Blankenship continued, adding that DeLay
has tried repeatedly to discredit them in Republican circles ever
since the lawsuit was settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a precinct chairman for the Republican Party. I am
totally dedicated to the Republican philosophy. I just feel as
though there are some bad apples in every bunch,'' she said. She
described DeLay as a ``two-faced'' politician who pontificates
about morality on the one hand and then uses intimidation to
destroy his political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't call him the Hammer for nothing,'' she said,
referring to the nickname DeLay has earned for his aggressive
fund-raising tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to DeLay's office Tuesday evening seeking a response to
Blankenship's comments were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   But DeLay's long-running battle with the Blankenships is no
secret. In 1996, it spilled over into the Fort Bend County
sheriff's race when he threatened to undermine the campaign of
Republican Milton Wright if he did not fire Jacqueline Blankenship
as campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said at the time that the Blankenships ``are not the kind
of people I want to see connected to the sheriff's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright kept Blankenship on, won the race and described DeLay as
``vindictive.''
</P>
<P>
   As perhaps the president's most vocal critic, DeLay has long
criticized Clinton for lying to the American people not only about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, but a host of other issues
as well. He has at times described Clinton as the most immoral man
in America, and the worst example of a politician with no
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president just can't tell the truth,'' DeLay has said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the DeLay controversy has failed to ignite much interest
among lawmakers on Capitol Hill. There has been little talk about
it on either side of the aisle, although some Democratic aides have
suggested that the House ethics committee ought to look into the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But House Minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., has cautioned
his fellow Democrats to stay focused on issues that will help them
regain control of Congress in the 2000 election, and to avoid
partisan battles over personal matters.
</P>
<P>
   After DeLay spoke briefly with reporters Tuesday, one associate
suggested that the congressman does not intend to comment further
``because he's not going to try this in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He strongly feels that this is making a mountain out of a mole
hill,'' said one associate. He added that DeLay has no interest in
getting into a public scrap with a former business partner ``who is
out there trying to screw him'' for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just not going to respond to that,'' he said.

 &HT;    Georgia governor OKs bill blocking Mayor's gun suit
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hours after it cleared the Legislature Tuesday, Gov.
Roy Barnes quietly _ and quickly _ signed into law a bill blocking
the city of Atlanta's lawsuit against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who received the endorsement of the National Rifle
Association in last year's election, said his decision was based on
the chain of government command, not the suppport and campaign
contributions from the pro-gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``As governor, I acknowledge the right of the General Assembly
to control the cities which it has created,'' Barnes said in a
statement after a private bill signing.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about the NRA's role in his decision,
Barnes said: ``I was endorsed by the NRA, but I was endorsed by a
lot of groups, some of them I've not made happy this year. If I
thought that it was right or wrong or good public policy, (NRA
support) wouldn't prevent me or make me sign or veto anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill takes effect immediately, ending the legislative battle
over the right of any local government to bring product liability
suits against gun manufacturers, but it certainly doesn't end the
wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell called the Legislature's action
unconstitutional and said the city will press forward with its
attempt to recoup money for health and medical costs associated
with gun injuries and manufacturers' failure to install safeguards
against unauthorized use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe it is legal for the Georgia General Assembly
to prohibit cities from filing lawsuits designed to protect the
public's interests,'' Campbell said in a statement. ``We are
confident that a court will rule the (legislation)
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is the fifth city to take such action against gun
companies, but Georgia was the first state in which gun supporters,
led by the NRA, tried to block the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Atlanta supporters said the new law comes too late _
after the lawsuit was filed _ to be effective. For the state to
step in to block the suit now may not meet constitutional muster,
city supporters argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like retroactive punishment, retroactive
prohibition,'' said Rep. Tyrone Brooks (D-Atlanta).
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes, a Mableton, Ga. attorney, said that ``generally
constitutional rights such as ex post facto . . . retroactive laws
don't apply to governments.''

FAGAN PLEA BARGAIN OFF, KIDNAP CASE NEARS TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After a hearing in Superior Court Tuesday, and the
apparent dissolution last month of a plea arrangement, the case of
Stephen Fagan has moved closer to trial _ now scheduled for June 14
_ on charges that he abducted his two daughters more than 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls, then 2 and 5, were taken by their father while
their parents were in a custody battle, and the girls were raised
in Palm Beach, Fla. They were allegedly told that their mother had
died in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   A plea bargain discussed by Middlesex County prosecutors and
Fagan's attorney, Richard Egbert, could not be finalized, according
to several people familiar with the case.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Barbara Kurth, the girls' mother, said the
agreement would not have provided any jail time but would have
called for Fagan to volunteer 2,000 hours of community service in
Palm Beach, where Fagan reinvented himself as a philanthropist and
former presidential aide.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Jacob Atwood said the agreement would have also
required Fagan to donate funds to the New England Home for Little
Wanderers, perhaps the state's best-known residential home for
children.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said that Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Joseph
Grasso, at an earlier hearing, deemed the plea arrangement too
lenient.
</P>
<P>
   Newly elected District Attorney Martha Coakley said Tuesday that
she could not comment on the specifics of any attempted plea
bargain, or on the reasons for the failure to finalize the
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, as with any case, we tried to see if it could be
resolved without a trial,'' Coakley said. ``Now it's headed on a
track for a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the defense filed discovery motions for Kurth's medical
records, and the prosecution filed a motion to prevent them from
being made public.
</P>
<P>
   Those records include Kurth's history of narcolepsy _ falling
asleep suddenly _ and her bouts with depression, Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, who spoke with prosecutors in late December, wants her
former husband to receive a prison sentence for the kidnapping of
their daughters, according to her attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But Kurth, now a molecular biologist at the University of
Virginia Medical School, is opposed to a trial because she believes
it will cause further pain to her daughters, and possibly make it
more unlikely that they will reconcile with her.
</P>
<P>
   Since the case unraveled in 1997, when a relative of Fagan's
learned he was living in Florida and had concocted a new identity,
the two daughters, now young women, have remained loyal to their
father, saying he must have acted with their safety in mind. They
have yet to speak to her mother, despite her public appeal for them
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth referred all inquiries to her attorney Tuesday.

SMITHKLINE BEECHAM TO SELL TWO UNITS, CUT 3,000 JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move to increase lagging earnings, SmithKline Beecham PLC,
the world's eighth-largest drug company, announced Tuesday that it
would sell its clinical laboratories division and its pharmacy
benefits management unit for $1.97 billion in cash and stock.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said that it would cut 3,000 jobs from its
worldwide work force, now about 58,000, by the end of 2002 and sell
or close plants that are not essential to its core operations of
pharmaceuticals and consumer products. The reorganization will
result in a $1.2 billion charge to be taken over the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts applauded the divestitures, noting that the clinical
laboratories and the pharmacy benefit management units were
historically poor performers. However, some analysts thought the
prices on the deals were too low.
</P>
<P>
   Quest Diagnostics Inc., based in Teterboro, N.J., will buy
SmithKline's clinical laboratories unit for $1.025 billion in cash.
SmithKline will also receive a 29.5 percent stake in Quest valued
at $245 million.
</P>
<P>
   Express Scripts Inc. of St. Louis will acquire SmithKline's
pharmacy benefits management unit, which sells drugs to health care
plans and hospitals, for $700 million in cash, 69.5 percent less
than what SmithKline paid for it in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted enthusiastically to the announcements.
SmithKline Beecham's American depository receipts climbed 4
percent, or $2.75, to $68.9375 before investors began to take
profits. The stock closed at $67.125, up 1.4 percent. Shares of
Quest Diagnostics rose 13.8 percent, or $2.6875 a share, to
$22.125, while shares of Express Scripts increased $4.50 a share,
or 7.3 percent, to $66.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had long expected SmithKline, which makes the popular
antidepressant Paxil and consumer brands like Aquafresh toothpaste,
to shake up its operations. Last year, the company endured a year
of headlines over its two failed megamergers _ first with American
Home Products and later with Glaxo Wellcome _ leaving it with the
reputation of being a slow performer.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid the company's new strategies that were announced
Tuesday, there was a hint of the old SmithKline Beecham. The
company said that its earnings had increased 10 percent last year _
in line with analysts' expectations _ but nonetheless one of the
worst performances before special items among the world's top drug
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were optimistic on Tuesday that SmithKline could end
its ponderous ways. Jan Leschly, SmithKline's chief executive, said
the company's plan to cut 3,000 jobs and close plants is expected
to generate $327.5 million in annual savings by 2002. SmithKline
will use that money to pay for product development.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the divestitures, Leschly said, will be used to
repay debt. Provided the deals meet government approvals,
SmithKline could lower its debt-to-equity ratio to 15 percent from
52 percent at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised some analysts, however, was Leschly's confidence
over SmithKline's products. He expects the company's earnings to
increase 13 percent this year, slightly below the industry average,
then accelerate to mid- to high-teens in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, no one expected SmithKline to have strong
earnings,'' said Jonas Morner, a pharmaceuticals analyst with
Deutsche Bank Securities in London. ``But if the company can make
earnings in the high teens, it will be one of the top performers in
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline's moves to divest its lagging businesses and
streamline operations only revived speculation that the company
would merge soon. Analysts agreed that deals made the company more
attractive and could tempt a large competitor into attempting a
friendly takeover.

 &HT;    Fonda: Birth rate among teens down
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Georgia's teen birth rate has been dropping, Jane Fonda
said the organization she founded to address the problem is just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our missions is to help people understand that just
saying ``no'' doesn't work anymore,'' Fonda said during a luncheon
for the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention at the
Omni Hotel. ``I can't say we caused a reduction in adolescent
preganancy, but we are beginning to get there and I think we are
going to leave behind empowered communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which once had the highest teen birth rate in the
nation, is now fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda and her husband, billionaire philanthropist Ted Turner,
addressed about 400 G-CAPP participants at an annual convention to
chart strategy and rally the troops who have been targeting three
Georgia communties: Atlanta, Gainesville and Savannah. First Lady
Hillary Clinton was unable to attend as scheduled, but sent a taped
message to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reaching a turning point in the struggle against teen
pregnancy,'' Clinton said. ``But there are too many teens who have
still not gotten the message. For them, pregnancy is not just a
dream deferred, it's a dream ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carried that message to another group Tuesday, telling a
U.N. population conference in the Netherlands that all women should
be allowed to make their own family planning choices, including
access to safe abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Turner used the occasion to talk about several projects being
funded by his $1 billion grant to the United Nations, and left it
at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's $40 million in one year,'' Turner said, glowing.
``That's better than a kick in the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballroom was filled with prominent Atlantans that Fonda
referred to as ``BTO's'' _ big time operators _ including former
Spelman president Johnnetta Cole, construction magnate Herman J.
Russell, the Rev. Gerald Durley of Providence Missionary Baptist
Church and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus was teens like Crystal Boggs of Savannah, who
spent the last three days learning how to help those back home.
Boggs said three classmates in the all-girl school she attends got
pregnant last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned how to listen first, and be real with them,'' said
Boggs. ``Some girls are going to get pregnant anyway, but you can't
stop trying to talk to them.''

 &HT;    Issue of personal responsibility largely ignored, survey finds
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite widespread sex on television, fewer than 10 percent of
shows that deal with it mention issues of sexual responsibility,
according to a study released Tuesday by the Kaiser Family
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How sex is shown on TV is just as important as how much sex is
shown,'' said foundation President Drew Altman.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of prime-time shows contained some sexual
content, the survey found, which could include anything from
flirting to intercourse. But of those shows with sexual content,
only 9 percent mentioned topics such as contraception, disease
prevention or waiting for sex. And the study called half those
mentions ``minor or inconsequential.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey sampled 1,351 shows from 10 broadcast and cable
networks during the 1997-98 TV season and was conducted by the
University of California at Santa Barbara. News, sports and
children's programming were not included, but both daytime (talk
shows, soap operas) and prime time were.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Of the shows with sexual content, only 3 percent involved
teenagers. And 83 percent of the scenes involving teens and sex
involved talk only. Adults over 25 were most often shown sexually
(73 percent).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Prime-time dramas tend to mention sexual responsibility far
more often than comedies (23 percent to 3 percent).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The much-maligned daytime talk shows tended to raise issues of
responsibility more than any other category.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sex scenes were most common in daytime soaps and movies,
occurring in 85 percent of each.
</P>
<P>
   The study comes less than a month after Scott Sassa, the new
president of NBC Entertainment, said he wants to tone down
gratuitous sex on his network. But its concerns also run counter to
what appears to be parental apathy toward the TV content ratings
system.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ On a chilly Southern California night
recently, Drew Carey pulled his black Porsche into his reserved
parking space right outside the door of Stage 17, one of the huge
beige warehouses on the Warner Bros. studio lot.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to make a little comedy. It was going to be a long
night.
</P>
<P>
   As the audience of 250 waited for the taping to begin, Carey
went out with a microphone to warm up the crowd. ``I lucked into
all this,'' he cracked, that big, goofy grin plastered across his
face. ``I can barely tell jokes. That's all it takes to make it in
Hollywood _ just pick a network that needs a little help.''
</P>
<P>
   Spread out in front of the audience were the sets for ``The Drew
Carey Show'' (9 tonight on ABC ) _ his kitchen at stage left (the
audience's right), living room in the center, next to that his
office and, at the far end, the Warsaw, the Cleveland tavern where
Carey and Co. hang out. When an actor exits Drew's front door, for
example, he is practically stepping into Mr. Wick's office a couple
of feet away. With several cameras and more than 30 crew members
between the audience and the sets, though, it was frequently hard
to see what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-working guy on the set is definitely Dailey Pike, a
stand-up comic who never appears on camera, but keeps the audience
pumped up, so it can laugh at take after take of the same scene.
``We're going to see that scene again,'' he said over and over
during the evening, ``and I want you to act like you've never seen
it before.''
</P>
<P>
   The taping for the show that airs tonight began at 7:10 p.m. and
ended at 10:35 p.m. _ 3 1/2 hours for a half-hour sitcom. Actually,
that isn't bad. Sitcom tapings have been known to go into the early
hours of the morning when they're not working.
</P>
<P>
   The episode finds Drew and buddies Oswald (Diedrich Bader) and
Lewis (Ryan Stiles) all meeting the same woman (Diane Farr, the
sidekick on MTV's ``Loveline'') and all thinking they've met their
perfect woman. The competition will continue for two more weeks
after tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But on tape night, there were flubs to get through _ notably
Colin Ferguson, who plays evil boss Nigel Wick, and who Carey says
has a reputation for flubbing his lines the most. A scene in which
Kate (Christa Miller) is supposed to fumble while setting up a
massage chair was done over when she fumbled a bit too much and
everyone dissolved into laughter. At times, a taping can resemble
one of those bloopers shows, only live. And long.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Carey and the writers would huddle after a scene
and rewrite lines, which the actors were then expected to
incorporate smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is fixing the jokes on the fly,'' Carey said
afterward. ``I've never come to a taping where every line works.''

 &HT;    Plumber dies after poking head through manhole
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fred Brooks was looking for work Monday when he died
in a manhole.
</P>
<P>
   An independent plumber who just gone into business for himself,
the 46-year-old Forest Park, Ga. man was hit in the head by a car
as he left a manhole on Rock Mountain Boulevard in DeKalb County
near Stone Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   He had entered the manhole apparently hoping to locate the
source of a sewer problem that had been reported by a business to a
construction company Brooks had previously worked for, police and
federal authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was going to go by to take a look at the sewer
problem to give them a quote,'' said DeKalb police investigator
R.D. Toney.
</P>
<P>
   At the manhole, Brooks parked his unmarked pickup at the side of
the road, raised the manhole cover with two shovels, and lowered
himself into the sewer, leaving the shovels behind in the road,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no flagman to route cars around the manhole. Brooks
didn't set up any traffic cones to shield the open hole from
traffic or any warning signs, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was the stench of raw sewage in the hole that made
him scramble for the opening without regard for traffic, police
said. Perhaps it was methane that DeKalb firefighters believe had
accumulated in the hole and may have left Brooks starving for air.
</P>
<P>
   But when Brooks popped his head out of the hole shortly before
11:30 a.m., he apparently did so without looking. He was struck by
the undercarriage of a passing car.
</P>
<P>
   The blow to the head knocked him back into the sewer and killed
him.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, Sum Nguyen, 69, had steered over the hole as he
swerved to avoid Brooks' parked truck, police said. He struck one
of Brooks' shovels lying in the road. But when he glanced in his
rear-view mirror, the man saw nothing. He didn't realize that his
car had killed a man, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
investigating.

COMMENTARY: THE DEATH RATTLES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y.Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You have to wait until the fat lady sings,'' said Henry Hyde
on Monday, lest he leave no cliche unturned. ``And the fat lady is
not even clearing her throat yet.'' No doubt his staff had failed
to inform him that the ``Today'' show had just announced that on
Friday it would air the first network interview with Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   History _ not talk-show pronouncements about ``history's
judgment'' _ will determine whether the past year has been a
constitutional crisis, the apotheosis of a corrupt presidency, a
partisan witch hunt or merely an excruciating but meaningless
Washington car wreck played out in slow motion to a throng of media
rubberneckers. But whatever that unknowable verdict, we are now at
the death-rattle stage: Monicagate is like the wounded King Kong
just before he topples from the Empire State Building. Though the
scandal's kidneys and lungs have given out, fake controversies and
overhyped non-stories are keeping the body on life support until
the Senate administers the last rites. As John Dickerson of Time
candidly put it: ``Everybody's looking for a new angle after a year
... .''
</P>
<P>
   Herewith a crib sheet to the endgame's bogus last-ditch angles:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chelsea Clinton's privacy. &LR;  Bill and Hillary Clinton released a
statement deploring People magazine for running a cover story on
their daughter. The press watchdog Howard Kurtz framed the debate _
``Is 18-year-old Chelsea Clinton now officially fair game for the
jackals of media?'' _ and op-ed writers took sides. Clinton-haters
floated the idea that the White House complaint was merely a clever
ruse to promote the People article, which is pure puffery.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who actually slogs through the offending piece will
learn that it offers no new details about Chelsea Clinton's private
life _ except the most innocuous of nuggets from FOB's. There'd be
no People story at all had the Martha's Vineyard hostess Rose
Styron, the U.N. delegate nominee Richard Holbrooke and ABC's Dr.
Nancy Snyderman resisted the urge to see their own names in print
by advertising their intimacy with the first family. Perhaps the
Clintons should have simply given them Black Dog T-shirts in
exchange for shutting up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Christopher Hitchens and Sidney Blumenthal. &LR;  Let me get this
straight: Mr. Hitchens, a Clinton critic, signs an affidavit saying
that his friend of 15 years, Blumenthal, a Clinton sycophant, aided
Bill Clinton's effort to defame Monica Lewinsky. Yet Hitchens also
declares that he'd ``rather be held in contempt'' than actually
testify against Blumenthal should the Senate put the Clinton aide
on trial. The writer Christopher Buckley describes this dust-up as
``a Chambers-versus-Hiss moment ... the kind of event in which one
inevitably must take sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Must we? If Hitchens won't testify, there's no case. Even if he
were to testify, the case is still legally weak _ given
Blumenthal's lawyerly testimony _ and is at most a sideshow to the
impeachment articles. Where are the huge principles to rally
around? The fate of anti-Communism isn't at stake _nor even the
fate of the Clinton presidency. What is on the line is the guest
lists of certain Washington dinner parties, a lot of lawyers' fees,
and Hitchens' continued ability to command a spotlight on All
Monica talk shows. This catfight isn't Chambers-vs.-Hiss but
Beaver-vs.-Eddie Haskell, less suitable for CNN than for Nick at
Nite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Robert Byrd plays Hamlet. &LR;  The West Virginia senator who is
inevitably described as the Senate's most respected graybeard _
much as Hyde used to be labeled in the House _ introduced a motion
to dismiss the impeachment trial on Jan. 22. Now, less than three
weeks later, Byrd tells a worshipful Cokie Roberts that he has ``no
doubt'' that the president committed high crimes and misdemeanors _
but adds that he still may not vote to convict, despite his firm
belief in the letter of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Huh? Only Brit Hume of Fox News has had the guts to politely
speak the truth _ that it is ``a little strange'' and ``a little
erratic'' for the august senator to take mutually exclusive
positions on impeachment in the same month, and sometimes even in
the same sentence. We can only pray that Byrd, heretofore best
known for diverting piles of our dollars into boondoggles in his
home state, is merely suffering from temporary deprivation of pork.

MACWORLD ORGANIZERS RETHINK RETURN TO BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Organziers of the popular MacWorld computer trade show
are reconsidering plans to return the event to Boston this summer,
a move that could cost the city millions of dollars in lost tourism
business.
</P>
<P>
   MacWorld's organizer, IDG Expo Management Co., is having second
thoughts about its plans to abandon the New York venue where it
held the event last summer, according to local tourism officials
and others.
</P>
<P>
   After a lower-than-expected turnout in New York in July, IDG
Expo said it would bring MacWorld's summer edition back to Boston,
its traditional home. At the time, IDG Expo said a Boston location
would draw more software developers and other specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, MacWorld events are still planned for the World
Trade Center, the new Seaport Hotel, the Hynes Convention Center
and other locations for August 3-6 this year. Visitors are expected
to spend more than $20 million on hotel rooms, restaurant meals,
taxi rides and other services.
</P>
<P>
   But citing the improved financial condition of the maker of
Macintosh computers, Apple Computer Inc., IDG Expo officials now
expect a larger turnout for the summer convention. As a result, the
most appropriate venue for the event may be a single, large venue
like New York's Jacob Javits Center, say people familiar with IDG
Expo's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   IDG Expo manages the event for MacWorld's owner, International
Data Group in Framingham. Executives at both companies declined to
comment publicly on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Patrick Moscaritolo, president of the Greater Boston
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, described a flury of recent meetings
and discussions with IDG Expo in an attempt to assuage their recent
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can say with any level of definiteness what they're
going to do,`` Moscaritolo said. ``Apple has had some successful
product launches and that's starting to work against us.''
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the thinking of IDG Expo executives say the
a large venue might help focus attention on popular speakers such
as Apple's interim chief executive, Steve Jobs. The Javits Center
also makes it easier for software and hardware developers to
mingle, these people said. ``All of these factors are demanding a
single facility that can house all the needs,'' said one person.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision is expected in coming weeks. Despite IDG Expo's
apparent flip-flop, Moscaritolo said he hopes creative ideas will
keep the event in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Trade Center executives have drawn up plans to set
up large tents to create extra exhibit areas. They might also
purchase giant inflatable balloons shaped like iMac computers, and
erect them near the event.
</P>
<P>
   Trade Center spokeswoman Dawn Curtis said executives hadn't
estimated the costs of such measures. ``We're trying to brainstorm
and to provide them with a creative marketing opprotunity,'' she
said.

FBI AIDED PINOCHET REGIME IN SEARCH FOR 2 SUSPECTED LEFTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, Spain)  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI tried to track suspected associates of
Chilean leftists in the United States in the 1970s on behalf of the
government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean dictator, newly
declassified documents show.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI sent agents in New York and Dallas to search for two
people whose names were found in the address book of a courier for
an underground Marxist group in Chile. The courier was arrested in
Paraguay in 1975, and Paraguayan police passed on the information
to American officials, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI initiated an investigation in the United States of the
aforementioned people and addresses,'' the FBI's legal attache in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, wrote to a senior Chilean official in June
1975. ``I will inform you of the results of the investigation as
soon as I have them in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing came of the FBI investigations detailed in the
documents. The bureau could not find the people it was looking for
and closed the case. Their nationalities and whereabouts are
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the records show that the FBI worked in liaison with the
Pinochet government during the mid-1970s, when thousands of Chilean
leftists were rounded up and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, now 83 and in London, is awaiting a ruling by
Britain's highest court on whether he may be extradited on a
Spanish judge's warrant to face charges of crimes against humanity
committed during his rule from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
documents showed a routine and traditional form of cooperation that
always has existed between the bureau and many foreign
law-enforcement services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be remiss in not checking out these people,'' one FBI
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrested Chilean whose address book was seized in Paraguay,
Jorge Isaac Fuentes, was sent back to Chile, where he disappeared
in a prison, according to Chilean records. Fuentes is listed among
the more than 3,000 people who were killed by Pinochet's military
and intelligence services in the 1970s. An official Chilean
commission concluded in 1990 that ``his disappearance was the work
of government agents.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that Fuentes was arrested in Asuncion,
Paraguay, on May 17, 1975. Police in Paraguay informed Robert
Scherrer, the FBI's representative at the U.S. Embassy in Buenos
Aires. Scherrer was the legal attache at the embassy; his
responsibilities included working in liaison with South American
law-enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In his post, Scherrer learned, as he wrote in a 1976 FBI cable,
that Pinochet had created a program called ``Operation Condor''in
which the governments of Chile, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia and
Uruguay shared intelligence on suspected leftists. The cooperation
between Paraguay and Chile in the Fuentes case was an example of
this intelligence-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1975, Scherrer wrote to Gen. Ernesto Baeza
Michaelsen, director of Chile's general office of investigations.
Baeza, a graduate of the U.S. Army's School of the Americas, led
the coup against Chile's elected Marxist president, Salvador
Allende, that helped bring Pinochet to power.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Scherrer told Baeza that Fuentes had admitted
under interrogation by police in Paraguay that he was a courier for
the underground Revolutionary Left Movement in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The letter went on to list two entries from Fuentes' address
book. One was for a woman named Margaret Sun, living in Manhattan.
The other was for a woman named Sonia Bacicalupe, living in Dallas.
The declassified FBI records show that agents tried to find the
women, and ran checks with local police and credit agencies, but
did not locate either one.
</P>
<P>
   Documents on the Fuentes case were made available by the FBI at
the request of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 1, U.S. government officials said they would declassify
records of Washington's relations with the Pinochet government, and
the Spanish authorities pursuing Pinochet are keenly interested in
seeing those documents.
</P>
<P>
   But the process has barely begun; an order from the National
Security Council to the FBI and other agencies to begin the
declassification was not issued until Jan. 28, officials said.
Until more records are made public, the depth of the relationship
between the FBI and Chilean authorities will remain unclear. So
will the relationship between the U.S. government and the Pinochet
government.
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships are an issue in the decision, still being
weighed by the criminal division of the Justice Department, on
whether to charge Pinochet in connection with the 1976 murders of
Orlando Letelier, a former Chilean foreign minister and the Allende
government's ambassador to the United States, and Letelier's
American research assistant, Ronni Moffitt. They were killed by a
car bomb in Washington, a crime for which Chilean secret police
officials and a former Chilean intelligence chief were convicted
and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Scherrer, who died of multiple sclerosis in 1995, was one of the
FBI officials who helped solve the Letelier murder case. Before his
death, he recorded a statement saying he personally believed
Pinochet authorized the killings.

 &HT;    Senate begins deliberating on impeachment articles
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For only the second time in American history, the
Senate on Tuesday locked its doors and began deliberating
impeachment articles against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Senators started debating the two articles of impeachment
against President Clinton shortly after 2 p.m. after a bid to open
the deliberations to the public fell eight votes short of the
two-thirds majority needed. Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) voted to open
the deliberations and Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) voted to keep
them closed.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly heeding the vow of silence that is part of a closed
session, senators offered only the briefest descriptions of the
mood and atmosphere inside the Senate chamber as the deliberations
got under way.
</P>
<P>
   Without the glare of television lights, the chamber was darker,
said Sen. Herb Kohl (D-Wis.). With no one present but the 100
senators and a handful of staff, the room was also quieter.
Democrats and Republicans alternated speaking, with each given up
to 15 minutes to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senators are taking it pretty seriously because this is the
moment of truth,'' said Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was somber,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), emerging from
4 1/2 hours of closed deliberations. ``There was no demagoguery. It
was serious stuff. I was proud of the United States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Many senators were hopeful they could beat their Friday deadline
and vote on the impeachment articles Thursday, but the pace of
deliberations suggested the votes will likely come Friday after
all.
</P>
<P>
   In a signal that Senate Republicans are trying to tie up all the
loose ends before the trial is officially adjourned, Majority
leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) wrote to independent counsel Ken Starr
Tuesday asking Starr's office to determine if any government agency
possessed a taping system that might have recorded Clinton's phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Senators received information about a week ago raising the
possibility that such a system might exist, but they have not
confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   The tape system, which the White House says does not exist,
could provide a record of what Clinton discussed with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and presidential confidant Vernon
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Lott spokesman John Czwartacki conceded that Lott held out
little hope that any tapes would be found, but wanted to leave no
stone unturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unfair to the president and to history to let this
hang out there,'' said Czwartacki, adding that Lott did not want
any future ``grassy knoll theories'' to cast doubt on the
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   While the beginning of the deliberations signaled the final
phase of Clinton's five-week impeachment trial, senators were still
working behind the scenes to script the epilogue.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by a handful of Republicans, Democrats scrambled to craft
language for a censure resolution they they hope to offer
immediately after the impeachment trial concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) became the fourth Republican to
co-sponsor a censure resolution drafted by Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.). Snowe said she felt like she could support the
resolution after Feinstein agreed to add non-binding language
expressing the Senate's hope that the censure resolution, if
adopted, would never be subsequently repealed.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe also asked for language that would state that any decision
to prosecute Clinton criminally be made as though he were no
different than any other citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be strong in its condemnation and it has to be
bipartisan,'' Snowe said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tougher language may have alienated some Democrats. Sen.
Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who opposes censure, said several Democrats
asked to be dropped as co-sponsors after hearing of the revised
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shifts every day because no one can agree,'' said
Harkin. Senate minority leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Democrats
need 20 Republicans to ensure the votes to defeat a threatened
filibuster of the censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Any prospect for censuring the president now appears to rest
with Lott, who has the power to let the censure resolution onto the
Senate floor but who has ruled out a decision until after the
impeachment trial is over.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho), a member of Lott's leadership,
called censure ``a rose that's beginning to wilt.''
</P>
<P>
   All 45 Democrats voted to open the deliberations and 14 of the
55 Republicans joined them, but the 41-59 vote against opening the
proceedings was still short of the 67 votes needed. With no
dissent, senators agreed to allow copies of their speeches
delivered in closed session to be inserted in the congressional
record at the close of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats adopted different procedures for the
closed deliberations. Democrats allowed senators to speak in order
of seniority, if they chose to, while Republicans simply put their
names on a sign up sheet.
</P>
<P>
   While Republican senators, particularly those who voted for
closed deliberations, said they wanted the sessions to be
deliberative, rather than just a lot of senatorial lectures,
speeches appeared to be the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't suggest that it was soaring, but it was
thoughtful,'' said Craig. ``As it got engaged, there were some back
and forth questions, but not as much as I thought there might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said that most senators appeared to using their
full 15 minutes, despite a reminder from Lott that President
Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg address in under three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said 18 senators spoke Tuesday, with Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy (D-Mass.) opening for the Democrats and Sen. Slade Gorton
(R-Wash.) leading off for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While the discussions were at times spirited, they were never
too heated, said Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.).
</P>
<P>
   ``They were forceful. People feel very deeply about this
thing,'' Lautenberg said. ``There are some who feel that the facts
establish some level of a high crime...and then others who say
no.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said they would make Starr the central focus
of their remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just decide this case on the facts,'' said Sen. John
Kerry (D-Mass.). ``We also decide how this case fits into the
larger mosaic of whether the president should be removed. In my
judgment a very, very real component of that is the question of
entrapment and prosecutorial abuse.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: IMPEACHMENT STARTS INTO REALMS OF POLITICS AND
HISTORY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate voted on Tuesday to keep its final
deliberations on impeachment closed, the proponents of secrecy
argued one last time that American juries always make their
decisions in private. Yet even as they scored a victory, time was
passing them by.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton's acquittal certain later this week,
impeachment is rapidly moving out of the trial phase and into the
realm of pure politics. After the year-long scandal over the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky and five months of
congressional impeachment proceedings, the political parties have
begun their effort _ for both the 2000 campaign and for history _
to explain what the impeachment drive of the past year was all
about.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has almost two years left to try to find some major
achievements that could counterbalance for history the scandal that
followed his sexual encounters with a White House intern and his
efforts to cover them up. Republicans are searching for a way to
defy the verdict of current public opinion and have this
impeachment judged more kindly than the 1868 trial of President
Andrew Johnson, which is viewed today as a partisan vendetta. And
congressional Democrats are hoping to ride the public anger over
Clinton's impeachment of Clinton to win control of the House and
possibly even the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   All of these calculations are now coming into play in the
endgame of this trial. For that reason it was only Republicans on
Tuesday who voted to keep deliberations closed. Though many said
they thought the senators might yet sway each other, others said
that they were trying to cut off partisan posturing and keep the
Democrats from using their speeches to stoke a backlash against
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who is weighing a presidential bid,
showed just what the Republicans were looking to avoid when he said
that he wanted to make the conduct of the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, a critical element of the final debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have in front of us is a crime, so-called, that arose
out of a private consensual affair,'' he told reporters, ``and I
think most Americans understand that that crosses the zone of
privacy that has serious implications for constitutional rights and
fairness. I think that is a part of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans by contrast want to change the subject fast.
Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, on Tuesday urged senators as
they deliberate to remember ``that Lincoln gave his Gettysburg
address in less than three minutes and Kennedy's first inaugural
was slightly over seven minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   To show tbey are ready to move beyond impeachment, the
Republicans have bills ready to move on military salaries and
education and are poised to begin a debate over tax cutting. ``We
need to pivot and go on and get the impeachment behind us and start
really talking about the business that people do care about,'' the
new House speaker, Dennis Hastert, said in an interview with CNN's
``Late Edition.'' He also said that ``Congress if we're going to
get anything done, has to work with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Congress can move on, there is one last impeachment
issue to resolve: whether to acquit or censure Clinton, and here
too longer-term political questions, as well as constitutional
ones, are being calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the proponents of censure are Democrats who want to make
a statement that their vote to acquit Clinton does not mean they
condone his behavior. ``If he's acquitted, and I think he will be,
there will be those who say that those of us who voted for
acquittal exonerate his conduct,'' said Sen. Richard Durbin,
D-Ill., ``and that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   And so intent are they on censuring Clinton that some Democrats
are threatening that they will keep trying to attach such a rebuke
to pending legislation throughout the spring if Republicans do not
agree to censure this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who is the head of the
Democrats' 2000 election effort, said this would hurt the
Republicans. ``It becomes very hard for them to explain why they
were so incensed they wanted to remove the president from office
and won't provide the others even a vote on a censure resolution,''
he said. ``They are increasingly in a situation where they cannot
extricate themselves or explain themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Torricelli's confidence, there are other Democrats and
Republicans alike who believe Clinton's currently high job approval
ratings may well fall once he no longer seems under threat of
removal from Congress. One senior Senate Republican staff member
noted on Tuesday that in October 1991, during confirmation
hearings, the American public believed Justice Clarence Thomas. A
year later, he said, the public had changed its mind and come to
believe Anita Hill's account of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   So a growing chorus of Republicans and conservatives are saying
that that their party should not join the censure effort and thus
give Democrats an insurance policy in case public opinion changes.
``I think its about politics,'' said Sen. Larry E. Craig, R-Idaho,
who is opposed to censure. ``I think it's about cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's editorial page has told Republicans to
abstain on a censure vote. The Weekly Standard has showcased an
article by its opinion editor, David Tell, arguing that the Senate
should not censure Clinton but simply leave him in office. ``Better
that he be acquitted and nothiing more,'' he wrote. ``''Yes, Bill
Clinton's acquittal will bother a lot of people. All to the good.
It should bother every one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, the editor of the Standard, said ``I prefer to
have the Congress divided, the parties divided and let the American
people judge in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the stand is risky, given the way
impeachment has damaged the Republicans in opinion polls, but
joked, ``no guts, no glory.'' He said, ``The only thing that can
make Americans take a second look is by leaving the issues
unresolved and leaving a situation in which the two major parties
fundamentally disagree on this.''

WEIGHT-LOSS COMPANIES AGREE TO DISCLOSE CONSUMER INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leading weight-loss companies in the United States
have voluntarily agreed to disclose information to consumers about
the costs and risks associated with their diet plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, the companies will warn customers that
weight loss after the first two or three weeks of dieting should
not exceed three pounds a week; that very low-calorie diets may be
associated with some medical problems; that people with some
medical conditions should consult a doctor before undertaking a
diet, and that there may be some physical changes, like dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Total program costs and information about staff qualifications
and the components of the program would also have to be declared in
advance. The guidelines are to be provided to customers before they
sign a contract.
</P>
<P>
   What the guidelines do not require is information about the
weight-loss success rate and the customers' long-term likelihood of
keeping the weight off. But they must include information about the
difficulty of losing weight and keeping it off, as well as about
the fact that even a small amount of weight loss ( 5 to 10 percent
of body weight) may reduce some of the risks associated with
overweight and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission joined industry representatives in
a group, called the Partnership for Health Weight Management, that
created the guidelines. It includes other government agencies as
well as health care professionals, researchers. consumer groups and
commercial companies that sell weight-loss plans and products.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that have pledged to abide by the agreement include
Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Slimfast Foods Co. and TOPS Club. The
president of another company, Diet Workshop Inc., said he had not
seen the guidelines yet.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer
protection, said: ``This is the first time that people are agreeing
that there is a need for certain kinds of information. It is a
breakthrough in the field and hopefully it will be semi-uniform.
People can look at the different kinds of services and producers
and then make comparisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Over 70 years, the FTC has prosecuted companies selling diet
plans and diet aids for promising things they cannot deliver:
quick, permanent, inexpensive and risk-free weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency as well as the states have been bogged down trying
to deal with these issues for many years,'' said Ms. Bernstein.
``It was time to try to take a different approach to give people
accurate information.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the commission will stop prosecuting false
advertising about diet plans and products. Since 1990, it has
brought 70 cases against weight-loss companies, charging them with
failure to substantiate success claims for weight loss and weight
maintenance, and for failure to substantiate testimonial claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know we have jurisdiction to continue to monitor the
marketplace and we are not going to back off from that,'' Ms.
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   An official from the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
which sought mandatory guidelines from the FTC in 1996, said he was
disappointed that disclosure of success rate was not required.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science,'' said Bruce Silverglade, director of
legal affairs for the center. ``Weight Watchers discloses some of
that data and so do some hospital programs. Until everyone
discloses this information people should ask and be suspicious of
those that don't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Bernstein acknowledged that the partnership could not reach
an agreement on how to provide this information. ``We are still
trying to convince people to collect that data,'' said Ms.
Bernstein, ``but we did at least get agreement that many consumers
have difficulty getting weight off.''
</P>
<P>
   To get these messages out the partnership has produced a
brochure of the guidelines and a public service announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Blackburn, associate director of the Division of
Nutrition at Harvard Medical School, said the new guidelines would
make it possible for physicians to direct people to trustworthy
weight-loss plans. ``I think the public is confused,'' he said,
``but now people will have the information to ask the right
questions. They can ask these companies if they are following the
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies advertising that they follow the guidelines, whether
on the Internet or in stores that sell their products, and then do
not follow them, could end up being charged with false advertising
by the FTC.

TOP 10 WAYS TO CELEBRATE END OF IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an end in sight, we offer the list you've all been waiting
for.
</P>
<P>
   Top 10 ways to celebrate the end of the impeachment trial:
</P>
<P>
   10. Rip out your cable.
</P>
<P>
   9. Sew four gold stripes on the arms of your favorite jacket.
</P>
<P>
   8. Move to France, where presidential adultery doesn't cost
taxpayers a dime.
</P>
<P>
   7. Get a bunch of friends together and reserve the Mayflower
hotel's $5,000-a-night presidential suite, where your group can
re-enact the 23rd deposition of Monica Lewinsky _ just for the heck
of it!
</P>
<P>
   6. Write a thank-you note to Richard Douglas Llamas, the D.C.-er
who fulfilled many a citizen's fantasy on Thursday by standing up
during the Senate proceedings and shouting, ``God almighty, take
the vote and get it over with!''
</P>
<P>
   5. Throw a ``Celebrate the Impending Acquittal'' and/or
``Celebrate the Impending Conviction'' party. Attempt to whack the
Linda Tripp pinata or, perhaps, whoop it up over the victory of the
``vast right-wing conspiracy.'' Should be a good time for all.
</P>
<P>
   4. Pin a scrap of blue cloth to your lapel, in silent
commemoration.
</P>
<P>
   3. Get out that glue gun and consult Martha Stewart about the
best way to preserve your copy of the Starr Report for the
enjoyment of future literary generations.
</P>
<P>
   2. Attempt to locate your own moral compass.
</P>
<P>
   1. Register to vote.

BAPTIST AGENCY WANTS GUNS BANNED IN HOUSES OF WORSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Baptists are at odds over an unlikely topic: whether to
allow concealed handguns in houses of worship.
</P>
<P>
   A major Texas Baptist agency wants to toughen the state law
against carrying handguns in church. But some Baptists and gun
owners from other denominations oppose the change.
</P>
<P>
   As first passed in 1995, Texas' concealed weapons law prohibited
concealed weapons in churches. But two years ago, at the behest of
five pastors from his district, state Rep. Ray Allen, one of the
sponsors of the 1995 bill, helped get the law changed to prohibit
weapons only when a place of worship gives ``effective notice'' _
posting a prominent sign, giving people a card or verbally
informing worshipers of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 amendment, co-sponsored by Rep. Bill Carter, R-Fort
Worth, also gives the same option to hospitals, nursing homes,
amusement parks and at government meetings, said Allen, a
Republican from Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Baptist agency, the Texas Baptist Christian Life
Commission, which speaks out on social, ethical and moral issues
for the state's largest Protestant denomination, is pushing House
Bill 815, sponsored by state Rep. Jesse W. Jones, D-Dallas. His
bill would categorically ban concealed weapons in churches,
synagogues and other worship facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who operates the Academy of Firearms Training in Grand
Prairie, opposes the bill. He said his company has trained more
than 200 pastors from several denominations so they could qualify
for concealed handgun permits.
</P>
<P>
   Weston Ware, associate director of the Baptist life commission,
an agency of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, which has 2.7
million members, said the notice has not worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that most churches refuse to put up those
ugly signs,'' Ware said. ``And if the sign isn't there, guns are de
facto legal in church.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of guns in church is absurd, said some Texas pastors,
including the Rev. Robert Pearle, pastor of the Birchman Baptist
Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a no-brainer,'' Pearle said. ``I can't imagine
anyone carrying a weapon to church. What do they want to do? Kill
you and let you go to heaven faster?''
</P>
<P>
   Armed and unarmed security guards often are used around places
of worship to protect members walking to and from their cars and
also to guard against theft. In high-crime areas, parking lots are
fenced off and are well-lighted. Deacons and ushers keep a close
eye on those entering churches.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-related violence in churches is difficult to track, said Lt.
Mark Krey, a spokesman for the Fort Worth Police Department. Arson
and burglary are the most common crimes at churches, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington experienced a rash of church burglaries in the fall
and early winter of 1997, said Eve Gray, an Arlington police crime
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was more than a year ago, and it didn't repeat itself
this past year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But churches are not exempt from violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1991, Fort Worth churches reported a series of armed
robberies. One woman was robbed at the Burchill Baptist Church, and
two women were robbed at the Rising Star Baptist Church. During
that month, the Rev. Charles Gillespi was seriously wounded during
a robbery at the Concord Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   On Mother's Day in 1991, a 22-year-old Fort Worth man seeking to
avenge the death of his brother carried a rifle into the Missionary
Baptist Church and shot one man, who survived.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman later killed another man and dumped the body at Mount
Moriah Missionary Baptist Church, where he was trying to find his
parents, said the Rev. Isiah Taylor, the pastor who witnessed the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that brush with violence, Taylor said he doesn't approve
of concealed handguns in churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want to bring a handgun into the house of God?''
Taylor asked. ``It makes me want to vomit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Daniel B. Keys, pastor of Mt. Zion Baptist Church,
southeast of downtown Fort Worth, believes that churches should
have the option of allowing concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are living in treacherous times,'' Keys said.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on guns in church would also be unenforceable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to have a policeman at every door or have metal
detectors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Tom Heath, pastor of the 300-member Trinity Baptist
Church in Grand Prairie _ who has a concealed handgun permit _ said
criminals will shy away from churches where carrying handguns is an
option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rarely carry a weapon into church,'' he said. ``I've never
worn it in the pulpit. But I would preach with it if I thought the
church was being threatened.''

CLINTON IMPLICITLY THANKS HOUSE DEMOCRATS FOR SUPPORT ON
IMPEACHMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a closed-door session with House Democrats at
their retreat in Wintergreen, Va., on Tuesday, President Clinton
expressed his gratitude to lawmakers in what apparently was an
implicit thank you for their support on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said later that Clinton, who did not directly
mention the impeachment issue, told the approximately 100 lawmakers
that he wanted to help them win back the House next year.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was determined that Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the minority leader, becomes the next speaker, and he
praised Gephardt for deciding not to challenge Vice President Al
Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination next year.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiastic welcome he received from House Democrats marked
a departure from their often frosty relations in the past. House
Democrats have long complained that the president was not
particularly interested in working with them, or helping them
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them have groused that Clinton has worked more closely
with Republicans on Capitol Hill. Many have also blamed the
president for costing them control of the House in 1994, and have
complained that he was not sufficiently helpful in the subsequent
1996 and 1998 elections to help them wrest back control.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment led many of Clinton's old foes in the Democratic
Party to rally behind him.
</P>
<P>
   On policy questions, participants said afterward that Clinton
repeated the party's agenda, from cutting taxes to using the budget
surplus to shore up Social Security and passing a patient's bill of
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The president also defended his proposal for an increase in
military spending, according to one participant, who added: ``He
said, `I know some of you disagree with me on the increase in
defense spending. I hope you'll hear me out on it.'''  &QL;

WEIGHT-LOSS COMPANIES AGREE TO DISCLOSE CONSUMER INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `a' category)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leading weight-loss companies in the United States
have voluntarily agreed to disclose information to consumers about
the costs and risks associated with their diet plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, the companies will warn customers that
weight loss after the first two or three weeks of dieting should
not exceed three pounds a week; that very low-calorie diets may be
associated with some medical problems; that people with some
medical conditions should consult a doctor before undertaking a
diet, and that there may be some physical changes, like dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Total program costs and information about staff qualifications
and the components of the program would also have to be declared in
advance. The guidelines are to be provided to customers before they
sign a contract.
</P>
<P>
   What the guidelines do not require is information about the
weight-loss success rate and the customers' long-term likelihood of
keeping the weight off. But they must include information about the
difficulty of losing weight and keeping it off, as well as about
the fact that even a small amount of weight loss ( 5 to 10 percent
of body weight) may reduce some of the risks associated with
overweight and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission joined industry representatives in
a group, called the Partnership for Health Weight Management, that
created the guidelines. It includes other government agencies as
well as health care professionals, researchers. consumer groups and
commercial companies that sell weight-loss plans and products.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that have pledged to abide by the agreement include
Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Slimfast Foods Co. and TOPS Club. The
president of another company, Diet Workshop Inc., said he had not
seen the guidelines yet.
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer
protection, said: ``This is the first time that people are agreeing
that there is a need for certain kinds of information. It is a
breakthrough in the field and hopefully it will be semi-uniform.
People can look at the different kinds of services and producers
and then make comparisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Over 70 years, the FTC has prosecuted companies selling diet
plans and diet aids for promising things they cannot deliver:
quick, permanent, inexpensive and risk-free weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agency as well as the states have been bogged down trying
to deal with these issues for many years,'' said Ms. Bernstein.
``It was time to try to take a different approach to give people
accurate information.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the commission will stop prosecuting false
advertising about diet plans and products. Since 1990, it has
brought 70 cases against weight-loss companies, charging them with
failure to substantiate success claims for weight loss and weight
maintenance, and for failure to substantiate testimonial claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know we have jurisdiction to continue to monitor the
marketplace and we are not going to back off from that,'' Ms.
Bernstein said.
</P>
<P>
   An official from the Center for Science in the Public Interest,
which sought mandatory guidelines from the FTC in 1996, said he was
disappointed that disclosure of success rate was not required.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not rocket science,'' said Bruce Silverglade, director of
legal affairs for the center. ``Weight Watchers discloses some of
that data and so do some hospital programs. Until everyone
discloses this information people should ask and be suspicious of
those that don't.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Bernstein acknowledged that the partnership could not reach
an agreement on how to provide this information. ``We are still
trying to convince people to collect that data,'' said Ms.
Bernstein, ``but we did at least get agreement that many consumers
have difficulty getting weight off.''
</P>
<P>
   To get these messages out the partnership has produced a
brochure of the guidelines and a public service announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Blackburn, associate director of the Division of
Nutrition at Harvard Medical School, said the new guidelines would
make it possible for physicians to direct people to trustworthy
weight-loss plans. ``I think the public is confused,'' he said,
``but now people will have the information to ask the right
questions. They can ask these companies if they are following the
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies advertising that they follow the guidelines, whether
on the Internet or in stores that sell their products, and then do
not follow them, could end up being charged with false advertising
by the FTC.

NEWS ANALYSIS: IMPEACHMENT MOVES INTO REALMS OF POLITICS AND

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate voted on Tuesday to keep its final
deliberations on impeachment closed, the proponents of secrecy
argued one last time that American juries always make their
decisions in private. Yet even as they scored a victory, time was
passing them by.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton's acquittal certain later this week,
impeachment is rapidly moving out of the trial phase and into the
realm of pure politics. After the year-long scandal over the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky and five months of
congressional impeachment proceedings, the political parties have
begun their effort _ for both the 2000 campaign and for history _
to explain what the impeachment drive of the past year was all
about.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has almost two years left to try to find some major
achievements that could counterbalance for history the scandal that
followed his sexual encounters with a White House intern and his
efforts to cover them up. Republicans are searching for a way to
defy the verdict of current public opinion and have this
impeachment judged more kindly than the 1868 trial of President
Andrew Johnson, which is viewed today as a partisan vendetta. And
congressional Democrats are hoping to ride the public anger over
Clinton's impeachment to win control of the House and possibly even
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   All of these calculations are now coming into play in the
endgame of this trial. For that reason it was only Republicans on
Tuesday who voted to keep deliberations closed. Though many said
they thought the senators might yet sway each other, others said
that they were trying to cut off partisan posturing and keep the
Democrats from using their speeches to stoke a backlash against
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who is weighing a presidential bid,
showed just what the Republicans were looking to avoid when he said
that he wanted to make the conduct of the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, a critical element of the final debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have in front of us is a crime, so-called, that arose
out of a private consensual affair,'' he told reporters, ``and I
think most Americans understand that that crosses the zone of
privacy that has serious implications for constitutional rights and
fairness. I think that is a part of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans by contrast want to change the subject fast.
Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, on Tuesday urged senators as
they deliberate to remember ``that Lincoln gave his Gettysburg
address in less than three minutes and Kennedy's first inaugural
was slightly over seven minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   To show tbey are ready to move beyond impeachment, the
Republicans have bills ready to move on military salaries and
education and are poised to begin a debate over tax cutting. ``We
need to pivot and go on and get the impeachment behind us and start
really talking about the business that people do care about,'' the
new House speaker, Dennis Hastert, said in an interview with CNN's
``Late Edition.'' He also said that ``Congress if we're going to
get anything done, has to work with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But before Congress can move on, there is one last impeachment
issue to resolve: whether to acquit or censure Clinton, and here
too longer-term political questions, as well as constitutional
ones, are being calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the proponents of censure are Democrats who want to make
a statement that their vote to acquit Clinton does not mean they
condone his behavior. ``If he's acquitted, and I think he will be,
there will be those who say that those of us who voted for
acquittal exonerate his conduct,'' said Sen. Richard Durbin,
D-Ill., ``and that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   And so intent are they on censuring Clinton that some Democrats
are threatening that they will keep trying to attach such a rebuke
to pending legislation throughout the spring if Republicans do not
agree to censure this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., who is the head of the
Democrats' 2000 election effort, said this would hurt the
Republicans. ``It becomes very hard for them to explain why they
were so incensed they wanted to remove the president from office
and won't provide the others even a vote on a censure resolution,''
he said. ``They are increasingly in a situation where they cannot
extricate themselves or explain themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Torricelli's confidence, there are other Democrats and
Republicans alike who believe Clinton's currently high job approval
ratings may well fall once he no longer seems under threat of
removal from Congress. One senior Senate Republican staff member
noted on Tuesday that in October 1991, during confirmation
hearings, the American public believed Justice Clarence Thomas. A
year later, he said, the public had changed its mind and come to
believe Anita Hill's account of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   So a growing chorus of Republicans and conservatives are saying
that that their party should not join the censure effort and thus
give Democrats an insurance policy in case public opinion changes.
``I think its about politics,'' said Sen. Larry E. Craig, R-Idaho,
who is opposed to censure. ``I think it's about cover.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's editorial page has told Republicans to
abstain on a censure vote. The Weekly Standard has showcased an
article by its opinion editor, David Tell, arguing that the Senate
should not censure Clinton but simply leave him in office. ``Better
that he be acquitted and nothiing more,'' he wrote. ``''Yes, Bill
Clinton's acquittal will bother a lot of people. All to the good.
It should bother every one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kristol, the editor of the Standard, said ``I prefer to
have the Congress divided, the parties divided and let the American
people judge in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the stand is risky, given the way
impeachment has damaged the Republicans in opinion polls, but
joked, ``no guts, no glory.'' He said, ``The only thing that can
make Americans take a second look is by leaving the issues
unresolved and leaving a situation in which the two major parties
fundamentally disagree on this.''

BOTH SIDES SEE LESS LIKELIHOOD OF CENSURE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the impeachment trial rounds its final corner, a
central rallying cry _ that President Clinton should be formally
criticized, even if he is acquitted _ appears to be flailing,
despite hard lobbying on both sides for a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the two-page resolution calls Clinton's behavior
``shameless, reckless and indefensible,'' and includes several
other strongly worded provisions, all designed to attract
bipartisan support. But Tuesday, several Republicans said they were
still against censure of any kind, even as some Democrats said the
new language had become too harsh, indicating nearly insurmountable
opposition on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Weakening the prospects of censure further still are the rules
of the Senate, which might prevent trial-weary senators from
settling the matter until later this month _ long after most had
hoped to rid themselves of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that there are going to be those who are going to
use Senate rules to undermine it and prohibit it at this time,''
said Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be very difficult, given the opposition
of some senators to get censure to the floor, at least now,''
agreed Senator John F. Kerry. ``And that may indeed doom it
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans oppose censure as merely a political cover for
Democrats while others have constitutional concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such opposition, Senate Minority Leader Thomas A.
Daschle took the first steps toward censure on Monday night. He
filed a procedural motion to force a vote on whether to suspend the
Senate rules, which would allow censure to leapfrog over all the
ordinary steps and come to the floor immediately after the
impeachment votes.
</P>
<P>
   While strictly procedural, a vote on Daschle's motion would
serve as a crucial ``test vote'' for advocates of censure. It would
require 67 votes to pass _ 16 more than needed to approve a censure
resolution and seven votes more than needed to override a potential
filibuster _ and could quickly signal how much support censure has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long row to hoe,'' Senator John H. Chafee,
a Rhode Island Republican who supports censure, said Tuesday night.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who helped
draft the proposal, agreed, saying he was ``a bit less optimistic
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem now is procedural. I think there's a clear
bipartisan majority that wants to vote for censure, but right now I
don't see 67'' votes, Lieberman said. ``So the unfortunate prospect
is that instead of ending with a strong unifying statement of
values, there's a danger that we will end in a weak parliamentary
gridlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Republicans are poised to block censure at every
procedural turn. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who has said
``discussion at this time is inappropriate and premature,'' is not
participating in any of the negotiations, said Lott's spokesman,
John Czwartacki. Lott has not even seen the draft, Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most fierce opposition has come from Senator Phil
Gramm, a Republican from Texas, who not only has threatened to
filibuster but also vowed to introduce 118 amendments to free
people who have been convicted of perjury if a censure motion is
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 118 people in the federal penitentiary for
perjury,'' he said. ``If we're going to censure the president,
perhaps we should pardon and censure them, one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also found censure critics in their own ranks. Senator
Tom Harkin, a Democrat from Iowa, said he opposed the measure for
constitutional reasons and because of the precedent it might set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we go down a bad road there,'' he said. ``What
then is to prevent a president from censuring a senator or a
congressman?''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat from New Jersey, objected
on different grounds, saying the proposal drafted by Senator Dianne
Feinstein, a Democrat from California, was ``too assertive in some
places.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been tilting against it,'' he said. ``I think it's too
severe.''
</P>
<P>
   According to several Democrats, anywhere from five to 10 members
of the party were still uneasy about censure as of Tuesday night.
Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Republican from Utah, has been
encouraging members of his party to consider censure. Tuesday, he
met with some success, as Maine Senator Olympia Snowe signed on to
censure, after being assured it would contain a provision
preventing it from being repealed later.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the timing appeared to be censure's biggest foe. As
senators left the chamber Tuesday night, after 4 1/2 hours of
closed deliberations, few could fathom the prospect of dragging out
the negotiations beyond this week.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said,
``It's just going to be impossible to get. My guess is that we're
not going to get a censure resolution through this week. Then we go
home for a week. When we come back, nobody's going to want to talk
about impeachment.''

GERMANY AGREES TO SET UP FUND TO COMPENSATE VICTIMS OF NAZIS
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The German government said on Tuesday that it had
agreed in principle to establish a huge compensation fund, financed
by the biggest names in German industry and banking, to compensate
victims of Nazi horrors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, announced here by a top aide of Germany's new
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, appears to be an effort to
short-circuit a wave of lawsuits in American courts against German
companies that made use of slave labor and forced labor during
World War II or profited from the seizure of assets belonging to
Jews and other victims.
</P>
<P>
   German officials have also made it clear that they want to avoid
the kind of international bruising that Switzerland suffered for
nearly two years, as the government fought off legal and diplomatic
actions against Swiss banks. Ultimately, the two largest banks in
Switzerland reached a $1.25-billion settlement, which was formally
signed last month.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference here on Tuesday, Schroeder's
chief-of-staff, Bodo Hombach, said that it would take some time
before the German government, its major corporations, Jewish groups
and lawyers representing Holocaust victims settled on the size of a
fund to resolve outstanding claims against German companies.
Nonetheless, participants in the talks said they thought the amount
paid by the Swiss banks would be a starting point and that the
German settlement _ which is likely to include Deutsche Bank,
Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, Siemens and others _ could easily range
into the billions.
</P>
<P>
   What the German concerns want in return is exactly what the
Swiss got: a ``global'' agreement that ends virtually all suits.
Hombach also suggested on Tuesday that Germany had concluded, after
watching the Swiss experience, that a prolonged fight was not in
the interest of the country or its companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could legally win and lose your reputation,'' he said. The
idea of a voluntary settlement ``is not something that the head of
the legal departments of German companies might subscribe to, but
the CEOs understand the political importance.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the Swiss and German cases are not comparable:
Switzerland was a neutral in the war, and the suits against its
banks marked the first time in half a century that the Swiss were
confronted with their mixed wartime record.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, successive generations of Germans have endlessly
wrestled with their national legacy. Hombach noted on Monday that,
since Germany's surrender, the government has already paid 140
billion marks, or about $80 billion at current exchange rates, in
war reparations and aid.
</P>
<P>
   The German announcement, which came after lengthy negotiations
on Monday at the State Department, won praise from the World Jewish
Congress, which pressed the Swiss case and has been a central
player in the negotiations with Germany. ``It is extremely
encouraging,'' said Israel Singer, who heads the organization,
``that they seem sincere in reaching moral and material
restitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the plantiffs in the suits _ who have often been
at odds with the World Jewish Congress _ were far more cautious.
Several plaintiffs' lawyers who are involved in class-action
lawsuits against German companies over Holocaust-related claims
said that a meeting here Monday night with Hombach had marked the
beginning of a dialogue but that it was premature to say any kind
of agreement was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   The German government is apparently hopeful that State
Department officials, led by Stuart Eizenstat, the undersecretary
for business and economic affairs, will find a mechanism that will
allow the Holocaust-related claims to be resolved outside the
courtroom. One possibility is a bilateral treaty between the United
States and Germany terminating the claims once the new fund is
established, an issue that Hombach said would be discussed at the
White House on Thursday in a meeting between Schroeder and
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear that a bilateral treaty would completely
protect the German companies. Many of the claims are being brought
on behalf of former forced laborers from countries like Poland, who
would not be affected by any bilateral agreement between the United
States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The talks to reach a settlement are likely to be difficult,
given the competing interests of Jewish groups, plantiffs and
lawyers, some of whom are still haggling over their fees for the
settlement with Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   The German companies have an extraordinary incentive to come to
some kind of settlement, especially now that the introduction of
the euro, the new common European currency, provides an incentive
for them to expand their operations around the world. And no
company has a stronger interest in a settlement than Deutsche Bank,
which acknowledged last week that it had provided much of the
financing for the construction of the Auschwitz death camp.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is attempting to complete an acquisition of
Bankers Trust Co., creating one of the largest financial services
concerns in the world. Deutsche Bank's chairman, Rolf Breuer, held
talks with the World Jewish Congress and other groups here on
Monday, leading Singer to declare that he would not object to the
merger while the talks were under way.
</P>
<P>
   But New York City's comptroller, Alan Hevesi, who was
instrumental in pushing Swiss banks to a settlement after he
organized a threatened boycott of the banks, said he was not yet
ready to step out of the way of the Deutsche Bank combination with
Bankers Trust.

SENATORS EXPRESS VIEWS ON CHARGES AGAINST CLINTON IN CLOSED
SESSION

 By FRANK BRUNI c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a vote by the Senate to keep its
deliberations closed, the doors to the chamber were shut tight on
Tuesday as senators began to render their final thoughts and
arguments about the votes they will cast in only the second
impeachment trial of a president in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   With spectators, reporters and television cameras gone, senators
stood up one at a time, walked to a microphone in the well of the
chamber and explained why they felt that President Clinton had
committed high crimes and misdemeanors and should be expelled from
office or why the president's behavior, however unsavory, did not
warrant such a fate, according to several senators.
</P>
<P>
   Although the verdict is a foregone conclusion, with votes for
conviction expected to fall well short of the 67 necessary, the
deliberations marked the only formal opportunity during the trial
for senators to express their assessments of the case inside the
chamber. They did so somberly, without partisan sniping or rancor,
over four and a half hours this afternoon, several senators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, senators are taking it pretty seriously,
because this is the moment of truth,'' said Sen. Herbert Kohl,
D-Wis., during a late afternoon break.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the deliberations provided some small hope for
proponents of a resolution to censure the president, because it
suggested that senators might abbreviate their remarks and that the
Senate might have time left before the weekend _ and before a
recess next week _ to debate that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although each senator had been allotted a maximum of 15 minutes
to speak, some of the estimated 18 senators who had delivered their
remarks by the time Tuesday's session drew to a close around 6:30
p.m. took a few minutes less than that, while a few asked for more,
according to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations were expected to resume at 10 a.m. on Wednesday.
Given the pace of progress so far, the deliberations should
conclude sometime Thursday or early Friday, at which point senators
would cast their votes of guilty or not guilty without any further
explanation of their positions.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the word ``deliberations'' was a misnomer for what
transpired behind closed doors on Tuesday. Many senators had
already foreshadowed their decisions about the case in interviews
with reporters and appearances on television news programs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, several senators said on Tuesday that the closed
session was less a group conversation whose participants grappled
for certitude than a series of carefully considered speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some interruptions,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said during a break in the session, ``but not a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican senator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that senators' speeches split almost exactly along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said that all of the Republicans who had spoken
said they would vote to convict the president on the second article
of impeachment, which charges Clinton with obstruction of justice,
while all of them except Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska said they would
cast a guilty vote on the first article, which concerns perjury.
</P>
<P>
   All the Democrats, the senator said, announced that they would
vote to acquit the president on both articles.
</P>
<P>
   Although senators are forbidden by Senate rules to divulge many
details of the closed session, some of them did sketch broad
outlines of what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   According to these senators, the first speech Tuesday afternoon
was delivered by Sen. Slate Gordon, R-Wash., and others who spoke
included Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.; Don Nickles, R-Okla.; Carl
Levin, D-Mich.; Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Phil
Gramm, R-Texas; Joseph Biden, D-Dela., and Frank Lautenberg,

   Senators said there were a number of moments when something akin
to an actual discussion occurred, with senators in the audience
piping up to ask whoever was speaking about his or her viewpoint.
But they said the atmosphere remained dignified and friendly with
few exceptions, if any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone was very collegial,'' Levin said at the end of the
session. ``People feel very somber, very thoughtful, very
respectful of other views.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the speeches, Levin, who gave one of them, said: ``There was
a range of approaches. Some were very emotional, some were very
historical, some were very analytical. Mine tended to be
analytical.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that he would be voting to acquit the president on
both articles of impeachment _ perjury and obstruction of justice _
but he declined to say anything specific about his remarks in the
chamber, saying he was not certain Senate rules permitted him to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, characterized the mood in the chamber
as almost dutiful. ``The speeches in there were not all
invigoratingly dynamic,'' Craig said after the session ended, ``but
most senators are paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate convened around 1 p.m. on Tuesday and proceeded
almost immediately to a rapid-fire series of motions, objections
and requests for unanimous consent that evoked the bitter arguments
in recent days over whether Senate impeachment rules should be
suspended and the deliberations opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to open them fell short by eight votes of reaching
the two-thirds majority required for its passage. Fifty-nine
senators voted in favor of it, with 14 Republicans joining 45
Democrats, while 41 senators, all Republicans, favored keeping the
deliberations closed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the motion would have suspended Senate rules, which call
for closed deliberations, it needed the support of 67 senators.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after its failure, five senators who had pushed for it
left the Senate floor in the middle of the session to vent their
disappointment at a news conference upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor of the Senate, no matter how clubby we think it is,
is not a private club,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told reporters.
``The public has every right to see and hear us deliberate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who appeared with Harkin at
the news conference, noted that even though a transcript of the
closed session would be taken and might be unsealed at some point,
Americans now and future generations would be shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overriding all of this,'' Hutchison said, ``is that the people
of our country will never be able to see the debate that is real on
videotape, not now and not for history, because we have closed the
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Senate rules forbid the lawmakers from divulging what
occurs in a closed session, senators had voted in open session to
allow one another the option of publicizing explanations of their
positions and essentially reiterating what they said or intended to
say in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But there was confusion among senators afterward about whether
they were authorized to do so only after the verdict or before it
as well. In fact, the motion to allow them some latitude in talking
about their statements in the chamber was so hazy that the Supreme
Court Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, made a joke of it.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, began to proceed to
other business before the motion was decided, Rehnquist, who has
presided over the proceedings, reminded him, ``We have a motion,
however amorphous it may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott blushed, laughed and responded, ``Thank you for that
amorphous ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senators later said that they would release statements
about their positions before the verdict, but only one, Lautenberg
of New Jersey, had done so by early this evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although President Clinton's shameful behavior in an
inappropriate relationship has caused great pain to his family and
the nation, the House managers have not proven that he committed
`high crimes and misdemeanors,' '' Lautenberg said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conduct did not threaten our constitutional system,''
Lautenberg continued, ``and the national interest will not be
served by removing him from office. I hope that my colleagues will
reject the articles of impeachment and not weaken the presidency
for future generations. These proceedings should not serve as a
precedent for using impeachment as a political weapon.''

   WASHINGTON _ After 13 months, the scandal guns fell silent
Tuesday, although a lone citizen paced before the Capitol's East
front, repeatedly bellowing his own verdict as the Senate went into
lockdown with President Clinton's fate in its hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``A liar cannot be president of the United States!'' shouted the
man, brandishing a wild gray beard and a firebrand's yowl before
the domed glory of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The East grounds were otherwise quite serene, inching toward
spring. The main pediment figures atop the Capitol columns stared
stonily upon the man and the land beyond, led by the allegorical
America shielding her nation. As if in anticipation of the
impeachment stakes, she was immediately attended by the figure of
Justice to her left and, to her right, Hope, who leaned on the
anchor of the ship of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw the bum out!'' the bearded citizen prattled at the
building.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Well beyond earshot, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, made a last
visit to his office to retrieve two constitutional tomes. He was
spotted hurrying by the sculptured busts of statesmen past and into
the Senate at 2:10 p.m. The door was closed and locked to
outsiders, the corridors fell peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   Parting sound bites had already been uttered in the television
gallery by some senators who sought in vain for their verdict
deliberations to be open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is posterity being denied something fundamental?'' one senator
who preferred privacy was asked earlier by a television reporter,
the news man sounding as alarmed as a diver finding his oxygen line
slashed just as some feverishly imagined treasure glints amid the
muck.
</P>
<P>
   Even the loudest objections were to no avail. A final bout of
Senate restlessness was gaveled down.
</P>
<P>
   And then the impeachment court was cloistered within something
rare for the long running Clinton-Lewinsky scandal: the official
invocation of public silence itself, a period of truce amid the
fury. No revealing film at 11, nothing much to even be leaked _ a
shocking turnabout itself after the grueling year the nation has
been through.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Through the deliberation hours, senators kept to themselves. On
coffee breaks, they emerged and tried to just say no to waiting
news workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only secret we have left in town,'' pleaded Sen.
Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., offering a commentary on the capital scandal
culture even more than the verdict in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Break done, he returned with the others to the chamber to
deliberate, with Senate clocks once more aglint with the jewel-like
red light signaling that the senators were beyond the reach of the
curious nation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as they pondered a verdict on Clinton, fresh lures to
scandal had been cast about the Capitol: Just before they were
sequestered, Senate Republicans called on Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, whose investigation spawned the impeachment case, to
look into someone's allegations that taped presidential
conversations might exist that could have something to do with the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats pointed to the timing and vagueness of the
Republicans' referral, dismissing it as a parting rubber bone to
soothe House Republican prosecutors widely expected to lose their
case when the Senate delivers its verdict. A Senate Republican
spokesman denied the referral was ``a stunt,'' insisting that the
goal was only historic thoroughness, lest ``dangling questions''
and ``grassy knoll theories'' bedevil the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my kind of trial,'' said a tired Senate worker when
the vote was cast guaranteeing that the deliberations would not be
opened to the public. His point was that the presence of television
might only invite extreme speechifying and grandstanding, as some
senators themselves had warned, as well as a deliberation reaching
the maximum 1,500 minutes _ a quarter-hour per senator across three
days.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday evening, there were some estimates the 1,500-minute
mark might be approached in private any way, so momentous is the
issue. ``After 20 senators, all will have been said, but not all
will have said it,'' Herb Kohl, D-Wis., declared before the Senate
quit for the day after more than four hours, with more to come.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Senate had been briefly prayed over as it faced ``this
breathtaking call'' to duty. A tinge of elation seemed at hand for
the fact that someone, some body _ the Senate _ was about to try
and find an official ending for a harrowing story that seems ever
to threaten to ravel onward.
</P>
<P>
   Under tight impeachment procedures, the Senate briefly delayed
from closing itself in when several members tried to make points
via leadership inquiries about the precise method for eventually
explaining individual verdicts in the Congressional Record. Almost
nostalgically, the chamber was threatened with an actual debate.
This was a yearning that Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
understandably tolerated, as if sensing the chamber's impeachment
cabin fever. But only up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parliamentarian tells me this is all out of order,''
Rehnquist finally ruled, drawing easy bipartisan laughter. With his
notice that the moment for constitutional duty was at hand, the
Senate quickly fell silent, the chamber was cleared of witnesses,
and the discussion began in private on whether the president's
misbehavior merits his removal from office.

SECURITY DEALERS' CHAIRMAN VOICES CONCERN OVER INTERNET TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The head of the organization that operates the Nasdaq
stock market says that the frenzy for trading stocks over the
Internet may be creating an increasingly risky environment for
investors, one that could undermine the public's confidence in the
financial markets and perhaps even create greater regulatory
scrutiny of brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq stock market and
regulates Nasdaq activity, said last week in a letter to chief
executives of the organization's more than 5,000 members that the
``frenetic'' activity in the marketplace this year was posing
greater problems for the industry. He suggested that the turbulence
could have a ``lasting impact on self-regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarb's letter comes amid growing concerns that the explosive
growth of online trading in volatile Internet and high technology
stocks is creating a risky and unhealthy environment for small
investors who regulators say may be naively trying to trade their
way to fast riches.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, which was issued last Thursday but posted on the
NASD's Web site Tuesday, Zarb said that he was also responding to a
growing number of complaints from investors who had experienced
poor service and execution of online trades. He said he was also
concerned about customers borrowing to trade in risky stocks and
about advertisements and promotions that create ``unrealistic
expectations'' about making money trading online.

STOCKS TAKE BEATING IN BROAD-BASED SELLOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were battered Tuesday in a broad-based
selloff that hit not only high-flying technology and Internet
issues but also blue chips and small companies.
</P>
<P>
   The decline was most pronounced among Nasdaq stocks, which so
far this year have posted the biggest gains. But the Dow Jones
industrial average fell to its lowest level since Jan. 22, a
performance that erased its gains last month and left the index
below where it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which had been held aloft by
the stellar performance of a handful of stocks, also plunged,
leaving it in negative territory for the year. The Russell 2000
index of small company issues, which has badly lagged the
performance of other market indexes, slumped.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks, under heavy selling pressure for the past few
sessions, were hammered again Tuesday. Still, a key index of
Internet stock performance is well ahead for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp drop in prices was not the product of frantic trading:
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a relatively modest 713.6
million shares. And it was not caused by unexpectedly bad news.
Analysts attributed the market's behavior to what they called the
need for a correction after the sharp ascent by market averages
since October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is healthier than the alternative, which is that the
market's valuation becomes twice as large as the country's gross
domestic product,'' said William Meehan, the chief market analyst
at Cantor Fitzgerald. ``The pullback we are seeing is still well
within what many bullish people call a moderate correction.''
</P>
<P>
   By the close of trading, the Nasdaq composite had shed 94.13
points, or 3.9 percent, to 2,310.79. It was the worst drop for the
index in four months and its third-biggest point decline ever.
Since it peaked on Feb. 1, the Nasdaq composite has declined by 8
percent. Still, it rose so much in January that it is up 5.4
percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow average lost 158.08 points, or 1.7 percent, to 9133.03.
Of the 30 stocks that make up the index, only three _ J.P. Morgan,
Coca-Cola and United Technologies _ rose in price Tuesday. For the
year, the Dow is now down a half percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which for some time has been
sustained by high-flyers like Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems and
Dell Computer, fell sharply, as prices of those issues plunged. The
index closed at 1,216.14, down 27.63, or 2.2 percent. Since it
peaked on Jan. 29, the index has declined 5 percent. It is now down
1.1 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   As the year began, a number of analysts were predicting a
comeback for small company shares. Compared with the prices of
large cap stocks, they looked inexpensive. Thus far, that forecast
has been inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index, a broad proxy for small company stocks,
fell 8.20 points Tuesday, or 2 percent, to 403.13. For the year,
the index is now down 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many forecasters labeled the sharp run-up in Internet stocks
over the past few months a mania, and said they were looking for a
sharp correction. That may be what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, TheStreet.com's index of 20 leading Internet issues
fell 48.59, or 9.6 percent, to 456.26. Since its peak on Jan. 11,
the index is down 22.5 percent. Still, for the year the index is up
12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing is a correction of the leadership stocks
of December and January, technology and the Internet,'' said
Marshall Acuff, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
``That is happening because prices of these stocks had gotten way
ahead of themselves'' relative to their earnings' prospects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a number of analysts have said the decline in
Internet issues would be triggered by a sharp increase in the
supply of stock in these companies.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions, a company which has the exclusive right to
assign Internet addresses, was the victim of that phenomenon
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced that 4.58 million of its Class A shares
were sold at $170 each in a secondary offering. The increase in
supply encouraged many to sell, and Network Solutions fell 26 1/8,
to 148.
</P>
<P>
   The market's high valuation on Lycos Inc., the No. 3 Internet
search directory, did not stand up Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, which since the start of the year has been the market's
tenth-best performer, was pummeled Tuesday after USA Networks Inc.,
a media company, said it had agreed to buy Lycos in a transaction
that implied a far lower market price for Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos fell 33, to 94 1/4, after USA Networks valued the
combination at $22 billion, an amount analysts said implies a price
of $91 a share for Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lycos deal was the dominant factor in what was a very poor
day for Internet stocks,'' said Paul Cook, lead portfolio manager
for Munder Capital's NetNet fund. ``That was why a lot of players
decided to move out of a lot of these companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading Internet stocks, Yahoo! fell 17 7/8, to 140
3/4. And Amazon.com lost 9 1/8, to 100.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of much bigger companies that have profited from their
exposure to the Internet also fell back.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T dropped 3 5/8 to 87 3/8. Cisco Systems fell 6 to 95 15/16.
And Microsoft declined 5 3/16, to 160 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow stocks, Merck was the biggest loser, falling 5 1/8 to
145 1/8. And IBM declined 4 5/8, to 162 3/8.

MODERATE HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE TAX-CUT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ohio, N.M., Mich., Pa., N.J., N.H., Iowa, Va., Md.,
Calif.) (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Casting doubt on the viability of one of their
party's main goals this year, a group of moderate House Republicans
plans to reject calls for a sweeping income tax reduction and
instead is building support for a more modest package of tax cuts,
congressional aides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group of 11, led by Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticut, will
introduce a plan on Wednesday that will scale back the so-called
marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples; raise the amount
of income that retirees can earn without losing Social Security
benefits, and enact other changes that would cut taxes by $100
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is intended as an alternative to one being developed by
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget
Committee, that would cut income tax rates by 10 percent. If fully
enacted at once, such a cut would reduce revenues by around $375
billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The move is the first effort by Republican moderates to flex
their muscle this year in the House, where the party's majority
after last November's elections is down to such a narrow margin
that passing legislation seems likely to prove a constant
challenge. Republicans hold 222 seats to 211 for the Democrats. One
independent votes regularly with the Democrats and there is one
empty seat.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary math means that the defection of as few as
five Republicans can block passage of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in both the House and Senate have been trying
to rally the party around an income tax reduction as the
centerpiece of their post-impeachment agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Saying a big tax cut would be both good politics and good policy
as their party struggles to define what it stands for other than
condemning President Clinton, Republican leaders have been spoiling
for a partisan fight over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they want to return a big portion of federal
budget surpluses to taxpayers in coming years to energize the
economy and check the growth of the government. But Clinton has
argued that a big tax cut would imperil efforts to strengthen
Social Security and Medicare and deal with mounting pressure for
more spending on military and domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   But as the emerging move on taxes by their moderates makes
clear, Republicans also have to worry about holding together their
fractious ranks. Efforts to pass a tax bill last year foundered on
disputes between House and Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   At a retreat in Williamsburg, Va., last weekend, many House
Republicans expressed reservations about pressing ahead with the
across-the-board income tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   From the right, social conservatives have been suggesting that
Republicans should concentrate this year on substantially reducing
or eliminating the marriage penalty, the quirk in the tax code that
forces many two-income couples to pay more in taxes than they would
if single.
</P>
<P>
   Repealing the marriage tax, said Janet Parshall of the Family
Research Council, which is influential with many conservatives in
the House, ``should be the backbone of any tax bill passed in this
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican moderates said Clinton's success in portraying tax
cuts as the enemy of efforts to insure Social Security's future
makes it politically suicidal to press ahead with a sweeping plan
to slash income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the moderates are from districts where they are
vulnerable to challenges from Democrats, and they are eager to
avoid the label of a do-nothing partisan Congress unable to address
the concerns of the voters. So they are pushing for legislation
that has a reasonable chance of being enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering within the party is likely to intensify in
coming weeks as Kasich, a likely presidential candidate, decides
how to proceed in laying out a budget framework for next year. The
same process is under way in the Senate, where Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., who is chairman of the Budget Committee, is working on a
plan to cut income tax rates by as much as 15 percent, but to phase
in the reductions slowly over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see over the next five weeks a variety of opinions
expressed over what size tax cuts we should have, but all
Republicans agree we should have tax cuts,'' said a senior House
Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``The test
for Republicans is to bridge those differences and emerge with a
common decision we can unite around. To do it with a landslide
five-vote majority will not be easy.''
</P>

<P>
   House Republicans who have agreed to co-sponsor Ms. Johnson's
tax plan include Reps. Rick Lazio of New York; Fred Upton of
Michigan; Sherwood Boehlert of New York; James Greenwood of
Pennsylvania; Jim Leach of Iowa; Vernon Ehlers of Michigan; Frank
LoBiondo of New Jersey; Wayne Gilchrest of Maryland; Charles Bass
of New Hampshire, and Stephen Horn of California.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is close to the tax-cut bill passed last year by the
House. It calls for addressing the marriage penalty by increasing
the standard deduction for spouses filing jointly to twice the
deduction for individuals, or $8,500 currently, the deduction for
joint filers is $7,100. The effect would be to reduce taxable
income by $1,400 for couples filing jointly and claiming the
standard deduction, a change that would save $392 for a couple
paying a 28 percent marginal income tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also accelerate a planned increase in the
income ceiling above which Social Security recipients begin losing
benefits. The earnings limit is scheduled to increase to $30,000
from the current $15,500 in 2002; under Ms. Johnson's plan the
increase would take effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also speed up an expected increase in the portion
of health insurance premiums that self-employed people could deduct
on their taxes. It would also contain tax breaks for the costs of
long-term health care, exclude tax credits for families with
children and for college expenses from the effects of the
alternative minimum tax, and extend a number of expiring tax
credits.

HOLBROOKE SETTLES WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OVER LOBBYING INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department on Tuesday dropped an
eight-month investigation of Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's
choice to be the top American diplomat at the United Nations, after
the veteran diplomat agreed to pay $5,000 to settle civil charges
that he had violated federal lobbying laws.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the settlement, which did not include an
admission of wrongdoing by Holbrooke, would allow his long-delayed
nomination to be sent quickly to the Senate for confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee pledged close scrutiny over the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In settlement papers filed in federal District Court here, the
Justice Department said that Holbrooke violated ethics laws when,
within weeks of resigning from the State Department in 1996 to
become an investment banker, he asked the American Embassy in South
Korea to set up a meeting with the South Korean president.
</P>
<P>
   The department accused him of having violated the law by also
helping arrange the guest list for an embassy lunch with senior
Korean officials on a visit to South Korea in May 1996 and by
inviting the American ambassador to the opening of a local office
of Holbrooke's investment banking firm, Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has denied that his embassy contacts were improper
and, in a separate statement Tuesday, said, ``I settled this matter
in order to allow my nomination to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my contacts with the U.S. government'' since leaving
the State Department three years ago ``were in my role as an unpaid
official consultant to the secretary of state and were entirely
appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After resigning from the State Department, Holbrooke, a former
ambassador to Germany and the architect of the 1995 peace
settlement in Bosnia, remained a part-time American envoy to the
Balkans and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   In the court papers, prosecutors appeared to go out of their way
to suggest that the violations of the law were technical and
inadvertent. The ethics law in question bars former senior
government officials from lobbying former colleagues for at least a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said specifically that it was not
accusing the 57-year-old diplomat of a ``willful violation'' of the
law, nor was it accusing him or Credit Suisse of having received
``any direct financial gain'' as a result of his contacts with the
embassy in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement noted, in fact, that ``it may have been in the
United States' national interest to have Holbrooke discuss certain
foreign policy issues with certain high-level Korean officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was welcomed by the White House, which has been
hindered for most of the last year by the lack of a high-profile
diplomat to lead the American delegation through a series of
diplomatic crises at the United Nations, notably during the
showdown with Iraq over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The previous top American diplomat at the United Nations, Bill
Richardson, became energy secretary last year.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., who is a leading critic of the United Nations, said
again Tuesday that he would closely review the Justice Department
investigation to determine whether prosecutors had treated
Holbrooke too leniently.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigation began last summer, shortly
after Clinton announced that he intended to nominate Holbrooke,
when the State Department received an anonymous letter that accused
Holbrooke of a conflict of interest in his dealings with the
American Embassy in Hungary in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has acknowledged through lawyers that in March 1995,
while he was assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian
Affairs, he asked the Embassy in Budapest to promote Credit Suisse
as a competitor for a multimillion-dollar consulting contract with
the Hungarian government. Credit Suisse won the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Holbrooke say that at the time he had not considered
Credit Suisse as a potential employer, and the Justice Department
did not charge Holbrooke on Tuesday with any wrongdoing as a result
of those contacts.
</P>
<P>
   But a larger ethics investigation by the Justice Department
turned up evidence of his contacts in 1996 with the American
ambassador to South Korea, James T. Laney, and prosecutors found
those contacts to be improper.
</P>
<P>
   According to a chronology included in the court papers,
Holbrooke wrote to Laney on March 21, 1996, on Credit Suisse
stationery, and requested that the ambassador set up a ``courtesy
call'' for him with President Kim Young-sam on his planned visit to
South Korea in May 1996. The ambassador arranged a meeting,
although it was later canceled because of scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on March 22, Holbrooke accepted Laney's offer of an
embassy luncheon with ``prominent Koreans.'' He wrote again to the
ambassador on April 30 to suggest inviting the South Korean foreign
and finance ministers. The luncheon, paid for by the embassy, was
on May 10, and the guest list included two other Credit Suisse
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said in its papers Tuesday that
Holbrooke's letters to Laney were illegal because they constituted
requests for ``official action by the Department of State'' in
violation of the one-year lobbying ban.
</P>
<P>
   The department also accused Holbrooke of having violated the law
by inviting Laney to a ceremony for the opening of a Credit Suisse
branch in Seoul on May 9, 1996. Laney attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   In his court papers Tuesday, Holbrooke denied that he had
invited Laney. In an interview, Laney said that he could not
remember exactly who had invited him and that he had no reason to
doubt Holbrooke.

 How Small Firms Can Get Great Staff  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  How can a small business that cannot afford to pay
employees much money, or offer them major benefits, still attract
and retain great employees?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Fortunately, the saying, ``cash is king,''
apparently does not rule the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``What differentiates the best companies from the rest is
ultimately how they treat people,'' says Robert Levering, president
of the Great Place to Work Institute in San Francisco. ``You can
pay people well and treat them badly and it's still a bad place to
work; you can't bribe people into a good relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Small businesses like yours may not be able to pay top salaries
or offer stock options. But that does not mean you can't create an
attractive workplace, said Levering, whose consulting firm
researches Fortune Magazine's 100 Best Companies project.
</P>
<P>
   He offers these suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; _ Establish trust.  &LR; Communicate with employees and give them
frequent opportunities to ask questions and get straight answers.
As companies grow, they often forget to share information,
especially informally like over a brown bag lunch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Show appreciation.  &LR; Two words, ``thank you,'' are an
inexpensive way to let employees know they are valuable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Be creative; establish fun traditions.  &LR; One of Levering's
clients started out providing employees with free bagels on Fridays
and as the company grew and prospered, it expanded its offerings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Be flexible.  &LR; Small companies may have the edge tailoring job
hours and other working conditions for each employee. That's
because big companies often have difficulty breaking out of the
``everything-applies-to-everybody'' policy mold. Other benefits
might include unpaid time off.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance for a Big Hit
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have developed and want to produce an electronic punching
pad that mounts on a wall and measures the effectiveness of a punch
and your response time, but I am having trouble locating product
liability insurance. Where do I find a specialist in this field?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's probably a good idea to worry about insurance for your
newfangled punching bag before consumers get hold of it.
</P>
<P>
   One place to search for coverage is the Insurance Marketplace, a
catalog of insurance companies and their coverage specialties. Its
Web site is the National Financial Services Network
( &LR; www.nfsn.com &LR; ). When you get there, punch in commercial finance,
then click the state of California, then general liability under
the insurance category and you will get a list of potential
insurance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   You might also check out the Western Insurance Information
Service. This nonprofit consumer education association also helps
consumers and companies research insurance issues, says Stephanie
Saari of the service's East Bay office. Phone (925) 277-8799 or
visit  &LR; www.wiis.org &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schell, co-author of ``Small Business for Dummies,''
recommends that you check out three or four companies that offer
the type of insurance you need to compare costs and coverage. Also
contact manufacturers of other boxing or sporting gear to find out
what insurance companies or agents they recommend.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing a New Tool
</P>
<P>
   Q: I plan to manufacture and wholesale a new handheld tool for
the construction industry. I have done a lot of homework but could
use some advice on pricing.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three basic ways to price your product, says Rick
Crandall, a Tiburon author of several marketing books, including
``1001 Ways to Market Your Services: Even if You Hate to Sell.''
They are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Price it against your competitor's product.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark it up from your cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charge what the market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of scholarly discussions on the subject, but it
basically boils down to this: If you are producing a low-cost
product and there already are competitors, you will need to price
your product near theirs.
</P>
<P>
   If you produce a high-quality product that offers more value
than your rivals, you can charge a premium. And if you are the only
one in the field, you can charge whatever someone is willing to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Crandall notes that if a hardware store sells your product for
$1 retail, you are likely to receive only 50 cents for it. If sales
reps and others are in the distribution channel, maybe you only get
25 or 30 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely you don't want to price your product below your
cost, unless you are well-capitalized and are willing to lose money
to gain market share and the economies of scale needed to justify
your low price.
</P>
<P>
   A common rule of thumb, Crandall says, is to price your product
at seven times your cost of production. That includes not just cost
of materials but markups and overhead such as rent, insurance,
phones and everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, you will probably have to price your product
relative to the competition. If you can't afford to sell your
product through traditional distribution channels, you might
consider selling direct, by going online or at swap meets.
</P>
<P>
   If you are unsure how to price your product, start off charging
a higher price rather than a lower one. ``It's a lot easier to
discount than to raise prices,'' Crandall advises. ``You can always
say you have achieved economies of scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Small Business Development Centers and the Service Corps of
Retired Executives can provide advice on pricing problems. Chuck
Eason, director of the Napa Valley College Small Business
Development Center, recommends Small Business Administration
pamphlet 1.002 called Profit Costing and Pricing for Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggests two books _ ``Priced to Sell: The Complete
Guide to More Profitable Pricing'' by Herman Holtz (Upstart Pub
Co., $27.95) and ``The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to
Profitable Decision Making'' by Thomas Nagle and Reed Holden
(Prentice Hall, $54.25).

 Toymaker Files Chapter 11  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Struggling toymaker Yes Entertainment Corp., best known for the Yak
Bak, Power Penz and Teddy Ruxpin electronic toys, filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pleasanton firm, founded by onetime toy industry genius and
Teddy Ruxpin creator Donald Kingsborough, listed $18.6 million in
assets and $19.6 million in debts in its petition filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the reorganization plan, Infinity Investors Ltd. of
Texas, which already owns about 55 percent of Yes, has agreed to
extend a new $20 million line of credit that will help keep the
company afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operating in Chapter 11 will allow the company to implement
its strategic plan and reach our ultimate goal, to return the
company to profitability,'' Yes CEO Mark C. Shepherd said in a
press release. ``The financing gives Yes the necessary resources to
support and develop its product lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd, who was attending a major industry toy show in New
York, was unavailable for comment. Yes board member Stuart J.
Chasanoff declined to comment on the bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Yes Entertainment, which was delisted by Nasdaq in
December, fell 8 cents to close at 14 cents a share in
over-the-counter trading yesterday. Shares in Yes peaked in 1996 at
$16.88 but plummeted as the company was unable to reverse about $92
million in losses in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Final 1998 earnings have not been disclosed. In the third
quarter, the company reported revenue of $9.9 million, a 55 percent
decline compared to the third quarter of 1997, and Shepherd said he
was hoping for a break-even year in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Even the biggest toymakers like Mattel and Hasbro and retailers
like Toys R Us have struggled with declining sales and shifting toy
buying patterns, making it even tougher for smaller companies like
Yes Entertainment to survive, said analyst Brian Eisenbarth of
Collins &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller toy companies either have been acquired or continue to
struggle to get shelf space,'' said Eisenbarth. ``At the retail
level, it's usually a numbers game, and size usually wins.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of YES10 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Kingsborough, found spectacular but brief success with the Teddy
Ruxpin talking teddy bear in the 1980s, when he ran Fremont's
Worlds of Wonder. That company went bankrupt in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsborough took another shot at the toy business when he
founded Yes in 1993. Yes even brought back Teddy Ruxpin last year
in attempt to boost its other toy lines. Its Yak Bak and Power Penz
toys generated about $26 million in sales in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yes also makes Itsy Bitsy Families and Fistful of Aliens
miniature dolls, but sold off other key toy lines to Wham-O for
$9.8 million in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Yes agreed to pay $2.25 million to settle several
investors lawsuits. Kingsborough himself stepped down as CEO in
September and was replaced by Shepherd, although Kingsborough
remains on the board of directors.

<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ Sooner or later here, one is bound to hear
a dreaded word: Mukluk.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years ago, the mention of Mukluk electrified oilmen. It
was a site off the Alaskan coast thought to be the greatest new oil
field in years, comparable perhaps to the richest in the Middle
East. Then, $2 billion in test wells were dug, and Mukluk turned
out to be dry. It was among the most expensive such failures in
industry history and at the time crushed interest in exploring for
oil in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a single field again has captivated the industry.
Situated 40 miles offshore in the Caspian Sea, it is called
Kashagan. This spring, a foreign consortium plans to drill the
first test well. But already, insiders with access to a private,
$300 million seismic survey are suggesting that Kashagan is among
the world's largest pools of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake. If Kashagan proves to be big, the Caspian
would be confirmed as one of the world's great oil regions. In
addition, the sea would justify a $4 billion pipeline that the
White House _ seeking to support the independence of Central Asian
republics from Russia and Iran _ has urged oil companies to build
to the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is reason to be wary. ``Kashagan is an enormous
structure, but it could be empty,'' said Chris Innes, a manager of
the nine-company consortium exploring Kashagan. ``If it is empty,
then talk of pipelines becomes fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the Caspian became the
greatest hope in global oil. On the western side in Azerbaijan,
foreign oilmen went to work on existing fields. Here in Kazakhstan,
Chevron and Mobil became partners in the region's biggest proven
oil field _ Tengiz, with a minimum of six billion barrels of
recoverable oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the big new finds expected with the introduction of Western
technology have been elusive. And, as world oil prices have plunged
to their lowest levels in a quarter-century, a crisis of confidence
has descended on much of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, Kashagan has cheered oilmen, geologists
and local leaders. The reason is geology.
</P>
<P>
   A reservoir covered by a 2,600-foot-thick salt dome, Kashagan is
situated in the same geological basin as Tengiz and is about the
same age, 300 million years old. And Kashagan, at about 2,000
square miles, is nearly three times the size of Tengiz, one of the
world's 10 largest oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   All along, though, geologists have warned that the details can
all appear favorable but amount to nothing once drilling is
completed. Yet interest has remained intense.
</P>
<P>
   One sign came in September when, amid the industry slump,
Phillips Petroleum and Inpex of Japan paid $500 million for a
combined one-seventh interest in the Kashagan consortium. The other
consortium members are Agip of Italy, British Gas International,
British Petroleum, Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, Statoil of Norway and
Total of France.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kazakhstan's biggest potential offshore project, a
successful well at Kashagan, with flow rates even close to what
have been anticipated, will mean as much for the future development
of this country and region as the 1968 discovery of oil at Prudhoe
Bay meant for Alaska,'' said Bruce Kososki, managing director of
Golden Eagle Partners, an oil consulting company here.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium plans to drill its first well when the ice in the
northern Caspian _ temperatures there range from 50 below zero in
winter to 120 degrees above in summer _ begins to break up, some
time in April or May.
</P>
<P>
   It has selected a spot near Kashagan's eastern edge where,
according to the seismic study, an oil strike looks most likely. To
get to it, workers must drill down roughly 2.3 miles, which will
take about five months.
</P>
<P>
   A second test well _ near Kashagan's western edge, deemed the
second most likely to be productive _ will follow. ``Then we'll
know if it's a commercial find,'' said Nicholas Wood, a consortium
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is especially awaited by the Clinton administration,
whose stalled Caspian Sea initiative seeks to establish a new
political balance in a region long dominated by Moscow, one where
the United States has had little influence.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the initiative is the proposed 1,087-mile
pipeline from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to a Turkish port,
Ceyhan, on the Mediterranean. The system would also serve
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, which would be linked to Baku through
undersea pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   To make the project profitable for the oil companies that
finance it, the administration must obtain guarantees that at least
a million barrels of oil a day would be shipped through the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has found a little more than half that, ``but if
Kashagan is as big as some people think, it could support three
pipelines,'' said a senior Western oil executive, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   All this has put great pressure on consortium members. At least
for now, they in a way have been delegated responsibility for
validating a region's strategic merit, in addition to an American
policy initiative.

 USA/Lycos Bets on E-Shopping  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
USA/Lycos Interactive Networks, the newest Internet dynamo, is
betting its future on hawking books, clothes and tickets straight
to consumers, but its rivals and investors have some doubts about
that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television giant USA Networks said yesterday it agreed to
buy Lycos Inc. in a complex stock deal that creates a TV-Internet
company valued at more than $20 billion. USA/Lycos Interactive
Networks stitches together Lycos, one of the largest Internet
search directories, with USA Networks' home shopping, ticketing and
online businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe consumers look at the Web as a utility rather than
as entertainment,'' said Jan Horsfall, Lycos senior vice president
of marketing. ``The Internet's winners over the next year (will be)
those companies who position the Net as a useful appliance to buy
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   USA/Lycos intends to do that by taking a slightly different
approach from archrivals Yahoo, Excite and Infoseek. The cable TV
/Internet media giant will focus exclusively on selling goods
directly to consumers _ not offering a combination of ads and
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The new media company could offer enormous potential for
cross-promotion between the Internet and television, according to
industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks' cable TV programming already is available in 70
million homes. Its Home Shopping Network handles more than 1
million telephone transactions and ships more than 200,000 items
daily. Ticketmaster sells 70 million tickets a year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Lycos reaches about 30 million people _ nearly half of all
domestic online users _ through a network of Web sites. The company
owns and operates four of the top 20 sites, including Lycos, one of
the largest ``portals,'' or Internet gateways, for Web searches,
news, free e-mail and online shopping. The others include WhoWhere,
a developer of personal Web pages; Wired Digital; and Tripod, a
provider of digital communities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``This (merger) places all the necessary ingredients for
electronic information and commerce ... into one centrally and
aggressively managed enterprise,'' USA Networks Chairman Barry
Diller said in a statement. ``There is no excuse now for us not to
be a dominant player as the world continues its transition toward
interactive systems.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Wall Street appeared to have reservations. While USA
Networks' stock rose $3.69 to $41.63 yesterday, Lycos shares
tumbled $33 to $94.25. The steep slide was triggered by concerns
that Lycos did not swing a deal with a bigger media partner and
that Diller got the better of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street made it clear what it thought of the deal,'' said
Ron Rappaport, analyst at Zona Research in Redwood City. ``This
industry is not shy about passing judgment on brand-name cache, and
USA Networks is not considered an Internet force. Instead, it
conjures up images of cartoons on Saturday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at rival Internet companies, meanwhile, downplayed
the deal, suggesting that Lycos and USA Networks had run out of
potential partners and were left with each other.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of LYCOS10 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; The Internet has ``shifted from a portal war to a brand-name
war,'' said Barak Berkowitz, Infoseek senior vice president of
marketing. ``We're happy with our partnership with Disney. It's a
premiere media brand name. People know and trust it. Lycos is
validating what we have already done.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo President Jeff Mallett said that by ``placing all of its
eggs into the e-commerce basket,'' Lycos runs the risk of cutting
itself off from other potential revenue such as advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitors characterized the Lycos-USA Networks deal as
too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done a good job of being a chameleon, and today they
adopted a new skin,'' Excite CEO George Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me get this straight: A couple of weeks ago, Lycos
executives said they were very, very committed to remaining
independent,'' Bell said. ``Yet at the same time, there were
reports they were talking to NBC and Time-Warner. And then they
strike a deal with USA Networks. They appear to be constantly
changing positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The USA/Lycos deal ends weeks of speculation about whether Lycos
was seeking a merger with a major media company, and caps off three
months of wheeling and dealing by the leading Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   In November, AOL announced a $4.2 billion takeover of Netscape
Communications, kicking off a consolidation race to secure the
largest audience of users. A few weeks later, AtHome Network said
it would acquire Excite for $6.7 million, and Yahoo announced that
it intended to merge with GeoCities for $4.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos had been in discussions with NBC this weekend, sources
said, and reportedly talked earlier with Time Warner and German
media giant Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover rumors fueled a steep run-up in Lycos stock during
the past month, to $145 from $58 early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Horsfall said the complex deal will have ``virtually no impact''
on Lycos' two Bay Area properties: the 165-person Wired Digital in
San Francisco and WhoWhere, which employs 100 people in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty damn good at running a far-flung number of
companies,'' Horsfall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, (the deal) creates a larger audience for Wired
Digital and gives us greater opportunities to be seriously marketed
on TV,'' said Wired Digital President Beth Vanderslice. She added
that the online news operation is in the process of
across-the-board job hires.
</P>
<P>
   Wired Digital, the last vestige of digital media empire Wired
Ventures, agreed to be sold to Lycos for $83 million in stock in
October. That deal is set to close in early March.

SICKOUT BY AMERICAN AIRLINES PILOTS LEADS TO CANCELLATION OF 730
FLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:20 p.m. ET) 
(fe) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 
 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's second-largest airline was forced to cancel nearly
one-third of its flights on Tuesday, inconveniencing tens of
thousand of passengers around the country, as a result of an
unusual wildcat strike by its pilots that now threatens to disrupt
the heavy travel expected during the upcoming Presidents Day
holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines said it had grounded 730 flights, 32 percent
of its 2,250 flights daily, after more than 2,000 of its 9,200
pilots called in sick on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The airline estimated that the cancellations affected about
73,000 passengers, many of whom waited for hours before getting on
other flights or being stranded for the night. American carries
about 225,000 people on a normal day.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Allied Pilots Association, the independent union
that represents American's pilots, began calling in sick on
Saturday, after negotiations broke down over how American would
integrate a small airline it acquired in December into its network.
American canceled 90 flights on Saturday. The cancellations
increased to 500 flights on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the union resumed negotiations on Tuesday, but
they did not bring a swift end to the disruption. After talking for
hours, the two sides adjourned and agreed to meet again on
Wednesday. In a statement, American called the talks helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive note is that both parties are talking again,''
Chris Chiames, a spokesman for American, said on Tuesday. ``With
regard to how that is going to affect tomorrow's operations, we
simply cannot forecast that.'' The union did not immediately return
a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes are relatively rare at airlines because the 1934 Railway
Labor Act, which governs labor relations in the industry, severely
restricts when unions are allowed to walk out. Slowdowns and
sickouts have occasionally occurred at American and other carriers,
however. For example, during the Christmas season, flight
attendants at Trans World Airlines forced the cancellation of some
flights after many called in sick. But no airline in recent memory
has been crippled as severely as American is now.
</P>
<P>
   Brian D. Harris, an industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
New York, estimated that the disruption had cost American $19
million so far and the figure was rising quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Carty, chief executive of AMR Corp., American's parent
company, said on Monday that the pilots' actions were clearly
illegal and that the company would seek a court order forcing them
back to work if the talks failed.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear whether a court order would have much
impact. The leaders of the pilots union say that the actions of the
pilots are spontaneous. While they have avoided endorsing the job
action, they have reminded their members that federal regulations
allow pilots to take themselves out of the cockpit if they do not
feel fit to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``American can prove actuarially that the pilots are staging a
sickout,'' Harris said. ``But it is a lot harder to prove that any
particular pilot is.''

MARKET PLACE: GABELLI SET TO GO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mario Gabelli plans to take his mutual fund company
public this week after agreeing to cut his annual pay and to give
his public shareholders first crack at his best investment ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Both conditions allowed him to line up underwriters for the
initial public offering, which is being viewed as an indicator of
investor appetite for asset management companies. Money management
firms have rebounded only modestly from last summer's selloff,
causing several private ones, including Neuberger &AMP; Berman Inc. and
Offitbank, to delay plans for public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli, known for astute stock picks, hopes to sell 20 percent,
or six million shares, of Gabelli Asset Management Inc., which is
based in Rye, and has $16.3 billion under management. That would
leave him with a controlling stake worth more than $250 million in
the company, which he founded in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   After a disagreement with potential underwriters last year,
Gabelli agreed to cut in half, to 10 percent, his annual take of
the firm's aggregate pretax profits _ which would have amounted to
more than $4 million in the first nine months of 1998. But he will
continue to earn other fees, which have topped $20 million in
recent years, and will get a $50 million payout in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli and other executives will also be free to sell their
remaining shares after three years.
</P>
<P>
   In securities filings, the firm says going public will help it
expand its products, recruit top money managers and perhaps lead to
acquisitions. Moreover, the firm plans to increase its presence in
mutual fund supermarkets and 401(k) plans as well as prepare to
offer mutual fund shares over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But some concerns remain whether investors will embrace a
company with a franchise so closely linked to one person and
whether the firm can expand distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue with the Gabelli organization is its very
ragged and uneven distribution strategy,'' said John Rekenthaler,
director of research at Morningstar Inc., the fund trackers in
Chicago. The firm has the potential for strong growth, he said, but
it has a history of ``wacky promotional schemes'' and a hodgepodge
of funds with and without sales charges. ``They've been run like a
cottage industry, a little bit unprofessionally even, at times,''
Rekenthaler said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most money management firms, Gabelli's company has
thrived, in part, because of its namesake, whose appearances on
television programs and in financial publications has made him one
of the most recognizable fund managers. ``The company is Mario,''
said Geoff Bobroff, a fund industry consultant in East Greenwich,
R.I.
</P>
<P>
   To help insure that his public company would get the benefit of
his best ideas, Gabelli reversed himself on a key issue. When he
disclosed plans for a stock offering last April, the proposal
stated that he would have ``no obligation to resolve conflicts in
favor of the company or to refrain from competing with the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gabelli will generally give the company a first right of
refusal on investment opportunities. The change was eased, a
spokesman said, by a decision to exclude certain assets, like some
hedge funds, from the new public company.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the deal comes off at the $16 to $19 a share expected
by the underwriters, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and the Salomon Smith
Barney unit of Citigroup, the stock (symbol GBL) will trade at a
discount to that of some other fund companies. Based on earnings
projections by the underwriters, Gabelli stock would be priced at
13 to 16 times its expected earnings for 1999.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price Associates trades at 21 times 1999 earnings, and
Franklin Resources Inc. at 18. Gabelli's valuation would be more in
line with the 15 at Federated Investors Inc. and the 14 at Waddell
&AMP; Reed Financial, both of whose shares have underperformed since
going public last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rekenthaler of Morningstar said the Gabelli funds had been good
performers recently, paced by their concentrations in media and
telecommunications stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The largest, Gabelli Growth, managed by Howard Ward, posted a
30.3 percent annualized return for the three years ended Dec. 31,
and received a five-star rating from Morningstar. The other
top-rated fund, Gabelli Global Interactive Couch Potato, managed by
Gabelli, posted a 27.2 percent annualized return over three years.
</P>
<P>
   A big determinant of the Gabelli firm's profits will be how much
Gabelli puts in his own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he earned portfolio management and account
executive fees of $23 million and $21.3 million for 1997 and 1996,
respectively. A spokesman for Gabelli said the structure was ``not
going to change'' and that the compensation structure was the
``same as for everybody else'' who managed money in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli has cut his incentive payment to 10 percent of pretax
income, from 20 percent last year. He will also receive a $50
million payout in January 2002, with $3 million in annual interest
payments on that deferred sum.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's total expenses related to Gabelli's compensation
would have topped $30 million out of total revenue of $105.3
million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Killian, who specializes in new issues at Renaissance
Capital in Greenwich, Conn., is enthusiastic about the offering,
even with Gabelli's hefty pay. ``There's something to be said for
the fact that you do want someone of his caliber to be highly
compensated,'' she said, ``because it serves as a great incentive
to produce good results.''

AIR FORCE WILL ADVERTISE ON TV TO STEM LAG IN RECRUITING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with an unusual drop-off in new recruits, the
Air Force plans for the first time to join the other armed services
and pay for national television advertisements to try to convince
young men and women to sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Air Force has not had to rely on paid
advertisements as part of its recruiting campaigns, since it was
able to attract a steady stream of new recruits simply with the
promise of technical training and experience in the field of
aviation.
</P>
<P>
   But the Air Force has now been hit by the same crisis in
recruiting that has hampered the other services in recent months.
Between October and January, the force fell 6.5 percent, or 696
enlistees, short of its goal of 10,901. If the trend is not
reversed, officials said Tuesday, the Air Force could miss its
annual recruiting goal for the first time since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   That the Air Force would fall short of new recruits underscores
the depth of the problems facing the military as a whole at a time
when a booming economy has created plenty of jobs and young people
are less willing to join the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. Peter Sutton, the commander of the Air Force's
recruiting division at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas, said in a
telephone interview Tuesday that the force needed to raise its
profile with young people. He attributed a waning interest in
service to the growing number of young people who go straight into
college after high school and the dwindling number of veterans, the
fathers and other role models who often inspire young people to
choose a stint in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just less visible to young people today than we were in
the past,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force plans to spend $17 million immediately to buy
national advertising time, beginning Feb. 27 and continuing through
CBS's coverage of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's
basketball tournament. It then plans to spend $37 million to begin
a new network advertising campaign in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The television advertisements will sharply increase the force's
overall advertising budget this year to $76 million, from just $22
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has produced television advertisements that
stations around the country broadcast as public-service
announcements, as well as local and national print advertisements.
But officials said the public-service television advertisements ran
haphazardly and did not necessarily target young men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign is mostly intended to increase the
enlisted ranks, but a secondary effect, the officials said, was to
enhance the Air Force's image. Sutton noted that in recent years
the public recognition of the Air Force's slogan _ ``Aim High'' _
had fallen off.
</P>
<P>
   All of the services have faced difficulties with recruiting and
retention. The Army's recruiting problem appears even more dire.
Between October and January, the Army fell 2,479 enlistees, or 13
percent, short of its recruiting goal of 19,020, despite a flurry
of advertisements and enlistment bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, on the other hand, exceeded its recruiting goal during
the same period after falling short last year for the first time
since the draft ended. The Marine Corps, too, met its recruiting
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon hopes that an across-the-board pay raise, as well
as targeted increases for mid-career officers and noncommissioned
officers and improvements in pension benefits, will convince more
people to join the military and reverse the flood of those getting
out.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed a 4.4 percent increase, with
targeted raises of up to 9.9 percent. Republicans in Congress have
proposed even more, with raises of 4.8 percent across the board and
10.3 percent in the targeted ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the advertisements, the Air Force intends to hire
270 more recruiters, increasing the total to about 1,200. Last
fall, the force, following the Army and the Navy, began offering
new enlistment bonuses, ranging from $1,000 to $9,000, depending on
the speciality and length of commitment.

 &HT;    Browns get young players, save money for veterans

<TEXT>
<P>
   A franchise whose storied NFL history included Hall of Fame
running backs Jim Brown, Leroy Kelly and Marion Motley might line
up for the future with a backfield comprised of ``Pooh Bear''
Williams and Ronald Moore.
</P>
<P>
   That terribly underwhelming status report characterized not only
the minimal impact of Tuesday's special expansion draft for the
resurrected Cleveland Browns but also the philosophy with which
team officials approached a lottery that produced 37 veterans for a
club that has been dormant three years.

   ``We wanted players with a clear upside,'' director of football
operations Dwight Clark said Tuesday evening. ``We're interested in
players who will blossom in two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid by Clark was that the Browns, who used only $15.03
million of their $57.288 million in salary-cap room for the group,
also sought players who came cheap. With Clark and fellow San
Francisco alum Carmen Policy calling the shots, Cleveland figures
to be active when the veteran free-agent signing period begins on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're sitting there with a lot of dry gun powder,'' agent
Jack Bechta said. ``No one is going to be able to outbid them for a
free agent they really want.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Browns already have quietly begun to substantially
upgrade over the cache of players acquired on Friday. Barring any
last-minute snags, Cleveland will swing its first trade later this
week, acquiring tight end Irv Smith and defensive end Roy Barker
from the 49ers, the Journal-Constitution learned late Tuesday. The
deal will be part of a fire sale by the Niners, who are $25 million
over the '99 spending limit.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland began the draft by selecting Detroit center Jim Pyne
and finished it with the popular choice of San Francisco cornerback
Antonio Langham, the former Alabama star who played the first two
seasons of his five-year career with Cleveland. The five-year
veterans were the lone players selected with cap designations over
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In between Pyne and Langham came the checkered assemblage of
little-known veterans who comprised the bulk of the 150-player
pool. A breakdown of the players taken:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average chronological age of the 37 players is 25.5 years
and the group averages just 2.7 seasons of NFL tenure. The Browns
took only one player, 49ers special-teams ace James Williams, who
is 30 years old. They grabbed just three veterans with more than
five years of experience in the league. Twenty-two players have
either one or two seasons of experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only four players have '99 salary cap designations of more
than $500,000. It is all but certain than Langham, whose choice
drew the largest response from a crowd of 4,000 at the Canton Civic
Center, will restructure his deal to reduce his cap number. Clark
and agent Pat Dye Jr., who represents Langham, have an excellent
working relationship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Leaning heavily on the relative strengths of the expansion
pool, the Browns selected nine offensive linemen and 10 defensive
backs. Four of the first choices were on the offensive line. The
team also took four wide receivers, one quarterback, four running
backs, four defensive linemen and five linebackers.

PILOT'S LEADER IS QUESTIONED ON COLLISION WITH SKI LIFT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. _ Capt. Richard Ashby, charged with 20 counts
of negligent homicide, received mixed reviews in his court-martial
Tuesday from the lieutenant colonel who was his squadron leader
when the marine jet Ashby was piloting severed the cables of a ski
lift in the Italian Alps.
</P>
<P>
   On the trial's second day, Lt. Col. Richard Muegge testified
that the pilot should not have brought a video camera along on the
flight, the first low-level mission the squadron had flown in
nearly six months of its tour at Aviano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't seem like a real smart thing to do when you
hadn't flown low level in a while,'' said Muegge, who was relieved
of command after the Feb. 3, 1998, accident in which 20 people
died. ``I sent them out there to do training, to do a very valuable
thing for us, to regain proficiency, not to go out and sightsee.''
</P>
<P>
   The squadron of electronic warfare jets, EA-6B Prowlers, was
deployed at Aviano to jam or disable radars or surface-to-air
missile systems in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the squadron said Ashby had ``the best hands'' of the
six pilots, Muegge said, but he said that Ashby, who was then 30
years old, was not as mature as some other pilots. Asked where
Ashby ranked among the four pilots who were captains, Muegge said
he was third, but he implied no criticism.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning by prosecutors and cross-examination by Ashby's
lawyers, Muegge laid out many of the weaknesses of his squadron,
among them, the use of American maps that failed to show the ski
lift's gondola system, and the failure to check Italian maps on
which the 31-year-old system was marked. The ski lift cables were
360 feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``common knowledge,'' Muegge said, that the area had
50-foot chair lifts, too low to worry about, he said, because they
were no taller than the trees. But a cable system that was about
360 feet above the ground, ``that was to me something that I'd seen
in movies or in Switzerland,'' Muegge said. ``It never crossed my
mind that something like a cable car or gondola-type thing existed
in Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   Muegge said it was the first time Ashby had flown the route.
</P>
<P>
   The squadron did not have a reliable procedure for disseminating
essential information like altitude and speed limits, Muegge said.
Almost everyone in the squadron believed their lower limit was
1,000 feet above the ground, when in fact it was 2,000 feet, and
airspeed was supposed to be no more than 450 knots, but the plane
flew at up to 555 knots, nearly 640 mph. Muegge also said he had
never asked the U.S. Air Force wing at Aviano for its briefing on
low-level flights because he did not know it existed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a report that Ashby's plane had performed a
360-degree roll, Muegge said he found the roll ``a very
disorienting maneuver.'' But under questioning by Frank Spinner,
who is Ashby's civilian lawyer, Muegge acknowledged that when
crossing a ridge line, it was common to turn the jet on its side to
keep from gaining altitude, and that sometimes it was easy to
return to upright by flipping the rest of the way around. He said
that at one point Ashby had dropped his right wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how it would be safe, or a reason to go 145
degrees angle bank, sitting there like this,'' he said, holding his
angled hand in front of him, ``looking at the ground, for no
tactical reason that I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the court examined an EA-6B at the Cherry Point
marine base. They sat in the pilot's seat, while an officer pointed
out the radar, altimeter, airspeed indicator and other equipment.
Then they went to the range, on Piney Island, where an EA-6B, and
then an F-18, flew over at 1,000 feet, to simulate what witnesses
could have seen just before the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby could face a sentence of 200 years if convicted.

SUSPECT IN FATAL FRATERNITY SLAYING IN TEXAS FOUND DEAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   A man suspected in the fatal bludgeoning of a San Marcos, Texas,
college student was found dead late Tuesday in northeast Texas,
where he apparently committed suicide, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Little more information was available about the death of
Jeremiah Marshal Wilkerson, 21, who police said was discovered in
Van Zandt County, east of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He had been wanted as a suspect in the weekend beating of
Nicholas George Armstrong, 21, a Southwest Texas State University
student who was attacked while sleeping on a sofa in a fraternity
house.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, a junior from Baytown who was majoring in
communications, never regained consciousness and died Monday in an
Austin hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that this terrible tragedy has profoundly touched
the lives of two families and at least two communities,'' San
Marcos Police Chief Steve Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith said the investigation of Armstrong's death will
continue. He said a second suspect, whom he wouldn't identify, was
expected to come to police headquarters with his lawyer Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A dispatcher at the Van Zandt County sheriff's office confirmed
Wilkerson's death Tuesday night but declined to provide details.
She said the death was being treated as a suicide but was still
being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, San Marcos police had named Wilkerson, a former
SWT student who was believed to have a job in Austin, as a suspect
in Armstrong's death.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were seeking an arrest warrant for him and
issued a description of the van he was believed to be driving. They
also said he may have been visiting friends in Terrell, near
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Griffith announced Wilkerson's death.
</P>
<P>
   He said San Marcos police were notified of the death about 6
p.m. by Wilkerson's parents, before an arrest warrant was issued,
and it was confirmed by Van Zandt authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was beaten after four men tried to ``crash'' a party
at the end of the university's ``rush week,'' when fraternities and
sororities recruit new members. Police said Tuesday they had
questioned one of four people they wanted to talk to and knew the
identities of the other three.
</P>
<P>
   None of them is believed to be a current student at the college,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Tuesday, friends and family members gathered around
George and Becky Armstrong to offer support as the couple prepared
to bury their son and tried to absorb the shock of his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know he always loved people,'' said the mother, 48. ``I
can't understand how something like this could happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, also 48, expressed the wish that any
memorial services for their son be in celebration of someone who
``lived each day to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, a 1996 graduate of Baytown's Ross S. Sterling High
School, was at a party at the Tau Kappa Epsilon house Saturday
night when a fight erupted after the four men tried to crash the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police that Armstrong was not involved in the
fight, which was broken up by police. He went to sleep on a sofa
afterward, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   He was found unconscious and badly beaten on the head at 3:15
a.m. Sunday. Police were called back to the house and a witness
told officers he had seen two of the earlier intruders in the
building about 15 minutes before Armstrong was found.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokeswoman Melissa Millecam would not say why Wilkerson
had been singled out for an arrest warrant or whether police had
established why Armstrong was attacked. Investigators would not
specify the weapon that they believe was used.
</P>
<P>
   The beating followed a round of parties by 12 fraternities
celebrating the end of the weeklong ``rush'' period. The activities
were supposed to be alcohol-free, but the university suspended the
fraternities after some were accused of permitting under-age
drinking Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Dean of Students John Garrison said no
alcohol-related problems had been reported at Tau Kappa Epsilon.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who had transferred to Southwest Texas a year ago
from Lee College in Baytown, worked part time as a cook at a San
Marcos restaurant to help pay for his education. He was a member of
Grace United Methodist Church in Baytown and had served as a
children's counselor last summer at Mo-Ranch Presbyterian Youth
Camp.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent three years with a church youth corps working with
the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, a kindergarten teacher, and father, an Exxon
supervisor, rushed to the hospital to be with their son until he
died Monday without regaining consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   They have two other children: Josh, 15, a sophomore at Sterling
High, and Hillary Scruggs, 24, who recently married and lives in
Baytown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad. Kids think we're silly to worry, but now we've
experienced everyone's worst nightmare,'' Armstrong's mother said
tearfully. ``I couldn't live through this without Jesus. But my son
was a Christian. He loved Jesus, so I know where he is. He will
always be forever young and special to us. We won't have to watch
him grow old and sick.``
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Armstrong's death, his parents donated his organs
so that ``something positive could come from all this,'' said
longtime family friend Cindy Hightower, 48.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all known each other so long, it's like we've lost one
of our own children,'' Hightower said. ``His mother is holding up
well. She showed me what God's grace is really all about.``
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Royce Robb, pastor at Grace United Methodist, said the
Armstrongs are among the church's ``central families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our church is sick about what's happened and in a state of
bereavement,'' he said. ``We're all hurting so much that I'm not
sure if we'll be much comfort to the Armstrongs. Nicholas was a
fine young man who loved God.``
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas had sung and toured with the church's youth choir and
worked five summers in the United Methodist Army helping the needy.
He loved to play the guitar and cook, especially outdoors, friends
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dozens of his college friends talked about how they would
gather together and eat chicken that he grilled while he played the
guitar and harmonized with friends,'' said Hightower.
</P>
<P>
   He dreamed of one day hosting a television cooking show, friends
said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also had proposed hosting a swing music radio show for
the campus radio station. His idea was accepted, and the show was
to have made its debut Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The funeral is scheduled for 4 p.m. Thursday at Grace United
Methodist Church in Baytown, said a spokesperson for Navarre
Funeral Service. Baytown, a petrochemical city of nearly 70,000
people, is about 15 miles east of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Students held a candlelight prayer vigil on the Southwest Texas
campus at midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of anger and frustration being felt.
Students don't think something like this should happen here,'' said
Garrison, the dean of students. ``We've never had a death in
conjunction with a fraternity event and, in fact, never had a
student murdered on campus.``
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's mother said he had not shown much interest in
joining the fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I understand he had been given an invitation to join,''
she said. ``He probably felt honored and excited. He may have
accepted. I guess that's something we'll never really know.''

AGENCY SEEKS TO MONITOR IRAQ FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The International Atomic Energy Agency has
submitted plans for long-term monitoring of Iraq that call for
``intrusive'' inspections and assume that Baghdad might try again
to produce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the Security Council on Monday, the agency
director, Mohammed el-Baradei, said the monitoring would cost at
least $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes once again that Iraq is denying the agency
documents and material it has requested, including, for instance,
documentary evidence that Iraq has abandoned its nuclear weapons
program. And the agency said it could not verify that Iraq had not
hidden away banned nuclear equipment or materials.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has therefore concluded that any long-term monitoring
must be ``comprehensive, rigorous, and, as a result, intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the agency says it would use such measures as
``unannounced inspections of previously uninspected locations.'' It
would examine ``records, equipment, materials and products,'' as
well as conduct interviews, environmental monitoring and radiation
surveys, and test samples of water, vegetation, air and soil.
</P>
<P>
   Most problematic from Iraq's standpoint, the agency said it
would need to conduct ``unannounced inspections at new sites'' to
detect signs of banned activities. Such inspections infuriated Iraq
when they were conducted by the U.N. Special Commission charged
with disarming Iraq of unconventional weapons. While the Special
Commission inspects for biological and chemical weapons, the
International Atomic Energy Agency monitors nuclear activities.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official said Tuesday that he hoped such an intrusive
monitoring system would deter Iraq from reviving its
unconventional-weapons programs, but added that there was no
indication that Iraq would ever agree to such an inspection system.

</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, the nation's second-largest carrier, was
forced to cancel nearly one-third of its flights, inconveniencing
tens of thousand of passengers nationwide as a result of an unusual
wildcat strike by its pilots that now threatens to disrupt the
heavy travel expected during the coming Presidents' Day weekend.
The company and the union representing the pilots, which are at
odds over how American integrates Reno Air, which it acquired in
December, resumed negotiations but did not reach an agreement. The

<P>
   ``You have reached the most dynamic pro-white organization on
planet Earth,'' says the greeting on his answering machine, before
launching into a 10-minute racist and anti-Semitic diatribe
condemning the idea of ``the equality of the races'' as ``patently
absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   In large part to foster and spread these opinions, Hale, 27,
from East Peoria, wants to be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be an advocate for white people in the court room,''
said Hale, who heads a white-supremacist organization called the
World Church of the Creator. ``I can't name one attorney, for
example, who is an open racist, and that's what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But because he makes no bones about his views and goals, Hale,
who has completed law school and passed the state bar, has been
denied a license to practice law in Illinois by a state panel that
evaluates the character and fitness of prospective lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, according to a decision that was supported by two of the
panel's three members, is ``free, as the First Amendment allows, to
incite as much racial hatred as he desires and to attempt to carry
out his life's mission of depriving those he dislikes of their
legal rights. But in our view he cannot do this as an officer of
the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision has generated controversy in First Amendment
circles and among legal experts who say they fear it could set a
dangerous precedent, denying rights based on a person's abhorrent
views. Leaders of the Anti-Defamation League say they worry such a
decision, allowed to stand, could lead to a ``slippery slope'' that
could penalize people with unpopular opinions on issues like
abortion or school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, who is challenging the panel's decision before a
higher-level state committee, is also trying to enlist the help of
Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor. Dershowitz said Tuesday
he was considering taking on the case.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have reviewed other cases in which applicants for the
bar have been rejected because of unpopular beliefs or because they
refused to swear allegiance to a particular political value system.
</P>
<P>
   In cases involving communists in the 1950s, the courts ruled
that membership in an unpopular movement, without proof that the
person's conduct was dangerous, was not enough to exclude a person
from the bar, said Geoffrey. Hazard, a professor at the University
of Pennsylvania Law School. In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned the rejection of two prospective lawyers who had refused
to reveal their political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say they know of no similar case involving someone
who actively spread racist propaganda or in which someone clearly
intended to use the law to support those views.
</P>
<P>
   The state panel's decision did not merely claim that Hale's
views were reprehensible, but said his ``active advocacy'' of his
goals was blatantly immoral and rendered him unfit to be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under any civilized standards of decency, the incitement of
racial hatred for the ultimate purpose of depriving selected groups
of their legal rights shows a gross deficiency in moral character,
particularly for lawyers who have a special responsibility to
uphold the rule of law for all persons,'' the decision said. It
added, ``If the civilized world had no experience with Hitler,
Matthew Hale might be dismissed as a harmless `crackpot.' However,
history teaches a different lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   But the opinion also seemed to indicate that the panel was
wading into delicate territory.
</P>
<P>
   It said that in an interview with one of the judges on the
panel, Hale had said that he could uphold the state and federal
constitutions even though he disagreed with their guarantees
against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   And when asked if he could obey a rule prohibiting
discriminatory treatment of ``litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers
and others, based on race, sex, religion or national origin,'' Hale
said he would follow such rules and laws until such time as he
could have them changed by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
   The third member of the state panel supported Hale's
application, saying there was no evidence that Hale could not
``hold racist views and practice law in accordance with his oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale, who said he developed his white-supremacist views at age
12, was active in racist groups in college, where he majored in
political science and played the violin. He ran unsuccessfully in
1995 for the East Peoria City Council and then, convinced that the
supremacist movement needed legal representation, went to law
school at Southern Illinois University. Last fall, he worked for
two months as a law clerk for a firm in Champaign, but was
dismissed when he failed to get his law license.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of the World Church of the Creator since 1996,
Hale, who calls himself reverend, has an office in his parents'
home where an Israeli flag serves as a doormat and swastika
stickers paper the walls. He writes letters to the editor saying
that all non-whites should be deported. He also and runs the
group's Web site, which demonizes Jews and ``other mud races'' and
says that Hitler had the right idea, except that he should have
promoted the supremacy of all whites, not just Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Hale has been convicted on minor charges in connection with
activities like burning an Israeli flag, but there is no evidence
he has committed or encouraged acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, four members of the World Church of the Creator were
indicted on hate-crime charges in the holdup of a Miami video
store, accused of acting on the group's belief that all media
outlets are controlled by Jews. Another member is serving a life
sentence for killing a black sailor returning from the Persian Gulf
War near Jacksonville, Fla., in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz, who is Jewish and said that if he took the case he
would choose a black lawyer as co-counsel, added that before he
took up Hale's cause, he would want to make sure Hale bears no
responsibility for encouraging or tacitly supporting such violence.
Dershowitz said he would contribute all his fees from the case to
anti-racist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Hale has said he advocates peaceful means and has no control of
the actions of some members of group, which was formed in 1973 and
claims 7,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said they thought Hale's rejection probably
violated the First Amendment unless there was proof that his
actions deprived people of constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want him to be a member of the bar,'' said David
Baugh, a black lawyer in Richmond, Va., who represented a Ku Klux
Klan member charged with burning a cross. ``But I would defend him
and if anyone is being denied access to the profession because of
their beliefs, that's wrong.''

NATION'S 4TH-QUARTER PRODUCTIVITY ROSE 3.9 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's productivity, the amount that a worker produces in
an hour on the job, rose in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of
3.7 percent, giving the United States three years of robust
improvement in labor efficiency, and suggesting that corporate
America might indeed have become slightly more efficient after
years of trying unsuccessfully to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The newest quarterly number, announced Tuesday by the Labor
Department, is the biggest increase in productivity since the first
quarter of 1996, when labor productivity rose by 4.2 percent,
inaugurating a three-year period of robust improvement. Some
economists say that computers are finally producing their promised
efficiencies. But most experts say that a robust economy and strong
demand have forced companies to squeeze more production from their
workers, often by running equipment at full capacity.
</P>
<P>
   And chance plays a role. Productivity is really the dollar value
of all merchandise and services produced, divided by the number of
worker hours needed to produce it. The dollar value is adjusted for
inflation, and since 1995 changes made by the Labor Department to
make the consumer price index more accurate have automatically
increased the dollar value of merchandise and services, thus
helping to raise the productivity rate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for the improvement, the latest
productivity numbers are a far cry from documenting the arrival of
a new era reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s, when rapid economic
expansion, rising wages and low unemployment coexisted with low
inflation. All those characteristics also coexist today. But
temporary factors apparently explain them, and not the
``structural'' changes arising from computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not clear whether we are experiencing a long-lasting
structural improvement,'' said Edwin Dean, chief of productivity
data at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, ``or
simply an increase in productivity that could disappear when the
economy slows down.''
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra's baseball aphorism, in effect, applies to
productivity, adds Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University
economist. The game is not over until it is over. In productivity's
case, the final score _ the rate of improvement _ cannot be
calculated until a business cycle ends. So far productivity has
improved at an average annual rate of 1.4 percent since July 1990,
the start of the current business cycle. This compares with an
annual increase of 1.1 percent for the entire 1980s cycle.
</P>
<P>
   This not-yet-final improvement of three-tenths of a percentage
point from one decade to the next is not to be scoffed at. ``It
would produce a significant improvement in American lives if it
endures for quite a few more years,'' said Jeffrey Madrick, a
journalist and economist who is writing a book on productivity,
``but even then it would not be a return to any kind of golden
age.''
</P>
<P>
   The productivity number, issued quarterly and covering all
business except agriculture, is arguably the nation's most
important economic statistic. Only when productivity rises, can
incomes and living standards rise for most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that productivity measures a worker's success at
generating income. A long distance telephone operator, for example,
finds that she can handle 100 calls an hour, up from 97 calls,
because the phone company has given her better equipment or extra
training. Her productivity has risen by 3 percent. The extra
revenue that she now generates in each hour of work can be used by
the company to fatten profits or raise wages, or both. Most
important, this improvement can take place without increasing
telephone rates. A raise, in effect, is not dissipated in higher
prices.
</P>
<P>
   That was commonplace from 1959 to 1973, a golden era.
Productivity for the nonfarm business sector rose at a 2.9 percent
annual rate, but then slumped to 1.1 percent from 1973 until 1990.
The reasons why have never been fully understood.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's fourth quarter announcement _ and a downward
adjustment in the third quarter number to 2.5 percent from 3
percent _ labor productivity for all of 1998 rose by 2.2 percent.
Manufacturing led, with a fourth-quarter increase of 5.6 percent
and for the year as a whole, a 4.3 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   For the three years starting in 1996, productivity rose at an
average annual rate of 1.9 percent. But while the last three years
were strong, the 1980s produced an even stronger three-year burst:
Productivity rose at a 2.3 percent annual rate from 1983 through
1985.
</P>
<P>
   What characterizes the two periods is robust economic growth _ a
rapid rise in the output of merchandise and services _ and the
scramble by employers to meet the demand without adding labor. Even
so, new jobs have been created at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The believer in the productivity miracle,'' said Edward
McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, ``has to explain
why it has taken so much additional labor to produce the additional
output.''

CHARLES SCHWAB AIMS TO SOLIDIFY DOMINANCE OF ONLINE STOCK TRADING

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are many brand-name banks and brokerage
houses battling on the front-lines of American investing. Only one
of them, Charles Schwab Corp., has made peace with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, the quarter-century-old discount broker that has long
cast itself as a Wall Street outsider, has converted most of its
brokerage business to the Internet with an ease that few analysts
predicted. Moreover, it has quickly come to dominate the booming
business of trading stocks online. Its giant computing center in
Phoenix handles almost a third of all Internet trading _ meaning
that one in 20 stock trades in America passes through the Schwab
system.
</P>
<P>
   All this has come while its rivals struggle with the new medium.
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the country's biggest retail broker, will
begin a limited online trading service soon, but like other
full-service firms has been slow to embrace the Internet.
E(asterisk)Trade, a leading online competitor, has suffered a
streak of embarrassing trading shutdowns. Nearly all other Internet
stock-trading companies talk of ``earnings before marketing
expenses'' instead of profits.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab stands practically alone: It has made the wrenching
transition _ and made money from it, too.
</P>
<P>
   But even as it becomes known as the Houdini of finance for its
ability to squeeze profits out of difficult situations, it is
undertaking an even trickier make-over. Schwab is trying to convert
itself into a full-service brokerage firm for the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to use the Web to challenge _ more directly than
ever before _ the retail arms of Merrill, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co., Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney and others. It plans
to offer more advice, research, analytics and even hand-holding to
customers. Schwab is also fighting to distinguish itself from
well-financed online trading competitors like E(asterisk)Trade,
Ameritrade and Waterhouse Securities that are clawing at its online
dominance and offering lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The transition will be closely watched by Schwab's competitors.
All are trying to figure out how Americans will invest early in the
next century, what role the Internet will play and how investment
advice will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab intends to hog the middle of the road, somewhere between
Merrill on the full-service side and E(asterisk)Trade on the
discount side. But it will need sharp elbows to keep that space for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission now is to create a new model of a full service
brokerage firm,'' said David Pottruck, Schwab's co-chief executive.
``We are not a discount firm anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pottruck was careful to distinguish his vision from that of
the existing full-service brokerage firms. ``I mean a new kind of
full service firm,'' he said. ``Not the kind that sells its own
load funds and gives brokers free trips to Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck is a burly native of Levittown, N.Y., who wrestled and
played football at the University of Pennsylvania. He had a brief
stint on Wall Street before joining Schwab 15 years ago. Promoted
to share the executive reins with chairman Charles Schwab a year
ago, he has made his message resonate: Schwab intends to go after
the big Wall Street firms, which control much more of America's
investment money than discount firms do, and it will use the
Internet as its weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the company's San Francisco headquarters is a bit
like dropping in on a West Coast consultants' convention. The dress
is Gap casual, the carpets are earth tone and the fixtures gray
stone _ no marble or mahogany. And the nouns are all semiotic:
segmentation, alignment, high-tech, high-touch and empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   But the mission is in many ways the logical extension of the
idea that first prompted Schwab, the 61-year-old founder, to
pioneer discount brokerages in the 1970s: distrust of Wall Street.
Schwab began as a refuge for investors who felt they had been
burned by brokers who get commissions each time a stock is bought
or sold. Schwab did trades for less and paid its brokers in salary
and bonus, not commissions. Now, it is starting to give its
customers many of the tools full-service brokers and professional
money managers have at their disposal, but for a fraction of the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Web, Schwab thinks it can make the desktops of its 2.2
million online customers resemble a broker's. Its Web site now has
industry research from Standard &AMP; Poor's, insider-trading reports
from Vickers, live interviews with chief executives from
Briefing.com, stock research from Credit Suisse First Boston and
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist and a proprietary stock screening service that
can pinpoint equities that meet an investor's customized criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Many are free to all, though those with less than $100,000 in
assets pay fees for research and some other services.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is also working out the kinks in an e-mail service that
it says will make ``warm calls'' and ``hot calls'' to existing
clients, as opposed to cold-call solicitations. The automated
system is designed to monitor clients' portfolios and give them an
electronic heads-up if the price moves up or down significantly or
if a new equity or mutual fund comes closer than an existing
holding to meeting investment goals.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is also seen as the way of knitting together the old and
the new Schwabs. The old Schwab has 275 branch offices, places
where customers still go to conduct transactions or open accounts.
The new Schwab plans to expand those centers and build at least 200
new ones to form what Pottruck calls the ``social fabric'' of
investing. They will hold seminars and training sessions. A client
who sets up a child's trust, say, might get an e-mail invitation to
a live discussion on custody accounts and estate planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Barnes &AMP; Noble should compete with Amazon.com is not
to offer books at lower prices, but to create links between online
and local services,'' Pottruck said. ``How do you tie the two
together and build relationships? That's the next phase on the
Internet business.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is also moving the line in the sand between itself and
Wall Street investment banks, which typically work for companies
that sell stock as well as customers who trade shares. That is a
role that Schwab has often criticized as leading to conflicts of
interest. Schwab still does not underwrite securities on its own,
avoiding becoming investment bankers for companies. But it has
agreed to join investment banks that act as lead underwriters in
offering Schwab customers a chance to buy new issues, recognizing
that it cannot compete across the board with the big brokerages
without giving customers access to some hot initial public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time late last year, Schwab's name appeared on the
cover of a prospectus for an initial offering. The company joined
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist _ it has also reached stock distribution
agreements with J.P. Morgan and First Boston _ to find buyers for
the public offering of Select Comfort Corp., a Minneapolis-based
maker of air mattresses. Not a sexy high-technology issue, but
Schwab added a dollop of data base marketing: It was able to find
250,000 of its clients who own a mattress from the company. Many
were eager buyers of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest initiative is its ``signature
services.'' The plan is to retain more wealthy customers,
especially those who park more than $500,000 in assets. Many will
get a team of perhaps eight designated consultants to help manage
their portfolios. And though the company does not plan to advertise
it, the wealthiest, if they choose, will be able to have a single
broker monitor their investments.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this high-end push is part of Schwab's unstated goal to
remove Merrill from atop the hierarchy of retail investing. Schwab
acknowledges that the people it loses to full-service firms tend to
be the wealthiest clients who say that they have graduated from
Schwab's do-it-yourself ethic to a full-service broker.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is Schwab's network of fee-based investment
advisers. Through these 400 advisers so far, the firm refers
customers who do not want to manage their own money to
professionals who invest for them through Schwab. But for those who
do not want to rely on advisers, Schwab's latest initiative is to
convince wealthy customers that they can control their own money
and get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our customers to feel we can help them to trade out of
a 20,000-share position without losing a point,'' adds Pottruck,
referring to the difficulty clients have making large trades
electronically at predictable prices. ``We will offer everything
Merrill does and many things you can never get at Merrill.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, whose nearly $1.5 trillion in customer assets is about
triple what clients invest through Schwab, intends to be a major
player online as well as in its traditional brokerage business,
said Jim Wiggins, a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 400,000 clients with $300 billion in household
assets who already use Merrill online to actively manage their
accounts, and we are just scratching the surface,'' Wiggins said.
``Anyone who thinks that Merrill Lynch won't be using the Internet
to magnify the value we deliver to clients is making a major
miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schwab still often acts like an underdog, perhaps
because some of its good fortune could easily be short lived.
Schwab will surely face more competition from full-service firms in
coming months, even though many of them face pressures from their
brokers not to lure clients online. Moreover, 20 or so low-cost
online trading companies are nipping at Schwab's heels.
</P>
<P>
   Julio Gomez of Gomez Advisors, an Internet consultancy that
rates online trading firms, ranks Schwab's Web service as No. 8 out
of 20, in part because its $29.95 fee for each trade is at the top
end of an industry where $8 trades are no longer unusual.
E(asterisk)Trade; DLJ Direct, a unit of the investment bank
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, and Morgan Stanley's Discover
Brokerage, among others, also offer some research. Schwab's 28
percent share of the online trading business is slipping, Gomez
says.
</P>
<P>
   But Gomez also points out that Schwab is perhaps the only online
broker to have grown out of its capacity problems. It can now
handle 88,000 online customers at one time.
</P>
<P>
   (E(asterisk)Trade, by contrast, had three days within the last
week when its trading system crashed, and Ameritrade had a costly
shutdown early this week.)
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, unlike its cut-price competitors, also has healthy
profits to sustain marketing campaigns and capacity upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the sharpest arrow in Schwab's quiver is its proven
willingness to cannibalize its business if its sees the market's
changing direction.
</P>
<P>
   Take its transition to the Internet. Early last year Schwab
stopped discriminating against online traders and gave them access
to all services that its higher-paying clients had, even while
lowering the cost of online trades. Pottruck estimated that pretax
earnings would take a $150 million hit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Schwab's Internet integration did dampen earnings early
last year because of reduced trading commissions and technical
glitches. But by year-end surging volume was more than compensating
for declining commissions. And in a tough year for Wall Street,
Schwab's revenues jumped 20 percent, and its net profits rose 30
percent, to nearly $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers have made Schwab the envy of Wall Street, where
the San Francisco firm was not long ago dismissed as a
self-righteous pipsqueak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Greenspan said buying Internet stocks is like a
lottery ticket,'' said Michael Freudenstein, a finance industry
analyst with J.P. Morgan, referring to Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan. ``Well, this is a lottery ticket with an earnings
stream attached.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what some executives at the blue-chip investment bank
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. were pondering when they debated strategy
recently, a banker there answered with one word: Schwab. &QL;

ANALYSIS: WALL STREET SOUR ON LYCOS-USA NETWORKS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet investors, it turns out, prefer fantasy to reality.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lycos, the Internet portal service, said it would
merge with the electronic shopping units of USA Networks, including
the Home Shopping Network, Ticketmaster and its partially
independent Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch.
</P>
<P>
   The deal means that Lycos shareholders will go from owning 100
percent of a company with $75 million in revenue to owning 30
percent of a company with $1.5 billion in 1998 sales. If this were
a fourth-grade math problem, the right answer would be that having
a smaller piece of a much bigger pie would be clearly superior.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Internet math is different.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Lycos fell by 26 percent Tuesday to $94.25. That was a
huge drop even on a day when the whole Internet sector fell.
America Online shares fell by 7 percent to 147 15/16, and Yahoo
shares dropped by 11 percent to 140.75.
</P>
<P>
   The market was in such a sour mood that news announcements that
would have pumped up stocks in giddier times were ignored. For
example, America Online said Tuesday that it had signed up 1
million new members in the first five weeks of the year, its
fastest million ever, for a total of 16 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But the even sharper drop in Lycos shares reflected the
deflating of hopes by investors that all or part of the company
would be bought at a premium to its already high share price.
</P>
<P>
   The deal essentially was the reverse. Lycos is buying the assets
of USA Networks and Ticketmaster Online by issuing many more of its
own shares. Indeed, Lycos can be seen as paying a premium to USA,
which is the main reason that USA's shares increased by 10 percent
to 41.625.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a more fundamental issue facing Lycos' investors:
Even the best reality cannot compete with fantasy. Suddenly their
stakes in a small, rapidly growing company with seemingly infinite
potential have become shares in a very finite and measurable
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be known as USA Lycos Interactive Networks,
will have 7,000 employees, 2,900 ticket outlets, and warehouses
stocked with 18,000 items for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Davis, the chairman of Lycos, who will become the
president and chief executive of USA Lycos Interactive Networks,
argued the stock market should still value the new Lycos as an
Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Home shopping, he argued, should not be seen as a mature
business, but the vanguard of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the ability to be the dominant portal in the world but
also the dominant e-commerce entity as well,'' Davis said in an
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Davis argued that the new company should be valued
the same way as the old one, at 30 times its projected 1999
revenue. With that yardstick, the combined company would be worth
$45 billion. And the Lycos shareholders would see the value of
their holdings double.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Noglows, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, argues that the
new USA/Lycos deserves a high Internet multiple.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you cut this, Lycos is worth more as a part of
this venture that it was last night,'' he said. ``It's an
electronic commerce powerhouse, spanning television and the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors saw it differently. The value of the new company,
based on Lycos' stock price fell from $22 billion at Monday's
closing price to $16 billion Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   And David Simons, an independent analyst with Digital Video
Investments, points out that other companies with both Internet and
traditional businesses have not been accorded such high stock
prices. And indeed several of them have chosen to spin out their
Internet activities in order to create a stock with a higher
Internet multiple, such as Barnes &AMP; Noble, Ziff Davis, and Creative
Computers, a catalog company that spun out Ubid, an auction site.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are merging an Internet business with a traditional
business,'' he said. ``The question is to what extent does this
hybrid maintain its Internet valuation?''
</P>
<P>
   This is a question that investors will increasingly have to
grapple with, argues David B. Readerman, an analyst with Thomas
Weisel Partners, as Internet operations are quite logically
combined with television and other traditional media and commerce
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing these companies together is based on sound judgment,
even though USA's assets are in lower margin businesses than
Lycos,'' he said. ``They are saying that there many not be any pure
Internet companies any more without some media involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis complains that this talk of lower valuation is unfair and
perverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of Internet businesses has been based on the premise
that we will build big sustainable businesses with high growth
rates and high revenues,'' he said. ``I've done that now. It
doesn't make sense for the market to say that now that I've done
what it asked me to do, it should punish me.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again this is the Internet and it doesn't have to make
sense.

IMPROPER MEDICARE PAYMENTS FELL TO $12.6 BILLION IN '98, U.S.
REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal investigators said Tuesday that improper
Medicare payments to doctors, hospitals and other health care
providers fell sharply last year, but still cost the government
$12.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, the inspector general of the Department of
Health and Human Services, said improper payments had fallen 46
percent in two years. Ms. Brown estimated that such payments
totaled $23.2 billion in 1996 and $20.3 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The error rate also declined, with 7 percent of Medicare
payments being deemed improper last year, compared with 11 percent
in 1997 and 14 percent for 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, doctors, home health care agencies, laboratories and
other health care providers said they had become more cautious in
submitting claims to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the improper payments include inadvertent mistakes,
abuse and outright fraud. Investigators said they could not specify
how much was due to fraud. Most of the incorrect payments were for
medically unnecessary services and claims overstating the value of
services actually provided.
</P>
<P>
   John Bentivoglio, the coordinator of health care investigations
at the Justice Department, said criminal prosecutions and
convictions for health care fraud had doubled in the last four
years. The number of convictions reached 326 last year, up from 140
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``These enforcement efforts have played a major role in reducing
improper payments,'' Bentivoglio said. ``Compliance has become a
top priority in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials said they had issued Tuesday's report to
partly answer critics in Congress who say the Clinton
administration has not done enough to curb Medicare fraud. The
House Committee on government Reform and Oversight plans to hold a
hearing on the subject Wednesday. Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who
heads the committee, praised Medicare officials for reducing
overpayments, but said $12.6 billion was ``still an outrageous
amount of waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare spending totaled $211 billion last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The biggest reason for improper payments in 1998 was that
doctors, hospitals and others billed Medicare for services that
were not medically necessary. Ms. Brown, the inspector general,
said Medicare had paid $7 billion for such services, including
mental health care and ambulance rides for patients who were found
to have not needed them.
</P>
<P>
   Another major reason for improper payments is that health care
providers filed claims for services more expensive than those they
performed. The medical industry uses a standard coding system to
bill Medicare for services, and in many cases Medicare providers
submitted claims with a higher reimbursement code than they should
have used, so they were paid too much, causing a total of $2.3
billion in such overpayments last year.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors and hospitals have become better at keeping the
medical records needed to justify their claims. Improper payments
attributed to ``documentation errors'' dropped to $2.1 billion last
year, from $10.8 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The other improper payments, totaling $1.2 billion, were for
goods and services not covered by Medicare. These items include
routine physical examinations and experimental treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general began doing comprehensive financial audits
of Medicare in 1996. Joseph Vengrin, an assistant inspector general
who has worked on all three reports, said: ``I see a different
climate here. It's premature to say that the problem has been
fixed, but we are gradually seeing a turnaround. Health care
providers are being more careful in the claims they submit to
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimate of improper payments was based on a review of 5,540
claims for 600 Medicare beneficiaries. The claims, valued at $5.6
million, were chosen to be representative of all claims filed with
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The crackdown on suspected Medicare fraud has provoked protests
from health care providers. Teaching hospitals have complained
bitterly about an investigation of their billing practices. The
American Hospital Association has unsuccessfully lobbied Congress
for changes in the False Claims Act that would make it more
difficult for the government to recover money for false billings
and other types of civil fraud.

PATRIOTS DEAL TO BE INKED BY THURSDAY, INTERESTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft plans on
signing a stadium development agreement Thursday with the state of
Connecticut that has been padded with contingencies to cancel the
massive project if problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   Although the signing event to finalize the agreement between the
football team and Connecticut officials has been delayed twice in
the last month, both sides Tuesday seemed relieved that they were
close to sealing the deal. The biggest impediment to the project,
relocating a steam plant on the site of the proposed $350 million
stadium, may soon be resolved. The utility company owner confirmed
it is mulling at least one solid offer to sell the plant to another
utility company that will tear down the facility.
</P>
<P>
   But the development agreement, still being worked on by a team
of lawyers, is expected to include ample opportunities for
Connecticut or Patriots officials to walk away from the deal by
mutual agreement, just in case the steam plant or other real estate
issues are not speedily resolved.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday whether the plant's owner, CTG
Resources Inc., would accept a proposal -- reportedly worth $30
million -- from the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, a
quasi-public agency that turns trash into energy, allowing the
steam plant to be torn down. Sources said another offer to buy the
plant's business could be on the table, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the steam plant owners agree in the next
few days on how to get out of the way without disrupting heating
and cooling service to much of downtown Hartford, Kraft and Rowland
representatives say the development agreement will still be signed.
</P>
<P>
   No one from CTG or CRRA could be reached for comment Tuesday and
Rowland's spokesman did not return repeated calls.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Marquardt, CTG's president and CEO, issued a written
statement saying the company ``will give serious consideration to
this offer and all other aspects of the Adriaen's Landing
project,'' he said referring to the massive $1 billion riverfront
redevelopment project, ``including their impact on customers and
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, CRRA would reportedly pay about $30 million for
the plant. The CTG plant and its office headquarters are located on
what would be the 68,000-seat stadium playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Governor Paul Cellucci contradicted a report in
the Boston Herald that said he wants Massachusetts lawmakers to
reopen negotiations to try and keep the Patriots in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge, the Patriots are trying to
finalize the deal in Connecticut,'' Cellucci said. ``They haven't
talked to us and we haven't talked to them. And I think that's
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's appropriate to do anything right now. But,
to the extent there are hurdles, we ought to at least be thinking
about what we might do if it doesn't go forward in Connecticut.''

CHAOS GREETS PASSENGERS SEEKING FLIGHTS ON AMERICAN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Catching a flight on American Airlines out of one of
the area airports proved a little like playing lottery Tuesday,
with many passengers not discovering until they arrived at the
counter whether their flight was among the lucky departures or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't really let people know what's going on,'' said
Darren Sharpe, a 27-year-old Australian standing around at Kennedy
International Airport, waiting to embark on an extended vacation
itinerary of American flights to Miami, New Orleans and the
Caribbean. ``I'm trying to remain calm. You don't want to take it
out on the people at the counter. It's not their fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe said he had called twice before getting to the airport
and was told twice that everything would be departing. But once he
got in line he was having such trouble finding out whether his
direct flight to Miami was leaving that he resorted to calling the
reservations agents again from the terminal itself and was rerouted
via Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   At Newark Airport, the departing flight times for the
transcontinental trek to Los Angeles came and went all afternoon
with no sign of a plane taking off. Darlene Weber, a passenger
trying to go to California said the 3:20, the 5:45 and the 7 p.m.
flights were all scratched.
</P>
<P>
   The first time she called the airline at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday she
was told her flight was fine, but when she checked back a couple of
hours later just to be sure she was given the string of
cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to ask them to put me on another airline, they didn't
offer it to me,'' Ms. Weber said. ``I think it's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Most passengers did seem to be calling ahead, since the usually
bustling terminal at Kennedy was all but deserted. Those in the
terminal were apparently unaware of the dispute causing the strike,
a fight between the pilots and the management over the salaries of
new pilots from a regional airline that the carrier recently
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   At Kennedy Airport around 6:15 p.m., usually the busiest time of
day, the departures board showed 17 flights on time or boarding and
14 with ``Canceled'' in red letters next to the destination. The
arrivals board showed 27 flights on time and 19 canceled. Flights
linking New York with points as varied as London, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Jose, San Juan and Bermuda were all scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, too, the normally hectic traffic island were virtually
barren of taxicabs and other vehicles. One airline employee
surveying the terminal said he thought he was usually about 10
times as busy.
</P>
<P>
   The customer service agents deployed to help stranded passengers
were easily visible in the terminal by virtue of their bright red
vests. They refused to answer questions about what the airline was
doing for passengers, referring all calls to a corporate
communications office in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chiames, a spokesman for the airline, said that more than
730 flights out of a total 2,250, or about a third, had been
canceled because pilots were calling in sick.
</P>
<P>
   He said the airline estimates that about 100 passengers are
affected per canceled flight, so that roughly 73,000 passengers had
to make alternative arrangements Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chiames said that the airline often did not know until just
before the flight was due to depart, when the pilots were supposed
to report, that the flight was not leaving. Since pilots usually
sign up for flight schedules in three-day strings, Chiames said
once a pilot failed to appear that gave the company some sense of
the other flights that would likely be canceled if a reserve pilot
could not be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told our staff at airports to get the passenger on the
most convenient flight, whether it be ours or somebody else's,''
Chiames said. ``Our goal is to find the most convenient way to get
people to their destination.'' Some passengers were dreading the
idea that the strike would continue through the busy Presidents Day
weekend, disrupting vacation plans. Others said they would not
attempt to fly for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, Brian Sandlin, 37, was trying to navigate
across Kennedy to the United terminal for a return flight to Los
Angeles. He had flown in Sunday for the toy fair in New York,
getting on one of the American flights not cancelled as the strike
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my luck got used up then,'' he said.

POP LIFE: MARK LINKOUS; R.E.M.; WETLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a while, Mark Linkous, the soft-spoken leader
of the one-man group Sparklehorse, thought his first album would be
his last. Two years ago, he collapsed in his London hotel room
after mixing barbiturates with his antidepressant medication. When
the paramedics came 12 hours later, they found him unconscious with
his legs bent under his body. When they straightened them, a surge
of potassium and calcium shut down his kidneys and heart.
Fortunately, they were able to revive him.
</P>
<P>
   While recuperating, Linkous tried desperately to work on new
songs but found himself blocked. ``I couldn't write,'' he said in a
telephone interview this week from his farm in Virginia. ``I was
really frightened that when I flatlined for a few minutes, the
songwriting cells in my brain died from lack of oxygen. But I was
on so much medication that I couldn't think straight.''
</P>
<P>
   After three months in the hospital, Linkous, who had to use a
wheelchair for six months, found his muse. The first song he wrote
was the slow, elegiac ``St. Mary,'' named for the hospital. ``Come
on boys,'' he pleads in the song, ``please let me taste the clean
air in my lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Mary'' appears on his beautifully off-kilter new album,
``Good Morning Spider'' (Capitol), along with another song about
the experience, ``Pig.'' Where ``St. Mary'' is hopeful and
grateful, ``Pig'' is nihilistic and angry. ``I want to try and
die,'' Linkous screams in the raw, overdriven song. Between these
two compositions is a clue to the cryptic personality of Linkous,
someone who simultaneously appreciates the simplicity of life and
is frustrated by the complex lot it has dealt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only things I really need is water, a gun and rabbits,''
he sings in ``St. Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the world is, things are so complicated and move so
fast,'' Linkous said, explaining the lyric. ``I'm guilty of
acquiring all these possessions that I really don't need, like five
old motorcycles. And there's all this stuff that comes with having
a house and health insurance. Sometimes I feel like all I want to
do is go up and live in the mountains and eat rabbits.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Linkous, who plays guitar, bass, piano, sampler and an
old toy electronic keyboard called the Optigan on the album, is
often compared to Neil Young, he said that lately he had been
listening to the low-fi rock of Guided by Voices, the experimental
electronic music of Oval and the trip-hop of Tricky and Radiohead,
with whom he has toured in Europe. He insisted, however, that
Radiohead was not an influence on his equally intense album. ``We
could never compete with them,'' he said. ``They're great at making
those big, majestic pop songs. Our thing is being kind of small and
pathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, Linkous is his own worst enemy. ``Good Morning Spider''
is full of self-destruction, with songs skidding to a halt after
half a minute and vocals sung through toilet-paper tubes and old
wireless intercoms. The song ``Happy Man,'' for example, is one of
his catchiest, most uptempo rock moments. But throughout it is
disfigured by warbling static that sometimes grows louder than the
song itself. ``I wrote that song before `Vivadixie,''' Linkous
said, referring to his first album. ``But I put all this radio
static in there. I was tired of the song. I wanted to, in a way,
sabotage it.''
</P>
<P>
   But why? ``I have pop instincts just in my brain from growing up
to pop music,'' he explained. ``They will always be there, but I
want to construct fairly traditional pop songs in the way that Tom
Waits constructs his records, where they're more interesting
sounding. I would much rather sound like `Bone Machine''' _ the
Waits album _ ``than Everclear.''
</P>
<P>
   But under pressure from his record label, Linkous caved in
slightly and recorded a noise-free version of ``Happy Man'' for
radio only. He explained, ``There's this really expensive
motorcycle that I want, so. . . .''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nontour Becomes Tour
</P>
<P>
   When R.E.M. put out its new album, ``Up,'' last year, band
members also put out a press release explaining that they would not
be touring to support the record. They shouldn't have bothered. The
band announced this week that it had decided to embark on a
three-month world tour, beginning in Europe in April. The group's
former drummer, Bill Berry, will be replaced by Joey Waronker.
There was no explanation for the change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   The American leg of the tour is to begin at the Greek Theater in
Los Angeles on Aug. 9 and 10. The band will play at Jones Beach,
N.Y., on Sept. 4 and the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., on
Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating 10 Years
</P>
<P>
   Wetlands, the Manhattan music club known as a haven for hippies,
hip-hop heads and environmental activists, is celebrating its 10th
anniversary this month. From Thursday through Saturday nights, Bob
Weir of the Grateful Dead will perform acoustic sets. The shows are
sold out, but those with tickets for Saturday are in for a
surprise. Three musicians who some may consider the antithesis of
the Grateful Dead will join Weir for a plugged-in encore featuring
``Promised Land'' and ``Goin' Down the Road Feeling Bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Other concerts for the anniversary are to be by the John Popper
(of Blues Traveler) side project Frogwings, featuring members of
the Allman Brothers on Wednesday night; the rap pioneers Cold Crush
Brothers with Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest next Wednesday, and the
rock musical ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' on Feb. 23 with opening
acts featuring cast members of ``Rent'' and ``Bring In da Noise,
Bring In da Funk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people see us as hippiedom,'' said Peter Shapiro, who
took over the club from its original owner, Larry Block, in 1997.
``But we're a home for music of all genres. I think our anniversary
shows prove that.''

MICROSOFT HAS A SMALL PROBLEM WITH ANOTHER VIDEOTAPE
DEMONSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday once again found
itself in trouble with a videotaped demonstration in federal court.
And while even the government lawyer who discovered the problem
conceded, ``I don't mean to imply that this is terribly critical,''
this adds to the growing body of evidence that the Justice
Department is using to throw Microsoft's credibility into doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In court last week, Microsoft played a videotape intended to
demonstrate the advantages of integrating a World Wide Web browser
with the Windows operating system. But over several days, the
government's lead trial lawyer, David Boies, pointed out so many
problems and inconsistencies with the tape that Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson finally declared that he could not view it as
reliable evidence.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Microsoft played another tape to demonstrate how
much easier it was for a customer to sign up for Internet service
on a computer running Windows 98 than it had been on a computer
running the older Windows 3.1.
</P>
<P>
   On the Windows 98 machine, the sign-up was quite simple and took
only about five minutes. On the older system, it took about 17
minutes, including long delays while Internet software was loaded
onto the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's new witness, Cameron Myhrvold, a vice president in
the Internet Customer Unit division, supervised the production of
the video. As soon as his cross examination began, Boies pointed
out that the Windows 98 computer in the video was using a faster
modem, giving the newer system an unfair speed advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold acknowledged the difference but added that while using
a faster modem ``would have been a factor'' on the Windows 3.1
machine, ``most of the time was spent loading the software.''
</P>
<P>
   After court had adjourned for the day, Microsoft executives
scoffed at Boies' question. Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman,
acknowledged that the Windows 98 machine had used a modem running
at 33.6 kilobytes per second, while the other computer used a modem
running at 28.8 kilobytes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 12 minutes difference between the operating systems, the
modem speed accounted for only 22 seconds, he said. William H.
Neukom, the Microsoft senior vice president for law and corporate
affairs, said: ``The difference in the speeds of the two modems is
meaningless, academic.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Tuesday, when a Microsoft lawyer got a chance to
question the previous witness, William Poole, a company vice
president, he suggested that a key charge in the government's
antitrust suit was insignificant since it actually dealt with
whether customers get to see a dancing Mickey Mouse when they
visited a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-examining Poole on Monday, Boies entered into evidence
Microsoft's contract with Intuit Inc., maker of Quicken, the
popular personal finance software, which set out the terms for
Microsoft's agreement to carry an Intuit advertisement on the
opening screen of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   One condition, Boies pointed out, was that Intuit and other
companies signing these contracts had to agree that some Web pages
would present a significant ``degradation in appearance'' for
visitors using Netscape Navigator, the rival Web browser.

   In court on Tuesday, Poole said the Walt Disney Co. had been the
only company that honored the requirement and that Microsoft had
made no effort to enforce the stipulation while the contracts were
in place.
</P>
<P>
   And the only difference in content on the Disney site, he said,
was that a Mickey Mouse cartoon danced across the opening screen
for users of Internet Explorer while Netscape users didn't see the
image.
</P>
<P>
   The judge chuckled and shook his head upon hearing that.
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, Boies caused the witness to admit that even this
enhancement was important to Microsoft. The company had been
arguing in court that features like this would win millions of new
customers.

SENATE DELIBERATES CLINTON'S FATE IN PRIVATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate huddled behind closed doors Tuesday to
begin deliberating President Clinton's fate, as a leading
Republican predicted the long-running impeachment drama could end
by Friday with Clinton's ``bipartisan acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   Weighing for the first time in 131 years whether to remove a
president from office, senators shuttered the doors after 41
Republicans blocked a move to open the debate to public scrutiny.
Nearly all the GOP senators who supported closing the doors are
expected to vote for Clinton's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   With the chamber eerily empty except for elected members, a
handful of staff, and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the
Senate launched the historic proceeding at 2:06 p.m., and debated
for 4 1/2 hours before recessing until Wednesday at 10 a.m. The
deliberations are expected to continue until Thursday or Friday,
followed by the votes on two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark session began with Senator Slade Gorton of
Washington speaking first for the Republican majority and
announcing he will vote to convict Clinton for allegedly
obstructing justice, according to a Senate source. In a statement
Tuesday night, Gorton confirmed he will vote to remove Clinton on
the obstruction count, and he became the first GOP senator to
unequivocally state he will oppose the perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton was followed to the podium by Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
who opened for the Democrats. Senate rules prohibit members from
disclosing the content of the private deliberations, but Kennedy
characterized his position during a break in the session.
</P>
<P>
   Invoking the long battle for voting rights and the role of free
elections in the national experience, Kennedy cautioned that the
Senate faced an ``awesome responsbility'' in deciding whether to
oust Clinton from office for circumstances stemming from his sexual
affair with a former White House intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our Founding Fathers wanted us to exercise that
responsibility unless the action of the president was going to
undermine the Constitution or our democracy in a very substantial
way,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying the case against Clinton as weak and the effort to
convict him as highly partisan, Kennedy said, ``What happened is,
our Republican friends aimed at President Clinton and they hit the
Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The deliberations unfolded as an effort to achieve bipartisan
support for a resolution censuring Clinton became seriously
endangered in the face of vows by some conservative Republican
senators to kill the initiative with parliamentary tactics. Censure
backers plan to raise the issue after the final impeachment votes.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen senators spoke on the first day of deliberations, with
Republicans alternating with Democrats, and nearly every member
consumed the 15 minutes allotted for individual statements. Only
three or four senators exceeded the 15-minute limit, prompting
Rehnquist to gavel them to a close.
</P>
<P>
   With the camera lights turned off, the Senate chamber was ``dark
and intimate,'' said Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions rose several times as the speechmaking evolved into
brief flurries of debate and procedural skirmishes, but no harsh
words were exchanged, according to a number of senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few points where you could feel the pressure
rise, but it didn't go beyond that,'' said Senator Larry E. Craig,
an Idaho Republican. ``As for the rhetoric, I wouldn't suggest it
was soaring, but it was thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said the pressure rose when senators challenged each
other, asking, for example, ``Why do you believe that?'' and
``Where did you find that'' in the evidence?
</P>
<P>
   The deliberations followed 55 hours and 13 minutes of the trial
phase since Jan. 7. At the current rate, the secret discussions
will continue for another 20 hours through Thursday, and possibly
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No debate preceded the crucial move to close the deliberations,
which fell eight votes short of the 67 required to change the rules
and open the Senate doors. Although 14 Republicans joined all 45
Democrats in favor of opening the proceedings, the motion was
defeated, 59-41, with every New Englander supporting open
deliberations except Republican Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode
Island, and Bob Smith and Judd Gregg, both of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats swiftly suggested that GOP conservatives were
trying to shield themselves from public scrutiny after pressing for
Lewinsky and others to testify under the glare of the klieg lights.
In the end, Lewinsky testified before the Senate on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's extraordinary that Monica Lewinsky can appear to
the American people on the floor of the Senate and senators cannot
appear to the American people deliberating on this issue,'' Senator
John F. Kerry told reporters. ``In modern times, to be hiding this
kind of decision from the American people, I find absolutely
staggering. It's an act of political arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, helped to lead the
effort to block open deliberations, arguing the private debate
would foster thoughtful discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that we won't just have speeches and we will have
deliberations,'' Lott said on the Senate floor. Lott said he hoped
the closed session also would encourage brevity, noting that
Lincoln's Gettysburg address spanned only three minutes and
President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address lasted just seven
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, however, the outcome is a foregone conclusion.
Senators in both parties agreed that the 13 House Republican
managers who presented the case against Clinton failed by a
substantial margin to muster the two-thirds majority, or 67 votes,
needed to convict Clinton on either charge of perjury or
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, enough Republicans could vote against both charges that
Clinton is cleared by a majority of senators, according to several
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we could end up having by the end of the week is a
bipartisan acquittal, which I'm afraid could lead to a good deal of
celebrating downtown'' at the White House, said Senator Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Senators in both parties said there were no surprise
announcements on the first day of deliberations. After Kennedy, the
Democratic speakers included Senators Ernest F. Hollings of South
Carolina, Joseph R. Biden of Delaware, Carl Levin of Michigan, and
Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, who closed for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were given the option of speaking in order of
seniority, although several senators opted to delay their speeches,
including the party's most senior member, Senator Robert C. Byrd of
West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who has suggested he is undecided about how to vote,
cleared the way for Kennedy by passing. Kennedy entered the Senate
in 1962 and ranks second among Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking in the secret deliberations, Kennedy said he saw
no reason to close the proceedings. ``I can't think of a single
statement or comment or speech that has been made that the people
of this nation would not have appreciated hearing in terms of the
reasoning of the members of the US Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans used sign-up sheets to determine their speaking
order. Besides Gorton, the other GOP speakers included Senators
Phil Gramm of Texas and Jon Kyl of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, Republicans sought permission to issue
three subpoenas to determine if White House adviser Sidney
Blumenthal lied in a deposition last week when asked if he spread
Clinton's assertion that Lewinsky was a ``stalker.'' Two Washington
journalists have filed sworn affidavits stating that Blumenthal
repeated the ``stalker'' description to them. The two reporters
told another journalist about the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate Democratic leader, Thomas A. Daschle, objected to
issuing the subpoenas and blocked them.

PATRIOTS DEAL TO BE INKED BY THURSDAY, INTERESTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft plans on
signing a stadium development agreement Thursday with the state of
Connecticut that has been padded with contingencies to cancel the
massive project if problems arise.
</P>
<P>
   Although the signing event to finalize the agreement between the
football team and Connecticut officials has been delayed twice in
the last month, both sides Tuesday seemed relieved that they were
close to sealing the deal. The biggest impediment to the project,
relocating a steam plant on the site of the proposed $350 million
stadium, may soon be resolved. The utility company owner confirmed
it is mulling at least one solid offer to sell the plant to another
utility company that will tear down the facility.
</P>
<P>
   But the development agreement, still being worked on by a team
of lawyers, is expected to include ample opportunities for
Connecticut or Patriots officials to walk away from the deal by
mutual agreement, just in case the steam plant or other real estate
issues are not speedily resolved.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday whether the plant's owner, CTG
Resources Inc., would accept a proposal -- reportedly worth $30
million -- from the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, a
quasi-public agency that turns trash into energy, allowing the
steam plant to be torn down. Sources said another offer to buy the
plant's business could be on the table, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the steam plant owners agree in the next
few days on how to get out of the way without disrupting heating
and cooling service to much of downtown Hartford, Kraft and Rowland
representatives say the development agreement will still be signed.
</P>
<P>
   No one from CTG or CRRA could be reached for comment Tuesday and
Rowland's spokesman did not return repeated calls.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Marquardt, CTG's president and CEO, issued a written
statement saying the company ``will give serious consideration to
this offer and all other aspects of the Adriaen's Landing
project,'' he said referring to the massive $1 billion riverfront
redevelopment project, ``including their impact on customers and
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, CRRA would reportedly pay about $30 million for
the plant. The CTG plant and its office headquarters are located on
what would be the 68,000-seat stadium playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Governor Paul Cellucci contradicted a report in
the Boston Herald that said he wants Massachusetts lawmakers to
reopen negotiations to try and keep the Patriots in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the best of my knowledge, the Patriots are trying to
finalize the deal in Connecticut,'' Cellucci said. ``They haven't
talked to us and we haven't talked to them. And I think that's
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's appropriate to do anything right now. But,
to the extent there are hurdles, we ought to at least be thinking
about what we might do if it doesn't go forward in Connecticut.''

 (Editors: subs 7th graph beginning ``Lycos reaches about...'')   USA/Lycos Is Betting Its Future on E-Shopping 
 &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
USA/Lycos Interactive Networks, the newest Internet dynamo, is
betting its future on hawking books, clothes and tickets straight
to consumers, but its rivals and investors have some doubts about
that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Cable television giant USA Networks said yesterday it agreed to
buy Lycos Inc. in a complex stock deal that creates a TV-Internet
company valued at more than $20 billion. USA/Lycos Interactive
Networks stitches together Lycos, one of the largest Internet
search directories, with USA Networks' home shopping, ticketing and
online businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe consumers look at the Web as a utility rather than
as entertainment,'' said Jan Horsfall, Lycos senior vice president
of marketing. ``The Internet's winners over the next year (will be)
those companies who position the Net as a useful appliance to buy
goods.''
</P>
<P>
   USA/Lycos intends to do that by taking a slightly different
approach from archrivals Yahoo, Excite and Infoseek. The cable TV
/Internet media giant will focus exclusively on selling goods
directly to consumers _ not offering a combination of ads and
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The new media company could offer enormous potential for
cross-promotion between the Internet and television, according to
industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks' cable TV programming already is available in 70
million homes. Its Home Shopping Network handles more than 1
million telephone transactions and ships more than 200,000 items
daily. Ticketmaster sells 70 million tickets a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos reaches about 30 million people _ nearly half of all
domestic online users _ through a network of Web sites. The company
owns and operates four of the top 20 sites, including Lycos, one of
the largest ``portals,'' or Internet gateways, for Web searches,
news, free e-mail and online shopping. Other properties include
WhoWhere, a developer of personal Web pages, and Wired Digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (merger) places all the necessary ingredients for
electronic information and commerce ... into one centrally and
aggressively managed enterprise,'' USA Networks Chairman Barry
Diller said in a statement. ``There is no excuse now for us not to
be a dominant player as the world continues its transition toward
interactive systems.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Wall Street appeared to have reservations. While USA
Networks' stock rose $3.69 to $41.63 yesterday, Lycos shares
tumbled $33 to $94.25. The steep slide was triggered by concerns
that Lycos did not swing a deal with a bigger media partner and
that Diller got the better of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street made it clear what it thought of the deal,'' said
Ron Rappaport, analyst at Zona Research in Redwood City. ``This
industry is not shy about passing judgment on brand-name cache, and
USA Networks is not considered an Internet force. Instead, it
conjures up images of cartoons on Saturday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of LYCOS10 (72553 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Executives at rival Internet companies, meanwhile, downplayed the
deal, suggesting that Lycos and USA Networks had run out of
potential partners and were left with each other.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Internet has ``shifted from a portal war to a brand-name
war,'' said Barak Berkowitz, Infoseek senior vice president of
marketing. ``We're happy with our partnership with Disney. It's a
premiere media brand name. People know and trust it. Lycos is
validating what we have already done.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo President Jeff Mallett said that by ``placing all of its
eggs into the e-commerce basket,'' Lycos runs the risk of cutting
itself off from other potential revenue such as advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitors characterized the Lycos-USA Networks deal as
too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done a good job of being a chameleon, and today they
adopted a new skin,'' Excite CEO George Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me get this straight: A couple of weeks ago, Lycos
executives said they were very, very committed to remaining
independent,'' Bell said. ``Yet at the same time, there were
reports they were talking to NBC and Time-Warner. And then they
strike a deal with USA Networks. They appear to be constantly
changing positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The USA/Lycos deal ends weeks of speculation about whether Lycos
was seeking a merger with a major media company, and caps off three
months of wheeling and dealing by the leading Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   In November, AOL announced a $4.2 billion takeover of Netscape
Communications, kicking off a consolidation race to secure the
largest audience of users. A few weeks later, AtHome Network said
it would acquire Excite for $6.7 million, and Yahoo announced that
it intended to merge with GeoCities for $4.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos had been in discussions with NBC this weekend, sources
said, and reportedly talked earlier with Time Warner and German
media giant Bertelsmann AG.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover rumors fueled a steep run-up in Lycos stock during
the past month, to $145 from $58 early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Horsfall said the complex deal will have ``virtually no impact''
on Lycos' two Bay Area properties: the 165-person Wired Digital in
San Francisco and WhoWhere, which employs 100 people in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty damn good at running a far-flung number of
companies,'' Horsfall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, (the deal) creates a larger audience for Wired
Digital and gives us greater opportunities to be seriously marketed
on TV,'' said Wired Digital President Beth Vanderslice. She added
that the online news operation is in the process of
across-the-board job hires.
</P>
<P>
   Wired Digital, the last vestige of digital media empire Wired
Ventures, agreed to be sold to Lycos for $83 million in stock in
October. That deal is set to close in early March.

 Tiny Diedrich Coffee Brews Challenge to Industry Giant Starbucks  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Value investors may want to sift through the grounds of Diedrich
Coffee before its shares begin to perk.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County coffeehouse chain is a classic example of a
much-loved family business that didn't get the knack of growing
profitably.
</P>
<P>
   Since going public in 1996, Diedrich has failed at the Wall
Street exercise of meeting earnings expectations. In fact, for the
past two years, the company has been in the red.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason bottom-fishers are watching this micro-cap with a
$30 million market value is that chief executive John Martin seems
to have righted the ship and has positioned little-known Diedrich
for national growth.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has done this before. When he was the top executive of
Irvine-based Taco Bell _ then a unit of Pepsico _ he oversaw that
chain's meteoric growth from $600 million in sales and 1,500
fast-food outlets to more than $4.5 billion in sales and some
25,000 stores during his 13 years at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   And yesterday, Martin made his biggest move since being named
chairman and CEO of Diedrich &UR;  &LR; about a year ago. He announced that
Diedrich has agreed to buy Castroville's Coffee People, a
competitor that operates under three banners: Coffee People, Coffee
Plantation and Gloria Jean's (the latter is a mall-based coffee
chain).
</P>
<P>
   Diedrich has pledged to pay about $35 million in cash and stock
for Coffee People, which is 70 percent owned by Second Cup of
Toronto. Under the proposed deal, Coffee People shareholders would
get $10.75 million in cash, 1.7 million shares of Diedrich common
stock and $14.25 million in a combination of cash and stock. To be
sure, this deal is far from done. Diedrich still needs to secure
financing for the cash portion of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, when closed, would make Diedrich the
second-largest publicly held specialty coffee company behind
Seattle's Starbucks, which of course is the thousand-pound gorilla
in this high-profile market. After the acquisition, Diedrich will
boast sales of more than $150 million via 360 stores in 38 states
and seven countries.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has been waiting for another company to challenge
Starbucks, and Diedrich might fill the bill. ``We already have been
warmly received by financial analysts,'' said Martin in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET10 (84620 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  That hasn't always been the case. In fact, because of its poor
financial performance, Diedrich has been basically orphaned by
brokerage analysts. One of two analysts to cover the company is Van
Kasper's Eric Wold, who rates Diedrich a buy. Shares have been
trading between $4 and $8 during the past 12 months. Yesterday,
Diedrich closed up a fraction at around $5 a share.
</P>
<P>
   While the acquisition gives Diedrich a kick-start, the real
potential for growth is expected to come from franchisees that will
control big regions and open hundreds of stores, Wold said in a
December research note. Wold, whose firm has an investment banking
relationship with Diedrich, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Martin's vast relationships with regional franchise
developers, the corporate fast-food veteran is expected to deliver
a series of franchise agreements that should fuel growth.
</P>
<P>
   Diedrich blueprint for national expansion calls for about 1,500
new coffeehouses over the next six years through development deals
with large multi-unit franchise operators. The company has already
signed two major deals that would open about 145 Diedrich
coffeehouses and has plans to expand the Gloria Jean's brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be too commercial, and we think we can get
local (operators) who can do that better than corporate executives
in Irvine,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Was that a dig against Starbucks? Of course, there will be
endless comparisons to the McDonald's of espresso _ which is no
pushover as Pasqua discovered. The homegrown San Francisco coffee
chain recently decided to throw in the towel and agreed to sell out
to Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Diedrich, on the other hand, has a slightly different business
model. It has been around for more than 25 years, with a loyal
following in its native Orange County where it competes well with
Starbucks. Diedrich's outlets are not coffee bars, like Starbucks,
but coffeehouses that are larger and encourage customers to hang
out.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Starbucks' strategy has been to enter major urban
markets and migrate out to the suburbs. Having started in the
suburbs, Diedrich will launch in the suburbs, where there is less
competition, and expand toward the downtowns of those cities it
enters, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET10 (84620 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Lastly, the coffee chain has Martin Diedrich, the company's
founder and vice chairman who is well known in Southern California
cafe society. Martin, the CEO, thinks the affable coffee expert has
the potential to become the Dave Thomas (of Wendy's fame) of
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Diedrich is like a winemaker. He has a passion not just
for the beans but for the roasting,'' Martin noted.

UNABOMBER IS PLANNING TO SEEK NEW TRIAL, LAW PROFESSOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski, imprisoned as the Unabomber who conducted a
lonely campaign of terror, believes he was unfairly forced to plead
guilty last year and plans to seek a new trial, a law professor who
has corresponded with him said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The law professor, Michael Mello of Vermont Law School, said in
an interview that Kaczynski has objected in letters to the
circumstances that led to his guilty plea last January. His lawyers
then portrayed him as mentally ill and the judge in the case denied
him permission to represent himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he had been denied his day in court; that he had
been silenced by the legal system,'' Mello said. ``He had an
intuitive sense that he should have been allowed his day in
court.'' Mello said he had received 58 letters from Kaczynski, who
has been in federal prison in Florence, Colo., since he was
sentenced to life without the possibility of parole last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski's desire for a new trial and his correspondence with
Mello were described in an article in the Feb. 15 issue of The
National Law Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kaczynski's plea deal, federal prosecutors withdrew their
demand for the death penalty. As a result, legal experts said on
Tuesday, any effort to void Kaczynski's guilty plea could subject
him to the death penalty once again.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear in his abortive trial in Sacramento, Calif., last
year that Kaczynski was intrigued by the idea of using a trial as a
platform for his antitechnology views. His lawyers said then that
his willingness to risk death to make a political point, and many
other unorthodox actions, were indications of what they and a
court-appointed expert said was paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski, a mountain recluse when he was arrested, began
writing to Mello after Mello published articles that were critical
of the defense lawyers. Mello is writing a book on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Mello said on Tuesday that at Kaczynski's urging, he and
students at the law school drafted legal papers for Kaczynski to
file on his own behalf that would seek a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Richard Bonnie, a law professor and an expert on
psychiatry and the law, agreed to represent Kaczynski, said another
lawyer involved in the case who insisted on anonymity. Bonnie,
director of the Institute of Law, Psychiatry and Public Policy at
the University of Virginia Law School, and Kaczynski's original
chief defense lawyer, Quin Denvir, both declined to comment on
Tuesday.

COMPANY HALTS ITS WORK ON CANCER DRUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., a leading maker of anti-cancer drugs,
said Tuesday that it was halting its work on angiostatin, one of
two anti-cancer compounds that have excited intense interest in
last year or so.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers officials hesitated Tuesday to give details
explaining their move. But Robert Kramer, Bristol-Myers vice
president for oncology drug discovery, said in a statement: ``At
this time, angiostatin protein in its present form does not meet
our criteria for molecules that advance to clinical trials. We have
chosen to direct our resources to other programs in our broad
oncology pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, Kramer said the company's main concern
was not the compound's effectiveness, but rather whether it could
be manufactured in large enough amounts in sufficient strength to
sustain tests in people.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release issued by Bristol-Myers and Entremed, the
small biomedical company in Rockville, Md., that has been its
partner in the work, the two companies said the development
agreement between them was being modified.
</P>
<P>
   While Entremed will continue to develop angiostatin, the
statement said, Bristol-Myers will retain the option to reassume
development and marketing rights of the protein once ``clinical
proof of principal has been demonstrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Entremed first captured national attention last May when a
front-page article in The New York Times reported enthusiasm among
scientists that angiostatin and endostatin, another compound being
tested by the company, made tumors disappear in mice.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there have been reports that scientists have had
difficulty working with the compounds, whose use as cancer
treatments was initially investigated by Dr. Judah Folkman, a
researcher at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The reports have frustrated John Holaday, Entremed's chief
executive, who said that Tuesday's announcement, in spite of the
media attention surrounding it, was a non-event. Holaday emphasized
that Bristol-Myers Squibb would still consult with Entremed during
the development of angiostatin and that the two companies'
agreement was anything but ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``In developing this drug, we have come under a tremendous
spotlight,'' Holaday said. ``We had planned to quietly develop the
drugs with haste to get them to cancer patients. But we were
catapulted into the spotlight with that New York Times article. Now
everything we do gets news whether its newsworthy or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The article turned angiostatin into one of the year's hottest
drugs even though it had yet to be tested on humans and was years
away from being released. Entremed's stock jumped $39.75, to
$51.81, with the trading volume at a level above the number of
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   But the article reported excitement among scientists about
earlier findings, not about new results. As Holaday noted Tuesday,
there had been no new developments regarding the compounds for
several months.
</P>
<P>
   Entremed said Tuesday that, as planned, it should begin
angiostatin's clinical trials on humans this year. Until those
trials are under way, no one will know how successful angiostatin
can be.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Bristol-Myers Squibb also emphasized that the
company's decision to have Entremed develop angiostatin had nothing
to do with the drug's effectiveness or with doubts in the company
as to whether it could be safely used in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have confidence in the principle of angiostatin,'' Kramer
said. ``We are confident that the angiostatin molecule can reduce
tumors in mice. You just have to understand that angiostatin has to
be one of the most complex compounds ever to be developed for
man.''

A MILESTONE OF MILESTONES

 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For an allegedly young team, the Kings are pretty old
and have been having a pretty grand time.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, defenseman Doug Bodger, 32, played in his
1,000th NHL game. Last week, it was 35-year-old defenseman Garry
Galley's turn.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, winger Russ Courtnall, 33, is scheduled to appear in
his 1,000th game when the Kings visit the Phoenix Coyotes. And
later in the season, 34-year-old center Ray Ferraro also will reach
the 1,000-game milestone.
</P>
<P>
   It's believed to be the first time in NHL history that a team
has had four players reach the 1,000-game mark in the same year.
And when Courtnall hits 1,000, it will be the first time brothers
have accomplished the feat. Courtnall's brother, St. Louis' Geoff
(currently sidelined with post-concussion syndrome), has appeared
in 1,039 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I'll probably look back on and think more about
then than right now,'' Russ Courtnall said of reaching the 1,000
mark. ``But I'm pretty proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Henri and Maurice Richard came the closest of any
previous brothers to appearing in 1,000 games. Henri played in
1,256 and Maurice in 978.
</P>
<P>
   To mark Courtnall's 1,000th game, his wife, Paris, is flying her
husband's mother, stepfather, sister and younger brother to Los
Angeles from British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of last season it looked as if Courtnall might not
reach the 1,000-game mark. He was unsigned and uncertain he wanted
to play again. Instead, he signed with the Kings a month into last
season and signed another one-year deal with the Kings over the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to question whether I was going to play,'' Courtnall
said. ``At one point, I wasn't sure I wanted to. After missing the
first month, I wanted to get back. I really missed the game and I
knew I could still play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I decided to come back. Hopefully, I can play three
or four more years. The break was good for me. It made me miss the
game and miss the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro is 10 games from 1,000 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means playing a lot longer than a lot of people thought I
could,'' Ferraro said. ``Two things I always tried to have are
consistency and durability. I guess 1,000 games is a measure of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Big game:!off! The Kings were 0-3 at home against the
Coyotes this season but are 1-0 in Phoenix. In that game, on Dec.
28, Bodger was viciously checked from behind by Phoenix winger
Dallas Drake, who received a four-game suspension for the play.
</P>
<P>
   Bodger missed six games with a cervical strain as a result of
the hit, and as recently as last week said he felt the effects of
the play. Drake will miss tonight's game with a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd been looking forward to playing against Drake,
Bodger said, ``Things happen. I'm still not happy about what
happened. Sometimes, I think about it. It could have been a lot
more serious, but it was still one of the most painful things I've
ever gone through. I can't be worrying about Dallas Drake. We've
got to worry about winning hockey games. You've got to put personal
hatred or whatever aside. It's a team game. You can't be selfish.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if ``hatred'' was the right word to describe his feelings
toward Drake, Bodger said, ``My mom always told me two wrongs don't
make a right. I know nobody tries to really hurt anybody. I hope
that doesn't happen. I know frustration sets in. It is a
frustrating game, an emotional game. You do things you regret. I
remember when Matt Johnson punched Jeff Beukeboom (of the New York
Rangers), he came in and said, `That wasn't good, was it?' I said,
`No, it wasn't.'''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Loose pucks: &UR; !off! &LR;  In the Kings' 4-2 victory over
Phoenix, the Coyotes lost star winger Keith Tkachuk to bruised ribs
and star center Jeremy Roenick to a concussion. Tkachuk recently
missed two games with a back strain, but it is believed his ribs
also have been bothering him.... Jamie Storr is expected to start
in goal tonight. Stephane Fiset was held out of Saturday's victory
over San Jose with stiffness in his groin but said he's fine and is
slated to play Thursday night at home against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get it worse and miss three weeks or a
month,'' Fiset said. &UR; !dlim!!end!

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As more than 1,000 people gathered Tuesday in the
second angry demonstration in three days to protest the killing of
an unarmed African street vendor by four police officers, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani canceled a political trip to Texas so he could
meet with the victim's parents and perhaps attend a memorial
service Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's announcement came as the mother of the victim
arrived in New York from Guinea and visited the Bronx building
where her son, Amadou Diallo, 22, died in a barrage of 41 bullets
last Thursday, for reasons still unexplained. Protesters have
denounced the shooting and called for the federal government to
take over the inquiry, but there were indications Tuesday that
federal prosecutors would defer to the Bronx district attorney for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, Diallo's mother, Kadiadou, stepped out of a
dark police van at the site of the shooting, crumpled to the
street, was helped to her feet, then cried out ``Amadou, Amadou,
Amadou.'' She was lifted by both arms up the stairs to the
apartment building vestibule at 1157 Wheeler Ave., which was filled
with flowers and, votive candles and pock-marked with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   When she re-emerged half an hour later, she said softly in
English that ``justice must be done'' and that she wanted to take
her son and bury him at home.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration over the killing took place at lunchtime
outside the Federal Courthouse in Foley Square, where protesters
chanted for more than two hours to demand that federal officials
take charge of the investigation into Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can shoot anyone 41 times,'' said the Rev. Al
Sharpton, who led the protest, ``they can shoot anyone 41 times. It
may start with blacks and Latinos, but it can go everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many in the crowd were apparently veterans of similar
protests, others said they were demonstrating for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take some of the responsibility for what happened,'' said
Roger Bobb, a 31-year-old lawyer from Crown Heights, who said he
had never participated in a protest before. ``I've sat back too
long while this kind of thing happens time and time again. I feel
that as black people, we have not done enough to show Mayor
Giuliani that we will not tolerate this.''

SEARS AGREES TO $60-MILLION FINE FOR TRYING TO COLLECT FROM
BANKRUPT CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending a two-year criminal investigation into charges that it
was trying to illegally collect debts from customers who had
declared bankruptcy, Sears, Roebuck and Co., agreed on Tuesday to
plead guilty to one count of bankruptcy fraud and to pay a fine of
$60 million.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, which is subject to approval by the federal district
court, would be the largest ever to be paid in a bankruptcy fraud
case, according to the U. S. attorney's office in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The charges concern a policy by Sears Bankruptcy Recovery
Management Services Inc., a unit of the retailer, to force
credit-card customers who had filed for personal bankruptcy
protection to pay Sears their back debts anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers felt obligated to sign reaffirmation agreements
giving them a schedule of payments to settle their outstanding
balances. Sears, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., never
filed the reaffirmation agreements with the court, in violation of
the law.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the fine caused many bankruptcy experts to see
an impact beyond Sears.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law professor who specializes in
personal bankruptcy, said, ``This is a bombshell in the consumer
protection area.'' She added, ``This is a warning'' to other
retailers that ``someone is looking out for hard-pressed consumer
debtors.''
</P>
<P>
   May Department Stores and Montgomery Ward have also been hit
with class-action lawsuits over their reaffirmation practices.
</P>
<P>
   Sears had long acknowledged ``flawed legal judgment'' in
pursuing these cases and had already paid more than $180 million in
restitution to about 188,000 debtors and $40 million in civil fines
to 50 state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   A Sears spokeswoman, Jan Drummond, said, ``This has been the
outstanding item and it is a relief to finally have a resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter of 1997, Sears took a pretax charge of
$475 million to cover the cost of the fines, settlements and
expenses related to the unfiled agreements.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ms. Drummond said the fine would have ``no effect
on Sears' earnings'' this year.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Schuster, portfolio manger, with Gemina Capital, a New
York-based money management firm, concurred that Sears' earnings
would be unaffected and added, ``This scandal has had very little
affect on their business.'' he said, ``It really hasn't crept into
the consciousness of most customers' opinion of Sears.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with federal prosecutors in Boston, Sears has
agreed to ensure that all future reaffirmation agreements are
properly filed. It agreed to the same thing in the settlement of
civil lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sears fell 87.5 cents, to $39.125.

   Don't get bogged down in your usual dilly-dallying,
shilly-shallying thing.
</P>
<P>
   Dump the guy, Janet. He's a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he's a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he didn't do rope lines, but Kenneth Starr is more
creepily obsessed with tracking and trapping Bill Clinton than
Monica ever was.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Reno has been stewing about all the independent
persecutor's transgressions: how his team manhandled Monica at the
mall, how his office leaked and leaked, how Starr steamrolled the
attorney general into expanding his authority into the Lewinsky
affair without revealing his office's contacts with Paula Jones'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the president thinks the prosecutor is evil, he is
loath to play Nixon to Starr's Cox.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came out that Starr was calculating how he could
indict Clinton on criminal charges while he is still in office, or
the day he leaves for Hollywood, the Clinton crowd realized that a
wooden stake might be required.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Starr's shy smile lurks the heart of the undead.
</P>
<P>
   He comes back and back and back for more blood _ from Web
Hubbell, from Susan McDougal, from Julie Hiatt Steele, from Bill
Clinton. Maybe poor Sidney Blumenthal is next. (Only Starr could
inspire ``poor'' before ``Sidney Blumenthal.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Buffy, Janet is all we've got. She has been
fantasizing about slaying the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are oodles of reasons to can him. He wasted a
federal fortune investigating all the serious issues _ Whitewater,
Travelgate, File-gate _ that could have entailed the kind of public
misconduct that Americans care about. He found nothing, and instead
came up with a sizzling impeachment potboiler.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reports on Friday that Justice Department
officials are starting to build a case against the man who built
the case against their boss. David Johnston and Don Van Natta
reveal that Starr's deputies assured Reno's department that they
had not had any contact with the Paula Jones lawyers when they
sought to expand their investigation into the president's affair
with the intern. Based on contemporaneous notes of that crucial
meeting in January 1998, it appears that the Office of Independent
Counsel misled the Justice Department, since Linda Tripp's fateful
call to Starr's office was preceded by a conversation between one
of Starr's deputies and a lawyer who had worked on the Jones case
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem that Janet Reno is out to help the president, but
really she may be rescuing the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans may not care about Starr's ethics. But they
should care about his incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is supposed to be the party of big business. If Starr
were a CEO, the stockholders would be clamoring for his head. He
tried a hostile takeover and lost. And the company's stock has been
plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public disdain for impeachment, Starr still managed to
sell the House managers a weak case. The fact that the managers'
case is entirely built on Starr's tainted enterprise is why it's
impossible for reasonable people to accept their arguments, even
though most reasonable people believe the president lied and
schemed to hide evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After the House Republicans bullied the impeachment into the
Senate, they were again led astray by Starr, who went to court to
help them drag Monica back from California. Any idiot should have
known that on the stand, Monica would try to protect the president,
not bury him. She may have ``mixed emotions'' about her former
boyfriend, but she hates Ken Starr with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   When things got rough for the Republicans, the independent
counsel, with his tin ear for public relations, made them worse:
Word got out of his musings about indicting the president while
still in office.
</P>
<P>
   People used to trust the Republicans to be practical. As Calvin
Coolidge put it, ``The chief business of the American people is
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Starr, with destructive cheerleading from the Christian
right, helped turn Republicans into a party of scolds brandishing
scarlet letters. Their new motto is more ominous: ``Your business
is our business.''
</P>
<P>
   So fire him, Janet, fire him. His business is our business.

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The German government said on Tuesday that it had
agreed in principle to establish a huge compensation fund, financed
by the biggest names in German industry and banking, to compensate
victims of Nazi horrors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, announced here by a top aide of Germany's new
chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, appears to be an effort to
short-circuit a wave of lawsuits in American courts against German
companies that made use of slave labor and forced labor during
World War II or profited from the seizure of assets belonging to
Jews and other victims.
</P>
<P>
   German officials said that the size of the fund is still to be
determined. They have made it clear that they want to avoid the
kind of international bruising that Switzerland suffered for nearly
two years, as the government fought off legal and diplomatic
actions against Swiss banks. Ultimately, the two largest banks in
Switzerland reached a $1.25-billion settlement, which was formally
signed last month.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here on Tuesday, Schroeder's
chief-of-staff, Bodo Hombach, said that it would take some time
before the German government, its major corporations, Jewish groups
and lawyers representing Holocaust victims settled on the size of a
fund to resolve outstanding claims against German companies.
Nonetheless, participants in the talks said they thought the amount
paid by the Swiss banks would be a starting point and that the
German settlement _ which is likely to include Deutsche Bank,
Daimler-Benz, Volkswagen, Siemens and others _ could easily reach
into the billions.
</P>
<P>
   What the German concerns want in return is exactly what the
Swiss got: a ``global'' agreement that ends virtually all suits.
Hombach also suggested on Tuesday that Germany had concluded, after
watching the Swiss experience, that a prolonged fight was not in
the interest of the country or its companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could legally win and lose your reputation,'' he said. The
idea of a voluntary settlement ``is not something that the head of
the legal departments of German companies might subscribe to, but
the CEOs understand the political importance.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the Swiss and German cases are not comparable:
Switzerland was a neutral in the war, and the suits against its
banks marked the first time in half a century that the Swiss were
confronted with their mixed wartime record.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, successive generations of Germans have wrestled
with their national legacy. Hombach noted on Monday that, since
Germany's surrender in 1945, the government has already paid 140
billion marks, or about $80 billion at current exchange rates, in
war reparations and aid.
</P>
<P>
   But there has never been a settlement by German companies,
including those that forced East Europeans to work in German war
factories for little or no wages.
</P>
<P>
   Other individuals were slave laborers in the death camps,
working for the government, and one of the unresolved questions is
whether the German Parliament will create a fund of its own or
contribute to the one financed by industry.
</P>
<P>
   The German announcement, which came after lengthy negotiations
on Monday at the State Department, won praise from the World Jewish
Congress, which pressed the Swiss case and has been a central
player in the negotiations with Germany. ``It is extremely
encouraging,'' said Israel Singer, who heads the organization,
``that they seem sincere in reaching moral and material
restitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the plantiffs in the suits _ who have often been
at odds with the World Jewish Congress _ were far more cautious.
Several plaintiffs' lawyers who are involved in class-action
lawsuits against German companies over Holocaust-related claims
said that a meeting here Monday night with Hombach had marked the
beginning of a dialogue but that it was premature to say any kind
of agreement was in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   The German government is apparently hopeful that State
Department officials, led by Stuart Eizenstat, the undersecretary
for business and economic affairs, will find a mechanism that will
allow the Holocaust-related claims to be resolved outside the
courtroom. One possibility is a bilateral treaty between the United
States and Germany terminating the claims once the new fund is
established, an issue that Hombach said would be discussed at the
White House on Thursday in a meeting between Schroeder and
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear that a bilateral treaty would completely
protect the German companies. Many of the claims are being brought
on behalf of former forced laborers from countries like Poland, who
would not be affected by any bilateral agreement between the United
States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The talks to reach a settlement are likely to be difficult,
given the competing interests of Jewish groups, plantiffs and
lawyers, some of whom are still haggling over their fees for the
settlement with Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   The German companies have an extraordinary incentive to come to
some kind of settlement, especially now that the introduction of
the euro, the new common European currency, provides an incentive
for them to expand their operations around the world. And no
company has a stronger interest in a settlement than Deutsche Bank,
which acknowledged last week that it had provided much of the
financing for the construction of the Auschwitz death camp.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is attempting to complete an acquisition of
Bankers Trust Co., creating one of the largest financial services
concerns in the world. Deutsche Bank's chairman, Rolf Breuer, held
talks with the World Jewish Congress and other groups here on
Monday, leading Singer to declare that he would not object to the
merger while the talks were under way.
</P>
<P>
   But New York City's comptroller, Alan Hevesi, who was
instrumental in pushing Swiss banks to a settlement after he
organized a threatened boycott of the banks, said he was not yet
ready to step out of the way of the Deutsche Bank combination with
Bankers Trust.

 UNDATED: pilot is.''

   American said it did not know precisely how many passengers or
which areas of the country were most severely affected by the
cancellations. February is normally a light month for travel. The
airline said that it had been able to rebook many affected
passengers on its other flights and that it was also transferring
passengers to competing airlines. The airline is recommending that
passengers check on the status of their flights by calling the
company's toll-free reservation number.
</P>
<P>
   At airports in Chicago, Dallas, Miami and New York, where
American has its biggest operations, passengers appeared to be
suffering irritating delays but were not stranded in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate travel managers, who book airline tickets and make
other travel arrangements for corporate clients, said they were
able to handle the disruption by protectively booking their clients
on another airline in addition to American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's having a limited impact on our customers,'' said Don
Munro, a spokesman for American Express, whose travel agencies had
$19.9 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hit harder were agencies that receive discounts from American in
exchange for steering business to the airline. ``It's been terribly
disruptive,'' said Paul Metselaar, chairman of World Travel
Specialists Group Inc. in New York ``Clients are getting to the
airport and learning that their flight has been canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Metselaar said that double booking by travel agencies was
causing a shortage of seats on some airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between American and the pilots was triggered in
December, after American bought Reno Air, which is based in Nevada,
for $124 million. American said it would take a year to 18 months
to integrate Reno's 25 airplanes and 300 pilots into its operations
because pilots at both carriers needed to be retrained and Reno's
jets needed to be refurbished.
</P>
<P>
   But the union says that American is violating its contract,
which requires all flying at the airline to be done by its members.
The union is demanding that American integrate Reno faster and
begin paying pilots at both carriers as if the merger had been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the dispute are years of mistrust and resentment on the
part of the pilots, who went on strike two years ago but were
ordered back to work within minutes when President Clinton
exercised executive powers to cut off the strike. Many pilots are
still angry that they were denied their right to walk out.
</P>
<P>
   The union says it believes American's real agenda is to keep
Reno as a separate low-cost carrier. Senior pilots at Reno make
about $65,000 a year, less than half of what their counterparts
earn at American.
</P>
<P>
   American has said repeatedly that it intends to integrate the
two airlines and bring Reno pilots up to the salary levels of
pilots at American. ``There is no reason for this dispute to
continue,'' the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts and industry observers agree, and they predict the
two sides will reach an accord. ``My guess is that it will be
resolved in the next couple of days because the financial harm is
disproportionate to the issues at hand,'' Harris of Salomon Smith
Barney said. ``But that assumes that rationality prevails.'' &QL;

REPORT REVEALS WIDER OLYMPIC SCANDAL THAN SUSPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ A quarter of the International Olympic
Committee's members _ far more than had been suspected _ received
improper payoffs or gifts from the Salt Lake bidders before and
after the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games, according to the
organizing committee's ethics panel.
</P>
<P>
   A 300-page report released Tuesday dramatically broadened what
is already the worst scandal in modern Olympic history, revealing
that 21 of the 82 members who voted in 1995 accepted inducements
worth nearly $1 million, ranging from cash to college tuition and
jobs for children to expensive vacation trips.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the members have resigned or will be expelled at next
month's IOC special session at its Swiss headquarters. Three are
already under investigation; one has been formally warned. But the
Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) report provides eight new
names, including:
</P>
<P>
   --Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa, whose wife received a
$30,000 loan with no record of repayment.
</P>
<P>
   --Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, whose son received $5,800 in
travel expenses, $762 in tuition payments, and an internship with a
Salt Lake bank.
</P>
<P>
   --Austin Sealy of Barbados, who received monthly payments of
$3,000 from an agency linked to former US Olympic Committee senior
director Alfredo LaMont.
</P>
<P>
   --Anani Matthia of Togo, Ashwini Kumar of India, and Ram Ruhee
of Mauritius, whose family members had expenses paid to the IOC
meeting in Budapest where the vote was taken.
</P>
<P>
   --Phillip Coles of Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of Guatemala,
whose families were treated to Super Bowl trips.
</P>
<P>
   The report also provides fresh information on two members
already under scrutiny _ Kim Un-Yong, an IOC vice president from
South Korea, and Louis Guirandou N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's son received $100,000 from a job with a Salt Lake
telecommunications company and his daughter received $5,000 for a
piano performance with the Utah Symphony. A Russian woman
recommended by Kim also received $15,000 in tuition to the
University of Utah. N'Diaye's daughter had her expenses paid to the
Budapest meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel also confirmed payoffs made to members who have
already resigned or been forced out. Among them, Jean-Claude Ganga
of the Republic of Congo and his family received more than $250,000
in cash, medical care, travel, and gifts. David Sibandze of
Swaziland received more than $100,000 in tuition for his son at the
University of Utah. The late Rene Essomba of Cameroon received
$60,000 in cash and $108,000 for tuition and expenses for his
daughter at American University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC, which used SLOC documents in its own investigation last
month, will receive the ethics report Wednesday. ``We want to
pursue all improper conduct on the part of IOC members,'' said vice
president Richard Pound of Canada, who chairs the IOC's special
inquiry panel. ``We are determined to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has said that it will expel any members who violated
their oath promising to be above influence. ``We only have that one
sanction _ expulsion,'' said Pound. ``We'll have to make a
distinction between things that are clearly inappropriate and stuff
that is ill-advised and tacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the SLOC panel concluded that top bid committee officials
Tom Welch and Dave Johnson secretly funneled lavish inducements to
IOC members without the trustees' knowledge between 1991 and 1998,
paid nearly quarter of a million dollars to middlemen, and provided
for $30,000 in cash and traveler's checks to be brought to Budapest
on the eve of the vote, it found no evidence of criminal
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will find nothing that says: `My vote is for sale for this
much' or `If I pay you this much, may I have your vote?' '' said
panel member David Jordan. ``It was a long-term vote-influencing
relationship with IOC members. There was an intention to curry
favor with those who had the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the SLOC panel reviewed 50,000 pages of documents over
seven weeks, its report was admittedly incomplete, since it had no
subpoena power and several key officials (notably former chief
administrative officer Craig Peterson and Stephanie Pate, Welch's
secretary) refused to cooperate. ``The people we were not able to
interview were in a position to have a great deal of information,''
Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the ethics panel was able to chronicle the seven-year
campaign in extensive detail, with hundreds of pages of financial
documents, memoranda, faxes, and personal letters between Welch and
IOC members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   After Salt Lake lost the 1998 Games to Nagano, Japan, by four
votes, the bid committee embarked on a well-funded plan to secure
as many votes as it needed for 2002. ``What was not part of the
plan was Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson's direct payments to IOC
members,'' said board chairman Robert Garff, who called them
``disgusting and disguised transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Welch has claimed that the SLOC trustees, including
Utah Governor Mike Leavitt, knew of the vote-influencing scheme,
the panel found that no board members were aware of direct payments
made to IOC members. ``What did I know?,'' said Anita DeFrantz, an
IOC vice president and SLOC board member. ``I know everything you
know right now, today.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Joklik, who chaired both the bidding and organizing
committees and succeeded Welch as chief executive in 1997, insisted
that he was blameless. ``I do not see anything that would cause me
to say I did anything wrong,'' said Joklik, who resigned as CEO
last month but is staying on until a successor is named.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel concluded that Welch and Johnson misled board
members about the payoffs, particularly the use of National Olympic
Committee Assistance funds, it criticized the board for slack
oversight and focusing more on fund raising than monitoring
spending. ``There were many places the system fell down,'' said
Jordan. ``There is plenty of blame to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who resigned two years ago amid charges of spousal abuse,
has been stripped of his pension and $10,000-a-month consultancy
and Johnson resigned last month. The organizing committee,
meanwhile, is being radically reformed. The board will be expanded
Thursday from 33 to 50 members but reduced to advisory status. The
executive committee will be increased from 12 to 20 members and
have stronger control over the $1.45 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   Though the board only Tuesday named an eight-member search
committee for Joklik's successor, SLOC sources reaffirmed that Mitt
Romney, the Belmont, Mass., venture capitalist and former US Senate
candidate, was the top contender and could be named after
Thursday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened here wasn't right, and we are setting it
right,'' Leavitt said Tuesday. ``Let me say again, Olympic
corruption did not start here, but it must end here.''

 &HT;    Browns take 37 lesser-known veterans in expansion draft
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Jim Pyne strode across the stage, shook hands
with team president Carmen Policy, snapped on a Cleveland Browns
ball cap and then pumped his fist at the most famous cheering
section in sports _ the Dawg Pound.
</P>
<P>
   As the former center of the Detroit Lions, Pyne is accustomed to
toiling in obscurity. As the first pick in the Browns expansion
draft on Tuesday at the Canton Civic Center, he was suddenly a
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a glamorous guy,'' Pyne said. ``I guess I am now. I
never expected a standing ovation. I thank 'em for doing it. It's
unbelievable. The last time I got one, I think my mom did it in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs a physical run blocker and that's what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyne's selection set a tone. The Browns want to build an
offensive line that will either protect Kentucky QB Tim Couch or
blow open holes for Texas' Heisman Trophy-winning back Ricky
Williams _ depending on which way the franchise goes with the first
pick in the April 17-18 NFL Draft. ``I couldn't say what we're
going to do,'' said Dwight Clark, director of football operations.
``We're still looking at tapes of the quarterback-running back
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   With the sold-out crowd of 3,908 fans chanting _ ``Here we go,
Browns, here we go!'' _ the Browns used three of their first five
picks on offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   New England tackle Scott Rehberg and San Francisco center Steve
Gordon went third and fifth, sandwiched around Dallas defensive
tackle Hurvin McCormack at No. 2 and Cincinnati wide receiver/kick
returner Damon Gibson at No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're young, we're energetic and we got a good mix,'' said
Policy, who selected 37 players _ 18 offensive and 19 defensive _
in the 3-hour draft. ``I think we covered all bases.''
</P>
<P>
   If the first pick wasn't glamorous, the last one was. The Browns
decided to go out with a bang, grabbing San Francisco 49er
cornerback Antonio Langham _ the Browns' No. 1 draft choice in '94
_ with the final pick.
</P>
<P>
   Langham struggled as a free agent with the 49ers in 1998, but
Policy feels a homecoming will be the player's best medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel he's about to excel at this stage of his career,''
Policy said. ``By coming back to Cleveland, he'll have tremendous
energy. That's why we decided to bring him back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns passed on nearly all the big-salary players _ Langham
($3.08 million) and Pyne ($1.89 million) were the only millionaires
taken _ and went for young, hopefully hungry overachievers.
</P>
<P>
   The position breakdown: Two centers, 10 defensive backs, one
defensive end, three defensive tackles, three guards, five
linebackers, one quarterback, four running backs, four tackles and
four wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Clark called Gibson ``an excellent return man _ the best one in
the expansion draft. He'll be a receiver. We'll see how that
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Browns took Gibson, the Bengals pulled long snapper
Greg Truitt off the board. But Cleveland got another Bengal _
defensive tackle Mike Thompson _ at No. 35. Green Bay fullback
Michael Blair _ another ex-Bengal _ was taken at No. 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns even made the Miami Valley proud, grabbing former
Trotwood-Madison star Duane Butler with the 18th pick. Butler was a
safety and special teams performer who played in the NFC
Championship game for the Minnesota Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's typical of what the Browns did here today,'' said Paul
Wiggin, the Vikings' director of pro personnel. ``They went after
young guys on the rise who are good for building a foundation.
Duane is one of those guys.''

KEEPING THE ARTS IN MIND AND THE MIND ON THE ARTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for GARDNER-ART-EDUCATION)  
 (af)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ (italics)Howard Gardner, a psychologist,
studies the arts, the mind and human development. He spent two
decades working with brain-damaged patients and is a founding
member and has for many years been a director of Project Zero at
Harvard, a research group started in the 1960s by Nelson Goodman,
the philosopher, to study cognition and the arts. Increasingly.
Gardner and Project Zero have become involved with arts education
and school reform. Over the years he has written about children's
drawings and about art education in China. His latest book,
``Creating Minds,'' is a collection of studies of Freud, Picasso
and other figures, but he is probably best known for ``Frames of
Mind,'' which proposed that the human brain is equipped with what
he calls ``multiple intelligences.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL KIMMELMAN. What do you mean, multiple intelligences? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOWARD GARDNER. The claim is that as a species, human beings
have developed over many thousands of years to have a number of
different computers in their mind-brain _ information processing
devices which, so to speak, are predisposed to process certain
kinds of content in certain kinds of ways. I now think there are
eight or nine different intelligences: musical intelligence,
linguistic intelligence and so forth. In relation to visual acuity,
there's spatial intelligence, which is the capacity to appreciate
and navigate open spaces, as a pilot or sailor would do, and also a
more local kind of space, as an architect might deal with in a
schematic drawing. Essentially I'm talking about three-dimensional
versus two-dimensional spaces. Spatial intelligence also entails a
sense within spaces for the existence of underlying structures,
symmetries, essential forms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. If I recall, you have written that all children are born
with certain artistic skills, a kind of basic visual logic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H.G. Most people who study children's graphic growth across
cultures feel there's an inner logic that's being unfolded. If at
an early age you give kids markers and surfaces and time, they will
eventually go through a rather similar progression, at least until
they're 5 or 6. They're really giving you their understanding of
whatever happens to be around them, in a graphic medium.
</P>
<P>
   This idea goes back a long time to somebody nobody knows about,
a man named Henry Schaefer-Simmern. He studied not only normal
adults and kids in Europe, but all kinds of what we might call
pathological populations: people who are retarded or schizophrenic.
And he said that there's something about the human body, the human
visual system and a piece of paper, which induces you to go through
certain steps.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to know whether Nadia went through the
same steps. You remember she was that girl who erupted on the
psychology scene in England during the late 70s. She was autistic,
she couldn't speak, couldn't communicate. And the drawings she did
at 3, 4, 5 years of age blew people's socks off. Then she stopped
doing interesting drawings by 8 or 9, the question being whether
she lost the ability when she began to develop language.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind the association between autism and graphic artistry
was striking. She would draw off the page. Drawing seemed almost to
be like an automatic thing to her, with this incredible motor
facility such that she could draw things as she saw them. You know,
when most kids are young they draw equivalents. They see a big blob
in front of them so they make a circle. The notion that they could
draw what they see retinally, which is never truly circular and
involves foreshortening and so on, is incredible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. But foreshortening and perspective are invented conventions
for depicting three dimensions, they're not actually true to life,
so if Nadia drew in perspective she must have seen examples of it
somewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H.G. She might be the exception that proves the rule, but I
suspect you're right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. The implication of children's art seems to be that there
are certain basic artistic principles that cut across style and
time, which we are born with, then which re-emerge in different
forms in adult artists, a kind of metavisual language. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H.G. I wouldn't put it that strongly. I prefer to talk about
certain tendencies, which are strongly affected by specific models
and practices in different cultures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Well, to ask the question a different way, is there an
implication that all children, being born with some visual ability,
are potential artists?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H.G. Let's get some terms straight. Some people use the word
creativity for anybody who does anything well. Most people in most
societies who work a long time at something can become experts.
Most people who play the piano for 10 years become expert pianists
in the sense that they can sit down and play a Mozart sonata
without a lot of mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   I went to China in the early 1980s and saw kids doing art work
that I didn't think was possible. This was because China had
developed a remarkable system for training children to draw. But
they weren't creative in the sense that they weren't affecting the
practices in a domain or our conception of a domain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A domain is what I call any organized activity in a society
where you can rank people in terms of expertise. You know that
story about T.S. Eliot? Somebody was trying to ingratiate himself
with Eliot and said to him that most editors are failed writers.
Eliot said: ``Yes. So are most writers.'' And so are most painters
failed painters in the sense that they don't affect their domain. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To affect a domain, number one, you've got to want to do it very
much. Anybody who thinks that creativity just sort of happens is
mistaken because when you do things that are different from other
people, you usually get rejected. The second requirement is to
master the history of the domain. You can't go on to do something
new unless you know what's been done before.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A third thing, which is very hard for people to swallow, is that
you need to know about the people of influence in that field. You
need to know who they are and how they operate, and if you don't,
you need to have somebody else who does know. The work somehow has
to be brought to their attention.
</P>
<P>
   People could say, well, if the stuff (italics)had(end italics)
come to the attention of these people, maybe it (italics)would
have(end italics) affected the domain on its own merits. And the
answer is, we can only find that out by bringing it to their
attention. It's like the sound of a tree falling in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   The critical thing in terms of creative impulse seems to be that
when something aberrant or unusual happens _ either in your life or
in your work _ that you don't ignore it. The easiest thing is to
ignore when something strange happens. If I'm a scientist and my
experiment doesn't work out, the easiest thing is to assume that I
made a mistake rather than to become interested in the anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   But the roots of innovation lie in taking seriously and
developing something which nobody else has paid attention to and
which you and the rest of the universe might be inclined to ignore.
You need to have a lot of fortitude to do this because most other
people aren't going to be giving you a lot of positive signals.
It's therefore not surprising to discover that people who end up
making creative breakthroughs also have support from somewhere.
That's another requirement, whether it's support in the form of van
Gogh's brother Theo or the proverbial Jewish mother.
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Speaking of Mozart, the classic prodigy, what is the
difference between creativity and prodigious behavior? I think most
people mistake prodigiousness for, as you put it, affecting a
domain. But in Mozart's case, what we consider to be the music that
defines him as a major figure basically was composed only after he
became a young adult.
</P>
<P>
   H.G. Prodigiousness, whatever else it may be, is to a large
degree socially determined. That is to say, you need to have
standards of accepted achievement _ essentially a society telling
you what happens when, which a prodigious child exceeds. And
prodigiousness has nothing to do with creativity.
</P>
<P>
   To be creative, you have to go against the grain, whereas a
prodigy is somebody who's honored precisely because he does exactly
what society has established as a set of accomplishments. He's a
child who acts like the adults are supposed to act. Picasso, like
Mozart, was a rare case of a prodigy who transformed himself and
became a creator.
</P>
<P>
   M.K. The term prodigy is so vague to me that I wonder whether
you can say Picasso was a prodigy. In fact, I'm unclear about what
makes a visual prodigy in the first place, and even, in your terms,
what is visual creativity. So let me ask, what are the qualities
that differentiate, say, visual intelligence or visual skills from
other kinds of artistic talents?
</P>
<P>
   H.G. I don't think visual artistry has much to do with motoric
abilities. Nor do I think that it's important to have great visual
acuity, although I think visual memory is very important.
Obviously, being able to yoke visual experiences to emotional
experiences in the context of your own culture is very important
and to do that in a way that is distinctive yet not just bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Creativity in the visual arts cuts across intelligences,
certainly. It can involve spatial, bodily and personal
intelligence, meaning that it's about you and other people,
although less directly than, say, being an actor. To be a painter
you've got to spend many, many hours alone every day.
</P>
<P>
   I recently added to my roster what I call naturalist
intelligence, which says that part of our mind-brain is designed to
deal with recognizing plants and animals and making discriminations
among them. Our entire consumer society is based on naturalist
intelligence, having evolved from the need to tell one tree from
another to the need to tell one car from another or one sneaker
from another.
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Are you saying that you think naturalist intelligence
applies to connoisseurship, meaning it applies to the ability to
differentiate among works of art?
</P>
<P>
   H.G. That's an interesting thought. It could well be that people
with promise in the area of naturalist intelligence might be better
able to recognize and classify art, but I'm not talking about
making value judgments, which is a separate issue. I've also
tentatively added a kind of spiritual or what I call existential
intelligence, which causes people to ask the basic questions about
life: Why do we live? Why do we die?
</P>
<P>
   I bring this up because I recently saw the Rothko show at the
Whitney Museum. There have always been experiences in the arts that
I would call spiritual. I think they convey to me what most other
people get from nature. I am by nature an artifice person. I'm
interested in what humans do.
</P>
<P>
   M.K. What's spiritual, then, has to do with making you feel
outside yourself but not necessarily feel something in a religious
sense.
</P>
<P>
   H.G. I agree with Mahler. You know that story about the
conductor Bruno Walter going to visit Mahler in the Alps at the
turn of the century? Walter told him that he thought the landscape
was magnificent and Mahler said, ``Don't worry, it's all in my
Third Symphony.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You go, girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get bogged down in your usual dilly-dallying,
shilly-shallying thing.
</P>
<P>
   Dump the guy, Janet. He's a loser.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, he's a stalker.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he didn't do rope lines, but Kenneth Starr is more
creepily obsessed with tracking and trapping Bill Clinton than
Monica ever was.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Reno has been stewing about all the independent
persecutor's transgressions: how his team manhandled Monica at the
mall, how his office leaked and leaked, how Starr steamrolled the
attorney general into expanding his authority into the Lewinsky
affair without revealing his office's contacts with Paula Jones'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the president thinks the prosecutor is evil, he is
loath to play Nixon to Starr's Cox.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came out that Starr was calculating how he could
indict Clinton on criminal charges while he is still in office, or
the day he leaves for Hollywood, the Clinton crowd realized that a
wooden stake might be required.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Starr's shy smile lurks the heart of the undead.
</P>
<P>
   He comes back and back and back for more blood _ from Web
Hubbell, from Susan McDougal, from Julie Hiatt Steele, from Bill
Clinton. Maybe poor Sidney Blumenthal is next. (Only Starr could
inspire ``poor'' before ``Sidney Blumenthal.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Buffy, Janet is all we've got. She has been
fantasizing about slaying the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are oodles of reasons to can him. He wasted a
federal fortune investigating all the serious issues _ Whitewater,
Travelgate, File-gate _ that could have entailed the kind of public
misconduct that Americans care about. He found nothing, and instead
came up with a sizzling impeachment potboiler.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reports on Wednesday that Justice Department
officials are starting to build a case against the man who built
the case against their boss. David Johnston and Don Van Natta
reveal that Starr's deputies assured Reno's department that they
had not had any contact with the Paula Jones lawyers when they
sought to expand their investigation into the president's affair
with the intern. Based on contemporaneous notes of that crucial
meeting in January 1998, it appears that the Office of Independent
Counsel misled the Justice Department, since Linda Tripp's fateful
call to Starr's office was preceded by a conversation between one
of Starr's deputies and a lawyer who had worked on the Jones case
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem that Janet Reno is out to help the president, but
really she may be rescuing the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans may not care about Starr's ethics. But they
should care about his incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is supposed to be the party of big business. If Starr
were a CEO, the stockholders would be clamoring for his head. He
tried a hostile takeover and lost. And the company's stock has been
plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite public disdain for impeachment, Starr still managed to
sell the House managers a weak case. The fact that the managers'
case is entirely built on Starr's tainted enterprise is why it's
impossible for reasonable people to accept their arguments, even
though most reasonable people believe the president lied and
schemed to hide evidence.
</P>
<P>
   After the House Republicans bullied the impeachment into the
Senate, they were again led astray by Starr, who went to court to
help them drag Monica back from California. Any idiot should have
known that on the stand, Monica would try to protect the president,
not bury him. She may have ``mixed emotions'' about her former
boyfriend, but she hates Ken Starr with a passion.
</P>
<P>
   When things got rough for the Republicans, the independent
counsel, with his tin ear for public relations, made them worse:
Word got out of his musings about indicting the president while
still in office.
</P>
<P>
   People used to trust the Republicans to be practical. As Calvin
Coolidge put it, ``The chief business of the American people is
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Starr, with destructive cheerleading from the Christian
right, helped turn Republicans into a party of scolds brandishing
scarlet letters. Their new motto is more ominous: ``Your business
is our business.''
</P>
<P>
   So fire him, Janet, fire him. His business is our business.

SUSPECT IN FRATERNITY KILLING IS FOUND DEAD IN EAST TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ A Lockhart man suspected in the beating
death of a Southwest Texas State University fraternity pledge after
a weekend party was found dead Tuesday afternoon in Van Zandt
County in East Texas, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   San Marcos Police Chief Steve Griffith said Jeremiah Marshal
Wilkerson, 21, apparently committed suicide. Wilkerson's family was
contacted later by Van Zandt County authorities, Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of Wilkerson's body came just hours after San
Marcos police said they were seeking a capital murder warrant for
his arrest in the death of Nicholas George Armstrong, 21, who was
bludgeoned while sleeping on the couch at a fraternity house in the
Central Texas college town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret that this terrible tragedy has profoundly touched
the lives of two families and at least two communities,'' Griffith
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said San Marcos police are still seeking information about a
second person who was at the fraternity house that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe Wilkerson was at that residence that night,''
Griffith said. ``We are still investigating the circumstances
surrounding the killing and whether that other individual might be
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson and three others began fighting with fraternity
members Saturday night when they were escorted out of the
organization's bid night party, Griffith said. Police do not
believe that Armstrong was involved in that disturbance, the chief
said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith said that the four men were irate at being removed from
the party, and that one or more of them apparently returned later,
found Armstrong asleep on a couch, and at least one of them beat
Armstrong with a metal object similar to a tire iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being asleep on that couch was just a matter of being in the
wrong place at the wrong time,'' Griffith said. ``As far as we
know, Armstrong had no beef with these four people.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wilkerson, a former Southwest Texas student, worked
in the Austin area and might have fled to Terrell in East Texas,
where he had friends.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Armstrong, a graduate of Ross S. Sterling High
School in Baytown, and the alcohol poisoning of Aaron James
Durante, 18, of Fort Worth after a party at a Kappa Sigma
fraternity house, rocked the university, which has tried to move
away from its reputation as a party school.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the university suspended all 12 fraternities that
were having parties to celebrate their new pledge classes.
</P>
<P>
   Durante, whom friends took to Central Texas Medical Center in
San Marcos on Saturday night, was recovering at home Tuesday, said
Hays County Sheriff's Department spokesman Allen Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Durante's blood-alcohol content was .508, Bridges said. The
legal driving limit in Texas is .10. Durante was released from the
hospital Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials are investigating the Kappa Sigma party,
which led to six alcohol-related arrests.
</P>
<P>
   John Garrison, assistant vice president and dean of students,
said Southwest Texas State suspended the fraternities because of
the two incidents and problems at other parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year we have had problems with underage drinking and
drinking to excess, but these are the most serious incidents we've
ever had,'' Garrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the TKE house a block from the campus, the aftermath of
Saturday night's party was evident Tuesday. Garbage cans, trash and
beer cans were piled along the curb. Several cars were parked in
the rear of the house, but no fraternity members could be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Martin, 30, a Southwest Texas State senior, said he
doesn't believe that the drinking problem at Southwest Texas State
is any worse than that at other Texas schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Waco, and believe me, I've been to my share of
keggers at that Baptist university they call Baylor,'' Martin said.
``Quite honestly, the parties I've been to at UT are a lot wilder
than the ones here. I know we have a reputation as a party school,
but it doesn't seem much different than when I was in high
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is not a fraternity member, said members of the
Greek organizations are not the only ones who consume alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody parties around here if they have an excuse,'' he
said. ``If you go in any apartment complex around here, you'll find
people drinking. I'm not a big fan of frats, but I think they may
be getting a bum rap on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   University officials said preliminary reports indicate that the
TKE house was following university guidelines during the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have shut down the party a little late, but our
monitors didn't see any signs of underage drinking,'' Garrison
said. ``As of right now, we don't know of any possible violations,
but we haven't seen the police report and our internal
investigation is just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The current suspension does not affect sororities or the
university's three African-American fraternities, which do not have
houses and weren't hosting parties Saturday night.
</P>

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Salt Lake City Olympic officials showered
Olympic delegates with cash payments and an array of gifts that
ranged from free trips to the Super Bowl to door knobs and
furniture, according to a voluminous report released Tuesday on the
city's effort to win the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The report by an ethics panel working for the Salt Lake Olympic
Organizing Committee provides the most detailed account to date of
the city's desperate campaign to win the Games. It asserts that a
fifth of the International Olympic Committee delegates received one
form or another of improper benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The report implicated an additional 10 members of the
International Olympic Committee in accepting improper college
tuition for family members and other gratuities. Fourteen Olympic
delegates have already been tied to the widening scandal, six of
whom have already been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on evidence gleaned from interviews with some
participants and 50,000 pages of internal documents, the panel
detailed the frantic, fawning extent to which the bid committee
went to secure votes.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, two members of the bid committee flew to
Washington, D.C., to help the daughter of an IOC member from
Cameroon move her furniture to a new apartment. In another, Tom
Welch, president of the bid committee. withdrew $30,000 from his
daughters' college trust fund to make a loan, later repaid, to the
wife of the IOC member from Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel report disclosed that the U.S. Olympic
Committee worked shoulder-to-shoulder with local Olympic officials,
assisting on a training program for Sudanese athletes that was
described in internal e-mail as a payback for Sudan's vote. The
assistance was in a gray area between ethical and unethical, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the ethics panel said they found no evidence that
laws were broken by the committee, saying the violations were
ethical, not criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The report laid much of the blame for ethical violations on two
top officials of the Salt Lake City bid committee, Welch and Dave
Johnson, saying they set up a variety of deceptive schemes to
funnel benefits to IOC members and their relatives. Welch and
Johnson have denied any wrongdoing and have said that the bid
committee's practices were open, not hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The report asserted that the board of trustees of the bid
committee was not aware of direct payments to IOC members. But it
said board members were aware of lavish gifts and that there should
have been stricter oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schaffer, the attorney for Welch, said that his client and
Johnson were simply ``doing what they had to do'' in a bidding
system that ``stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It validated what we've been saying all along, that the
process the bid committee undertook was to market the city, not buy
votes,'' Schaffer said of Tuesday's report.
</P>
<P>
   Max Wheeler, the attorney for Johnson, said that his client was
simply implementing procedures set by others and that ``if an
effort had been made to conceal actions, how do you explain the
volume of documents available to the committee? Policies were
implemented, records were kept, reports were made. End of story.''
</P>
<P>
   While the report was the size of the Salt Lake City white pages,
the five-member ethics panel said it was not complete because the
panel lacked subpoena power and the ability to scour bank records,
and at least two important members of the bid committee declined to
testify. Also, record keeping by the bid committee was so
insufficient in some instances that investigators were unable to
tell how much of nearly $1 million in air fare costs for IOC
members was spent legitimately.
</P>
<P>
   The global investigation of the Olympics began here when a local
television station reported last November that a daughter of an IOC
member from Cameroon had received college tuition from the Salt
Lake City committee. That story unleashed a cascade of disclosures
from cities around the world that had competed for the Olympics.
Utah's attorney general, the International Olympic Committee, the
U.S. Olympic Committee, and the Justice Department all began their
own inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report will further embarrass the IOC, which is
already reeling from its largest corruption scandal, and could lead
to more expulsions of delegates, including a member from South
Korea who is considered a possible successor as president to Juan
Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four members _ a full 20 percent of the 114 delegates who
were serving before the scandal broke _ have now been linked to
ethical misconduct involving the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disgusted about these members,'' said Anita DeFrantz,
an IOC vice president from Los Angeles. ``This is not what we
expect. This is not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also portrayed an eager willingness by IOC members to
flaunt guidelines that prohibit them from accepting gifts valued at
more than $150 and from making more than one three-day visit to
evaluate cities seeking the Games.
</P>
<P>
   No gift or favor appeared to be too big or small for the bid
committee to provide to IOC members. On various shopping trips,
according to the report, the committee spent $268 on lawn
equipment, $524 on a violin, $673 on doorknobs, $1,010 on dogs,
$1,488 on bathroom fixtures, $1,282 on mattresses and bedding,
$3,117 on draperies and hardware and $6,934 on the purchase and
shipping of letterhead stationary for an unidentified national
Olympic committee. The committee also took IOC members and their
families on trips to Las Vegas, Yellowstone Park, Disneyland,
Niagara Falls and the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Welch hosted a trip to Florida for the Super Bowl for IOC
members Philip Coles of Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of
Guatemala that cost $19,991 for the members and their families; the
members did not even make an effort to check out Olympic
preparations in Salt Lake City, the report said. Coles and
Kaltschmitt had not previously been implicated.
</P>
<P>
   The bid committee also paid for a holiday vacation for the
family of IOC member Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, putting the family
up in a Park City, Utah, condominium for two weeks at a cost of
$10,000, the report said. Arroyo has been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Special mention in the report was made of Jean-Claude Ganga, the
expelled IOC member from Congo Republic, who received more than
$200,000 in cash payments and medical treatment from the bid
committee. Tuesday's report said that Ganga's wife, Eugenie, loved
to shop at Wal-Mart, purchased carpets, rugs, draperies and other
items at the bid committee's expense and ran up the credit card of
one bid member ``to the maximum.''

 SALT LAKE CITY: the maximum.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Welch and Ganga also entered a joint investing agreement
and Johnson carried large amounts of cash to be deposited in
Ganga's personal bank account in Salt Lake City, the report said,
the bid committee also helped the Ganga's plan the decor for their
new kitchen and one member arranged for the purchase of Ganga's
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also apparently spent more than $27,000 in flying
families of IOC members to Budapest, Hungary, where Salt Lake City
was awarded the 2002 Winter Games on July 16, 1995, the report
said. Included were IOC members such as Anani Matthia of Togo,
Ashwini Kumar of India and Ram Ruhee of Mauritius whose names have
not previously been linked to receiving benefits from Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   Other IOC members implicated Tuesday but not in a previous IOC
report were Maj. Gen. Henry Olufemi Adefope of Nigeria, Austin
Sealy of Barbados, Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, Mohamed Zerguini
of Algeria and Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report was particularly critical of Welch and Johnson
for making direct payments to IOC members or their relatives under
the guise of scholarship programs and training assistance to
various national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the scholarship money was paid to legitimate students,
the report said. Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake City
organizing committee, called other disguised payments ``disgusting
and disturbing'' and said they were made without supporting
documents or the approval or knowledge of the committee's board of
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson were accused of using phony contracts to hide
payments by the bid committee to the son of Kim Un Yong, a powerful
IOC member from South Korea, and to the husband of Pirjo Haggman,
an IOC member from Finland who has since resigned. The bid
committee also apparently arranged for Kim's daughter to perform
with the Utah Symphony, for which she was paid $5,000, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Kim, a member of the IOC executive board and a possible
successor to Samaranch, is expelled, he would be the
highest-ranking member of the IOC to fall in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz said that the ``documents make a very strong case of an
IOC member stepping across the line,'' but she pointed out that
Kim's attorneys had written to the ethics panel denying knowledge
that his son had been paid $75,000 by the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Included in ostensible scholarship payments, the report said,
was $23,000 for Arroyo's daughter, which Welch justified by saying
she was divorced and having personal problems. Welch has said she
attended school in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in cash payments by the bid committee, the report
said, was $7,000 sent to Zema Gadir, who supposedly was the
daughter of Gen. Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, an IOC member
from the Sudan. The request was made of the bid committee through a
consultant who provided access to Gadir. But, as it turns out, Zema
Gadir is a pseudonym used by the IOC delegate, who has been
expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened here wasn't right, so we're setting it
right,'' said Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. ``Olympic corruption didn't
start here, but it must end here.''

   SALT LAKE CITY _ Salt Lake City Olympic officials showered
Olympic delegates with cash payments and an array of gifts that
ranged from free trips to the Super Bowl to door knobs and
furniture, according to a voluminous report released Tuesday on the
city's effort to win the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The report by an ethics panel working for the Salt Lake Olympic
Organizing Committee provides the most detailed account to date of
the city's desperate campaign to win the Games. It asserts that a
fifth of the International Olympic Committee delegates received one
form or another of improper benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The report implicated an additional 10 members of the
International Olympic Committee in accepting improper college
tuition for family members and other gratuities. Fourteen Olympic
delegates have already been tied to the widening scandal, six of
whom have already been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on evidence gleaned from interviews with some
participants and 50,000 pages of internal documents, the panel
detailed the frantic, fawning extent to which the bid committee
went to secure votes.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, two members of the bid committee flew to
Washington, D.C., to help the daughter of an IOC member from
Cameroon move her furniture to a new apartment. In another, Tom
Welch, president of the bid committee. withdrew $30,000 from his
daughters' college trust fund to make a loan, later repaid, to the
wife of the IOC member from Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel report disclosed that the U.S. Olympic
Committee worked shoulder-to-shoulder with local Olympic officials,
assisting on a training program for Sudanese athletes that was
described in internal e-mail as a payback for Sudan's vote. The
assistance was in a gray area between ethical and unethical, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the ethics panel said they found no evidence that
laws were broken by the committee, saying the violations were
ethical, not criminal.
</P>
<P>
   The report laid much of the blame for ethical violations on two
top officials of the Salt Lake City bid committee, Welch and Dave
Johnson, saying they set up a variety of deceptive schemes to
funnel benefits to IOC members and their relatives. Welch and
Johnson have denied any wrongdoing and have said that the bid
committee's practices were open, not hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The report asserted that the board of trustees of the bid
committee was not aware of direct payments to IOC members. But it
said board members were aware of lavish gifts and that there should
have been stricter oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schaffer, the attorney for Welch, said that his client and
Johnson were simply ``doing what they had to do'' in a bidding
system that ``stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It validated what we've been saying all along, that the
process the bid committee undertook was to market the city, not buy
votes,'' Schaffer said of Tuesday's report.
</P>
<P>
   Max Wheeler, the attorney for Johnson, said that his client was
simply implementing procedures set by others and that ``if an
effort had been made to conceal actions, how do you explain the
volume of documents available to the committee? Policies were
implemented, records were kept, reports were made. End of story.''
</P>
<P>
   While the report was the size of the Salt Lake City white pages,
the five-member ethics panel said it was not complete because the
panel lacked subpoena power and the ability to scour bank records,
and at least two important members of the bid committee declined to
testify. Also, record keeping by the bid committee was so
insufficient in some instances that investigators were unable to
tell how much of nearly $1 million in air fare costs for IOC
members was spent legitimately.
</P>
<P>
   The global investigation of the Olympics began here when a local
television station reported last November that a daughter of an IOC
member from Cameroon had received college tuition from the Salt
Lake City committee. That story unleashed a cascade of disclosures
from cities around the world that had competed for the Olympics.
Utah's attorney general, the International Olympic Committee, the
U.S. Olympic Committee, and the Justice Department all began their
own inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report will further embarrass the IOC, which is
already reeling from its largest corruption scandal, and could lead
to more expulsions of delegates, including a member from South
Korea who is considered a possible successor as president to Juan
Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four members _ a full 20 percent of the 114 delegates who
were serving before the scandal broke _ have now been linked to
ethical misconduct involving the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disgusted about these members,'' said Anita DeFrantz,
an IOC vice president from Los Angeles. ``This is not what we
expect. This is not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also portrayed an eager willingness by IOC members to
flaunt guidelines that prohibit them from accepting gifts valued at
more than $150 and from making more than one three-day visit to
evaluate cities seeking the Games.
</P>
<P>
   No gift or favor appeared to be too big or small for the bid
committee to provide to IOC members. On various shopping trips,
according to the report, the committee spent $268 on lawn
equipment, $524 on a violin, $673 on doorknobs, $1,010 on dogs,
$1,488 on bathroom fixtures, $1,282 on mattresses and bedding,
$3,117 on draperies and hardware and $6,934 on the purchase and
shipping of letterhead stationary for an unidentified national
Olympic committee. The committee also took IOC members and their
families on trips to Las Vegas, Yellowstone Park, Disneyland,
Niagara Falls and the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Welch hosted a trip to Florida for the Super Bowl for IOC
members Philip Coles of Australia and Willi Kaltschmitt of
Guatemala that cost $19,991 for the members and their families; the
members did not even make an effort to check out Olympic
preparations in Salt Lake City, the report said. Coles and
Kaltschmitt had not previously been implicated.
</P>
<P>
   The bid committee also paid for a holiday vacation for the
family of IOC member Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, putting the family
up in a Park City, Utah, condominium for two weeks at a cost of
$10,000, the report said. Arroyo has been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Special mention in the report was made of Jean-Claude Ganga, the
expelled IOC member from Congo Republic, who received more than
$200,000 in cash payments and medical treatment from the bid
committee. Tuesday's report said that Ganga's wife, Eugenie, loved
to shop at Wal-Mart, purchased carpets, rugs, draperies and other
items at the bid committee's expense and ran up the credit card of
one bid member ``to the maximum.''

DARTMOUTH FRATERNITIES TO ADMIT WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dartmouth College, which helped inspire the drunken and
debauched antics in the movie ``Animal House,'' announced Tuesday
that its storied fraternities would begin admitting women next
fall, the first step toward what is likely to be the complete
transformation of the Greek system on campus.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees and college president James Wright said in a letter
announcing the decision that it was aimed at encouraging
``respectful relations between women and men,'' and assuring
``opportunities to meet and learn from, as well as develop enduring
friendships with, others who have different backgrounds,
experiences, and expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fraternities and sororities as we have known them will be
ended,'' said Wright, who became president in the fall after 30
years on campus as a professor and provost.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sense . . . that we needed to take
significant steps, and this is a piece of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Heightened concerns about fraternities came out of concerns
about drinking and hazing _ problems hardly limited to Dartmouth.
Trying to cut down on binge drinking and abusive behavior, many
formerly single-sex colleges, including Colby, Williams, and
Bowdoin, have eliminated fraternities altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere had fraternity traditions been so closely guarded by
alumni and students, so widely renowned and associated with campus
life, as at Dartmouth. One of the co-writers of the 1978 movie
``Animal House,'' Chris Miller, was a member of Alpha Delta at
Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Fraternities &UR;  &LR; have been a flashpoint in a heated gender war at
Dartmouth. Challenging them as emblems of a male-dominated campus,
female students in the 1980s tried in vain to rush the
fraternities. And as the second-last of the Ivy League to admit
women, Dartmouth suffered a reputation as a school for conservative
white males even after co-education arrived in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just not an accurate representation of Dartmouth,''
Wright said. ``This is not aiming at altering a public image as
much as it is to enhance what we have here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after the introduction of women and sororities on campus,
the fraternities have held on to the best houses on campus, and
occupied the orbital center of its social universe.
</P>
<P>
   Integrating fraternities and sororities, to take effect in the
fall, was aimed at opening up that social life. But Wright, like
many students, agreed that it would not happen without complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greek system is strong here. There are many people, both
at the college and alumni, who loved it and who are going to object
to any change,'' said Jacob Elberg, the editor of The Dartmouth,
the nation's oldest student newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Elberg said, ``There are also those, both
inside and especially outside the Greek system, that believe there
needs to be significant change to the way things are at
Dartmouth.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Wright and the trustees, many of them former
fraternity members, was made known to students Tuesday in a letter
announcing an effort to enhance social and residential life.
</P>
<P>
   Out of five principles to guide that enhancement, making
residences co-educational was number three _ buried so deep,
students said, that many did not realize what it meant for the
Greek system.
</P>
<P>
   While he acknowledged that the move on fraternities would
generate the most heated response, Wright also emphasized that it
was part of a larger plan that includes greater choice in housing,
moving off-campus students back on campus, and ``eliminating''
abuse or unsafe use of alcohol. Wright also said a significant
investment to improve housing is planned.
</P>
<P>
   The principles the trustees announced would not be open to
debate, Wright said, but what is to become of the co-ed Greek
system is.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the college has established a new Website to allow
far-flung alumni to suggest ways to improve campus life.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to the Greek system, Wright said, ``will depend
on discussions with students and with others. The trustees are
looking for some imaginative new initiatives.''

 SALT LAKE CITY: the maximum.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Welch and Ganga also entered a joint investing agreement
and Johnson carried large amounts of cash to be deposited in
Ganga's personal bank account in Salt Lake City, the report said,
the bid committee also helped the Ganga's plan the decor for their
new kitchen and one member arranged for the purchase of Ganga's
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also apparently spent more than $27,000 in flying
families of IOC members to Budapest, Hungary, where Salt Lake City
was awarded the 2002 Winter Games on July 16, 1995, the report
said. Included were IOC members such as Anani Matthia of Togo,
Ashwini Kumar of India and Ram Ruhee of Mauritius whose names have
not previously been linked to receiving benefits from Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   Other IOC members implicated Tuesday but not in a previous IOC
report were Maj. Gen. Henry Olufemi Adefope of Nigeria, Austin
Sealy of Barbados, Shagdarjav Magvan of Mongolia, Mohamed Zerguini
of Algeria and Seiuli Paul Wallwork of Western Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report was particularly critical of Welch and Johnson
for making direct payments to IOC members or their relatives under
the guise of scholarship programs and training assistance to
various national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the scholarship money was paid to legitimate students,
the report said. Robert Garff, chairman of the Salt Lake City
organizing committee, called other disguised payments ``disgusting
and disturbing'' and said they were made without supporting
documents or the approval or knowledge of the committee's board of
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Welch and Johnson were accused of using phony contracts to hide
payments by the bid committee to the son of Kim Un Yong, a powerful
IOC member from South Korea, and to the husband of Pirjo Haggman,
an IOC member from Finland who has since resigned. The bid
committee also apparently arranged for Kim's daughter to perform
with the Utah Symphony, for which she was paid $5,000, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Kim, a member of the IOC executive board and a possible
successor to Samaranch, is expelled, he would be the
highest-ranking member of the IOC to fall in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz said that the ``documents make a very strong case of an
IOC member stepping across the line,'' but she pointed out that
Kim's attorneys had written to the ethics panel denying knowledge
that his son had been paid $75,000 by the bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   Included in ostensible scholarship payments, the report said,
was $23,000 for Arroyo's daughter, which Welch justified by saying
she was divorced and having personal problems. Welch has said she
attended school in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in cash payments by the bid committee, the report
said, was $7,000 sent to Zema Gadir, who supposedly was the
daughter of Gen. Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, an IOC member
from the Sudan. The request was made of the bid committee through a
consultant who provided access to Gadir. But, as it turns out, Zema
Gadir is a pseudonym used by the IOC delegate, who has been
expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened here wasn't right, so we're setting it
right,'' said Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. ``Olympic corruption didn't
start here, but it must end here.''

DOUBTS ABOUT N.Y. PROSECUTORS PROMPT CALLS FOR U.S. ROLE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Behind the many calls for federal involvement in last
week's police killing of a West African immigrant is the concern
that Bronx prosecutors may have difficulty winning a case against
the officers.
</P>
<P>
   There is some history that may help to explain the concerns: in
1996, the Bronx district attorney's office failed to win a
conviction in a major police brutality prosecution, when Francis
Livoti was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in the death
of Anthony Baez, who died in 1994 after a confrontation with the
officer that began over a street football game.
</P>
<P>
   After that state acquittal, federal prosecutors opened a federal
civil rights investigation and won a conviction of Livoti, who was
sentenced to 7{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Any state attempt to prosecute the officers for last week's
shooting would be also fraught with legal challenges. Under state
law, police officers can use deadly force if they reasonably
believe they face the threat or imminent threat of deadly force
themselves. In the case last week, the lawyers for the police have
argued that the officers had reason to believe that the victim,
Amadou Diallo, might have been pulling a weapon on them. He was
killed in a 41-shot barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shot him. The killed him. They feel very bad about
that,'' Stephen Worth, their lawyer, said of the officers. ``That
doesn't mean they committed a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In several cases where officers' perceptions of danger have been
an issue, state prosecutors have failed to bring charges against
officers involved in shootings of unarmed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Day 1997, for instance, Officer Michael Davitt shot
an unarmed man, William Whitfield, in a confrontation at a
Canarsie, Brooklyn, grocery store. Police officials said that the
officers on the scene, believing that Whitfield was behaving
suspiciously, ordered him to halt and then, guns drawn, followed
him when he dashed into a grocery store and seemed to hide.
</P>
<P>
   They said Davitt fired the fatal shot when Whitfield suddenly
emerged, rising from a crouch. A state grand jury refused to bring
charges, finding the shooting justified under the laws governing
use of force. Federal prosecutors looked into the case, but did not
bring charges. Michael Hardy, a lawyer for the Whitfield family,
said that although no federal charges were filed, the review had
been useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about the federal government is that they don't have
the conflict of interest with the New York City police,'' Hardy
said. ``They have demonstrated some commitment to bringing police
up on charges and prosecuting them if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors often have more leeway in pursuing civil
rights charges in such shootings. Federal rules of evidence are
more liberal in some cases than in the state courts. Under the
federal civil rights laws, the government does not have to prove
that an officer caused a victim's death, only that the officer's
acts resulted in bodily injury.
</P>
<P>
   One argument for having federal officials prosecute the latest
shooting is that state prosecutors are not as well equipped to
handle such cases. During the federal trial of Livoti, federal
prosecutors raised some questions about how the Bronx district
attorney's office handled some witness interviews: for instance,
when it allowed police officers to meet in a group and discuss the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, who is a former member of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
commission on police-citizen relations, said Tuesday that many
critics were underestimating Johnson's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they didn't successfully prosecute was Livoti,'' he said.
``So the Livoti case sticks in everyone's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who defended Livoti, Stuart London, is working with
Worth on behalf of the officers in the current investigation.
London said he believed that the fairest result would be for the
grand jury investigating Diallo's death to conclude that the four
officers reasonably believed that they were in fear for their
lives, based on the suspicious behavior they perceived, and to
spare them from criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the grand jury could suggest procedures to be
followed in the future.

SPORTS COLUMN: GREED KNOWS FEW BOUNDS IN OLYMPICS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My Uncle Harry had come from Russia and he couldn't read or
write English. That didn't stop him from ordering from a menu in a
restaurant in America. I was with him when a waitress handed him a
menu and he handed it back. ``Give me anything,'' he said. ``I got
money.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought of Uncle Harry when I learned about the activities of
the Salt Lake City Olympic bid committee, which had two of its top
officials condemned Tuesday in a report by an internal ethics
panel. These officials _ and, the guess here is, numerous others _
were guilty of essentially bribing the International Olympic
Committee to get the 2002 Winter Games to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I know, Uncle Harry was clean as the driven snow _ he
worked as a peddler with an asthmatic horse _ but what the Salt
Lake City committee did was the reverse of Uncle Harry and the menu
business. ``We'll give you anything,'' they apparently said. ``We
got money.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by the ethics investigators quoted witnesses as
saying that Nagano, Japan, had beaten Salt Lake City for the 1998
Games with a ``more sophisticated and extravagant'' effort, giving
IOC members video cameras while Salt Lake was glad-handing them
with disposable cameras. And Salt Lake City was edged out in the
1991 vote. What were the other contenders offering, Brownie
cameras?
</P>
<P>
   But this was, to use a wintry metaphor, simply the tip of the
iceberg. The ethics panel found that Jean-Claude Ganga, for one,
the IOC member from the Congo Republic who has been suspended from
the IOC, and members of his family received more than $250,000 in
goods and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   A similar report last month by the IOC said that $800,000 in
cash payments, scholarships, medical care and travel expenses were
paid to 14 I.O.C. members. So far, nine have been expelled or
resigned. More expulsions are anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga had excused his activities by saying that he pocketed none
of that loose change but used the money to develop athletes in his
country. That is about as believable as only Tom Welch, the
president of the bid committee, and his top lieutenant, Dave
Johnson, knowing what was going on under the table.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly people from foreign countries who happened to be
related to IOC members, who vote for host cities, were popping up
with plum jobs and college admissions in Utah and environs.
</P>
<P>
   It had become clear to Johnson and Welch, presumably, that they
had to fight fire with fire, or gifts with ever more lavish gifts.
Certainly. There are no free lunches. You get what you pay for. And
so on. But also, it's business as usual, and if you get caught,
someone's got to be the fall guy. Enter Welch and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Money is being thrown around like crazy, doors are opening that
are normally closed, IOC big shots from various countries who used
to have one video camera now have an armful, and nobody knows how
it happened. They weren't in the neighborhood. They were visiting
relatives. Their phone was off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah said that, yes, he had met 50 IOC
members and their families, posed for photographs (he did not
mention the type of cameras) and gave obligatory gifts of diplomacy
(``obligatory'' has now become my favorite word). But, he said: ``I
did not ever personally see a gift of great value. I was doing
everything I could to be charming.'' But weren't Johnson and Welch
doing the same?
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, and the bulk of politicians and business people in Utah
and members of the United States Olympic Committee, contend they
saw no evil. I have no evidence to the contrary. It sounds similar,
however, to presidents of universities and head coaches not knowing
anything, or not wanting to know, about boosters who stuff cash in
the sneakers of star performers.
</P>
<P>
   If the IOC, that phony, supercilious entity that answers to no
one, was not corrupt, potential Olympic cities would not be able to
get dirty with its members. But greed knows few bounds, and these
games within the Games are singularly gamy. ``This is an ethical
dilemma,'' said Beth Wilkinson, a lawyer for the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, but she added that there was no evidence of
criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   At family affairs, Uncle Harry used to do the kazachok, a
Russian dance in which you kick out your legs from a crouched
position. Harry boasted that he could do it with a glass of wine on
his head and not spill it. Well, maybe the wine didn't spill in
Russia. But it was an honest endeavor. And Harry looked better with
wine on his eyeglasses than all these Olympic hypocrites do with
egg on their faces.

A PLAYGROUND FOR TECHNOLOGHY'S ARTS OF ILLUSION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARLSRUHE, Germany _ Art museums are tangible links to history,
filled with stone and canvas dossiers attesting that human
aspiration and conflict were as compelling in Titian's and
Hokusai's time as in our own.
</P>
<P>
   As the traditional notion of reality fractures, and it becomes
possible to imagine living in a culture that is largely illusion,
the museum might be a bulwark against the loss of both past
(italics)and(end italics) present, or so says Hans-Peter Schwarz,
director of the ZKM/Center for Art and Media here.
</P>
<P>
   In a book called ``Media/Art/History'' (Prestel), he writes: ``A
museum must always remain that impressive place where one can
assure oneself of one's own reality and of the material reality of
the historical and artistic evidence of history. It is perhaps the
museum that can provide one of the last refuges for the sensual
scrutiny of reality, particularly in this age of total
simulations.''
</P>
<P>
   This might be considered an odd viewpoint for a man who heads
the first and biggest museum of media art anywhere, a museum
dedicated to simulation, hybrid arts and confounded perception. Yet
even the Media Museum may come to seem like a bastion of
old-fashioned direct reality if such visionary notions as ``neural
museums'' implanted on chips in visitors' neck muscles are someday
carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The Media Museum is one part of the Center for Art and Media
Technology (Zentrum fur Kunst und Medientechnologie), an
institution that has no exact parallel in the world and not even a
recognizable echo in America.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989 and opened to the public in October 1997, the
ZKM has more than 48,000 square yards of usable space. It houses,
in addition to the museum, an Institute for Visual Media, an
Institute of Media and Acoustics, a media library, a media theater,
a Museum for Contemporary Art and, under different direction, the
State Academy of Design and the Municipal Gallery of the City of
Karlsruhe.
</P>
<P>
   Today's world is already a media-scape, with television
following travelers onto planes, fashion shows on monitors in
department stores, buildings flashing news and advertisements, and
sports contests, rock concerts and political events reproducing
themselves in real time on large screens for the benefit of those
attending in person.
</P>
<P>
   Artists have been trying to come to terms with the newer
technologies since the early 1960s, when Nam June Paik compressed a
television signal to a thin line on the screen and called it ``Zen
TV.'' The techniques of electronic art were largely pioneered by
science and engineering museums years before art museums were
interested, but by now most good-size art museums have at least
exhibited individual pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the media artist Bill Viola represented the United
States at the Venice Biennale, and Gary Hill's interactive
installation took the main prize there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, collections and permanent displays are prohibitively
expensive and require huge spaces, and most such art is seen
principally at technology fairs and congresses. Enter the ZKM and
its few smaller peers, chiefly the Ars Electronica Center in Linz,
Austria, which opened in 1996, and the InterCommunication Center in
Tokyo, open since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the Media Museum is like roaming an electronic theme
park, a futuristic playground for grown-ups where miniature
theaters, videos and oversize images morph, dance, respond to
questions and urge visitors along on fictive journeys. Theme parks,
incidentally, have been major players in the electronic field,
where the entertainment industry is a driving economic force.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic games are now a $10 billion market worldwide, and
designers and manufacturers in search of opportunity have made
major contributions to the software and hardware of interactive
applications. It could even be argued that the most prominent
electronic artists are the generally unsung special-effects people
for film and the graphic designers for Pac Man, Pong, Doom, et al.
</P>
<P>
   At the ZKM, an installation called ``World of Games,'' collected
and developed by the center, serves as both history and
encyclopedia. And a day at the media museum, stocked with machines
that manufacture unrealities, near-realities and super-realities,
is the cutting-edge way to have that old-fashioned experience
called fun.
</P>
<P>
   The visitor can ride a stationary bicycle through Jeffrey Shaw's
``Legible City,'' where all the buildings are letters of the
alphabet, or touch what in this case are actual plants in Christa
Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau's ``Interactive Plant Growing,''
making magical plants spring up in response on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   At the table where Masaki Fujihata has projected ``Beyond
Pages,'' an illustrated book makes a real lamp light up when a
picture of a light switch is tapped with a pen, or causes a door
projected on a wall to swing and a naked child to run in and out
when a pictured doorknob is touched.
</P>
<P>
   In Pierre Dutilleux and Christian Muller-Tomfelde's
``ArchitectureMusic Labor,'' a visitor with headphones can hear the
precise differences between the way Beethoven sounds in a
cathedral, a Roman amphitheater, a bedroom or a cylindrical or a
spherical space. Or one can hear how jazz, or snoring, or a
flushing toilet, sounds in those same spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is both an education and a delight, though by no
means does everything answer to that description.
(Technology-oriented art has already amply proved that it can be
ponderous, poky and dull.)
</P>
<P>
   The museum's system of labeling is hopeless; it is often hard to
tell which exhibit is which. Though even art ought to be
user-friendly, the programs for a few of the installations are
difficult to decipher for anyone over 15, and a good many
exhibitions were on the blink the day I was there. I have seen the
future, and it does not always work.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this museum makes clear how radically the traditional stance
toward art has already been changed, with participation elbowing in
on centuries of observation. In practice, this newly active role
proves relatively circumscribed, as viewer-determined changes are
almost always within programmed parameters.
</P>
<P>
   Such art also demands large quantities of time, negating the
viewer's (if that's still the right word) expectation of control
over how long to spend with a work of art. Video art alone can take
irritating amounts of time before a viewer can tell if it's worth
looking at.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What's more, participation is seldom communal, except sometimes
on the Net; one person at a console may be interacting with a
machine but is not exactly sharing an esthetic experience with a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The ZKM/Museum for Contemporary Art, which owns some 500 pieces,
almost all from the last two decades, offers plenty of
traditionally made art, yet it, too, has an uncommonly high
proportion of media-related work, and these pieces outshine the
paintings and sculpture on view in almost every instance.
</P>
<P>
   In Fabrizio Plessi's ``Cariatide,'' a column of bricks sits atop
a monitor with a video image of a brick wall, making a deft comment
on the underpinnings of reality. Steina Vasulka's ``Borealis''
engulfs the visitor in sound and mirrored images of waves or stones
that are seen first in painful close-up and then suddenly cascading
down.
</P>
<P>
   The Contemporary Museum will eventually become a separate unit
and the ZKM will concentrate on media art and research, but at the
end of next year, a Collectors' Museum will open with a kind of
parallel history of traditional art: shows from six private
collections featuring art that dates from Rauschenberg and Warhol
to the present, in old-fashioned mediums like paint.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Visual Media invites artists from around the
world to work in its labs with high-end equipment for anything from
a couple of days to a year. Bill Viola did his first interactive
piece, ``Tree of Knowledge,'' there. The institute also develops
hardware and software tailored to artistic needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Music and Acoustics, which occupies a blue
glass cube built onto the ZKM's front facade near the entrance,
offers composers and performers opportunities to work with the
latest technologies and will foster research into the creation of
new instruments (and doubtless new sounds). The composition program
was established jointly with the Center for Computer Research in
Music and Acoustics at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   The digital era has encroached on the age of mechanical
reproduction in more areas than imagery; as Johannes Goebel,
director of this institute, writes in ``Media/Art/History,'' ``Even
sounds are no longer produced mechanically using muscle power, but
indirectly, electronically.''
</P>
<P>
   The media library is compiling a comprehensive collection of
contemporary music, which so far includes a digitized archive of
electronic music, chiefly from the 1950s to the present; more than
500 videos spanning three decades, the first collection of its kind
in Germany, and approximately 20,000 books and CD-ROMs on art of
this century.
</P>
<P>
   The media theater puts on public performances once or twice a
week, ranging from lectures to concerts (electronic and otherwise)
to traditional film to theater.
</P>
<P>
   The center is situated in an old industrial section of
Karlsruhe, in a converted munitions factory, an immense building
with open interior spaces laced with steel trusses, pipes that run
up three stories to skylights and cantilevered stairways.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerd Schwandner, the acting chairman and general manager,
likes to think of the center as a kind of disarmament program and
happily points out that the new, neighboring office building of the
federal attorney general is quite dwarfed by his institution. ``You
can see how culture is estimated in Germany,'' he says. ``This
country has the highest per capita expenditure on culture in the
world. Hong Kong comes in second.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that the media arts have created the first global arts
scene, and not only on the Net: just about everyone in the field
knows everyone else. The number of artists is still relatively
small, they all need to know the same things, they all attend the
same conferences, and many pass through the center at one point or
another, often meeting at the media festival.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately enough, the center itself has a global reach, with
access to its home page on the Web (www.zkm.de) established in
German, English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and Alsatian.
It is providing expertise to Baptist University in Hong Kong, which
is sending a few students to Karlsruhe, and, in addition to
exchanging professors and staff with the faculty of science at
Chulalongkorn University, in Bangkok, will also set up a multimedia
center there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another partnership is being arranged (with the Walker Hill
Art Center) in Seoul, South Korea, to convert an established museum
into one that emphasizes media. The center has already collaborated
twice on exhibitions with the Guggenheim Museum in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The ZKM/Media Museum is surely the only museum in the world that
has ever commissioned a video game, then put it on display. Though
many of the installations ask hard questions about serious issues,
the museum simply brushes aside the barrier between art and
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The historian J. Huizinga once wrote: ``It is a general
phenomenon that the idea which works of art give us of an epoch is
far more serene and happy than that which we glean in reading its
chronicles, documents, or even literature. Plastic art does not
lament.''
</P>
<P>
   Centuries from now archeologists sifting through the ruins of
the ZKM may think that this troubled century believed art was one
game and technology another, and life was lived to play them.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has decided to begin an
inquiry to determine whether Kenneth Starr's prosecutors misled
Attorney General Janet Reno about possible conflicts of interest in
January 1998 when they obtained permission to investigate the
Lewinsky matter, government officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among other concerns, the inquiry will focus on whether the
prosecutors were truthful when they asserted that there had been no
contacts between Starr's office and Paula Jones' legal team in the
weeks leading up to Starr's decision to ask Reno to expand his
inquiry beyond the Whitewater matter, said the officials, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, documentation has emerged that indicates there
were conversations between a prosecutor in Starr's office and a
lawyer working behind the scenes with the Jones legal team from
November 1997 to January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of newly disclosed notes taken at the initial
meetings on Jan. 15 and Jan. 16, 1998, between Starr's prosecutors
and Justice Department officials shows that the prosecutors flatly
asserted that there were no contacts with the Jones team.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Eric H. Holder Jr., the deputy attorney general,
wrote in his three pages of notes of a Jan. 15, 1998, meeting with
Starr's prosecutors: ``They've had no contact with plaintiff's
attys.''
</P>
<P>
   Handwritten notes by two other Justice Department officials,
Monty Wilkinson and Josh Hochberg, who also attended that meeting,
corroborate the statements attributed to Starr's prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, notes taken by another participant in the meeting,
Steven Bates, a prosecutor in Starr's office, indicate that Jackie
M. Bennett, one of Starr's deputies, told the Justice Department
officials: ``We've had no contact with the plaintiffs' attorneys.
We're concerned about appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   The notes have become crucial evidence in the Justice Department
inquiry, which will be conducted by the Office of Professional
Responsibility, which investigates prosecutorial misconduct. The
lawyers' notes became public just last month as part of the Senate
record of documents related to the impeachment trial of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The truthfulness of Starr's prosecutors is one of several issues
that the Justice Department wants to examine, the government
officials said. Lawyers in the ethics office also intend to
investigate whether Starr abused his authority to convene grand
juries, or improperly pressed witnesses, like Ms. Lewinsky, and
disclosed secret grand jury information to the news media, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's lawyers and supporters have long contended
that there was collusion between Starr's office and the Jones
lawyers, noting that Linda Tripp found her way to the Independent
Counsel's Office through a group of private lawyers who performed
legal work on the Jones case. Starr has insisted that his office
sought permission from Reno to expand his jurisdiction when he
learned of allegations that Clinton's close friend, Vernon Jordan,
was helping Monica Lewinsky find a job in exchange for her silence
as a possible witness in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr's office, would not
comment on the Justice Department plans to start an investigation.
But Bakaly said that the notes showed that prosecutors supplied the
Justice Department with a thorough status report on the
then-nascent inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how else to put it,'' Bakaly said. ``There was no
misleading of Justice. This was a very fluid evolving situation.
Unlike most public corruption cases, this one was ongoing, felonies
were still possibly being committed.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest inquiry has exacerbated tensions that have existed
between the Justice Department and the Office of Independent
Counsel almost since the beginning of the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last spring, Reno asked her senior aides to
research whether she had the authority to discipline Starr in some
way that stopped short of removing him, according to a former
Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Some aides told her that it would be a mistake, comparing it to
the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' when President Richard Nixon
ordered the firing of the Watergate special prosecutor Archibald
Cox in October 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But, the official said, Reno shot back: ``I'm not asking you to
make a political judgment. I'm asking you to make a legal
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Deepening hostilities between the Justice Department and Starr's
office delayed the start of the new ethics inquiry. The ethics
investigators had recently written to Starr outlining the scope and
authority for the investigation, the officials said. Starr's
prosecutors are challenging the inquiry, asserting that the
attorney general does not have the authority to delve into highly
sensitive grand jury material or investigative decisions that led
Reno to refer the case to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's aides have said that investigative authority is implied
by language in the independent counsel statute, which gives the
attorney general the sole responsibility to remove an independent
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Justice Department officials, including Reno, have
been troubled by what they view as possible violations of Justice
Department guidelines. From issues like calling the Secret Service
before the grand jury to the crossfire over leaks to the media,
Starr's prosecutors and Justice Department officials have feuded
privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time went on, people became more and more frustrated with
him,'' the Justice Department official said of Starr. ``He seemed
less concerned with Department of Justice policies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors had also grown angry and suspicious about
Reno's aides, suggesting that the Justice Department was under the
control of the White House and had quietly tried to squelch Starr's
effort when it became apparent that Clinton might be in jeopardy,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, several news organizations have reported how
Starr's office first learned about the Lewinsky matter. On Jan. 8,
1998 _ four days before Linda Tripp contacted Starr's office _
Jerome M. Marcus, a Philadelphia lawyer who did extensive work for
the Jones legal team, informed Paul Rosenzweig, a prosecutor in
Starr's office, about the accusations related to Clinton's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The early tip was not disclosed in Starr's 445-page referral to
the House of Representatives in September. Nor was it disclosed to
the Justice Department. Indeed, The New York Times reported last
month that there were several conversations between Marcus and
Rosenzweig from November 1997 to January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, one of the president's personal lawyers,
complained to Reno in October that ``very serious questions'' were
raised about Starr's request for jurisdiction over the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of collusion prompted lawyers at the Justice
Department to turn their attention to their own recollections, and
their own hand-written notes, of statements made by Starr's
representatives on Jan. 15, 1998, officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One former Justice Department lawyer said in an interview on
Tuesday that Reno was especially disappointed in the fact that the
early phone call was not shared with her senior aides during the
January meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In January, The New York Times reported that Marcus was the
leader of a small secret group of lawyers working behind-the-scenes
on the Jones case. Marcus drafted legal documents and was involved
in many of the most important strategic decisions in the Jones
lawsuit, according to billing records in the Jones case and
interviews with other lawyers who worked with him.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus recruited other conservative lawyers to assist with his
efforts, including several classmates from the University of
Chicago Law School. One of the lawyers who was approached, Paul
Rosenzweig, briefly considered doing work for Ms. Jones in 1994,
the billing records show, but he decided not to.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Rosenzweig joined Starr's office, where he and
Marcus had several conversations about the Jones case, according to
one lawyer familiar with their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, the spokesman for Starr, has adamantly denied any
suggestion of collusion. When Starr testified before the House
Judiciary Committee on Nov. 19, he was asked by the Democratic
chief counsel, Abbe Lowell, about the ``substantial contacts'' that
he had with Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of questions, Lowell attempted to suggest that Starr
should have revealed the contacts to the Justice Department in
January 1998, and that Richard Porter, a partner of Starr's at the
law firm, Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, had been asked to represent Mrs. Jones
but declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Richard Porter; I've had communications with him from
time to time,'' Starr said at the time. ``But in terms of a
specific discussion with respect to what the law firm may be doing
or may not be doing, I'm not recalling that specifically, no.''

THE RED CLAY AND SORROW OF NIGERIA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voices keen in muted harmony as the lights slowly illuminate
the Nigerian village. ``This world, this world, what wrong man has
done to the world,'' sing the mourning women and men in their Igbo
language.
</P>
<P>
   Before them, a proud warrior swings from a noose, his body and
spirit broken. Undone by the disruption of his village by Europeans
and tormented by the flaws in his own character, he chose to end
his life rather than struggle to survive in a society he could no
longer understand.
</P>
<P>
   This bleak image opens and closes ``Things Fall Apart,'' a drama
with music now at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.
Adapted from the classic 1958 novel of the same name by the
Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, the production chronicles the rise
and fall of a Nigerian leader who watches his beliefs and
traditions unravel with the arrival of missionaries and other white
foreigners in Africa during the early 1900's.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of Okonkwo, a great wrestler, a famous warrior
and a successful farmer with three wives and two barns full of
yams. But his unrelenting fear of failure transforms him into a
harsh and inflexible man who ultimately plants the seeds of his own
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The script was adapted from Achebe's novel by Biyi Bandele, 31,
a playwright, screenwriter and novelist who was born in Nigeria and
now lives in London. The director is Chuck Mike, a black American
actor, director and producer who has devoted his career to
exploring and expanding the role of Africans and African-Americans
in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Mike, who grew up in Brooklyn, said he had always been troubled
by the images of Africans in the Tarzan movies he watched as a
child. As an adult studying drama at Fordham University, he felt
equally disturbed by the portrayal of blacks as hustlers and pimps
in 1970s films.
</P>
<P>
   When he won a fellowship to study theater in Nigeria in 1976, he
said, he decided to set the record straight. Mike, who became a
professor of theater in Nigeria and the founder of two theater
companies there, staged plays about black Americans, among them,
Lorraine Hansberry's ``Raisin in the Sun'' and August Wilson's
``Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   In bringing ``Things Fall Apart'' to America, he said, he hopes
to provide a more authentic portrait of African society by
describing a people who worshiped their gods, revered their elders,
celebrated their harvests and settled disputes in village courts
before the arrival of the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like people to walk away with, what I'd like them to
know is that these people with flesh, blood and bones exist as
normally and naturally as we do here,'' explained Mike, 46, who
said he had worked for years under the guidance of Wole Soyinka,
the Nigerian poet and playwright who won the Nobel Prize in
Literature in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a personal journey, bringing the show back here,'' said
Mike, who has lived in Nigeria for 23 years. ``In Nigeria, I've
been able to share African-American culture with Nigerians. Now I
can do the same thing here with `Things Fall Apart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   First presented to acclaim in England by the West Yorkshire
Playhouse and the London International Festival of Theater in 1997,
``Things Fall Apart'' made its American debut earlier this month at
the Kennedy Center in Washington. After the Newark run ends next
Sunday, the cast of African, Caribbean and British-born actors and
musicians will perform at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J.,
on Feb. 23; at Aaron Davis Hall in Manhattan, on Feb. 26, 27 and
28; and at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, on March 2,
3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   To infuse the American performances with African spirit, the
cast brought with them brightly colored Nigerian outfits, Nigerian
drums and a tiny plastic bag filled with Nigerian red clay.
</P>
<P>
   They carried the clay sample to quarries and dirt-removal
companies in Washington and Virginia. Their goal: to find perfectly
tinted sand so the performers could dance with the feel of
authentic African dirt under their feet (about two tons of red and
yellow sand cover the stage).
</P>
<P>
   Achebe, who teaches at Bard College, has yet to see the show and
had nothing to do with its creation. The production emerged out of
the longstanding friendship between Mike and Bandele, who met when
Bandele was studying drama in Mike's theater class in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Both say the novel continues to reflect Nigerian reality, though
they sometimes differ about the aspects it reflects. Mike says the
book captures the vibrant energy of modern-day villages and cities
and the dignity and warmth of the people.
</P>
<P>
   But Bandele warns that the novel also mirrors the
self-destructive bent of a society riddled with corruption,
oppression and ethnic rivalries, even as it totters toward
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Okonkwo's story, the society disintegrated because the
people stopped respecting one another, started distrusting one
another,'' said Bandele in a telephone interview from London.
``Dialogue broke down, and things fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing is that we seem doomed to repeat those mistakes
over and over again,'' Bandele said. ``Most people growing up now
don't have the luxury of thinking things are going to be fine
tomorrow. The book still resonates.''

 (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Saturday evening, at Merkin Concert Hall, a group
of fine musicians will gather to pay tribute to one of America's
finest composers: Leon Kirchner. Kirchner turned 80 last month, and
the retrospective concert is a kind of birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   The real beneficiaries, though, will be the members of the
audience, for Kirchner's music has always been outgoing, strong,
challenging, glorious to hear. He is a big man, and he makes big
music.
</P>
<P>
   Kirchner was born in Brooklyn but brought up in Los Angeles,
where he studied with Ernest Bloch and, most decisively, Arnold
Schoenberg. From Schoenberg he seems to have learned two essential
lessons. One was to accept the rough with the smooth: not to be
afraid of irregular tunes and awkward, dissonant harmonies; not to
run away from the grandeur of difficulty. The other was to
recognize the primacy of what you have to say, from which the way
to say it will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``An artist must create a personal cosmos, a verdant world in
continuity with tradition,'' he wrote in the mid-1950s. ``It is in
this way that Idea, powered by conviction and necessity, will
create its own style and the singular, momentous structure capable
of realizing its intent.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is almost a definition of latter-day Romanticism, then
Kirchner was content to be a latter-day Romantic: a composer who
wished to persuade and express, as Brahms had persuaded and
expressed, but who, in order to do so, had to find an individual
voice, not make do with Brahms' or Prokofiev's or anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   In the 50s, this view placed him at odds with the abstract and
positivist direction in which many of his colleagues were going.
``Idea, the precious ore of art,'' he wrote, ``is lost in the
jungle of graphs, prepared tapes, feedbacks and cold stylistic
minutiae.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the '80s and '90s, his continued loyalty to his
Schoenbergian origins made him seem equally out of place in the new
world of easy tonality. He has always swum against the tide, but
since he is a whale of a composer, he has swum well.
</P>
<P>
   The ``verdant world'' of his music is a planet not so far from
Alban Berg's. It offers a similar intensity of expression in every
gesture, a similar gift for melody and a similar command of
lustrous orchestral resources, giving the music an enticing
sensuousness even when _ or especially when _ what it is saying is
dark or uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The scope, too, is Bergian. Most works unfold strongly from
start to finish, with no movement break or with a movement break
that is only an interruption to a continuing flow.
</P>
<P>
   But there are essential differences. Where Berg loved to relax
and relapse into the rhythm of the Viennese waltz, the armchair
that Kirchner's music occasionally seeks out is that of the
big-band music of his youth. And where Berg's central expressive
tone was nostalgia, Kirchner's is exhilaration: not a thin
exhilaration, mechanically made by speed and rhythm, but a rich,
dense exhilaration of sound and melody, an exhilaration of body and
mind in harness.
</P>
<P>
   The results, especially in recent works like ``Music for
Orchestra II'' and ``Music for Cello and Orchestra'' (the latter
recorded by Yo-Yo Ma and the Philadelphia Orchestra on Sony
Classical), sometimes suggest Scriabin, in an echo, perhaps, of
Kirchner's Russian origins.
</P>
<P>
   His first works came out soon after World War II and were
immediately characteristic. The music is compact in scale but large
in utterance, and most of the works are for small instrumental
combinations. The birthday concert starts with the Sonata
Concertante for violin and piano, of 1952, and those who cannot get
to that event can hear another fine work of this period, the First
Trio for Violin, Cello and Piano, of 1954, strongly played by
Malcolm Lowe, Jules Eskin and Gilbert Kalish on a magnificent
Nonesuch CD that was released for the composer's 70th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most immediately attractive piece on this album,
though, is the Concerto for Violin, Cello, 10 Winds and Percussion,
written in 1960, which starts with a dull thud _ almost a groan at
having to wake up and begin (a noise familiar to all parents of
teen-agers) _ but then quickly sets itself in order so that it can
start to explore typically rapturous, dynamic fields of sound,
sometimes almost ecstatic, though without the driving energy's ever
quite being lost.
</P>
<P>
   Kirchner conducts the Boston Symphony Chamber Players in this
work and in the ``Music for 12,'' of 1985, and appears as a pianist
in his Five Pieces, of 1987.
</P>
<P>
   His performing instincts are obviously strong, and as a
professor at Harvard, from 1961 to 1989, he had performers as well
as composers among his students: Ma as well as John Adams. One of
the first works he wrote while at Harvard was his Second Piano
Concerto, a magnificent piece, which ought to be much more widely
played.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in his Third String Quartet, of 1966, he decided that the
``prepared tapes'' he had disparaged a decade before might be
useful to him after all: the work adds synthesized sounds to those
of the quartet, and it won him a Pulitzer Prize. It, too, will be
played at the Merkin concert.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the next decade Kirchner devoted to his biggest work. He
had previously concentrated on composing for instruments, but now
he set about writing an opera, ``Lily,'' setting his own libretto,
which he adapted from Saul Bellow's novel ``Henderson the Rain
King.''
</P>
<P>
   The first performance, by the New York City Opera in 1977, was a
sad failure, for reasons that almost certainly had nothing to do
with the score. Given the dramatic force of Kirchner's music, and
his urgent melody, it is highly unlikely that ``Lily'' deserves the
neglect it has suffered for more than two decades. It needs to be
looked at again by a major company, soon.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointment over ``Lily'' understandably affected Kirchner's
composing for a while, but the music he has produced during the
last 15 years displays a full return to creative strength and an
over-brimming optimism. These later works include, besides piano,
chamber and orchestral pieces, a cantata, ``Of Things Exactly as
They Are,'' setting an anthology of American poems for soprano,
baritone, chorus and orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   This, again, has not had the exposure it merits as a major
achievement by a composer who has, for more than half a century,
created works of supreme confidence, technical mastery and
powerful, human voice.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a vote by the Senate to keep its
deliberations closed, the doors to the chamber were shut tight on
Tuesday as senators began to render their final thoughts and
arguments about the votes they will cast in only the second
impeachment trial of a president in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   With spectators, reporters and television cameras gone, senators
stood up one at a time, walked to a microphone in the well of the
chamber and explained why they felt that President Clinton had
committed high crimes and misdemeanors and should be expelled from
office or why the president's behavior, however unsavory, did not
warrant such a fate, according to several senators.
</P>
<P>
   Although the verdict is a foregone conclusion, with votes for
conviction expected to fall well short of the 67 necessary, the
deliberations marked the only formal opportunity during the trial
for senators to express their assessments of the case inside the
chamber. They did so somberly, without partisan sniping or rancor,
over four and a half hours this afternoon, several senators said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, senators are taking it pretty seriously,
because this is the moment of truth,'' said Sen. Herbert Kohl,
D-Wis., during a late afternoon break.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the deliberations provided some small hope for
proponents of a resolution to censure the president, because it
suggested that senators might abbreviate their remarks and that the
Senate might have time left before the weekend _ and before a
recess next week _ to debate that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although each senator had been allotted a maximum of 15 minutes
to speak, some of the estimated 18 senators who had delivered their
remarks by the time Tuesday's session drew to a close around 6:30
p.m. took a few minutes less than that, while a few asked for more,
according to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations were expected to resume at 10 a.m. on Wednesday.
Given the pace of progress so far, the deliberations should
conclude sometime Thursday or early Friday, at which point senators
would cast their votes of guilty or not guilty without any further
explanation of their positions.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the word ``deliberations'' was a misnomer for what
transpired behind closed doors on Tuesday. Many senators had
already foreshadowed their decisions about the case in interviews
with reporters and appearances on television news programs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, several senators said on Tuesday that the closed
session was less a group conversation whose participants grappled
for certitude than a series of carefully considered speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some interruptions,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
said during a break in the session, ``but not a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   A Republican senator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that senators' speeches split almost exactly along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The senators said that all of the Republicans who had spoken
said they would vote to convict the president on the second article
of impeachment, which charges Clinton with obstruction of justice,
while all of them except Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska said they would
cast a guilty vote on the first article, which concerns perjury.
</P>
<P>
   All the Democrats, the senator said, announced that they would
vote to acquit the president on both articles.
</P>
<P>
   Although senators are forbidden by Senate rules to divulge many
details of the closed session, some of them did sketch broad
outlines of what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   According to these senators, the first speech Tuesday afternoon
was delivered by Sen. Slate Gordon, R-Wash., and others who spoke
included Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.; Don Nickles, R-Okla.; Carl
Levin, D-Mich.; Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.; Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Phil
Gramm, R-Texas; Joseph Biden, D-Dela., and Frank Lautenberg,
D-N.J.. The order alternated between Republicans and Democrats.

</P>
<P>
   Senators said there were a number of moments when something akin
to an actual discussion occurred, with senators in the audience
piping up to ask whoever was speaking about his or her viewpoint.
But they said the atmosphere remained dignified and friendly with
few exceptions, if any.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tone was very collegial,'' Levin said at the end of the
session. ``People feel very somber, very thoughtful, very
respectful of other views.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the speeches, Levin, who gave one of them, said: ``There was
a range of approaches. Some were very emotional, some were very
historical, some were very analytical. Mine tended to be
analytical.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said that he would be voting to acquit the president on
both articles of impeachment _ perjury and obstruction of justice _
but he declined to say anything specific about his remarks in the
chamber, saying he was not certain Senate rules permitted him to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, characterized the mood in the chamber
as almost dutiful. ``The speeches in there were not all
invigoratingly dynamic,'' Craig said after the session ended, ``but
most senators are paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate convened around 1 p.m. on Tuesday and proceeded
almost immediately to a rapid-fire series of motions, objections
and requests for unanimous consent that evoked the bitter arguments
in recent days over whether Senate impeachment rules should be
suspended and the deliberations opened to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The motion to open them fell short by eight votes of reaching
the two-thirds majority required for its passage. Fifty-nine
senators voted in favor of it, with 14 Republicans joining 45
Democrats, while 41 senators, all Republicans, favored keeping the
deliberations closed.
</P>
<P>
   Because the motion would have suspended Senate rules, which call
for closed deliberations, it needed the support of 67 senators.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after its failure, five senators who had pushed for it
left the Senate floor in the middle of the session to vent their
disappointment at a news conference upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor of the Senate, no matter how clubby we think it is,
is not a private club,'' Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, told reporters.
``The public has every right to see and hear us deliberate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who appeared with Harkin at
the news conference, noted that even though a transcript of the
closed session would be taken and might be unsealed at some point,
Americans now and future generations would be shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overriding all of this,'' Hutchison said, ``is that the people
of our country will never be able to see the debate that is real on
videotape, not now and not for history, because we have closed the
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Senate rules forbid the lawmakers from divulging what
occurs in a closed session, senators had voted in open session to
allow one another the option of publicizing explanations of their
positions and essentially reiterating what they said or intended to
say in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But there was confusion among senators afterward about whether
they were authorized to do so only after the verdict or before it
as well. In fact, the motion to allow them some latitude in talking
about their statements in the chamber was so hazy that the Supreme
Court Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, made a joke of it.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, began to proceed to
other business before the motion was decided, Rehnquist, who has
presided over the proceedings, reminded him, ``We have a motion,
however amorphous it may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott blushed, laughed and responded, ``Thank you for that
amorphous ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senators later said that they would release statements
about their positions before the verdict, but only one, Lautenberg
of New Jersey, had done so by early this evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although President Clinton's shameful behavior in an
inappropriate relationship has caused great pain to his family and
the nation, the House managers have not proven that he committed
`high crimes and misdemeanors,' '' Lautenberg said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conduct did not threaten our constitutional system,''
Lautenberg continued, ``and the national interest will not be
served by removing him from office. I hope that my colleagues will
reject the articles of impeachment and not weaken the presidency
for future generations. These proceedings should not serve as a
precedent for using impeachment as a political weapon.''

NEW JERSEY SHUTS DOWN AILING HMO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey insurance regulators said Tuesday
that they would liquidate the financially troubled HIP Health Plan
of New Jersey, leaving 165,000 people to find a new health insurer
and saying that those people would probably pay more for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The state rejected reorganization proposals by the health
maintenance organization's New York parent, HIP of Greater New
York, and instead said it would close the nonprofit insurer's
network of clinics by March 31.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the state's 20 other insurers will be required to accept
former HIP clients regardless of their health status, pre-existing
medical conditions or chronic illnesses as long as they enroll with
a new plan during an enrollment period that begins on Wednesday and
ends on March 31. But those who had been covered by HIP, which used
doctors employed at a network of 23 clinics, are likely to face
increased premiums in shifting to other plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to state rate schedules, HIP premiums for a single
person were the lowest in the state, ranging from $196 to $220 a
year. Other health maintenance organizations in the state charge
$223 to $369 a year for the same coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The state commissioner of banking and insurance, Jaynee
LaVecchia, said the agency would start sending letters on Wednesday
to inform HIP members of the end of their insurance plan and would
set up special telephone lines to ease the transition. But she
cautioned that it was important for people to enroll in a new plan
soon to avoid ``inadvertent lapses in coverage that would create a
very sad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The one group that does not have to find a new health insurer is
HIP's nearly 21,500 Medicaid patients, who, like other New Jersey
Medicaid patients in a two-year-old experiment, are getting their
health care through HMOs. That group's policies, Ms. LaVecchia
said, have been sold for $6 million to the Americaid Medicaid
Health Maintenance Organization, and they will be transferred to
that plan before March 31.
</P>
<P>
   HIP's 600 doctors and other employees will no longer have jobs
when the clinics close, nor will the 140 employees at the company's
headquarters in New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   The state's decision comes nearly three months after regulators
pronounced HIP, the state's fourth-largest health plan, insolvent.
At that time, the state took control of HIP and set a 90-day period
to reorganize it, sell its assets and policies to another insurer,
or liquidate it.

COMMENTARY: WHERE POLICE ARE ERODING SELF-RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (with NY-SUPSPECT SHOT and NY-SUSPECT-FEDS) 
 (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although the wind and cold can make for a miserable
walk home, Floyd Coleman refuses to keep warm and dry under his
jacket's hood. Same thing goes for the bandanna he usually sports
to protect the waves in his hair. As bad as the elements might be,
he is preoccupied by a more elemental fear in his Bronx River
neighborhood. He doesn't want to make waves with the plainclothes
police officers on patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when it's cold, I try not to wear my hood,'' said
Coleman, 27, who works at a youth center. ``Especially at night,
because you're going to get stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes his kind of dressing for success works. But it didn't
a few weeks ago, when he and four teen-agers from the center were
walking home from the movies in Parkchester. They noticed an
unmarked police car crawling behind them until they were in a
darkened street. The officers got out, he said, asked the young men
to stop, and began frisking them. Coleman asked the officers one
question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the cops said, `Oh, you want to be a wise guy,' and
pushed me up against a tree,'' he said. ``He started searching to
see if I had a weapon. I had my cell phone. The other officer said
someone reported somebody throwing a brick off the bridge over the
Cross Bronx. We weren't anywhere near that bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The police let them go. This, he said, usually happens every
weekend when he takes the youngsters to watch movies or play
basketball as a special treat beyond what he normally does for them
at the center. Never mind that he has never been arrested or that
he gets up early each morning to walk his young charges to three
different schools. Sometimes the same officers pull him to the
side, not remembering their previous encounters. For young black
and Latino men like him, being stopped by police is part of life in
Bronx River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me want to cry,'' Coleman said. ``Here I am, steering
young people in the right direction and doing things for them. And
we have cops approaching us for no reason. I feel like we're in
prison. There are no bars, but the cops are like corrections
officers standing around and watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman works at Youth Ministries for Peace and Justice, an
aptly named group, considering how chants of, ``No justice, no
peace'' echoed through the nearby Soundview neighborhood Sunday.
The center is a five-minute walk from the street where four police
officers fired 41 shots and killed an unarmed African immigrant who
apparently had gone out for a snack after coming home from a day
peddling on the street. That such an ordinary day would end in such
violence has scared Coleman and his friends, who walk those same
streets every day and night.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are criminals out there _ with hoods and beepers _
hurting their neighbors. There are too many guns on the street, and
that fact can present an officer with an intensely complex
cognitive choice. In a pulse-pounding minute inside a dim hallway,
a cell phone might look like something more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The result can seem like a nocturnal state of emergency in some
neighborhoods, said Alexie Torres, the youth center's director. She
thinks the only offense committed by a lot of the young men she
works with is not fitting into somebody else's mental image of what
a law-abiding citizen should look like. She knows the
stop-and-search routine doesn't usually end in deaths or broken
bones. But it chips away something just as vital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst experience you can have is a sense of total
helplessness and a feeling you have to cower in the presence of
somebody else,'' she said. ``What's frustrating is, we hear that
somehow this is for our own good. They're doing this to protect us
and take care of the community. In the process of helping reduce
crime, sometimes there is a long-lasting sense of something else in
a generation of young men. You're breaking their spirit. You're
breaking their will.''
</P>
<P>
   She advises the young people to know their rights and speak up.
She tells them to take down badge numbers. Coleman has tried that
before, but he said the officers sometimes cover their badges with
their hands or just leave. Still, he and his colleagues at the
center are speeding up their plans to address the issue of police
relations. They have to, because once the protests die down and the
Rev. Al Sharpton leaves their neighborhood, Ms. Torres and her
staff will be left with a lot of angry and frustrated young people.
</P>
<P>
   She can work with anger. At least it shows that the youths feel
passionate about an issue. The trick for her and her staff is to
channel it into actions that help, not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good organizing against injustice starts not with rhetoric or
slogans,'' she said. ``It starts with people's passions. So, I have
a great place to start.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, Carmin Kalil came into the center to start work.
He has two brothers who are police officers. He also has a college
scholarship that he won for his community work. On the street, who
would know that just by looking at him? A few weeks ago, he said, a
police officer tauntingly refused to believe that he and his
roommate were making a late-night ice cream run to a local store.
The store was suspected of selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not tonight, fellas,'' Kalil recalled the officer saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him we were getting ice cream, and all he said was,
`Yeah, whatever,''' Kalil said. ``We went to another store and got
it. I wanted to go back to him and say, `Ice cream, see?' But you
just got to keep walking. It's not worth it. It's all about
ignorance.''

<P>
   The nation's second-largest airline was forced to cancel nearly
one-third of its flights on Tuesday after 2,000 of its pilots
called in sick. The moves inconvenienced tens of thousands of
passengers around the country, as a result of an unusual wildcat
strike by its pilots that now threatens to disrupt the heavy travel
expected during the upcoming Presidents Day holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines said it had grounded 750 flights, 33 percent
of its 2,250 flights daily, affecting about 73,000 passengers, many
of whom waited for hours before getting on other flights or being
stranded for the night. American carries about 225,000 people on a
normal day.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Allied Pilots Association, the independent union
that represents American's 9,200 pilots, began calling in sick on
Saturday, after negotiations broke down over how American would
integrate a small airline it acquired in December, Reno Air, into
its network. American canceled 90 flights on Saturday. The
cancellations increased to 500 flights on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife isn't very happy about this,'' said John Rubino, 36, a
systems analyst from Dallas who was sipping a beer in a bar at
O'Hare International Airport near Chicago Tuesday afternoon
awaiting a flight. He had expected to return home in the morning
after doing business in Chicago. ``Our girl is in a school play
tonight, and I'm not very happy about the chance of missing that.
My boss understands about these things. It's harder for a
9-year-old girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The company and the union resumed negotiations on Tuesday, but
they did not bring a swift end to the disruption. After talking for
four hours, the two sides adjourned and agreed to meet again on
Wednesday. In a statement, American called the talks helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positive note is that both parties are talking again,''
Chris Chiames, a spokesman for American, said on Tuesday. ``With
regard to how that is going to affect tomorrow's operations, we
simply cannot forecast that.'' The union did not immediately return
a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes are relatively rare at airlines because the 1934 Railway
Labor Act, which governs labor relations in the industry, severely
restricts when unions are allowed to walk out. Slowdowns and
sickouts have occasionally occurred at American and other carriers,
however. For example, during the Christmas season, flight
attendants at Trans World Airlines forced the cancellation of some
flights after many called in sick. But no airline in recent memory
has been crippled as severely as American is now.
</P>
<P>
   Brian D. Harris, an industry analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
New York, estimated that the disruption had cost American $19
million so far and the figure was rising quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Carty, chief executive of AMR Corp., American's parent
company, said on Monday that the pilots' actions were clearly
illegal and that the company would seek a court order forcing them
back to work if the talks failed.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear whether a court order would have much
impact. The leaders of the pilots union say that the actions of the
pilots are spontaneous. While they have avoided endorsing the job
action, they have reminded their members that federal regulations
allow pilots to take themselves out of the cockpit if they do not
feel fit to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``American can prove actuarially that the pilots are staging a
sickout,'' Harris said. ``But it is a lot harder to prove that any
particular pilot is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American said it did not know precisely how many passengers or
which areas of the country were most severely affected by the
cancellations. February is normally a light month for travel. The
airline said that it had been able to rebook many affected
passengers on its other flights and that it was also transferring
passengers to competing airlines. The airline is recommending that
passengers check on the status of their flights by calling the
company's toll-free reservation number.
</P>
<P>
   At airports in Chicago, Dallas, Miami and New York, where
American has its biggest operations, passengers appeared to be
suffering irritating delays but were not stranded in large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate travel managers, who book airline tickets and make
other travel arrangements for corporate clients, said they were
able to handle the disruption by protectively booking their clients
on another airline in addition to American.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's having a limited impact on our customers,'' said Don
Munro, a spokesman for American Express, whose travel agencies had
$19.9 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hit harder were agencies that receive discounts from American in
exchange for steering business to the airline. ``It's been terribly
disruptive,'' said Paul Metselaar, chairman of World Travel
Specialists Group Inc. in New York ``Clients are getting to the
airport and learning that their flight has been canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   Metselaar said that double booking by travel agencies was
causing a shortage of seats on some airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between American and the pilots was triggered in
December, after American bought Reno Air, which is based in Nevada,
for $124 million. American said it would take a year to 18 months
to integrate Reno's 25 airplanes and 300 pilots into its operations
because pilots at both carriers needed to be retrained and Reno's
jets needed to be refurbished.
</P>
<P>
   But the union says that American is violating its contract,
which requires all flying at the airline to be done by its members.
The union is demanding that American integrate Reno faster and
begin paying pilots at both carriers as if the merger had been
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the dispute are years of mistrust and resentment on the
part of the pilots, who went on strike two years ago but were
ordered back to work within minutes by President Clinton. Many
pilots are still angry that they were denied their right to walk
out.
</P>
<P>
   The union says it believes American's real agenda is to keep
Reno as a separate low-cost carrier. Senior pilots at Reno make
about $65,000 a year, less than half of what their counterparts
earn at American.
</P>
<P>
   American has said repeatedly that it intends to integrate the
two airlines and bring Reno pilots up to the salary levels of
pilots at American. ``There is no reason for this dispute to
continue,'' the airline said.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts and industry observers agree, and they predict the
two sides will reach an accord. ``My guess is that it will be
resolved in the next couple of days because the financial harm is
disproportionate to the issues at hand,'' Harris of Salomon Smith
Barney said. ``But that assumes that rationality prevails.''

<P>
   His name is Andrei Siperco, a doctoral student in history, who
is the son of Romania's Olympic delegate.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, the report says, the committee arranged for
Siperco to enroll in Brigham Young University and complete his
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Writing to his father, Alexandru Siperco, the committee offered
to pay for airline tickets, housing and ``a modest living expense
as part of our approved grant program.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by the committee's vice president, Dave
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Siperco reacted with shock.
</P>
<P>
   Writing to the committee on Dec. 1, 1996, he reminded officials
that he had never asked for money. It was a member of the bid
committee, he said, who ``approached me and gave me to understand
that the University of Utah or BYU could be interested to enlist my
services.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Please believe me, dear Mr. Johnson, that if I had
the slightest idea that all will come down to offer some financial
help from the organizing committee of the Winter Olympic Games, I
would not even have mentioned to you my interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Siperco declined the money, saying ``it is not
appropriate'' for him to take any advantage of his family or
``relations with people involved in any Olympic activity.''

   Amid all the sordid tales of Olympic delegates with their hands

secure the Olympics, there is the story of at least one honest man

   &UR; Given the continuing interest in the persona and probe of
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, we are rereleasing the following
series from The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART I: ``What Drives Ken Starr?'' (1,500 words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During his early career, Ken Starr, a minister's son, was
considered too bland, cautious and reserved to have political
enemies. But Starr changed into a prosecutor so relentless that he
drove a U.S. president to admit his sins on national television.
What changed Starr is unclear. By now, however, Starr's character
has forever altered President Clinton's destiny. (slugged:
BC-STARR-CLINTON-PROBE-ONE-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART II: ``Ken Starr's Passions: Religion, Politics and the
Supreme Court'' (2,200 words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was fun, you couldn't do it,'' says a childhood friend,
recalling Ken Starr's religious upbringing _ no drinking, smoking,
dancing or musical instruments in church. It didn't keep Starr from
becoming fascinated with politics, though, and campaigning for
Nixon and Goldwater. Beyond that, Starr's driving ambition, one
that now he will never attain, was to become chief justice of the
Supreme Court. (slugged: STARR-CLINTON-PROBE-TWO- NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART III: ``Ken Starr's Search for Truth'' (1,600 words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Ken Starr compared himself to Joe Friday, the detective on
TV's erstwhile ``Dragnet'' _``just the facts, ma'am; only the
facts'' _ it seemed laughable. But today, a search for truth is
probably one of the most charitable interpretations that can be
made of his dogged pursuit of President Clinton. (slugged:
STARR-CLINTON-PROBE-THREE-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; PART IV: ``The Shadow Bill Clinton Can't Shake'' (1,550
words) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr has been willing to drive on in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation long after many other prosecutors would have stopped.
Some say he is driven by hate, others by religious values, others
by moral outrage at Clinton's escapades, others by his legal
temperament and love of the law. But at this point Starr's motives
are secondary. The question is, What is to be done with President
Clinton, and how badly has the whole affair fractured the American
body politic? (slugged: STARR-CLINTON- PROBE-FOUR-NYTSF)

E-MAIL TRAIL ADDS DETAILS TO USOC'S ROLE

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ This city's campaign to win the 2002 Olympic
Winter Games has largely been cast as a solo act: Salt Lake City
out there and alone, desperate to curry favor and win friends among
the International Olympic Committee with cash, gifts and tuition
programs for members and their children.
</P>
<P>
   But the city had some helpers, too. Tuesday's report by a Salt
Lake ethics panel describes at least one instance in which
officials of the U.S. Olympic Committee were actively involved in
helping Salt Lake keep what they characterized as ``promises'' to
Sudan in exchange for its support of Salt Lake's bid.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel documents tell the story through what the chief
investigator called an ``explicit'' exchange of e-mail in early
November 1995, six months after Salt Lake won the bid to be host of
the 2002 Games. In the messages, senior officials of the USOC
discussed financial support to three athletes and their coaches
from Sudan who were training in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The interoffice correspondence talks about promises, debts owed
and deals made, all in the chatty casual candor of office e-mail
everywhere. And in the process it opens a window to what appears to
be a new level of involvement, or at least knowledge, by senior
USOC officials about how at least this particular arrangement was
arrived at, and in blunt and frank terms, what it was for.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of promises were made to secure votes,'' wrote Alfredo
La Mont, then the USOC's director of international relations, in an
e-mail note dated Nov. 11, discussing support for the Sudanese,
which the ethics report said included air fare, ground
transportation, room and board, training kits, and other items.
</P>
<P>
   Another official, Jim Page, the assistant executive director for
sport at the committee, responded with some doubt about how the
athletes' expenses would be budgeted. ``Should I take financial
support away from American athletes?'' Page wrote. ``Or does your
budget cover these international political initiatives?''
</P>
<P>
   La Mont's response: not to worry. ``You can take it away from
the additional revenue we will ALL benefit from after having won
the 2002 Games for SLC,'' he wrote, according to the panel
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC's executive director for administration, Tom Wilkinson,
then contributed his own thoughts in support of the Sudanese, the
e-mail record shows. ``Seems to me a deal is a deal and the Sudan
delivered.'' Wilkinson then added another insight, looking forward
to the future: ``We may need the Sudan again future. Don't burn
bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the USOC, Dick Schultz, said in a
telephone interview that the e-mail exchange was ``unfortunate,''
because it casts a ``poor light'' on a training-assistance program
that he said has been a genuinely humanitarian program that has
helped some 2,000 foreign athletes train for the games in the
United States over the past 17 years. He also said that he thought
the exchange did not prove that there had been a formal agreement
to exchange the training for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make flippant remarks on e-mails that aren't always
accurate,'' Schultz said. ``It seems like it was handled
appropriately. `` `If you do this they'll vote for us' _ I don't
see that in any records we've turned up.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief investor for the Board of Ethics for the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, David Jordan, said he thought the distinction
was also important and that the USOC's role did not involve a
payment or gift for the personal benefit of an IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our minds, we distinguished the transactions in which
Sudanese athletes were brought to the United States, apparently
with some understanding that we would receive Sudanese votes, from
an example which in an IOC member sells their vote,'' said Jordan,
who was the U.S. Attorney for Utah from 1991 to 1993. ``It's a
different thing; a distinction needs to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan said he believed that the e-mail exchange shows there
was little doubt about the purpose of bringing the Sudanese to
train. ``The documentations show a fairly clear discussion that the
intention of bringing those athletes and coaches here was to obtain
the vote of the Sudanese IOC member,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   La Mont, who resigned from the USOC last month, did not return
telephone calls to his home. His lawyer also did not return several
telephone calls. There was no answer to several calls placed to the
Sudanese Olympic Committee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report said that there was a cost-sharing program for the
athlete's training. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee's former
vice president, Dave Johnson, told investigators that the USOC
expected that the organizing committee would pick up a share of the
cost of training the athletes. Records included in Tuesday's report
show that that is exactly what happened: After the e-mail exchange,
the organizing committee began making payments to the USOC on
behalf of the Sudanese.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also said that his investigation had turned up evidence
that La Mont was directly involved in the transmission of cash
payments to IOC members. At the same time that he was assisting the
Salt Lake bid in his capacity as a senior official of the USOC,
Jordan said, La Mont also had private consulting contracts with the
bid committee _ one under a company called Citius, and another from
a company called Arca. The Arca contract appears to have functioned
like a conduit, sending money from Salt Lake to the IOC member from
Barbados, Austin Sealy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arca contract is particular troubling because it appears
to us from the documents that Mr. La Mont's company received
so-called consulting payments from the bid committee, and then
passed them through to a member of the IOC,'' Jordan said.

JESSE JACKSON ASSAILS NEW YORK GOVERNOR ON EDUCATION BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Critics of Gov. George E. Pataki's education
budget sharpened their attacks Tuesday, with the Rev. Jesse L.
Jackson accusing Pataki of favoring prisons over schools, while New
York City Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew said there was no point in
even meeting with the governor to try to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Making an unusually direct foray into state policy, Jackson told
a joint hearing here of the Assembly and Senate finance committees
that the Republican governor was ``using our children as political
trade-offs,'' by under-financing schools while building prisons in
depressed upstate communities to mollify voters there who need
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These poor schools serve as feeder systems for the
prison-industrial complex,'' he said to reporters after the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is traveling to several state capitals to lobby for
more money for education, compared Pataki to to Orval Faubus of
Arkansas and George C. Wallace of Alabama, two governors who tried
to block racial integration of their states' schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Pataki in that tradition,'' he said. ``Whether you're
blocking school doors in Alabama and Arkansas or simply locking
kids out of closed school doors in New York, it's not the wave of
the American future.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, Pataki's press secretary, said: ``Jesse
Jackson's partisan attack is absurd. It doesn't warrant comment.
Coming from someone in public life, it's surprisingly
undignified.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Democrats who control the Assembly have turned
the annual hearings on the governor's budget proposal into a
platform for lambasting Pataki, particularly on education, inviting
prominent critics like Jackson and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New
York City to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $2 billion surplus, the governor's $72.66 billion
proposed budget would increase aid to local school districts by
only 1.3 percent. It would also eliminate a package of education
programs for very young children, including pre-kindergarten and
expanded kindergarten offerings, freeze aid to public colleges, and
sharply reduce tuition aid to poor college students.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the governor point out that in the last two years,
under Pataki, New York has sharply increased spending on schools,
and the total, adjusted for inflation and the number of students,
has matched the previous highs reached in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Crew, who addressed the committees after Jackson,
called the governor's proposal ``a very mean-spirited budget on
behalf of children.'' When asked why he was not meeting with the
governor during his trip to the capitol, he said, ``At this point
in time, there is not enough of a relationship to meet with the
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to commenting on Pataki's policies, Jackson derided
the governor's possible aspirations to national office. Referring
to the screaming blocks of type on tabloid front pages, he said,
``Sometimes I think the size of New York headlines gives New York
politicians the impression that is their size.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets received some bad news Tuesday when it was learned
Charles Barkley had suffered an   incomplete tear of the medial
meniscus in his left knee. But the news could have been much worse.
<TEXT>
<P>
   BarkleyBarkley, who is expected to play in tonight's game
against the Sacramento Kings at Compaq Center, could have had a
complete tear, which would have required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barkley, 35, will be treated with anti-inflammatory
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's torn, but it's not torn away from the meniscus,'' said
Rockets trainer Keith Jones. ``There is no exposed flap of tissue
there, as would happen with a worse tear. This is more like a slice
in the meniscus. It's really not a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly common injury. It could have been much worse. It
could have been a complete tear, or a plica (a painful fold of
tissue in the knee capsule), like Hakeem (Olajuwon) had (last
season). Given the circumstances, this is a best-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley, who leads the NBA with an 18-rebound average, had been
bothered by swelling in his left knee. He played 36 minutes in
Monday's 99-80 victory over Denver, scoring 15 points and pulling
down a game-high 19 rebounds. It is not known how Barkley hurt the

   But it's not going to stop him from taking the court.

<P>
   ``I'm going to play,'' Barkley said of tonight's game. ``I
played (Monday) night, and it was bothering me Saturday. I feel
like I can play with it. I just hope it's not something that is
going to get progressively worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably just wear and tear. That's what I'm hoping it
is. It's not going to be easy to play these games. I think that,
obviously, I might struggle sometime in back-to-back games. But I
feel good about our team. I'm hoping they'll just tell me it's wear
and tear and that they can control it with anti-inflammatory
drugs.''

LONG ISLAND TOWN STRUGGLES WITH POST-SUBURBAN LIFE  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLEN COVE, N.Y. _ The year began here much the way last year
did: with the wind whistling through downtown streets empty except
for groups of shabby men walking aimlessly about with little more
in their pockets than their fists.
</P>
<P>
   Across from City Hall, Stan Eisenstadt, 75, and his son Bob, 47,
waited for customers in their hardware store. Everything was marked
down 50 percent, but still nobody came. After four decades in the
business and facing a bleak future, the Eisenstadts have sold their
corner lot to a developer and plan to close this month.
</P>
<P>
   Up the hill, among the duck ponds and the naked sycamores, Paul
G. Pennoyer, 78, a grandson of J. Pierpont Morgan, listened as the
earth movers felled trees to make way for the new houses being
built across the glade, a place where his family once held fox
hunts and shooting competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sad to see what's happening in Glen Cove,''
Pennoyer said. ``But I'm not weeping over it. I can't stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally the exclusive province of wealthy industrialists and
robber barons, Glen Cove was and still is considered the capital of
the Gold Coast, a place where the rich spent their summers before
anyone had heard of the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan built his estate here. So did the oil barons Charles
Pratt and Stephen V. Harkness. F.W. Woolworth built his palace next
to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   But the butlers and the lavish parties are memories. Some
estates were torn down to make way for glorified subdivisions, and
those that remain are now museums, conference halls and university
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   With the opulence gone, few tourists visit this enclave on
Hempstead Harbor. Downtown is half empty, and one of the most
conspicuous features on the streets are the clusters of Central
American laborers waiting for work.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Cove is in the midst of its post-suburban life. Its
population of 25,000 has become a gumbo of the rich, the middle
class, the poor and the downright poor. With impoverished
immigrants knocking at its door and the small businessman walking
out of it, old-timers here wonder whether the golden luster of Glen
Cove can ever be reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and city elders are optimistic about its renewal, with
some justification. They have their flip charts and
waterfront-development proposals, and boast about the new
government buildings downtown. But that they are talking about
urban revitalization in one of America's original suburbs shows
just how far the city has spilled into Long Island's Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a strange place, more like New York City than
Nassau County,'' said Roger Wunderlich, a professor of Long Island
history at the State University at Stony Brook. ``It went from
rural to exclusive to mainstream to a time now where the mom and
pop mainstream are having trouble surviving.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have welfare people living near the very rich. You have
housing issues and elderly people and homelessness. There is a
large minority population and the city seems unwilling or unable to
come to grips with its real social problems,'' professor Wunderlich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the mayor, Thomas R. Suozzi, a man who is rabid about Glen
Cove's image, concedes the point. ``It's true, we are a suburban
town with city problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Suozzi has a vision for his city and eagerly heralds
his accomplishments since taking office five years ago. There is
the new City Hall-police station-courthouse complex. He closed down
the incinerator. A software designer has set up operations in Glen
Cove, and a shabby patch of land that sat barren for 20 years in
the middle of downtown has recently been sold to a developer.
</P>
<P>
   His most ambitious plan is a $250 million renewal of the
waterfront, transforming it from a hazardous waste site into a
seaport and marina to rival those in New York City, Connecticut and
Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Gold Coast, and we want to capitalize on that,''
he said, dirtying his polished shoes in waterfront mud. ``Imagine
hundreds of people docked here, eating oysters in the restaurants,
listening to music on the waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the waterfront is miles away from any major highway, and
little has been done on the project, his critics contend, calling
it a thin sheet masking Glen Cove's more serious needs. They laugh
at the Regina Maris, the 90-year-old ship that was thought to have
helped rescue Danish Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the mayor welcomed it to the city as a symbol of
his efforts to revitalize the waterfront. But last week, officials
announced that the vessel may have hauled rocks during the war, but
never refugees. She now rests in the mud of Hempstead Harbor,
taking on water, drawing more titters than tourists.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of fluff but little substance,'' said John
Maccarone, a city councilman. ``The point here is the small
businessman is leaving downtown and little is being done to help
him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The decay of the village center is a problem that plagues much
of Long Island, said Lee E. Koppelman, executive director of the
Long Island Regional Planning Board.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to compete with the super malls and strip developments
along nearby highways, small shops are packing it in. And though
some bigger businesses have come to Glen Cove, the city has few
answers on how to help its independent businesses. ``It's a slide
that started 30 years ago, and I'm not sure that we have bottomed
out,'' Koppelman said.
</P>
<P>
   To resuscitate themselves, other small villages in the area
developed attractions to draw people. Port Jefferson's waterfront
and harbor face lift has been successful. Bay Shore is planning an
aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Glen Cove already has the attractions: the waterfront, three
public beaches, a yacht club, parks and, of course, the mansions;
like Woolworth's Winfield, where the grand marble staircase cost $2
million to build in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Until Suozzi came along, no one thought to stitch it all
together and invite the outside public. Instead the waterfront
rotted away, and many mansions fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   One was Pennoyer's boyhood home, one of several estates that
Morgan built for his children.
</P>
<P>
   The other morning, Pennoyer sat in front of his stone hearth,
offering recollections of his grandfather's mansion at the tip of
the peninsula, where the surrounding waters provided an anchorage
for Morgan's black yacht, Corsair. Besides marble and caviar, his
grandfather imported Italians to do his labor and tend to his and
his children's estates.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said when Glen Cove was incorporated into a city
back in the 20s, city problems would follow,'' Pennoyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pennoyer now lives with his wife in the former horse stable of
his parents' 100-acre estate. Just 15 acres remain in the family
now, and houses are going up all around them. Some men in tattered
clothes sleep in their woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only immigrants there used to be here were the people who
worked in the houses,'' he said. ``They came in old jalopies. Now
there are just too many of them. There is crowding in the streets,
in the houses, people sleeping in the woods. I have sympathy, but
we need to stem the inflow.''
</P>
<P>
   In the south of Glen Cove is a neighborhood known as the
Orchard, once the Italian enclave, now rapidly becoming a ghetto of
overcrowded houses occupied by young men from Central America.
There are hundreds here now, and hundreds more come during summer
to mow the lawns and rake the leaves of Glen Cove's wealthy
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them live 16 to a house; others sleep in the elements.
One man froze to death a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The city is unwilling to build a shelter for the homeless,
because, the feeling is, if you build it more will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are concerned with real estate values, not
homeless shelters,'' said the Rev. Patricia B. Mitchell, who
retired as the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that if you build shelters, others will be
attracted to them. That's why we have shelters for animals and not
for people in Glen Cove. That doesn't mean there isn't a need for
one.''

JURORS REPORT A DEADLOCK IN SUIT AGAINST GUN MAKERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jurors in a lawsuit seeking to hold gun manufacturers
liable for six killings with illegally obtained handguns told the
judge Tuesday afternoon that they were deadlocked and that their
deliberations had left them ``emotionally drained and some of us
feel physically ill.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the note seeking his guidance _ the second
deadlock note the jury sent him Tuesday _ the judge, Jack B.
Weinstein of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, told the jury that
its deliberations had not gone on long enough for him to declare a
mistrial. He sent the panel home for the night, with instructions
to resume deliberations on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all very upset!'' the jury's second note read. ``We are
starting to fight!! We can not reach a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, at 3:15 p.m., the jurors had deliberated 23 hours
over four days after hearing four weeks of testimony and arguments
in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts see the civil suit as a test case for a wave of
recently filed lawsuits seeking to hold the gun industry liable for
shootings by criminals or others with illegally obtained handguns.
However, part of the 23 hours has been spent hearing testimony
reread rather than discussing the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you've given it sufficient attention,''
Weinstein told the jurors, even as he said he sympathized with them
for what he had earlier described _ after their first deadlock note
_ as a ``very complex case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has invested, including yourselves, too much in this
case for you to throw up your hands prematurely,'' the judge said,
giving the jurors a choice of three possible respites: being
dismissed for the rest of the day, being taken for a walk by
federal marshals near the downtown Brooklyn courthouse or going to
a restaurant for a cup of coffee. The jurors chose dismissal for
the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs _ relatives of six homicide victims in the New
York City region and a Queens teen-ager severely wounded in a
seventh shooting _ contend that the 25 gun manufacturers they are
suing are collectively liable for the shootings, even if it cannot
be proved which company's gun was used in a given shooting.
</P>
<P>
   This is so, they argue, because the companies, including giants
of the industry like Smith &AMP; Wesson and the Colt's Manufacturing
Co., have marketed and distributed handguns so negligently that
they have fostered the illegal gun trafficking that ``put the guns
into the hands of the shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies have denied that their marketing was negligent.
They have argued that they cannot control illegal trafficking and
criminal misuse of guns and have said they cooperate in every way
they reasonably can against illicit trafficking. The collective
liability argument, they say, would be like holding all car makers
liable for an injury caused by a drunken driver.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the suit is being closely watched by lawyers for
Chicago and other cities that have recently filed, or plan to file,
similar suits against gun companies.

AMERICAN AIRLINES, PILOTS TALK BUT FAIL TO END SICKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Negotiators for American Airlines and
representatives of its pilots union failed to reach an agreement
Tuesday to end a four-day slowdown that has hobbled the nation's
second-largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based carrier was forced to cancel 750 flights, a
third of the 2,250 scheduled, because it couldn't find enough
pilots to fly them.
</P>
<P>
   At Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, the airline's major hub, American
said it scrubbed 173 of its scheduled 525 departures, displacing
about 17,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown has left passengers and travel agents in limbo as
the three-day Presidents Day weekend approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leisure travelers are just stuck,'' said Kimberly Ray, owner
of How To Go Travel in Bedford near D/FW. ``We have a lot of people
calling and asking us to help, but American is rerouting the
flights themselves and you just really have to go to the airport.
At least the business travelers that have paid full fare _ we can
change theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of cancellations could grow larger Wednesday.
Negotiations are scheduled to resume in the afternoon, but the two
sides are apparently far apart.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arises out of American's acquisition of Reno Air in
December for $124 million. The Allied Pilots Association and the
airline have been unable to reach an agreement on how fast to
integrate Reno's 300 pilots into American's 9,300-member pilot
corps. The pilots say they should be integrated sooner, and at the
same pay scale as American's pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of pilots have called in sick over the past four days,
forcing American to cancel flights.
</P>
<P>
   Management called Tuesday's meeting with the union helpful. But
airline officials once again pleaded publicly for the union to urge
its members to ``return to work for the sake of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said they were unmoved by the appeal, which they
suggested the company made as a prelude to seeking a federal
injunction ordering the pilots back to work.
</P>
<P>
   The union has maintained that it is not orchestrating a job
action against American, although individual pilots may be
expressing their concern about the lack of progess in the Reno
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize to our customers,'' said Allied Pilots President
Rich LaVoy. ``But management long ago, long before this became an
issue, should have come to us and done a reasonable deal, and our
passengers would not be in this fix today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is typical of how management has run this company for the
last 20 years,'' LaVoy added. ``This shows the world what we've
been suffering under all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent employee opinion survey, sponsored by
management. The results showed that employees have a great deal of
public pride in the company, he said, but a lot of private pain.
</P>
<P>
   American executives declined to estimate the financial damage
suffered by the airline since the slowdown began Saturday. But
several analysts have suggested that the airline is bleeding about
$1 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   AMR's stock fell $1.50 a share Tuesday, closing at $55.50 in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It has fallen $4.4375 a
share, or more than 7 percent, since Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot sickout is having a compound effect on American's
operations, company officials said. When a pilot calls in sick, he
or she is removed from service for the entire scheduled trip, which
in most cases is three days.
</P>
<P>
   American spokesman John Hotard said that 645 pilots called in
sick Saturday, compared with a normal day of about 400 calls.
</P>
<P>
   Another few hundred called in sick Sunday, he said, resulting in
944 on the sick list. The total number of sick rose to 1,288 on
Monday, and to 1,645 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of canceled flights has also risen from 84 Saturday,
to 237 Sunday, 505 Monday and 750 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, has stepped up
its inspections, FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started increasing our oversight when the job action began,
which is what we do for any airline that has a job action under
way,'' he said. But the agency has found no problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The additional inspections include checking log books and crew
staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those who have travel plans this week will not know
whether their flights will be canceled until the departure day.
</P>
<P>
   Most leisure travelers buy nonrefundable tickets, which travel
agents cannot change until the flight is officially canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard for us because we really don't know what to
say,'' said Ray, the Bedford travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   American's customers, management and pilots aren't the only ones
unhappy about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's pilots, who are represented by a different union, the Air
Line Pilots Association, have said they are unhappy about being
shut out of the American-Allied Pilots talks. They have also said
they are concerned they'll end up at the bottom of the American
seniority list.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Monday that they are contemplating
filing suit against the Allied Pilots in federal court, seeking an
injunction ordering an end to the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials repeated American chairman Donald Carty's
position that the airline hopes to avoid going to court. But the
American officials said a suit is more likely the closer American
and the Allied Pilots get to the three-day weekend, when American's
flights are heavily booked with holiday travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, American said management and
the union have ``agreed from the outset on the need for a stronger
American Airlines presence on the West Coast, and that the Reno Air
purchase will help us accomplish this goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The company added: ``We have made it clear to APA that we will
not operate Reno as a separate carrier, and we will pay Reno pilots
100 percent American Airlines wages as soon as the integration is
complete. We have even offered significant pay raises to Reno
pilots during the integration process.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline has proposed to integrate the Reno pilots into the
American system within 12 to 18 months, a timeframe it
characterized as one of the fastest in industry history.
.MDBO/.MDNM/ LaVoy, in a statement issued by the union, said ``the
remedy to the dispute is a simple one: apply the American Airlines'
pilots' contract to the Reno Air pilots effective Dec. 23, 1998,
the date AMR gained control of Reno Air.''

<P>
   Company officials repeated American chairman Donald Carty's
position that the airline hopes to avoid going to court. But the
American officials said a suit is more likely the closer American
and the Allied Pilots get to the three-day weekend, when American's
flights are heavily booked with holiday travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, American said management and
the union have ``agreed from the outset on the need for a stronger
American Airlines presence on the West Coast, and that the Reno Air
purchase will help us accomplish this goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The company added: ``We have made it clear to APA that we will
not operate Reno as a separate carrier, and we will pay Reno pilots
100 percent American Airlines wages as soon as the integration is
complete. We have even offered significant pay raises to Reno
pilots during the integration process.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline has proposed to integrate the Reno pilots into the
American system within 12 to 18 months, a timeframe it
characterized as one of the fastest in industry history.
.MDBO/.MDNM/ LaVoy, in a statement issued by the union, said ``the
remedy to the dispute is a simple one: apply the American Airlines'
pilots' contract to the Reno Air pilots effective Dec. 23, 1998,
the date AMR gained control of Reno Air.''

AMERICAN AIRLINES, PILOTS TALK BUT FAIL TO END SICKOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN REED 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Negotiators for American Airlines and
representatives of its pilots union failed to reach an agreement
Tuesday to end a four-day slowdown that has hobbled the nation's
second-largest airline.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based carrier was forced to cancel 750 flights, a
third of the 2,250 scheduled, because it couldn't find enough
pilots to fly them.
</P>
<P>
   At Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, the airline's major hub, American
said it scrubbed 173 of its scheduled 525 departures, displacing
about 17,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown has left passengers and travel agents in limbo as
the three-day Presidents Day weekend approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leisure travelers are just stuck,'' said Kimberly Ray, owner
of How To Go Travel in Bedford near D/FW. ``We have a lot of people
calling and asking us to help, but American is rerouting the
flights themselves and you just really have to go to the airport.
At least the business travelers that have paid full fare _ we can
change theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of cancellations could grow larger Wednesday.
Negotiations are scheduled to resume in the afternoon, but the two
sides are apparently far apart.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute arises out of American's acquisition of Reno Air in
December for $124 million. The Allied Pilots Association and the
airline have been unable to reach an agreement on how fast to
integrate Reno's 300 pilots into American's 9,300-member pilot
corps. The pilots say they should be integrated sooner, and at the
same pay scale as American's pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of pilots have called in sick over the past four days,
forcing American to cancel flights.
</P>
<P>
   Management called Tuesday's meeting with the union helpful. But
airline officials once again pleaded publicly for the union to urge
its members to ``return to work for the sake of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said they were unmoved by the appeal, which they
suggested the company made as a prelude to seeking a federal
injunction ordering the pilots back to work.
</P>
<P>
   The union has maintained that it is not orchestrating a job
action against American, although individual pilots may be
expressing their concern about the lack of progress in the Reno
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize to our customers,'' said Allied Pilots President
Rich LaVoy. ``But management long ago, long before this became an
issue, should have come to us and done a reasonable deal, and our
passengers would not be in this fix today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is typical of how management has run this company for the
last 20 years,'' LaVoy added. ``This shows the world what we've
been suffering under all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent employee opinion survey, sponsored by
management. The results showed that employees have a great deal of
public pride in the company, he said, but a lot of private pain.
</P>
<P>
   American executives declined to estimate the financial damage
suffered by the airline since the slowdown began Saturday. But
several analysts have suggested that the airline is bleeding about
$1 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   AMR's stock fell $1.50 a share Tuesday, closing at $55.50 in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. It has fallen $4.4375 a
share, or more than 7 percent, since Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot sickout is having a compound effect on American's
operations, company officials said. When a pilot calls in sick, he
or she is removed from service for the entire scheduled trip, which
in most cases is three days.
</P>
<P>
   American spokesman John Hotard said that 645 pilots called in
sick Saturday, compared with a normal day of about 400 calls.
</P>
<P>
   Another few hundred called in sick Sunday, he said, resulting in
944 on the sick list. The total number of sick rose to 1,288 on
Monday, and to 1,645 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of canceled flights has also risen from 84 Saturday,
to 237 Sunday, 505 Monday and 750 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration, meanwhile, has stepped up
its inspections, FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started increasing our oversight when the job action began,
which is what we do for any airline that has a job action under
way,'' he said. But the agency has found no problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The additional inspections include checking log books and crew
staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those who have travel plans this week will not know
whether their flights will be canceled until the departure day.
</P>
<P>
   Most leisure travelers buy nonrefundable tickets, which travel
agents cannot change until the flight is officially canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard for us because we really don't know what to
say,'' said Ray, the Bedford travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   American's customers, management and pilots aren't the only ones
unhappy about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's pilots, who are represented by a different union, the Air
Line Pilots Association, have said they are unhappy about being
shut out of the American-Allied Pilots talks. They have also said
they are concerned they'll end up at the bottom of the American
seniority list.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Monday that they are contemplating
filing suit against the Allied Pilots in federal court, seeking an
injunction ordering an end to the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials repeated American chairman Donald Carty's
position that the airline hopes to avoid going to court. But the
American officials said a suit is more likely the closer American
and the Allied Pilots get to the three-day weekend, when American's
flights are heavily booked with holiday travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, American said management and
the union have ``agreed from the outset on the need for a stronger
American Airlines presence on the West Coast, and that the Reno Air
purchase will help us accomplish this goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The company added: ``We have made it clear to APA that we will
not operate Reno as a separate carrier, and we will pay Reno pilots
100 percent American Airlines wages as soon as the integration is
complete. We have even offered significant pay raises to Reno
pilots during the integration process.''
</P>

American system within 12 to 18 months, a timeframe it
characterized as one of the fastest in industry history.
.MDBO/.MDNM/ LaVoy, in a statement issued by the union, said ``the

OLOWOKANDI, BIBBY TO MEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The highly anticipated rematch between the
finalists in last year's NBA draft lottery will happen tonight in
Vancouver, where the 0-2 Clippers square off with the 0-2
Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   The stars of this subplot are Michael Olowokandi, the spoils of
the Clippers' Ping-Pong-ball victory, and Mike Bibby, who was
drafted No. 2 by the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable,'' Olowokandi said, ``that people will make
the comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   So let's get to it.
</P>
<P>
   In two games for the Clippers, the 7-foot rookie from Pacific
has averaged 13 points and 6 rebounds while making 50 percent of
his field-goal attempts. Bibby, a point guard who left Arizona
after his sophomore season, has averaged seven points and seven
assists but is shooting just 20 percent (5 of 25) from the field.
The son of USC coach Henry Bibby was 1 for 12 and played 41 minutes
Monday in Vancouver's loss to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   What do the numbers indicate? Other than isolating Bibby's
fondness for shooting, probably nothing.
</P>
<P>
   For perspective, we have consulted Elgin Baylor, the Clippers'
vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't judge a draft pick on one year,'' he said, ``or one
short season. You have to look at it over the years. And generally,
it takes big players longer to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   But Baylor, who took a long look at Bibby before deciding to
select Olowokandi, isn't bashful about how he thinks history will
treat his pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy with the decision,'' Baylor said. ``So is the
coaching staff, everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi's just happy to be playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be focused on that,'' he said of stepping into
tonight's spotlight with Bibby. ``I can say right now, I am not
`the man' on our team. I'm not going to go out and do something
with the ball just because I'm trying to conquer Bibby.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's not exactly shy about attempting to prove the Clippers
showed wisdom in their selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bibby) better not get too carried away driving into the
lane,'' Olowokandi joked.
</P>
<P>
   __ Wright stuff, wrong timing: It's time to check in on Lorenzen
Wright, the center/power forward whose agent provided a
training-camp tremor by insisting the team extend his client's
contract.
</P>
<P>
   When the Clippers said the timing was all wrong, the agent _ who
was seeking a deal worth $60 million over six years _ strongly
requested the team trade Wright before the third (and final) year
of his contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, Wright is averaging 27.5 minutes, seven points,
eight rebounds, and has made 5 of 8 field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it's early.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bigger country: Because nobody locked Bryant ``Big Country''
Reeves out of the dining room during the NBA's work stoppage,
ex-Clipper Tony Massenburg has been starting at center for
Vancouver. Massenburg, who played for the Clippers in the 1994-95
season, stands 6-foot-9.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, Reeves, whose playing weight is rumored to
be in the 290 range, checked into training camp with 40 bonus
pounds. In Monday's home-opener against Portland, Massenburg made
his first nine field-goal attempts, scored 20 points in the opening
half and finished the game with 24. Reeves played 13 minutes and
had five points.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rogers update: A sprain of the medial collateral ligament in
Rodney Rogers' right knee kept the forward in street clothes during
Tuesday's practice at Veterans Park SportsComplex in Carson. It
also was expected to keep Rogers from making the trip to Vancouver.
Maurice Taylor, who started at power forward in Sunday's loss to
Chicago, is expected to get the call again tonight.

EXCERPTS FROM REPORT BY OLYMPICS ETHICS PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With BC-OLY-SALTLAKE-NYT)  (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Following are excerpts from the report issued
Tuesday by an internal ethics committee of the Salt Lake City
Olympic Organizing Committee:
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Ethics was charged to investigate allegations of
impropriety in connection with the bid committee's efforts to win
the bids for the 1998 and 2002 Olympic Winter Games. The Board of
Ethics was not requested to, and did not, evaluate whether any of
the conduct discussed in this report indicates civil or criminal
liability.
</P>
<P>
   The bid committee had no written code of ethics until 1993, and
that code primarily addresses conflicts of interest and the use of
an individual's committee position for personal profit. This does
not mean, however, that there were no expected standards of conduct
governing the relationship between individuals associated with the
bid committee (or the organizing committee) and I.O.C. members. . .
. The Board of Ethics believes that it is a fundamental ethical
principle that bid cites should avoid even the appearance of
influencing the vote of an I.O.C. member by appealing to his or her
personal financial interest. Consistent with this standard, it is
inappropriate for any bid city to offer or give I.O.C. members
personal financial benefits unrelated to their professional
responsibilities. By the same token, no I.O.C. member should
solicit or accept such benefits. To do so would be inconsistent
with the oath taken by all I.O.C. members to keep themselves free
from any ``commercial influence.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   The bid committee for the 1998 Winter Games employed only a
handful of full-time paid personnel. In November 1989, Gov. Norman
Bangerter appointed Mr. (Tom) Welch as volunteer president of the
bid committee. Mr. (David) Johnson was hired as vice president in
the spring of 1990. . . . Craig Peterson, on loan from the State of
Utah, became chief administrative officer (the equivalent of chief
financial officer) and was responsible for the financial controls
and budgeting of the bid committee. Rod Hamson, a recent University
of Utah graduate who had worked as a volunteer for the referendum
effort, was hired to assist Mr. Peterson. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City's campaign for the 1998 Winter Games culminated
in June 1991, at the I.O.C. site selection meeting in Birmingham,
England. Like the other bid cities, including Nagano, Japan, Salt
Lake City sent a large contingent of paid personnel and local
business and government leaders to this three-day meeting for one
last lobbying effort. Each bid committee hosted parties in
Birmingham, delivered last-minute gifts to the I.O.C. members, and
made final personal appeals to the I.O.C. members. By all accounts,
Nagano outdid Salt Lake City in each of these areas. The exposure
to Nagano's well-oiled bid machine and to the excessive demands of
certain I.O.C. members would prove to be a watershed event that
shaped the approach of Mr. Welch and Mr. Johnson to the campaign
for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses described the Nagano bid effort as more
sophisticated and extravagant than Salt Lake City's. . . . Other
witnesses noted that Japanese companies made large donations,
reported to be in excess of $15 million, to the I.O.C. Museum in
Lausanne, Switzerland, shortly before the Birmingham meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The behavior of some I.O.C. members was eye-opening, as well.
Mr. Welch told the Board of Ethics that on the night before the
vote he was approached by at least two individuals on behalf of
I.O.C. members asking for cash in exchange for votes. Bid committee
personnel refused to make the requested payments. . . . Though
disappointed by the vote in Birmingham, the bid committee had good
reason to believe it could win the bid for the 2002 Games. Salt
Lake City had lost to Nagano by only four votes. . . .
</P>
<P>
   With the I.O.C.'s June 1995 meeting in Budapest, Hungary, to
select the site of the 2002 Winter Games nearly four years away,
few I.O.C. members were interested in visiting Salt Lake City in
the 1991-1992 time period. Instead, bid committee personnel
continued to visit I.O.C. members in their home countries and at
international Olympic meetings. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the relationships became very close. For
instance, in November 1991, the wife of Seiuli Paul Wallwork, an
I.O.C. member from Western Samoa, sent a letter to Mr. Welch
stating that she needed to speak with Mr. Welch on ``a matter of
great urgency.'' The substance of Mrs. Wallwork's request is
contained in a telegram dated Nov. 12, 1991, in which she states
that she needs Mr. Welch's assistance ``to help a friend in a
serious situation'' and asks Mr. Welch to remit $30,000 U.S.
dollars to her account in Auckland, New Zealand. The telegram also
states that the loan has ``nothing to do with Paul (Mr. Wallwork)
or bid city but (is to be) regard(ed) as (a) business arrangement
between you and me.'' In response, the bid committee's records show
that Mr. Welch authorized a $30,000 wire transfer from his
children's personal trust account to Mrs. Wallwork's account. . . .
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that Mr. Welch was lending money to Mrs.
Wallwork, he and other senior bid committee officials embarked on a
program to provide assistance to relatives of other I.O.C. members.
During the 1991-92 time period at least four relatives or
associates of I.O.C. members received tuition and/or living
assistance from bid committee funds. This assistance has been
widely described as a ``scholarship program,'' but in reality the
payments bore little resemblance to traditional scholarships. . . .
</P>
<P>
   During the 1993-94 time period, more I.O.C. members began
visiting Salt Lake City. . . . Among the I.O.C. members who visited
Salt Lake City, Jean-Claude Ganga merits special mention. Many
witnesses before the Board of Ethics described Mr. Ganga as the
I.O.C. member who most took advantage of the bid committee's and
the community's generosity; indeed, bid committee and S.L.O.C.
expenditures attributable to the Ganga family total more than
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in August 1993, Mr. Ganga became a frequent guest of
the bid committee. While it is typical for an I.O.C. member and a
companion to make a single site visit to a bid city, Mr. Ganga
visited Salt Lake City on at least a half-dozen occasions. He was
accompanied variously by his wife, Eugenie, his son, Jean-Jacques,
and his mother-in-law, Pauline Biyendolo. Since 1990, the total
amount paid by the bid committee and the organizing committee for
the travel expenses of Mr. Ganga and his family amounted to more
than $115,000; meals and lodging for the Gangas cost the bid
committee $13,900.

USC LOOKS TO JCs 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With only one scholarship available, USC has
turned its attention to some junior college players, hoping to find
one who can make a quick impact next season.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are recruiting Schea Cotton for the third time in
three years, despite having been spurned on two previous occasions.
Cotton is playing for Long Beach City College and recently received
his NCAA eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   He chose UCLA over USC in 1997 and then selected North Carolina
State last season but never became eligible under NCAA rules.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Compton College guard James Jones, who
played at Dominguez High with USC quarterback Jason Thomas. Jones,
who is 6-foot-5, has played shooting guard and some point guard,
although the Trojans believe he could play primarily at the point.
</P>
<P>
   Whomever USC signs, the Trojans have a dilemma ahead. It's
obvious they need another point guard to fill the gap created when
sophomore Kevin Augustine quit the team in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been recruiting one until the time Kevin left,''
USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``We need another one. Is there anyone
out there good enough to take you to another level of play? I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   USC was interested in Compton College guard Danny Walker, who
played with the Trojans two years ago before transferring to New
Mexico State. But Walker told USC he is not interested in returning
and is expected to attend either Nebraska or Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Another junior college player the Trojans are looking at is
Vernon Jackson of Saddleback College. Jackson, a 6-foot-4 shooting
guard, attended USC's game with Oregon last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   USC signed two players last November. Nathan Hair, a 6-foot-4
shooting guard from Capistrano Valley, and Luke Minor, a 7-3 center
from Blue Ridge Academy in Dyke, Va.
</P>
<P>
   USC should have another scholarship but was stripped of one for
the 1999-2000 school year because the university's director of
compliance misinterpreted NCAA rules and awarded one scholarship
above the limit last season.
</P>
<P>
   __ It's a rough conference: With seven games left, it's getting
tough to figure out where USC's next victory will appear. The
Trojans will be heavy underdogs in their next three contests: at
California, at Stanford and at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to get a win? Yeah. You want to get a win,'' Bibby
said. ``Where do you get it? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he is not disappointed by USC's 11-9 record because
he is slowly trying to rebuild the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an overnight success story. In one of the toughest
conferences in the nation from 1 to 10, we've hung in there against
the toughest teams,'' Bibby said. ``I'm pleased. There are so many
other people unpleased, I guess. But I'm the one that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wanted to win the championship and so do I. But is
that realistic with the people that we have? Not yet.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Time change: USC's game at Arizona State on March 6 has been
changed to 11 a.m. PST.

 SALT LAKE CITY: committee $13,900. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During their many trips to Salt Lake City, Mr. Ganga and his
family members received extensive medical care. For example, Mr.
Ganga was treated for hepatitis, his mother-in-law underwent knee
replacement surgery, and his wife had cosmetic surgery. Some
medical expenses were covered by health insurance. Other medical
expenses were paid directly by the bid committee. However, the bulk
of the medical expenses were furnished without charge by the health
care providers. Arrangements for free medical care from hospitals
and physicians were made by Mr. Welch. The value of the
complimentary health care received by Mr. Ganga and his family
could not be calculated from the financial records of the bid
committee. Intermountain Health Care has publicly reported that the
portion of the care which it donated had a value of approximately
$28,000. The bid committee directly paid $17,172.37 for health care
expenses for Mr. Ganga.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant event during this 1993-94 time
period is the beginning of direct payments made to I.O.C. members
without any supporting documentation for the purpose or use of the
funds. Some of these payments may have legitimate explanations; Mr.
Welch claimed that many were to assist N.O.C.'s in developing
countries. However, the fact that they were made by check or wire
directly to the I.O.C. member presents an appearance of
impropriety. Other payments were made to provide financial
assistance to individual I.O.C. members, an improper use of bid
committee funds no matter how sympathetic the need.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1993, the bid committee began a series of direct
payments to Charles Mukora, an I.O.C. member from Kenya. . . . From
November 1993 through May 1995, Mr. Mukora received direct payments
of bid committee funds in the amount of $34,650. . . . While Mr.
Welch stated that he authorized the first payment intending to
provide financial support for a meeting of athletic organizations
in Africa, he acknowledged that the remaining payments totaling
$29,450.00 were made to Mr. Mukora in response to his request for
personal financial assistance. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Ethics wrote to Mr. Mukora describing the
undocumented payments and requesting any information that would
explain their purpose. . . . Without differentiating the first
payment of $5,200.00 from the remainder, Mr. Mukora stated that the
funds had been used for the support of amateur athletics in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1993 and January 1994, two direct payments of bid
committee funds were made to Sergio Santander-Fantini, a member of
the I.O.C. from Chile, who also served as the president of the
Chilean National Olympic Committee throughout the bid period. Both
checks, totaling $20,050, lack proper documentation. While the bid
committee's files contain no information related to these payments,
interviews conducted by the Board of Ethics revealed that they were
authorized by Mr. Welch and used for Mr. Santander's political
campaign. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Ethics asked Mr. Santander to explain these
payments and furnish any supporting documentation. . . . Mr.
Santander responded that he had indeed received a political
contribution that he understood to have been made personally by Mr.
Welch and his wife. . . .
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 10, 1994, Mr. Johnson received a fax from the bid
committee's consultant, Muttaleb Ahmad, requesting that the bid
committee send $1,000 per month to the ``daughter'' of General
Gadir, the I.O.C. member from Sudan. From recent admissions by
General Gadir to the I.O.C., it appears that he has no daughter
named ``Zema,'' but rather that this is a pseudonym for General
Gadir himself. Mr. Johnson responded immediately to the request,
without any apparent knowledge of the existence of Zema Gadir, and
wire transfers began two weeks later. In any event, there is
little, if any, difference between these ``direct payments'' made
to I.O.C. members and the ``assistance'' given to relatives of
I.O.C. members. . . . On Oct. 24, 1994, $1,000 in bid committee
funds were wired to this account. Six more payments of $1,000 each
were made until June 7, 1995, one week prior to the I.O.C. site
selection meeting in Budapest. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, the bid committee began making payments to
support the training of three Sudanese athletes for the 1996
Olympic Summer Games in Atlanta. These payments amounted to more
than $40,000 and continued until August 1996. This arrangement
involved a complex relationship between the bid committee
(principally Mr. Johnson), the U.S.O.C., a consultant and General
Gadir. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the people discussed above, bid committee
officials made direct payments to several other I.O.C. members in
the last few months before the I.O.C. vote in Budapest. Again, many
of these payments are accompanied by notations referring to
``N.O.C. assistance,'' but have no backup documentation to indicate
their purpose or ultimate use.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1994, the bid committee's largesse to Mr. Ganga extended
beyond expensive gifts, lavish entertainment and expensive travel
and lodging to include unexplained direct payments to Mr. Ganga
himself. These unexplained payments total $70,010.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mr. Welch, Mr. Ganga often solicited assistance for
amateur athletic programs in the Congo. . . . On Oct. 25, 1994, the
bid committee issued a $10,000 check to First Security Bank on Mr.
Ganga's behalf. This check was endorsed ``for deposit only'' by Rod
Hamson, a bid committee employee, and deposited into an account at
First Security Bank, which had been opened in the name of Mr. Ganga
and his wife, Eugenie, on April 11, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 9, 1994, another check payable to First Security Bank
was issued on behalf of Mr. Ganga, this time in the amount of
$10,010. . . . Neither Mr. Welch nor Mr. Johnson could offer an
explanation for the purposes of these checks. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Payments to Mr. Ganga continued into 1995. On Jan. 20, 1995, the
bid committee issued a $20,000 check payable to the ``Jean Claude
Ganga N.O.C. Program,''and on March 27, 1995, a $30,000 check was
issued to the same payee. There is, however, no documentation
regarding this putative N.O.C. program. In response to questions
about these items, Mr. Welch stated that they were paid in
satisfaction of his earlier promise of a $50,000.00 contribution
from the bid committee to support amateur athletics in the Congo. .
. . However, both checks were endorsed for deposit only by Rod
Hamson and deposited in Mr. Ganga's private banking account at
First Security Bank. Mr. Welch specifically denied any knowledge
that the checks were deposited to Mr. Ganga's personal account.

 SALT LAKE CITY: personal account. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When questioned about these deposits, Mr. Hamson stated that he
was skeptical that the funds had been used for amateur athletics in
the Congo and expressed his suspicion that they were diverted to
Mr. Ganga's personal use. He reported that this belief was based on
a conversation with Mr. Welch shortly before the trip to Budapest,
in which Mr. Welch complained that he was being ``squeezed'' by Mr.
Ganga for money. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Assistance to the relatives of I.O.C. members and other N.O.C.
assistance payments did not end when Salt Lake City was awarded the
Olympic Games. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The organizing committee continued to pay for the expenses of
the three Sudanese athletes training for the 1996 Olympic Summer
Games in Atlanta. In an exchange of E-mail messages on Nov. 11,
1995, U.S.O.C. officials considered discontinuing payments for the
athletes' training, but ultimately conceded that the program was
necessary to the continued good graces of the ``Sudanese I.O.C.
members'':
</P>
<P>
   ALFREDO LA MONT: I need to talk to you about the Sudanese
athletes. S.L.C. wants to send them back to us. Apparently what we
all hoped for didn't work and we need to help pay our debt to the
Sudanese I.O.C. members. Call me to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   JIM PAGE: How much is the debt? These athletes all got injured
the last time they were here. I don't think this is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ALFREDO LA MONT: Our and S.L.C.'s debt is to train them for
Atlanta. . . . We made the offer, we tried to get out of it, we
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   JIM PAGE: How did we acquire this debt? . . .
</P>
<P>
   ALFREDO LA MONT: A lot of promises were made to secure votes. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   TOM WILKINSON: Seems to me a deal is a deal and Sudan delivered.
Games aren't that far away. Seriously doubt these three guys will
take anything away from any athlete we have training here. May need
Sudan again in future. Don't burn bridges.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned by the Board of Ethics about this exchange,
David Johnson stated that the U.S.O.C. expected S.L.O.C. to pick up
a share of the cost of training these athletes. When pressed on
certain phrases used in the E-mail (specifically, ``our debt to the
Sudanese,'' ``the Sudanese delivered,'' ``promises were made to
secure votes'' and ``may need Sudan again in the future''), Mr.
Johnson indicated that this was standard operating procedure for
the U.S.O.C. . . . .

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As more than 1,000 people gathered Tuesday in the
second angry demonstration in three days to protest the killing of
an unarmed African street vendor by four police officers, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani canceled a political trip to Texas so he could
meet with the victim's parents and perhaps attend a memorial
service Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's announcement came as the mother of the victim
arrived in New York from Guinea and visited the Bronx building
where her son, Amadou Diallo, 22, died in a barrage of 41 bullets
last Thursday, for reasons still unexplained. Protesters have
denounced the shooting and called for the federal government to
take over the inquiry, but there were indications Tuesday that
federal prosecutors would defer to the Bronx district attorney for
now.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon, Diallo's mother, Kadiadou, stepped out of a
dark police van at the site of the shooting, crumpled to the
street, was helped to her feet, then cried out ``Amadou, Amadou,
Amadou.'' She was lifted by both arms up the stairs to the
apartment building vestibule at 1157 Wheeler Ave., which was filled
with flowers and, votive candles and pock-marked with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   When she re-emerged half an hour later, she said softly in
English that ``justice must be done'' and that she wanted to take
her son and bury him at home.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration over the killing took place at lunchtime
outside the Federal Courthouse in Foley Square, where protesters
chanted for more than two hours to demand that federal officials
take charge of the investigation into Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can shoot anyone 41 times,'' said the Rev. Al
Sharpton, who led the protest, ``they can shoot anyone 41 times. It
may start with blacks and Latinos, but it can go everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many in the crowd were apparently veterans of similar
protests, others said they were demonstrating for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take some of the responsibility for what happened,'' said
Roger Bobb, a 31-year-old lawyer from Crown Heights, who said he
had never participated in a protest before. ``I've sat back too
long while this kind of thing happens time and time again. I feel
that as black people, we have not done enough to show Mayor
Giuliani that we will not tolerate this.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have been unable to say why the four white
officers thought their lives were in jeopardy or why they fired so
many times at Diallo. Diallo, who came to America more than two
years ago from Guinea and had no criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony of the four police officers _ all members of an
aggressive Street Crimes Unit and three of them involved in prior
shootings _ is important because they are apparently the only
witnesses. The officers have said they believed that Diallo had a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department has not yet interviewed the officers
because police officials are deferring to the Bronx district
attorney. The four have also not been questioned by the district
attorney's investigators, because their lawyer has been negotiating
the terms under which they would appear before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   A police official said that detectives have yet to find a
witness who saw what happened at the outset of the incident, when
the police officers first encountered Diallo in the vestibule.
</P>
<P>
   But Francis Riva, 38, who lives across Wheeler Avenue from the
shooting scene, said he told investigators Monday that he heard
three shots initially. ``There was a pause between shots,'' he
said. ``Then it sounded like they all started firing at once.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers were patrolling in an unmarked car looking for a
serial rapist.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani has expressed concern and sympathy about Diallo's
death, he continued to deny Tuesday that the shooting was any
indication of a pattern of excessive force by the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of force by the department, the use of weapons is
down, over the last four or five years, dramatically,'' he said,
although accusations against the police for misconduct have risen
sharply in New York in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's death has become a major issue for the administration
as it draws national attention to what critics argue is the dark
side to Giuliani's achievements in bringing down crime _ the sense
that aggressive police enforcement has created a climate that can
breed brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's trip to Texas would have been one of the most
prominent in a series of political trips he is making around the
country as a potential candidate for higher office. He was to have
made a speech Thursday in Dallas, and then had plans to fly to
Austin to stay overnight at the Governor's Mansion with Gov. George
W. Bush, a leading contender for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000. Giuliani and Bush had plans for a joint press
conference Friday. Aides to the mayor said the trip would be
rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Tuesday at City Hall that a final decision by a
grand jury on whether the officers' actions were criminal is likely
to take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense for me to comment on it every day
because I'm not conducting the investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four officers, Edward McMellon, fell during the
encounter with Diallo, injuring his tailbone. But investigators
said they have yet to determine whether that fall played any role
in the incident, such as giving his fellow officers the false
impression that he had been hit by a gunshot.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday at the protest, Diallo's uncle, Mamdou Diallo, spoke to
the crowd. ``I love my nephew deeply and I will miss him daily,''
he said. ``And my sadness is made greater knowing that the four
people who took his life are still walking free.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd's demand that the case be taken over by federal
investigators will apparently not be met. Tuesday the lawyer for
the four officers, Stephen Worth, said that lawyers in the U.S.
attorney's office had assured him that they would monitor the case
but not take it from Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson. In
return, Worth said his clients would ``most likely'' testify before
a state grand jury, which is expected to begin hearing evidence
later this week.

IN GOTTI CASE, ANOTHER DEFENDANT PLEADS GUILTY TO REDUCED CHARGES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another pretrial deal in the racketeering case
against John A. Gotti, a co-defendant described by prosecutors as a
high-ranking member of the Gambino crime family pleaded guilty
Tuesday to reduced federal charges of evading taxes on $260,000 in
illegal gambling profits.
</P>
<P>
   Salvatore Locascio, 39, was indicted last year with Gotti, the
accused Gambino leader, on charges that could have brought a
sentence of up to 20 years in prison. He now faces a maximum term
of 16 months and will pay a forfeiture of $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The government, in accepting the plea, dropped charges that
Locascio extorted payoffs from the owners and employees of Scores,
the Manhattan strip club, and that he ran illegal gambling and
loansharking rings. ``This is a vindication that he had nothing to
do with Scores or any continuing criminal activity,'' Locascio's
lawyer, Jay Goldberg, said of the plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The plea by Locascio in federal District Court in White Plains
reduced Gotti's co-defendants to four men from the original 22 who
were indicted in January 1998 on accusations that they participated
in a huge criminal enterprise in the New York City region led by
Gotti.
</P>
<P>
   Serita Kedia, a lawyer for Gotti, said that her client had
rejected plea deals and was confident of being acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti, who will turn 35 on Sunday, is the son of John J. Gotti,
58, who law enforcement officials say is the boss of the Gambino
family even though he is serving a life sentence for racketeering
and murder. The younger Gotti, known as Junior, was identified in
the indictment as the acting Gambino boss on behalf of his father.
</P>
<P>
   Locascio, the indictment asserted, is a capo or captain in the
Gambino group. He is the son of Frank Locascio, 66, who was
convicted of the same charges as the elder Gotti and is also
serving a life sentence. The elder Locascio, according to the
authorities, held the No. 2 and No. 3 posts in the Gambino family
before his conviction.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Within hours of arriving from her homeland, Guinea,
on Tuesday, the mother of Amadou Diallo stepped from a dark police
van a few yards from where her unarmed son was killed last
Thursday, and instantly crumpled to the street. ``Wait, wait,
wait,'' she moaned, clutching her stomach as though in pain, while
police officers held back a crowd of reporters and grieving and
angry bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Kadiadou Diallo cried, ``Amadou, Amadou,'' and was half-carried
by police officials in business suits and Guinean diplomats in
traditional robes into the modest apartment house at 1157 Wheeler
Ave. in the Bronx where police had fired 41 times at her son. The
bullet holes riddling the building's doorframe and hallway had been
marked and numbered with a black felt-tip pen.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo, wearing a blue raincoat and with a pale green scarf
draped over her head, wailed as she was escorted up the steps where
a spray of blood was still faintly visible. Diallo's father, a
businessman, is expected to arrive Wednesday or Thursday, and the
family will then meet with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Once Mrs. Diallo entered the vestibule, which was heaped with
flowers and votive candles placed there by neighbors, her wails
turned to screams that were audible from the street. She was
followed inside by a representative from the Senegalese Embassy,
Abid Denj; the president of the Guinean Association of America,
Mohamed Jalloh, and several of Amadou Diallo's friends and
roommates.
</P>
<P>
   About 45 minutes later, Mrs. Diallo emerged and, speaking softly
in careful English, said, ``I want to bring him home to bury him.''
Her son was from a ``good family,'' she added. Just before climbing
back into the police van, she was asked by a reporter whether she
had a message for New Yorkers. She did.
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``Justice must be done.''

JONES HAS NOT USE FOR AN AGENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Eddie Jones will be a free agent in the summer of 2000
and it's safe to say that, wherever he plays, he has a firm idea
what he's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of Milwaukee's Ray Allen, Jones has fired his
agent, Sal DiFazio, in favor of using a charge-by-the-hour lawyer
to negotiate his next contract. Like Allen, Jones aims to get the
maximum allowed under the new labor deal _ in his case, a starting
salary of $11 million a season _ so there's no use paying an agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't have to have an agent to go in there and
negotiate a deal for you,'' Jones said. ``It wasn't a difficult
decision at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Jones can command the max has yet to be seen, so his
decision is perhaps a bit of a gamble. He fired DiFazio two weeks
ago, but he had been pondering the move for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew during the lockout, all the agents want to fool you and
tell you this was a bad deal. In reality, it wasn't a bad deal, it
was just cutting them out.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jones is hiring an attorney who is certified by the players
association, though the deal isn't final and he can't name the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's not altogether clear where Jones will be seeking
that lucrative new deal. Reports last week had him headed to
Charlotte in a trade for Glen Rice, and there have been no shortage
of rumors involving Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of that stuff is far-fetched,'' he said. But of the Rice
trade, he said, ``I know that was possible'' and might not be a
dead issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it's difficult to know what his future holds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When's the (trade) deadline?'' March 11. ``The 11th, I'll
know.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Oops: Derek Fisher, definitely among the league's nice guys,
is establishing a bad-boy reputation in San Antonio. Last year, he
tangled with 7-foot Will Perdue and was tossed from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he leaped out of bounds near the Lakers bench to
save a stray ball, and in midair, tried to bounce it off the Spurs'
Sean Elliott. Unfortunately, his aim wasn't so great _ he nailed
Elliott in the face. The move drew boos from the Alamodome crowd,
but it was clearly not intended to injure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it intentionally but not in the facial area or nothing
like that,'' Fisher said. ``I tried to apologize, but he couldn't
really see me. Hopefully, he knows who I am as a player and next
time he won't try to get me back.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Rodmanesque: Kobe Bryant has posted double figures in
rebounds in all three games and is averaging 10.7 per game, far in
excess of the 3.1 he averaged as a reserve last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mindset coming into the season was to be a better
rebounder,'' he said. ``Obviously, starting gives me a chance to
get more rebounds than coming off the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   But can he sustain the trend? He knew that question was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you guys go,'' a smiling Bryant said to reporters,
``putting up expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Travis Knight, who missed the last two games
with the flu, rejoined the team and is expected to be available for
tonight's game against Denver. Rick Fox, suffering from sore feet
and bone spurs in his right foot, was waiting for new athletic
insoles and said he might be back by Sunday, when the Lakers play
host to Indiana.

<P>
   A: ``The system operates much like a severe-weather
disruption,'' airline spokesman Tim Smith said. ``We try to pick
flights to cancel where the fewest passengers are disrupted and
where those passengers can be `reaccommodated' on other flights.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How far in advance are flights canceled?
</P>
<P>
   A. That depends on when the pilots call to say they will not be
flying, Smith said. In some cases, the airline knows a day in
advance. In others, there might be a couple of hours' notice. ``We
already know several hundred flights (Wednesday) will be canceled
based on calls we have already received,'' he said. ``But by no
means is that the final number.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can customers check on flights?
</P>
<P>
   A: To check before going to the airport, call the American
Airlines reservations line at (800) 433-7300, or call the automated
Dial-a-Flight line at (800) 223-5436, Smith said. Also, anyone with
Internet access can check flights on the airline Web site at
www.aa.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens if a flight is canceled?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``As soon as we know that a flight is being canceled, our
reservations agents begin trying to reach customers to try to
`reaccommodate' them,'' Smith said. ``We try to reach them before
they get to the airport, and apparently we have been pretty
successful because we have not had long lines at the terminals at
D/FW Airport. We have been able to get most people `reaccommodated'
on American or other carriers. The exceptions are wide-body
international flights where there is maybe just one flight a day
and not many options. There have been more disruptions on those
flights than domestically.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many flights at D/FW were canceled Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   A: The airline canceled 173 outbound flights at D/FW, about
one-third of its usual D/FW schedule of 524 departures a day, Smith
said. Flights by American's commuter partner, American Eagle, have
not been disrupted, but its passenger counts are reduced because
many passengers were to have connected to American flights that
were canceled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many passengers were affected?
</P>
<P>
   A. The airline has no exact figures but said that about 100
passengers per flight is typical, which means that flights with
more than 17,000 passengers were canceled Tuesday at D/FW. That's
about one-third of the 50,000 passengers who fly on American from
D/FW on a typical day, Smith said. American operates about 62.5
percent of the passenger flights at D/FW each day. The
second-busiest airline is Delta, with about 17 percent.

 &HT;    Texas class-action issue before high court
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Margaret Dunayer points to the rusted hood of
her 1990 Ford pickup truck, a rough reddish-brown square circled on
its edge by remnants of the original deep blue.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with her paint job and thousands of other Ford Motor
Co. cars and trucks built in the 1980s and early '90s was that Ford
used a new painting method that didn't stand the test of time. But
when Dunayer asked the dealer and the company to repaint her truck,
they both said no.
</P>
<P>
   So the Round Rock, Texas woman, a state agency analyst, sued the
only way she says she could afford, by joining in a consumer class
action to get the $1,600 or so to fix her truck.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the case can proceed involving as many as 100,000 other
Texas Ford owners is up to the Texas Supreme Court, which heard
arguments Tuesday. But the larger issue of class-action lawsuits is
also being debated in the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Two leading state tort-reform groups, the Texas Civil Justice
League and Texans for Lawsuit Reform, have put high priority on
passing restrictions on class actions. They want lawmakers to give
the Supreme Court broader authority to review a trial judge's
decision establishing a class before a trial. Currently, Supreme
Court reviews rarely occur before the trial; that decision
generally is left to the intermediate courts of appeals after the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Troy Fraser (R-Horseshoe Bay) has filed a bill that would
change that. Another bill, by Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, would
command dismissal of a class action if a state agency could have
helped fix a problem but the administrative solution was never
sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen too many cases where the attorneys reap millions
and the class gets pennies,'' said Ken Hoagland of Houston,
spokesman for Texans for Lawsuit Reform. ``Once a class action is
certified, they almost never go to trial. They will be settled.
That suggests a need for reform in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates call the proposed restrictions unnecessary
hurdles for people like Dunayer.
</P>
<P>
   Dunayer said she first noticed what appeared to be chips cut by
flying gravel on her hood little more than a year after she bought
the truck. But not until two years later did she discover that
paint was flaking off other Ford cars and trucks. And in some cases
Ford had been repainting them.
</P>
<P>
   She never was told about Ford's program, Dunayer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that time,'' she said, ``Ford decided they weren't going to
do it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer lawyers say her case represents a classic example of
why consumer class lawsuits are needed: Small, individual claims
aren't worth the expense for one person's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 100,000 claims. That's an argument for judicial
economy,'' said Reggie James, Southwest regional director for
Consumers Union. ``But the real argument is that none of these
claims would be brought.''
</P>
<P>
   The case argued Tuesday was before the court by a special
provision the Legislature passed in 1997 while the Ford case was
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Ford contends too many differences exist between Dunayer's case
and those of other Texas Ford owners. The car company argued that
the peeling paint might be caused by many factors, such as the
owners' care or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Class actions must, at their core, raise common complaints
shared by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Osler McCarthy writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

SENATOR SPLITTING HIS VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 and JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton said Tuesday he will vote ``with
clear conscience and saddened heart'' to remove President Clinton
from office for obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton has debased the presidency now and, if he is
allowed to remain in office, the low level to which he has brought
the presidency will continue, and that is not tolerable,'' Gorton,
R-Wash., said in a lengthy statement. ``I cannot will to my
children and grandchildren the proposition that a president stands
above the law and can systematically obstruct justice simply
because both his polls and the Dow Jones index are high.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton said he will vote against convicting Clinton of
perjury. Gorton said he believes the perjury charge against Clinton
is not significant enough to lead to the president's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's vote is sure to become an issue if the state's senior
senator follows through on his pledge to seek a fourth term next
year. Democrats, energized by public unhappiness with Congress's
handling of the Clinton scandal, already are criticizing Gorton for
his decision to support conviction, while the conservative American
Heritage Party is angry that Gorton hasn't been firmer in his
opposition to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``After viewing the evidence, he is doing something that is
clearly not politically in his best interest,'' said state GOP
Chairman Dale Foreman. ``If he had voted to convict on both counts,
he would have solidified support of his conservative base in the
state. By voting `yes' on one and `no' on the other, it will raise
questions by the American Heritage Party about whether they should
run a candidate against him. And that would be a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has twice won a plurality of support at the polls from
Washington state voters, and three polls last fall noted Clinton's
continuing popularity in the state. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., is
expected to vote against removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   In splitting his vote on the two impeachment articles, Gorton is
joining what is expected to be a minority of Republican senators.
Virtually all Republicans are expected to vote to convict Clinton
of obstruction of justice, but they are divided on the perjury
allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are virtually unanimous in their opposition to
convicting Clinton, and the Senate is expected to fail to muster
the two-thirds support for either charge that would result in
Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the partisan divide, Gorton's staff is reminding
reporters that in 1973, as state attorney general, he called for
the resignation of President Nixon, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said the country will suffer minimal harm if Clinton is
ousted, but said the country will be damaged if Clinton remains in
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we acquit; if we say that some perjuries, some obstructions
of justice, some clear and conscious violations of a formal oath
are free from our sanction, the Republic and its institutions will
be weakened,'' Gorton said. ``One exception or excuse will lead to
another. The right of the most powerful of our leaders to act
outside the law _ or in violation of the law _ will be
established.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, who was the first of 18 senators to speak during the
first round of closed deliberations in the Senate Tuesday,
announced his position with a written statement at 8 p.m. and then
declined to be interviewed. Gorton has repeatedly claimed that he
wanted to insulate himself from the politics of impeachment _ even
asking his staff not to tell him about constituent phone calls on
the issue.

GIULIANI PRESSES FOR PACT TO PRIVATIZE CITY'S AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vowing that the city would never renew its lease with
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani forged ahead Tuesday with his idea of formally asking
private companies whether they are interested in operating the
city's two airports.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's aides said he hoped to sign a binding, long-term
agreement to take effect when the Port Authority lease expires at
the end of 2015, at least 14 years after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's remarks, at a City Hall news conference, and
interviews with his aides suggested that he is so intent on
wresting control of the airports from the Port Authority and so
confident of the potential benefits that in the next year or two he
will sign an agreement binding on the city through at least the
next four mayoral elections.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they hoped that having an agreement might
persuade the Port Authority to end its lease early. Authority
officials have said that is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who renewed his call for the city to reclaim La
Guardia and Kennedy International Airports during his State of the
City address in January, has long accused the Port Authority of
favoring New Jersey and diverting profits from New York's airports
to money-losing ventures like the PATH commuter train system. In
announcing his request for ``expressions of interest'' from airport
management companies Tuesday, he roundly criticized the authority's
management.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two of the worst airports in America, for large
airports,'' Giuliani said. ``This is the worst form of a government
bureaucracy that is running something that should be run by private
enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority officials declined to comment on Giuliani's
announcement. Under terms of its lease, signed in 1947, the Port
Authority has paid the city varying amounts each year, depending on
the profit it makes by operating the airports, including revenue
from terminal rentals, parking charges and flight fees. Capital
expenses reduce the amount paid to the city.
</P>
<P>
   The annual amount paid to the city has been as little as $3.1
million in 1993, slightly more than the minimum set in the lease,
and as much as $87.2 million in 1987. Giuliani has suggested that
more efficient management of the airport by a private company could
increase the city's profits by up to $200 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today is the first step in the process that will
result in the privatization of the airports,'' said Anthony Coles,
a senior adviser to the mayor. After soliciting proposals, the city
will enter into a contract with the best management company, Coles
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what immediate effect the mayor's proposal would
have on plans to upgrade New York's airports. New Jersey Gov.
Christie Whitman, who had responded to Giuliani's State of the City
speech by saying that the Port Authority should reconsider whether
to spend billions of dollars on the improvements, maintained that
position Tuesday.

A BLACK PRIVATE SCHOOL PREPARES FOR A NEW HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID J. DENT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When her eldest son was ready for kindergarten, Ora
Abdur-Razzaq, a homemaker with a degree in English, decided the
best classroom would be their apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
A year later, she was on a new career track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a school for my children,'' she said. ``I couldn't
continue at home like that. And then there were other people who
wanted me to do with their children what I did with mine. So we
started a school.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abdur-Razzaq's Cush Campus Schools has quietly provided a
low-tuition alternative for inner-city youth since 1971. Now, with
125 students and 16 teachers, it has grown far beyond the
parameters of the three-story building it leases from a Crown
Heights church.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, with a benefit auction at B.Smith's restaurant in
Manhattan, Cush embarks on a campaign to raise $5 million toward a
new home: an abandoned day-care center to be renovated by the Pratt
Planning and Architectural Collaborative, a nonprofit architectural
firm based at the Pratt Institute.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 150 private secular schools founded by
African-Americans across the country, including eight in New York
City, two on Long Island, one in Westchester County and three in
New Jersey, according to the Institute for Independent Education.
Many of the schools were founded like Cush: veterans of the 1960s
Black Power movement, frustrated with public schools, transformed
living rooms, basements and brownstones into small schools with a
pan-African focus.
</P>
<P>
   Many now have growing enrollments and waiting lists. That, and
the high costs of providing education, from teacher salaries to new
technology, are nudging these modest schools into larger arenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black private schools are at a crossroads because there are
many more demands on them with the explosion of information and
technology,'' said Joan Ratteray, executive director of the
Institute for Independent Education. ``Many of these schools have
had low tuition and they have kept it that way for many, many years
so they could help families in the communities keep coming to the
schools. Funding is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically charged issues like school choice and vouchers are
creating delicate new alliances. Some schools have signed on with
business groups and conservative foundations that provide
scholarships for inner-city students to attend private schools,
although traditional black leadership has waged legal battles
against vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now in our district, less than 50 percent of students
are reading on grade level,'' said Krim Abdur-Razzaq, 27, Cush's
development coordinator (and its founder's youngest son).
``Vouchers would give us a chance to serve some of these
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Cush is on the list of eligible schools for School Choice
Partnerships in New York, which provide $1,400 a year each for
1,000 students toward private tuition for the next three years. The
Marcus Garvey School, a private school founded by blacks in Los
Angeles, is part of a similar program financed by Wall Street
investors and celebrities. It offers $8 million in scholarships for
low-income children to attend private schools in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Cush, with its first graduates in the work force and a second
wave in college, cannot rely heavily on rich alumni and parents, as
do many established independent schools.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Abdur-Razzaq, 33, Cush's first graduate, who is now an
assistant vice president of the New York City Health and Hospitals
Corp. and chairman of the school's board of trustees, says the
school's budget has relied largely on tuition. ``In the '70s,'' he
said, ``it was not easy, but much easier, to start a school with
little or no money. Nowadays, you can't have a school and expect
your students to learn without the latest technology.`
</P>
<P>
   At Cush, which is divided into three schools covering all
grades, tuition has risen from $1,000 that first year to $5,700 _
more than twice the average of $2,480 for black private schools,
Ms. Ratteray said. While still considerably lower than the $14,150
median cost of an established independent school in New York City,
that puts Cush out of reach of many low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abdur-Razzaq says the school has tried to retain a
familylike atmosphere as it has grown. Students address teachers by
prefixing their first names with ``brother'' and ``sister.''
Classes have fewer than 15 students.
</P>
<P>
   Most combine students of two grade levels, and instruction is
largely individualized with students working at their own pace. In
1997-98, 100 percent of Cush third graders scored at or above grade
level in reading and math on Stanford Achievement Tests, while 13
of 15 sixth graders scored above level.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Campbell said his son, Damany, 13, did not receive enough
attention in the public school he attended before Cush. ``The
teachers had 30 or more students and there were so many students,
teachers couldn't teach,'' he said. ``At Cush, there are fewer
students and you don't have the disruptions from students that keep
teachers from teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Khalid Rahman, 21, a Cush graduate who is now a senior at Boston
University, recalls catching the conversations of peers on his
block as he walked to Cush and they traveled to the neighborhood
school. ``They would talk about fights in class and laugh about
arguments with teachers, things that never happened at my school,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a Thursday ritual, students in their uniforms _ kente-design
vests, blue ties, white shirts and dark pants or skirts _ file into
the gymnasium for the weekly assembly, a presentation of one of the
classes. On this day, a class of combined fourth and fifth graders
takes the stage to present two versions of ``Little Red Riding
Hood,'' one to appeal to the lower school and one to engage
students in upper grades.
</P>
<P>
   Lower graders roar with laughter when Little Red Riding Hood
discovers the Big Bad Wolf is in Grandma's bed. There are no cheers
during the second version, ``Little Red in the Hood,'' when Wolf, a
gang member, tries to use peer pressure to woo Little Red into a
gang and to use and sell drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send a message not to go with strangers, and to
upper schools not to take drugs,'' said Damany Campbell, ``so we
actually combined it all together.''

EX-LAKER SAYS LIFE ISN'T BAD IN DENVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Somewhere between Salt Lake City and Cancun, Nick Van
Exel forfeited his lifetime pass to sun, fun and championship
dreams in L.A. and earned a one-way ticket to this sub-freezing,
sub-.500 outpost of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Where it all went wrong for the former Lakers All-Star isn't
totally clear, even seven months after his trade to the Denver
Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   It surely began with his combative relationship with coach Del
Harris. But there was much more to the decision that ultimately
prompted the team that drafted Van Exel in 1993 to trade him five
draft nights later, last June.
</P>
<P>
   There were concerns over his attitude but also his two bad
knees. There was his curious decision to give up his starting job
when he returned from knee surgery last spring. There was his role
in the Lakers' four-game collapse to Utah in the conference finals
in May. And, of course, there was his infamous ``Cancun'' chant in
the huddle of Game 4 of that watershed series.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers brass came to a sad conclusion: Van Exel had given up on
his team. And it was time for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Now Van Exel is facing his old team for the first time as a
Nugget tonight at McNichols Arena. He's had ample time to adjust to
his new surroundings, to high altitudes and low expectations. To
thin air and even thinner championship prospects.
</P>
<P>
   And he's fine with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was better that I moved on. This is a better
situation for me,'' Van Exel said in a recent telephone interview.
``I'm not really worried about the Lakers anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the 27-year-old Van Exel says he's past the shock
and the bitterness, it's difficult for him not to think it was the
Lakers who, in a panic, gave up on him. A scapegoat for the sweep
against Utah? He has no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, of course,'' he said. ``When it was all said and
done, I was the guy who quote-unquote `gave up on the team' and
didn't want to win.... The players, they know I would never do
that. Jerry West, he knows I would never do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But West, the Lakers executive vice president, wasn't so sure.
He had tolerated Van Exel's moodiness and occasional misdeeds _ the
forearm shiver to referee Ron Garretson in 1996, the nationally
televised blowup with Harris in Game 4 of the conference semifinals
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What West would not tolerate was an All-Star player shunning his
commitment to the team. And that's what West saw last year in the
conference finals, a 4-0 sweep by the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one particular game where when you watch him, I was
let down, I'll tell you that,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Van Exel didn't want to be there _ a message Van
Exel himself perpetuated in Game 4, when he shouted ``Cancun!''
instead of the traditional ``Lakers!'' chant when the Lakers broke
the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never heard anything in my life like that,'' West said.
```Shocked' doesn't begin to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, of course, lost the series that day, and in the
painful aftermath, team captain Shaquille O'Neal, without naming
names, declared that anyone who didn't want to win should ``get off
my team.'' A month later, Van Exel was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they don't understand was Cancun was a little vacation
spot that was already (planned),'' Van Exel said. ``I say things
like that all the time ... just to keep the guys loose and
laughing.... It gets blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Kobe Bryant, who is not among Van Exel's staunch supporters
and called the trade ``a no-brainer,'' said the Cancun incident was
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just trying to be funny or lighten it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And though Bryant admitted Van Exel sometimes had ``a negative
influence on people,'' he added, ``I think people are giving Nick
way too much credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet management saw other signs that Van Exel's dedication was
waning. In February, Van Exel developed a clicking sensation in his
right knee, and though doctors said it was not serious, he chose
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   During Van Exel's month-long absence, backup point guard Derek
Fisher had the Lakers on a roll, so when Van Exel was ready to play
again, he chose to come off the bench for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team was playing well,'' Van Exel said, and he didn't want
to mess with a good thing. ``I guess they didn't see it that way.
They thought I was giving up on the team, which wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Said West, ``I don't know if he gave up on the team, but I just
would have preferred him to say, `I'm the leader on this team, I
want to start.' I think the leader of your team has to be a leader
at all times. Sometimes, he seemed not to want that
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   On a purely practical level, Van Exel's departure has
strengthened the Lakers in several ways, including making practice
more competitive. Van Exel's knees often kept him out of workouts,
or he'd be running half speed. And while it's an exaggeration to
say he was a cancer in the locker room, the tensions between Van
Exel and Harris sometimes spilled over into other corners of the
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awkward to trade someone who's an All-Star player, but
I think in the long run it will be better for him and for the
Lakers,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are some hard feelings on both sides. West, expressing
sadness over the decision, said he tried to call Van Exel several
times, to no avail. Van Exel disputed that, saying, ``That's just
him telling the media that so he looks good in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel did receive a fax from West before the season opener
last Friday but waved it off as meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   And while Van Exel, joined by buddy Antonio McDyess, now feels
comfortable in Denver and plans to finish his career here, he said
West intended the trade as a form of punishment. ``I asked for a
trade a couple years earlier. I was told that if I were to be
traded, it would be a place like Vancouver or someplace cold. I
knew I wouldn't be traded to a team that has a chance to win a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his teammates, Van Exel said he missed friends Eddie
Jones, Corie Blount and Elden Campbell. Jones, who was upset over
the trade of his backcourt mate, said friendship is thicker than
basketball, and ``I can't wait to see him.'' But outside of that
group, there are few Lakers who have strong feelings for Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   Of seeing him tonight, Bryant said, ``Whatever. No big deal. I
really don't care if he plays or doesn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel said he will take the court with nothing to prove. The
Lakers, after all, know what he's capable of _ the
momentum-changing 3-pointers, the buzzer-beaters, the exciting
plays _ things West openly admits the team will miss.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel's trying to put old feelings behind him. He's even
changed jersey numbers, to 31, which he wore at Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just wanted to get back to my college days and forget about
old No.9. Get those things out of my system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But of tonight's game, he admitted, ``It's gonna be a lot of fun
playing those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones echoed the sentiment. ``It's gonna be fun,'' he said,
``because you know he's gonna try to come out and kill us.''

BROWNS START TO BUILD WITH YOUNG PLAYERS IN EXPANSION DRAFT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new Cleveland Browns _ primarily younger, inexperienced,
cheaper and relatively unknown players _ were selected Tuesday in
the National Football League expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 adoring fans, including members of the Dawg
Pound, gathered at the Canton Civic Center in Ohio to watch the
rebirth of pro football in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns chose 37 players from a pool of 150 provided by the
other 30 NFL teams. They will complete their roster from free agent
and college draft signings. In September, the franchise begins play
once again in the American Football Conference Central Division
after a three-season absence in Cleveland. Art Modell moved the
original Browns to Baltimore three years ago .
</P>
<P>
   A new stadium, new owners, a new coaching staff, yet plenty of
history and rabid fans make Cleveland a hot spot and the Browns a
hot team for NFL players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure wanted to come here,'' said Jim Pyne, the former
Detroit Lions center, who was Cleveland's first selection. ``I
asked to come here. It's a great situation. Five years ago I was
drafted out of Virginia Tech in the seventh round by Tampa Bay, and
I was the 200th player chosen. Back then I didn't know if I would
be drafted or if I'd even make it in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I had an idea I was coming here, but I didn't know a I'd
be the first pick. It's an honor. There is good leadership here and
a bright future. Expansion teams in Carolina and Jacksonville have
shown you can win. It's not a death sentence at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a cool little flavor going in Cleveland, and I'm glad
to be a part of it,'' said Hurvin McCormick, a defensive end from
the Dallas Cowboys, who was the Browns' second choice Tuesday.
``These fans are already geeked. It's the Dawg Pound all over
again, but we're still part of something being built from the
ground up. I'm a fifth-year guy and it's time for me to move on to
a new place and showcase my talent. It's time for me to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns looked to build on a foundation of youth. They are
counting on this nucleus providing the teeth of their special
teams. And if a few starters emerge from this bunch, that will be a
bonus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Jets lost guard Jim Bundren to Cleveland; he was a rookie
from Clemson last season. The Giants lost two players, cornerback
Kory Blackwell and safety Brandon Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we heard, those were the two players we would
likely lose, and that's what happened,'' Giants General Manager
Ernie Accorsi said. ``We were able to keep Derek Engler at center,
and we felt we had to, given the situation on our offensive line.
In Blackwell, we lost potential; he is a young guy and he can run.
He played in the World League last year and improved, and any young
guy who can run at cornerback has a chance. Sanders was an
excellent special-teams player. We've got guys who can fill these
spots, but you hate to lose anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Accorsi saw what the rest of the league did: the Browns selected
young players with lower-end salaries, unproven players who have
shown promise. The Cleveland plan was to use the expansion draft as
a base on which to build not just for the 1999 season but also for
well beyond.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has decided to begin an
inquiry to determine whether Kenneth Starr's prosecutors misled
Attorney General Janet Reno about possible conflicts of interest
when they obtained permission to investigate the Lewinsky matter in
January 1998, government officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among other concerns, the inquiry will focus on whether the
prosecutors were truthful when they asserted that there had been no
contacts between Starr's office and the Paula Jones' legal team in
the weeks leading up to Starr's decision to ask Reno to expand his
inquiry beyond the Whitewater matter, said the officials, who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, documentation has emerged that indicates there
were conversations between a prosecutor in Starr's office and a
lawyer working behind the scenes with the Jones legal team from
November 1997 to January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of newly disclosed notes taken at the initial
meetings on Jan. 15 and Jan. 16, 1998, between Starr's prosecutors
and Justice Department officials, shows that the prosecutors flatly
asserted that there had been no contacts with the Jones team.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Eric H. Holder Jr., the deputy attorney general,
wrote in his three pages of notes of a Jan. 15, 1998, meeting with
Starr's prosecutors: ``They've had no contact with plaintiff's
attys.''
</P>
<P>
   Handwritten notes by two other Justice Department officials,
Monty Wilkinson and Josh Hochberg, corroborate the statements
attributed to Starr's prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, notes taken by another participant in the meeting,
Steven Bates, a prosecutor in Starr's office, indicate that Jackie
M. Bennett, one of Starr's deputies, told the Justice Department
officials: ``We've had no contact with the plaintiffs' attorneys.
We're concerned about appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   The notes have become crucial evidence in the Justice Department
inquiry, which will be conducted by the Office of Professional
Responsibility, which investigates prosecutorial misconduct. The
lawyers' notes became public just last month as part of the Senate
record of documents related to the impeachment trial of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The truthfulness of Starr's prosecutors is one of several issues
that the department wants to examine, the government officials
said. Lawyers in the ethics office also intend to investigate
whether Starr abused his authority to convene grand juries, or
improperly pressed witnesses, like Ms. Lewinsky, and disclosed
secret grand jury information to the news media, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's lawyers and supporters have long contended
that there was collusion between Starr's office and the
conservative Jones lawyers, noting that Linda Tripp found her way
to the Office of Independent Counsel through a group of private
lawyers who performed legal work on the Jones case. Starr has
insisted that his office sought permission from Reno to expand his
jurisdiction when he learned of allegations that Clinton's close
friend Vernon Jordan, was helping Monica Lewinsky find a job in
exchange for her silence as a possible witness in the Jones
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr's office, would not
comment on the Justice Department's plans to start an
investigation. But Bakaly said that the notes showed that
prosecutors supplied the Justice Department with a thorough status
report on the then-nascent inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how else to put it,'' Bakaly said. ``There was no
misleading of Justice. This was a very fluid evolving situation.
Unlike most public corruption cases, this one was ongoing, felonies
were still possibly being committed.''
</P>
<P>
   This latest inquiry has exacerbated tensions that have existed
between the Justice Department and the Office of Independent
Counsel almost since the beginning of the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last spring, Reno asked her senior aides to
research whether she had the authority to discipline Starr in some
way that stopped short of removing him, according to a former
Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Some aides told her that it would be a mistake, comparing it to
the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' when President Richard Nixon
ordered the firing of the Watergate special prosecutor Archibald
Cox in October 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But, the official said, Reno shot back: ``I'm not asking you to
make a political judgment. I'm asking you to make a legal
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Deepening hostilities between the Justice Department and Starr's
office delayed the start of the new ethics inquiry. The ethics
investigators recently wrote to Starr outlining the scope and
authority for the investigation, the officials said. Starr's
prosecutors are challenging the inquiry, asserting that the
attorney general does not have the authority to delve into highly
sensitive grand jury material or investigative decisions that led
Reno to refer the case to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's aides have said that investigative authority is implied
by language in the independent counsel statute, which gives the
attorney general the sole responsibility to remove an independent
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Justice Department officials, including Reno, have
become troubled by what they view as possible violations of Justice
Department guidelines. From issues like calling the Secret Service
before the grand jury to the crossfire over leaks to the media,
Starr's prosecutors and Justice Department officials have feuded
privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time went on, people became more and more frustrated with
him,'' the Justice Department official said of Starr. ``He seemed
less concerned with Department of Justice policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethics lawyers are trying to determine whether prosecutors
in Starr's office had a vested interest in the outcome of the Jones
case, an interest that would have undercut their ability to
impartially investigate allegations related to the lawsuit. If that
conflict existed, the officials said, it would have been an
important factor as Reno weighed whether to recommend to a
three-judge panel that Starr take on the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the ethics unit of the Justice Department must
determine whether Starr and his prosecutors violated departmental
rules and prosecutorial guidelines. Their findings could lead to
recommendations for disciplinary action, like reprimands or
suspension of employment.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Reno and Starr began as a wary but
cordial one that a government official compared to ``Thatcher and
Gorbachev.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, though, Reno has expressed exasperation over Starr's
conduct, fuming over letters sent by Starr's prosecutors accusing
the Justice Department of trying to undercut the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors had also grown angry and suspicious about
Reno's aides, suggesting that the Justice Department was under the
control of the White House and had quietly tried to squelch Starr's
effort, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, several news organizations have reported how
Starr's office first learned about the Lewinsky matter. On Jan. 8,
1998 _ four days before Linda Tripp contacted Starr's office _
Jerome M. Marcus, a Philadelphia lawyer who did extensive work for
the Jones legal team, informed Paul Rosenzweig, a prosecutor in
Starr's office, about the Lewinsky accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The early tip was not disclosed in Starr's 445-page referral to
Congress. Nor was it disclosed to the Justice Department. And The
New York Times reported last month that there were several
conversations between Marcus and Rosenzweig from November 1997 to
January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, one of the president's personal lawyers,
complained to Reno in October that ``very serious questions'' were
raised about those contacts.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of collusion prompted lawyers at the Justice
Department to turn their attention to their own recollections, and
their own hand-written notes, of statements made by Starr's
representatives on Jan. 15, 1998, officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One former Justice Department lawyer said in an interview that
Reno was especially disappointed in the fact that the early phone
call was not shared with her senior aides in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, The New York Times reported that Marcus was the
leader of a small secret group of lawyers working behind-the-scenes
on the Jones case. Marcus drafted legal documents and was involved
in many of the most important strategic decisions in the Jones
lawsuit, according to billing records in the Jones case and
interviews with other lawyers who worked with him.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus recruited other conservative lawyers to assist with his
efforts, approaching among others, Paul Rosenzweig, who briefly
considered doing work for Ms. Jones in 1994, the billing records
show, but he decided not to.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Rosenzweig joined Starr's office, where he and
Marcus had several conversations about the Jones case, according to
one lawyer familiar with their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, the spokesman for Starr, has adamantly denied any
suggestion of collusion. When Starr testified before the House
Judiciary Committee on Nov. 19 of last year, he was asked by the
Democratic chief counsel, Abbe Lowell, about the ``substantial
contacts'' that he had with Jones lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of questions, Lowell attempted to suggest that Starr
should have revealed the contacts to the Justice Department in
January 1998, and that Richard Porter, a partner of Starr's at the
law firm, Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, had declined a request to represent
Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Richard Porter; I've had communications with him from
time to time,'' Starr testified. ``But in terms of a specific
discussion with respect to what the law firm may be doing or may
not be doing, I'm not recalling that specifically, no.''

N.J. SCHOOLS CHIEF QUITS TO TAKE COLLEGE TEACHING JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey Education Commissioner Leo Klagholz,
the architect of the Whitman administration's efforts to impose new
curriculum standards and improve urban schools, resigned Tuesday to
take a job as a college professor.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said she would replace him with a former
assistant state education commissioner who has been in the No. 2
position at the state attorney general's office less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's nomination of David Hespe, 38, of Montgomery, was well
received by lawmakers, school board officials and groups that
represent parents and teachers. They said they have worked well
with him in his state government roles over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that he will have the ability to work with all of
these competing interests and maintain a focus of what is best for
kids,'' said Lynne Strickland, executive director of the Garden
State Coalition, which represents mostly suburban school districts.
Ms. Strickland said some school superintendents and advocacy groups
were sometimes frustrated that Klagholz and his aides were not as
receptive to their ideas as they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Whitman administration in 1994 as an
assistant counsel for education policy, Hespe worked on education
issues for five years in the Office of Legislative Services, a
nonpartisan policy and research organization serving lawmakers. He
moved to the state's Department of Education in 1997 and then the
Department of Law and Public Safety last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking forward to this,'' he said. ``Certainly, being
commissioner of education is one of those rare opportunities to
make a difference in a lot of people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Klagholz will leave in April after five years as commissioner
and become a professor of education policy at the Richard Stockton
College of New Jersey, an undergraduate institution in Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   Klagholz oversaw the department during often tumultuous and
difficult times. In his first four years, he spent most of his time
designing a plan to comply with a state Supreme Court ruling
requiring the same level of spending in the state's richest
districts and the neediest ones.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of significantly increasing state spending, though,
Klagholz sought to address the court's concerns by imposing
statewide curriculum standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court approved of statewide curriculum standards,
it ordered the Whitman administration to send an extra $248 million
to 28 urban school districts and provide extra programs for the
students there. The court later approved of various extra programs,
including early childhood education and policies that Klagholz
recommended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to spend the first three or four years of his tenure in
court, and put a lot of his time and energy into defending Whitman
policies,'' said David Sciarra, executive director of the Education
Law Center, which has represented the urban school districts in the
decades-long court battle. ``I think that is unfortunate, because
his legacy would have been different with respect to urban
education. In the last round, he did propose some initiatives that
we supported.''
</P>
<P>
   As commissioner, Klagholz also oversaw the implementation of
charter schools, improved teacher training, the state operation of
the school districts in Newark and Jersey City and efforts to
address the estimated $6 billion statewide cost of renovating and
building schools.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement released by his office, Klagholz said,
``I am proud of the many things we have accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Hespe is taking over just when the state is starting to carry
out the statewide curriculum standards, the equal spending ruling
and a new school building program.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that she would miss Klagholz, but that the
transition would be eased because Hespe has been involved in most
of the state's major education initiatives since she took office.
``His experience in educational policy and his familiarity with the
Legislature will serve our children well,'' she said.

CLINTON TRIAL COST IS SYMBOL OF COLOSSAL WASTE TO PEOPLE AT
SHELTER 
</HEADLINE>

   PHOENIX _ The nondescript sign says Colinga Apartments. They
look like any other apartments. Tan slump block exterior. A laundry
room near the parking lot. A small, weathered playground.
</P>
<P>
   But people who live here know what this place is really about.
It is about no longer having to sleep on the streets or in their
cars. It's an end to homelessness. It's a warm, safe place where
families can be families again.
</P>
<P>
   And it's about knowing the value of money.
</P>
<P>
   To the people here, the Clinton impeachment trial has become a
symbol of wasted cash on the most horrific of scales. Never mind
the billions the federal government spends for a single bomber, or
the trillions it has run up in debt. The $50 million spent to
investigate and try the president is as extravagant as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Central Arizona Shelter Services lends the living quarters
to homeless families until they can scrounge enough money to get
their own places. David Hammond, a program director at Central
Arizona Shelter, says it costs about $108 a week to shelter one
person. A man or woman could live for months on the amount of money
a lawyer in the Clinton case makes during an hour's worth of Monica
Lewinsky testimony.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 10,000 to 12,000 homeless people in the Valley,
according to Hammond. Somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 of them are
children. For $50 million, all the adults and all the children
could have roofs over their heads for a year.
</P>
<P>
   For the people who live here, this means something. Impeaching
Clinton doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   BillieJo Wood calls the shelter a godsend. Until recently, she,
her husband and their four children slept in their car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my husband both work. But we were living paycheck to
paycheck,'' she tells me calmly one evening after finishing her
shift developing film at a nearby Walgreens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't save enough money for down payments and all
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she gets angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't the lawmakers in Washington take what they've spent
on the trial and spend it on programs for the homeless? It makes me
mad that they have spent so much time and money on something that
doesn't really benefit very many people.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is well-intentioned but, of course, naive. Money
spent on politics in Washington seldom translates into money spent
on people in central Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wood can't help but dream of what $50 million _ or even a
small fraction of that _ would mean for people not quite as lucky
as she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what that would do? Just look at my
situation,'' she says, offering me a glimpse into her new home. Her
apartment is sparse, but neat. A rose-colored tablecloth brightens
the kitchen table. Her three preschool-age children play in the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down the way, Brandy Langley and Danny Hoyt agree
with Wood. They and Langley's two children lived in a U-Haul
trailer before moving into Colinga.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's raised our self-esteem'' to live in a home again, she
says. ``It's a good feeling. You don't feel like a person living
out of a box anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved their U-Haul to Phoenix from California looking
for a better life. Now that they're living in Colinga, Langley
says, her children don't get sick as often.
</P>
<P>
   In the final months of the scandal, Clinton supporters, and most
opinion polls, have been telling Congress it needs to get back to
the business of running the government. The residents of Colinga
want that too.
</P>
<P>
   But they hope Congress will put a little more thought into
money, and how it has more value here than when being poured by the
millions down the well of the U.S. Senate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie
Amparano is taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care
about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.

SCHULZ SEES HIS CHARACTERS GET A FACE LIFT _ AND THEN SOME 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By JOHN BECK NYT Regional Newspapers c.1999 N.Y. Times News
Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ROSA, Calif. _ Charles Schulz freely admits that ``You're
a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' was overdue for minor revision. A few
jokes had lost their punch. References to rotary telephones and the
recent invention of ZIP codes were obsolete. Even a minor character
no longer seemed necessary.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the musical opened off-Broadway more than 30 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the 77-year-old Santa Rosa cartoonist never imagined the
show would get a multiethnic face lift.
</P>
<P>
   New York audiences attending ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown,'' which opened Thursday at the Ambassador Theatre on
Broadway, should recognize many of the ``Peanuts'' characters
Schulz created 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters might not appear as familiar. Schroeder is
black and Linus is Asian.
</P>
<P>
   When Schulz first heard about the revisions, he was skeptical.
``I thought _ this is mine. I did this thing. Nobody helped me. I
did the whole thing and now you're going to come in and show me how
wonderfully open-minded and liberal you are.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Schulz wants to make one point very clear: He's
not racist. He's merely a protective artist, concerned whenever
someone tinkers with his characters, just as he would agonize if a
director transformed Snoopy from a beagle into a Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I worried about it right away,'' Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept wondering, what is he going to do? How is he going to
update it?'' Shulz said, referring to director Michael Mayer.
``Here's something which, through a series of lucky decisions,
turned out to be perfect _ and now they're going to monkey around
with it, and I thought they'll ruin it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a leather chair in his studio, between his desk and
his drawing board, Schulz seems almost restless. Maybe it's because
his characters, the ageless kids he revisits around 8:30 every
morning, are getting new attention on Broadway and he isn't there
to witness it. Yet, considering his disdain for travel, his absence
is hardly unusual. When the play premiered in New York in 1967, he
waited more than a year to see it at San Francisco's Little Fox
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Schulz didn't write the play, he still has total
control over the use of the characters he invented. When he found
out about the planned revival in a newspaper story, he called
United Features Syndicate, which distributes ``Peanuts,'' to
inquire about the new production and its ``updated'' cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their best argument was that this has been happening in New
York shows for the last few years. They've been reviving things
like ``Showboat' and others and mixing up the cast. It's a very New
York thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said, `Well, if that's what they're going to do, all
right.' As long as they're not doing it just to show us how
wonderfully liberal they are _ `Oh, look at us, what we're doing to
this thing!' I said that's just foolishness. But if these are the
right people, and people are willing to accept it, willing to
accept that Lucy's leaning on the piano playing up to a black
Schroeder _ all right, let's see how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor Anthony Rapp, who plays Charlie Brown, summed up Mayer's
philosophy: ``His vision was to take something that worked really
well 32 years ago and try to find ways to breathe new life into it
and bring it into a contemporary sensibility without betraying
anything that made it special to begin with. I feel like we've
certainly done that.''
</P>
<P>
   An original lead in ``Rent,'' Rapp has been a fan of ``Peanuts''
since he was 4 and even played Snoopy at age 7 in a summer camp
production of ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   To persuade Schulz of his plan, Mayer journeyed from New York to
the artist's studio, where he described the concept behind the
lively new production.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very nice,'' Schulz said. ``We got along right from the
start ... He sounded very sensible. He didn't sound pushy or
overriding or anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer even played a recording of one of two new songs written
for the revival. When Mayer mentioned updating the characters'
lines, Schulz volunteered plenty of research material, giving him
thousands of comic strips that had run since the original
production.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from recent reviews, replacing Patty (a precursor to
Peppermint Patty) with Charlie's little sister, Sally, seems a wise
decision. In fact, New York Times theater critic Ben Brantley said
Sally, portrayed by Kristin Chenoweth, is the ``only significant
reason for adults unaccompanied by children to sit through this
mild-mannered, sticky evening of skits and songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of casting or line-by-line revisions, one addition
Schulz still has a hard time reconciling is the $75 ticket price.
``They say that's what prices are in New York and people pay it.
But it doesn't seem right. It's like taking your family to the
hockey game or the football game or the baseball game. It costs a
fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Still amazed by the show's endurance, much like ``Peanuts''
itself, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, Schulz
wouldn't call the Broadway production a ``revival.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reviving is the wrong term because it never died,'' he said.
``It never stopped ... I think every school and church and
professional group in the world has put this thing on.''
</P>
<P>
   The original music, lyrics and book were written by composer
Clark Gesner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always given Joe Hardy, the first director, all of the
credit for fortunately making all the right decisions because I
think it easily could have been spoiled,'' Schulz said. ``Since
then, other comic strips have been put on the stage and they
haven't gotten any place because I just don't think they knew what
they were doing.''

MAN SAYS HE WAS DRUNK WHEN POLICE MADE HIM CONFESS TO KILLING
TEACHER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The second of two young men accused of torturing and
killing a popular Bronx public high school English teacher took the
witness stand in his own defense Tuesday and accused the police of
tricking him into making a false confession by questioning him
while he was drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Montoun T. Hart, 27, testified that he was never
in the apartment of the slain teacher, Jonathan M. Levin, and
played no role in the slaying. In November, his co-defendant, Corey
Arthur, a former student of Levin's, was convicted of second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detective Vasquez said it was a death penalty case,'' Hart
said, referring to the detective who elicited the confession from
him. ``He said the only way for me to get out of it was for me to
say that Corey did it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lead prosecutor, Eugene Hurley, argued that the
confession was genuine, hammering away at inconsistencies in Hart's
testimony and in his alibi during a grueling, three-and-a-half-hour
cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberations in the case are expected to begin on Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Hart and Arthur, 20, robbed and
tortured the 31-year-old teacher in his Upper West Side apartment
to get the personal identification number for his bank card.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur, who prosecutors say executed his teacher with a shot in
the head, was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Hart, who is
on trial for second-degree murder, faces the same term if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   With no fingerprints or DNA from Hart found in the apartment,
his statements to the police and the account of an eyewitness who
said he saw Hart at a nearby automated teller machine are the only
evidence directly linking him to the killing. The verdict therefore
could hinge on whether the jury believed his testimony .
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hart began by saying that he was tricked by Arthur on the day of
the killing. Under questioning by his lawyer, David Stern, Hart
said that he met Arthur at 11 a.m. on May 30, 1997, to buy
marijuana from him and that he did not know Arthur well.
</P>
<P>
   He said Arthur asked him to drive from Bedford-Stuyvesant,
Brooklyn, to an apartment building near the Grand Concourse in the
Bronx. When the two arrived there, Hart said, he gave Arthur $200
for the marijuana and waited in his car. Arthur went into the
building and never returned, he said, stealing the $200.
</P>
<P>
   Hart testified that he returned to Brooklyn and spent the
afternoon smoking marijuana in the apartment of a friend, Ike
Turner, and playing video games. He returned to his home in
Bedford-Stuyvesant around 4 p.m., spent the evening there and did
not see Arthur again.
</P>
<P>
   He said two detectives forced him to go to the 79th Precinct in
Brooklyn at 3 a.m. June 7, a week after the killing, for
questioning even though he was so drunk that his pants fell down at
one point. Hart said that Detective Anthony Vasquez and Detective
John Taglioni told him to make up a story about being involved in
the killing because they needed him as a witness against Arthur.
</P>
<P>
   He said he repeatedly asked the detectives to let him go home to
sleep during roughly seven hours of questioning. But they would not
allow him to leave until he signed the detailed confession the
detectives fed to him line by line, Hart said. Both detectives
denied any wrongdoing when they testified earlier in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley, the lead prosecutor, painstakingly chipped away at
Hart's story. He repeatedly asked why the police would feed him a
confession that did not match the evidence of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that Hart, for example, said in his confession
that he was standing near the apartment's front door when he saw
Arthur shoot the teacher in the kitchen, something that was
impossible because of the layout of the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't say, `Wait, if you're near the front door, you
can't see the kitchen?''' Hurley said, referring to the detectives.
``They didn't say, `That's no good?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who grew increasingly tense during the cross-examination,
replied that he said whatever the detectives told him to say.
</P>
<P>
   In another potential difficulty for the defense, Turner, the
friend Hart said he played video games with on the afternoon of the
killing, never appeared in court to corroborate Hart's story.

   Studies on Class Size Offer Mixed Results  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If every pupil had a personal tutor, students would undoubtedly
learn more than they would in 100-student classes. But studies
differ sharply on just how well smaller classes work.
</P>
<P>
   In a new study by the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee,
class size was reduced to 15 students, kindergarten through third
grade, in more than 70 public schools in low-income areas. In data
released last month for the 1997-98 year, researchers reported that
first-graders scored significantly higher than students in a
control group. The study also found evidence of continuing
advantages in math, reading and language arts in the second grade.
The biggest gains were among black pupils.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin report follows President Clinton's 1998 and 1999
budget messages calling for $12 billion over seven years to hire
100,000 teachers and reduce classes to 18 pupils in lower grades.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Department of Education, in its report last month
on teacher quality, found the data on effects of class size to be
``somewhat mixed.'' It is reasonable, the report added, to assume
that smaller classes mean fewer disruptions and more personal
attention. But a 30-year department study completed in the 1980s
found no consistent tie between smaller class sizes and higher
standardized test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hanushek, an economics professor at the University of
Rochester, concluded in a study last year that the quality of the
teacher was more important than class size. &QL;

<P>
   A Little Economic Advice For the Federal Reserve  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is looking for a few good ideas on what to
do about short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In a contest organized by nine Federal Reserve banks, high
school teams will compete at regional finals beginning in March;
nine winners will present their policy prescriptions in Washington
on May 3 and 4 to members of the Federal Open Market Committee,
which adjusts interest rates as the need arises.
</P>
<P>
   The students are asked to ``in effect forecast where they think
the economy is going over the next several months,'' said Steven
Malin, assistant vice president for public information at the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank is contributing $650,000 in cash and scholarships. The

   Dancing the Weekend Away At Penn State University

<P>
   In a ritual known simply as ``Thon,'' more than 620
undergraduates and a few alumni at Pennsylvania State University
will crowd into a campus gym on Feb. 19 for 48 hours of nonstop
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The dance marathon, said to be the nation's largest student-run
philanthropy, has a five-year, $5 million goal to endow an
institute for pediatric cancer research at the Penn State College
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday night of the Thon, at 7 p.m., the dancers stand up
and they don't sit down until Sunday at 7 p.m.,'' said Jessica
Souder, a junior who publicizes the event.

CITIGROUP OFFICIALS LEAVE VISA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Citigroup, the nation's second-largest issuer of
credit cards, has taken the first steps toward abandoning a
decades-old marketing relationship with Visa International in an
attempt to create greater awareness of its own Citibank brand name.
</P>
<P>
   John S. Reed, Citigroup's co-chairman, and Robert Lipp, co-head
of the company's consumer-banking operation, both resigned from
Visa's board on Friday following months of disagreements between
the two companies about branding issues, Citigroup and Visa
spokesmen said.
</P>
<P>
   Visa, which like Mastercard International is owned and
controlled by a consortium of banks including Citigroup, was set up
about three decades ago so banks could share marketing and
processing costs of the then-nascent credit-card business.
</P>
<P>
   But the credit-card industry has boomed since then and the
recent merger wave among banks has created some giant banks that no
longer believe they need to subordinate their brands to the Visa
logo.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's moves were first reported Tuesday on CNBC, the
financial news channel.
</P>
<P>
   Reed has been critical recently of what he calls the
``communal'' arrangement behind Visa and said that he thinks other
banks, including Bank One Corp. and BankAmerica Corp., may wish to
follow his lead when it comes to branding issues.
</P>
<P>
   While Citigroup's move is certainly a blow to Visa, not all big
banks share Reed's goals. Bank One, for example, has made much
greater headway marketing popular affinity cards than has
Citigroup. Because Bank One, which owns the largest credit-card
issuer in the country, First USA, has not sought to market a
distinct brand of credit cards, it is unlikely to make the branding
issue as much of a priority.
</P>
<P>
   The top credit and charge card issuers in the country are First
USA, Citigroup, the MBNA Corp., American Express, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter's Discover card, Chase Manhattan Corp. and BankAmerica,
according to the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Some Citigroup cards will still carry the Visa logo because of
contractual obligations, but all new cards issued by the bank will
only be marketed in conjunction with Mastercard, Visa's chief
rival.
</P>
<P>
   These cards will carry the Citibank brand name on the front of
the card and Mastercard's logo on the back, according to credit
industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   Mastercard severely lags Visa in market share, with only about
27 percent of the card market compared with Visa's 52 percent.
American Express has less than 15 percent of the market, followed
by Discover with about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mastercard officials could not be reached for comment.

U.S. INTELLIGENCE MAY HAVE TAPED CLINTON-LEWINSKY CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 and DAVE WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A U.S. intelligence agency may have taped telephone
conversations between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, and
information about the tapes has been turned over to independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, Sen. Jon Kyl said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The information came to light last week as the Senate considered
evidence in the president's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said key
GOP senators were approached by sources who said they knew of the
possible existence of the tapes. The names of those sources were
then turned over to Starr for investigation, Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the development would affect the
impeachment trial, which is scheduled to draw to a close on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different agencies in the government that make it
their business to tape certain things for certain reasons, and it
was one of those agencies'' that did the taping, Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incidentally, it may have been more than one of those
agencies,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, R-Ariz., refused to identify the agency or agencies
involved in the taping.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I absolutely can't get into in any greater
detail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said of the sources: ``They are people who claim to have
information about those tapes, who by virtue of who they are have
some credility with respect to the information they have come
forward about.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the sources were members of U.S. intelligence, Kyl
said, ``You can assume that they are people who at some period in
time have been in the employ of the federal government. ''
</P>
<P>
   As for the motive of the sources, Kyl said he believed they were
prompted by the testimony of witnesses in the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have a case going forward, and at issue are a lot of
different interpretations of phone conversations,`` Kyl said,
mentioning in particular diverging memories about details of events
in the testimony of Lewinsky and presidential friend Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl compared the allegations of the tapes' existence to the
``smoking gun'' evidence in the Watergate scandal, when
congressional witness Alexander Butterfield ``just blurted out'' a
reference to former President Nixon's taping system in the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have people who have reason to know that the tapes
exist and they say, `Wait a minute, shouldn't someone know about
this?' '' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   News reports on Tuesday about the possibility of tapes of
presidential conversations focused on the possiblity of a taping
system in the White House that captured phone calls between Clinton
and Lewinsky, but the White House denied the existence of such a
system.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl was the first to reveal that the conversations had been
recorded by the unidentified intelligence sources.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence, including the CIA, the National Security
Agency and all of the branches of military intelligence, report to
the president and work for the executive branch. The legality of
employees of these agencies informing members of Congress of the
existence of classified material was unclear Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl first revealed the role of the unnamed intelligence services
in his impeachment diary entry for Tuesday, which is published in
today's ``Republic.'' Kyl has been writing the diary for his
grandchildren, and the newspaper has been printing excerpts of the
diary since the impeachment trial of the president began in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public reports are now surfacing about the possibility that a
national security agency may have copies of taped conversations of
White House calls made by or to the president during the times
relevant to this case,'' Kyl wrote. ``I'll have more to say about
this as it is officially dealt with publically.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of turning over the records involving the tapes to
Starr's office apparently originated with a member of the GOP
Senate leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about what to do about this, and I
suggested why don't we turn it over to Starr,'' Assistant Majority
Leader Don Nickles told the Associated Press. ``It's for him to
handle; it's not for us to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported that the Republican senators received
information about a week ago, raising the possibility that a White
House taping system might exist. Eager to finish the impeachment
trial, they sent the information to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters Tuesday that the GOP
senators played no role in the affair other than to receive the
information and pass it on to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've done is make available information sent to me,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv denied the existence of a White
House recording operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not aware of any taping system,'' he told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Toiv said there are occasional instances in which Clinton will
conduct an interview by phone, and the call is taped to transcribe
the conversation. In some other instances when Clinton speaks to
groups long distance by phone, those calls are taped and
transcribed, he said. &QL;

GORDON SETTER WINS GROUP THIRD YEAR IN ROW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Pa. Ill., N.C., Texas, Wis.)  (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They wagged their tails and begged to stay in the
limelight sneaking liver treats from their human handlers. But the
culling of the canine champions continued Tuesday night at Madison
Square Garden, where the four group winners from Monday night were
joined by three more finalists for the most coveted nonedible
laurel in dogdom: the Best-in-Show trophy at the Westminster Kennel
Club Show.
</P>
<P>
   The evening began with a duel in the Sporting group, where the
Gordon Setter who was the two-time defending champion of the group,
Ch. Bit O Gold Titan Treasure, edged out Ch. Salilyn N' Erin's
Shameless, the Springer Spaniel bitch who had knocked him off his
perch as top sporting dog in the nation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This three-time sweep of the group by Kirby, the black-and-gold
setter, who turns 7 Thursday and is retiring after this show, is
believed to be a landmark. According to show officials, this is the
first time in memory the same dog dominated a group division for
three consecutive years since Ch. Warren Remedy, a smooth fox
terrier, monopolized the entire event by going best-in-show from
1907-1909.
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose in the best-in-show round, Kirby's handler, Ken
Murray of Island Lake, Ill., said the 75-pound dog's 84 bests and
270 group victories more than qualified him to take up residence on
the couch of one of his five owners, Judy Browne, of Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   When Kirby visits Browne, he gets to play outdoors, bury his
ball in the dirt and act just like any other pampered house pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done everything you could ask, and he's had a fabulous
temperament as a show dog: going on the road every week, living out
of a crate, that's a lot of abuse for a dog to take, and he's put
up with it,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   The group judge, Maxine V. Beam, selected Kirby as the paragon
of the 26-member Sporting Group ``because he looks like he could go
out in the field and hunt all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hound Group, Ch. Sundown Alabaster Treasure, J C, a
slender Saluki with five bests to her credit, drew the longest,
fondest look from Judge James R. White. Owned and bred by a
veterinarian, J. Darryl Black, and his wife, Karen, who also serves
as handler, the 43-pound saluki is also a registered therapy dog
when she is not showing off in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an angel,'' said the handler, who calls her dog,
Treasure. ``She sleeps under the covers. She visits hospitals and
convalescent homes. But when we're in the ring and the applause
starts, we're in a world of our own. She just loves the shows;
don't anyone tell her she's retiring after this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Herding Group winner was a German Shepherd, Ch. Windwalker's
Yes Virginia, handled by Laurie Greer of El Paso, Texas. The
shepherd was No. 2 in the nation of its breed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The canines who took group honors Monday, a foursome that ranged
in age from 2 to 8 and varied in size from a 6-pound Papillon to an
95-pound Bernese mountain dog, napped the day away while the
Sporting, the Hound and the Herding divisions were determined
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Toy Group, though it is hard to envision a 6-pound Iron
Man, that's exactly what Ch. Loteki Supernatural Being, happens to
be. Born on New Year's Eve in 1990, he is pushing 60 in human
years. Also known as Kirby, the little Papillon owns 30
bests-in-show and the 1998 World Championship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kirby became the first Papillon to win Westminster's
Toy group; in 1997 he was shut out in the breed ring by his own
nephew, but last year Kirby, whose owner/handler, John Oulton,
swears the little dog romps like any garden variety mongrel when he
is home in Norwalk, Conn., regained his breed title and finished
the group in third place.
</P>
<P>
   This year the saucer-eyed sprite cavorted past 20 younger rivals
in the Toy Group, and captivated the judge, Richard L. Bauer, who
had no idea Kirby was so long in the tooth; after all, his
dentifrice was as picture perfect as the rest of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have been three or four: he was in top form, and he
had all his teeth, which tells you something about the genes,'' he
said. ``He's supposed to look like a little butterfly in motion,
and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   In the non-Sporting Group, there were upsets galore on Monday,
but Ch. Lake Cove That's My Boy, the white Standard poodle who
finished 1998 as top dog all-breeds, was impervious to them and
gracefully defended his group title from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. James Edward Clark, the judge, said he exudes
``poodley-ness.'' If there's such a thing as championship genes,
this animal is well-insured: his grandfather, Peter, Ch.
Whisperwind On A Carousel, went Best-in-Show here in 1991. If
there's such a thing as consummate grooming, Tre-son has that going
for him as well: his handler, Dennis McCoy, and his beautician,
Randy Garren, both of Apex, N.C., made up Peter's human support
squad, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first saw him when he was just a year old, still in his
underwear, but I thought he was beautiful.'' said Tre-son's owner,
Isabelle Robson of Glenmore, Pa.

ROMANTIC COP 
IN THE RED 
FILM FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON WITH C.J. SATTERWHITE AND LINDA LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Bratton, the former New York police
commissioner, almost asked the question during the ride on the
carousel in Central Park Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This so-called tough cop, he's the most romantic man,'' Rikki
Klieman, an anchor on the Court TV cable network, said. ``He says,
`I want to go round and round with you in my life.''' But just in
case that sounded too much like the marry-me interrogatory she had
been hoping for, he added, ``Remember, this isn't the question yet,
this is a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The question came later, over dessert at Daniel, on East 65th
Street near Park Avenue. As an engagement present he gave her a
gold necklace with diamonds. ``I did not want a ring,'' she said.
``I was clear about that. Just a wedding ring.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Red Ball
</P>
<P>
   Byron Janis, whose career as a concert pianist was cut short by
psoriatic arthritis, is not usually thought of as a square-dancer.
</P>
<P>
   But there were Janis and his wife, Maria Cooper Janis,
do-si-do-ing to a country-and-western band at the Plaza Hotel on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   This being the Red Ball, the women had been asked to wear red,
and many did. Mrs. Janis, for example, wore a red silk Givenchy (by
Hubert himself, not his post-retirement successors).
</P>
<P>
   There were those whose nod to red consisted of nail polish,
lipstick or rubies. And there was Arlene Dahl, who wore a dress of
black silk and velvet and declared, ``Redheads are exempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Richards, the producer and widower of Mary Lea Johnson
Richards, in whose memory the Red Ball is held each year, told the
crowd, ``I've dropped my speech cards about six times. They're out
of order.''
</P>
<P>
   David Dinkins, the former mayor, declared, loudly enough for
three tables to hear, ``I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the crowd heard from Beth Dozoretz, a stand-in for Vice
President Al Gore, the honorary chairman of the Red Ball. Ms.
Dozoretz, the Democratic National Committee's newly named finance
chairwoman, read two notes _ one from Gore, the other from his
wife, whom Ms. Dozoretz first referred to as ``Tipper.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the audience, Alexander Forger raised an eyebrow at the
notion of first-name familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, when Ms. Dozoretz referred to the ``second
lady,'' Forger snorted. ``Second lady?'' he said. ``Never heard of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   No Autobiography
</P>
<P>
   Here are two facts about Jake Gyllenhaal, a freshman at Columbia
University: Paul Newman taught him to drive, and Gyllenhaal's new
film, ``October Sky,'' is not even close to being autobiographical.
</P>
<P>
   ``October Sky,'' which opens on Feb. 19, is about a rocket
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so bad with math,'' Gyllenhaal said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is why he is studying poetry and modern literature
at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He said a screening of ``October Sky'' the other night was for
``friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   In the friends category was the actress Debra Winger.
</P>
<P>
   In the family category were his father, the director Stephen
Gyllenhaal (whose credits include ``Losing Isaiah''), and his
mother, the screenwriter Naomi Foner (whose credits also include
``Losing Isaiah'').
</P>
<P>
   His older sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal, a 21-year-old actress,
missed the screening. ``She had to shoot,'' Jake Gyllenhaal said,
``and she had a 103-degree fever. The flu.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Gyllenhaal explained that the family's last name is
pronounced JILL-in-haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Swedish,'' he said. ``A long time ago, the king or queen
of Sweden, I'm not sure of the specifics, they asked my
great-great-great _ a lot of greats _ grandfather to be the court
butterfly catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big job in that time. He had a house off the golden
hall, and they gave him that name.''

COWBOYS LOSE TWO, BUT SALARY CRUNCH REMAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill Jr. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Despite the Cowboys' efforts, the Cleveland
Browns refused to fulfill Dallas' hopes of using yesterday's
expansion draft to significantly trim salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns took Cowboys reserve defensive linemen Hurvin
McCormack and Antonio Anderson with the second and 26th picks.
However, two higher-priced Cowboys, fullback Daryl Johnston and
receiver Billy Davis, were not selected, although Dallas left them
available throughout the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones said that he understands
the sensitivity of leaving Johnson exposed but that the team was
simply executing business decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want all these guys,'' Jones said. ``But there are rules
like salaries and cap issues that go along with these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys saved roughly $1 million by losing Anderson and
McCormack but are nearly $3 million above the NFL's 1999 salary cap
of $57,288,000.
</P>
<P>
   Team salaries must be reduced by Friday, by adjusting contracts
or waiving players. Cornerback Kevin Smith has agreed to rework his
deal, and talks are under way with defensive end Chad Hennings and
offensive tackle Erik Williams. Middle linebacker Fred Strickland,
who would count $1.17 million against the 1999 cap, is not expected
to be back.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, however, hoped to get a big chunk back by losing
Johnston and/or Davis in the expansion draft. Under their
contracts, Johnston would count $1.65 million against the cap next
season and Davis would count $1.12 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland didn't bite. Jones said he wasn't surprised because
the Browns were stockpiling young and inexpensive players. The
Browns picked only two players with salary-cap costs over $1
million: Detroit center Jim Pyne with its first pick and San
Francisco cornerback Antonio Langham with its last pick. They
selected only one player over 30: San Francisco linebacker James
Williams. The average player taken was 25.6 years old and will cost
$502,000 against the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland used 10 of its 37 picks on defensive backs and nine on
offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said he expects the Cowboys
to try to redo Johnston's contract. They rejected a similar
overture by the Cowboys last month.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what's in store for Davis, who was a considered a
disappointment as a starter last season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McCormack joins the Browns after recording 28 tackles
and five sacks as the Cowboys' top defensive line reserve last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very excited,'' said McCormack's agent, Alan Herman.
``He had some mixed emotions about leaving Dallas. He was
disappointed initially about being put on the list because he has a
home in Dallas and enjoys Dallas. But he's going to a place where
they've welcomed him with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson battled knee injuries and dropped to the bottom of the
Cowboys' depth chart last season after a promising rookie season in
1997.

HITCHENS: A WRITER WHO TURNED LUNCH INTO AN AFFIDAVIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In retrospect, Christopher Hitchens said Tuesday, the
only thing he really regrets about signing an affidavit that could
land his longtime friend Sidney Blumenthal in criminal trouble is
that he did not break the news himself to Blumenthal, the
presidential adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens writes witty, famously contrarian books and articles
for The Nation and Vanity Fair, and he is rarely at a loss for
words.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that on Friday, after signing the affidavit _ which
has now turned a friendly lunch between the two men and their wives
into something distinctly unfriendly _ he struggled with how to
tell the Blumenthals what he had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking, `Can I phone them? If I get the answering
machine, I can't leave it on an answering machine message. If I
faxed them ... '''
</P>
<P>
   His voice trailed off. Then he said: ``I was obviously
reluctant. I didn't know how I could phrase it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, out of town, he checked his answering machine and
discovered it was too late: 59 messages. ``I said, `I wonder what
that could be. No, I don't. I know what that is.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a long, rambling telephone interview Tuesday from his home in
Washington, Hitchens, 49, said that his failure of will ``still
makes me whimper when I think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But if anything, he has grown more resolute in the last three
days defending what he did willfully to start it all, after getting
an unexpected call on Friday from House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   He said they asked him ``very well-informed questions'' about a
conversation he had with Blumenthal over lunch last March at the
Occidental Grill in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   During the lunch, Hitchens says, Blumenthal related a story _
which Hitchens understood had originated with President Clinton _
that Monica Lewinsky had behaved like a ``stalker.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the call from House members, Hitchens said, he
did not know Blumenthal had just testified to the Senate that he
was not the source of negative stories to reporters about Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And so House prosecutors could now use the affidavit, and
another one signed by Hitchens' wife, Carol Blue, a freelance
writer, to pursue a perjury case against Blumenthal. (Blumenthal's
lawyer, William A. McDaniel Jr., contended Tuesday that nothing in
Hitchens' statement contradicted Blumenthal's testimony.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite a friendship of 15 years that included dozens of shared
meals and birthday parties and even toys shared by their children,
Hitchens explained that he signed the affidavit because he believed
strongly that Clinton was guilty of, among many other things,
``general thuggishness'' in dealing with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchens said he felt strongly that he ``would be withholding
evidence if I didn't say it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to his outspoken antipathy to Clinton _ he is
publishing a book critical of the president this spring _ he also
tried to portray the affidavit as a kind of self-defense for his
integrity.
</P>
<P>
   He had told friends and colleagues about the lunch conversation
and had even made an oblique reference to it in The Independent,
the London newspaper, last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if I said no, I would have to say I was a complete liar,''
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when asked whether he could have simply refused to talk to
the House investigators about it _ and left nobody the wiser _ he
conceded that he could have. ``I could have said, `I don't talk to
Republicans.' I'm sure I would have been within my rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four days, Hitchens has lost several friends and
found few defenders _ and none willing to go on the record.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Navasky, the editorial director of The Nation, who hired
Hitchens in the early 1980s, is trying not to take sides in the
rift. But earlier this week he offered his own simple policy for
such situations: ``It's wrong for friends to take private
conversations and enter them into public discourse unless you've
cleared them with the friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who speak for Blumenthal are not nearly so circumspect.
``This is a guy,'' said McDaniel, the lawyer, ``who has stabbed his
friend in the back for his own self-aggrandizement.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is certainly not the first time that Hitchens has found
himself on the lonely side of an argument. The son of a British
naval officer and the first in his family to attend college, he
recalled that during his first public speech in prep school, he
opposed a popular anti-immigration bill. ``I think I did it because
nobody else would,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a statement that Hitchens could use as a motto. He has
built his journalistic reputation over the last decade by attacking
people whom few others ever thought to attack.
</P>
<P>
   He met Mother Teresa in 1980, and several years later wrote a
book, ``Missionary Position,'' in which he criticized her for her
contacts with oppressive regimes and suggested that she was more
concerned with fighting abortion and contraception than helping
poor people.
</P>
<P>
   As the entire world seemed to be mourning Diana, the Princess of
Wales, in 1997, Hitchens was heaping scorn on her drawing a lot of
attention to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding beleaguered and weary Tuesday, he said that he did not
sign the affidavit to draw attention to himself or to his new book.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he even held out hope that he and Blumenthal could
patch things up. But he does not talk of apologizing, and he seems
resigned that he will not be getting many party invitations in
Washington any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose,'' he said, ``this is the time when one does find
out what people really think of you.''

UT'S MIHM BRINGS RESOLUTION INTO NEW YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas coach Rick Barnes and center Chris Mihm
spent some time watching tapes together in late December.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of those selected shorts in retrospect might be called
``Waking Chris Mihm.''
</P>
<P>
   Feature cuts included Mihm in action against South Florida's
Scott Johnson, Arizona's A.J. Bramlett and Georgia's Robb Dryden.
That trio outscored Mihm, 54-29, and outrebounded him, 24-7. Texas
lost all three games.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `Chris, you tell me. Are these guys that much
better than you are? What is it?''' Barnes recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I told him we needed him to dominate. That he was the guy
we were counting on and that we had to have some predictable points
and rebounds from him every night. I also told him that he didn't
have to do it, but that I was going to stay on him every day until
he did. And that I could want him to do it, but it wasn't going to
happen until he wanted to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As subsequent numbers suggest, Mihm decided in the affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really tried to improve my game since conference play
began,'' the Longhorns' 7-foot sophomore said. ``I really wasn't
pleased with how I was playing early. I knew I had to find some way
to change it because I wasn't playing up to my potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming seasons will determine whether Mihm has played to his
potential. But in the fourth month of his sophomore season, he
appears to be on the way. After an inconsistent December when he
averaged 11.4 points and 8.6 rebounds a game, Mihm has averaged
14.2 points and 10.2 rebounds in Big 12 action as Texas (14-9) has
surged to the top of the league at 9-1 entering tonight's game (8
p.m., KXTX/Channel 39) against Oklahoma (16-7, 7-3).
</P>
<P>
   Mihm's elevation has come at a time when many players' lofty
nonconference averages have fallen against teams who know them
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes what Chris has done even more impressive,''
forward Gabe Muoneke said. ``Being so close, if it was just a small
difference \Rin Mihm's game\S, we might not notice it. But there's
been such a big difference that I have definitely noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton said Mihm might be college
basketball's best center. Some might argue for Duke's Elton Brand,
Washington's Todd MacCulloch or Northwestern's Evan Eschmeyer, but
Mihm appears to have played himself into that class.
</P>
<P>
   ``What separates him from most big guys I see is his
versatility,'' Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``He's not just
a back-to-the-basket, stuck-in-the-middle big man. He's the '90s
version _ maybe the 21st-century version _ of the big man who can
step out and shoot the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson's point is not lost on Massachusetts coach Bruiser
Flint, who witnessed Mihm's soft touch on the jumper as he scored
20 points and pulled down 17 rebounds in the Longhorns' recent
76-65 victory over the Minutemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was making those baseline jumpers from 10 to 12 feet with a
guy in his face,'' Flint noted. ``What are you going to do about
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm says he knows what he's going to do: keep working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like coach Barnes says, `What you bring to practice, you bring
to games,''' he said. ``I definitely feel very confident in my game
right now. But I'm trying to improve every day and keep playing at
this level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely believe I've come a long way since the beginning
of the season. But you can't stop working or concentrating because
that's when what you've built can start falling down.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes says he doesn't see any signs of a falloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris has gotten excited about the fact that he can expand his
game on both ends of the floor,'' Barnes said. ``He can do things
like pressure the ball 20 feet from the basketball, go out on
screens ... and still get back and block shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be around kids who want to learn. And Chris wants
to do that.''

ANOTHER NIGHT AND ANOTHER LOSS FOR ISLES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Late in the second period Tuesday night, Bryan
Smolinski of the Islanders skated in on the Washington net, firing
a shot that Capitals goaltender Olaf Kolzig batted away with the
ease of swatting a mosquito at a summertime picnic. If Kolzig
seemed, like at a picnic, to be suppressing a yawn as he deflected
the shot aside, it was with good reason. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most family outings at the park draw better crowds than the
Islanders attracted to Nassau Coliseum and nearly all swatting of
mosquitoes takes more effort than Kolzig needed to keep the
Islanders at bay in a 2-1 victory. The announced crowd of 8,845 was
noticeable only when mustering a derisive taunt of the home team's
inability to mount any sort of an offense, . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Emotion did not surface from the Islanders side until the
players hit the locker room. There, Coach Bill Stewart lost his
temper, showing more fire at the podium during postgame interviews
than his team did during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 85 percent effort, that's not good enough for me,''
Stewart said. ``That's the difference between winning and losing
and I don't accept the way we played. It's a two-sided coin. Now
they're going to see the other side of Bill Stewart.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked what that entailed, Stewart simply said, ``Come to
practice and you'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   That message meant something to his team, too, which had
originally been scheduled for a day off, but Stewart said the
players might be on the ice, ``from 8 to 5 or longer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite their offensive woes, the Islanders were one wakeup call
from getting back into the game until Peter Bondra received a pass
from Brian Bellows and blasted a one-timer past Tommy Salo with the
Capitals on a two-man advantage at 11:55 of the third period. The
wakeup came too late, as the Islanders pulled Tommy Salo for an
extra skater in the final minute, then scored with 47.4 seconds to
go when Ziggy Palffy slipped a rebound past Kolzig.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders called time and kept Salo on the bench, but were
unable to pull even, but did finally throw a scare into the
Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ugly game to watch,'' Rich Pilon said. ``It was an
ugly game, period.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, now 0-10-1 in their last 11 meetings with the
Capitals, hardly threatened in this game before those final
seconds. Smolinski's shot with 4:55 remaining in the second period
was the Islanders' first in the period, and that included four
minutes of power play advantage without even one shot threatening
Kolzig. New York got off three shots in the final minutes of the
period and five more until the final two minutes of the third
period. They finished with 21 shots on goal, few of them even
remotely dangerous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders basically gave the game away with a pair of
penalties 22 seconds apart in the third period that led to Bondra's
goal. First, Pilon was sent off for cross-checking James Black, a
move that he did not deny, but which he said came after he had been
elbowed in the mouth. Zdeno Chara followed him to the penalty box
for two minutes for interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selfish,'' Stewart said of the penalties. ``It's not conducive
to a team concept.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The power play, once a mainstay of the Islanders offense,
continued to produce no goals and little opportunity. The Islanders
have converted just one power play opportunity in their last 36
chances spanning eight games. In the first period, the Islanders
had three power play chances in the opening 10 minutes, but managed
just 1, 2, and 2 shots.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, it got worse, as the Islanders had two
power play opportunities and could not even get a shot on goal in
the four minutes with advantage. Still, the Capitals mustered
little offense in the period either, and the Islanders trailed by
only 1-0 entering the final period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Salo played a solid first period, stopping 10 shots and he kept
the Capitals scoreless until an error in the final seconds of the
period, when he went behind the net and held the puck, waiting for
an opening.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Oates was lurking on the left side of the net, and when
Salo turned and fired the puck to the right side, Bondra swooped to
the boards and intercepted the pass, quickly turning and feeding
Oates, who was gliding to the front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Salo tried to hurry back into the net, but Oates fired the puck
over him as the goaltender dived across the crease to give
Washington a 1-0 lead with just 7.1 seconds remaining.  &QL;

PEARL BERNSTEIN MAX, 94, AN ARCHITECT OF NYC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pearl Bernstein Max, who played a central role in
melding the New York City municipal colleges into today's City
University of New York, died Feb. 4 in her home in Manhattan. She
was 94.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia appointed Mrs. Max _ known as
Pearl Bernstein for much of her career _ as the first
administrative director of New York City's Board of Higher
Education. That job, the chief administrator, was a predecessor of
the office of chancellor in the current system.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Max helped lay much of the groundwork for fitting City,
Hunter, Brooklyn and Queens Colleges into CUNY, as it came into
being in 1961. She drafted the first master plan and the financing
formula for the system and served as liaison to its Administrative
Council of College Presidents.
</P>
<P>
   She was the founding coordinator of CUNY's Office of
Institutional Research in 1967. From there, she initiated
pioneering studies of teacher education, admissions procedures and
other issues of vital importance to the growing university.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Mrs. Max was one of the principal shapers of CUNY, the
nation's largest municipal university system. It now comprises 11
senior colleges, 6 community colleges, a graduate division, a law
school, a medical school and an affiliated school of medicine. It
has nearly 200,000 students working toward degrees and 155,000
adult and continuing education students throughout the five
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Max also served as secretary and administrative head of the
New York City Employees Retirement System, one of the country's
largest pension funds. She taught courses on state and local
government at Barnard College, and retired from CUNY in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manhattan, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard
in 1925 and pursued postgraduate studies at Columbia University and
Fordham Law School. She joined the League of Women Voters of New
York City in 1926 as its municipal representative and the group's
first paid executive.
</P>
<P>
   The league monitored the policies and procedures of the city's
Board of Estimates and Apportionment. Her reputation for clear and
evenhanded analyses drew the attention of La Guardia, who named her
secretary of the board in 1934.
</P>
<P>
   She was the first woman in that post, which she held until the
Mayor moved her to the Board of Higher Education. Over the years
she served as an officer of the Women's Club of New York, Ethical
Culture Schools, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, New York
Metropolitan Council and American Society of Public Administrators,
among other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Dr. Louis Max, died four years ago after 66 years
of marriage. Mrs. Max is survived by a daughter, Dr. Claire Max of
Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Dr. Betty Bernstein of Manhattan and
Hilda Morris of Huntington, N.Y.; two brothers, Ira Bernstein of
Fairfield, Conn., and Seymour Bernstein of Manhattan, and one
grandson.

DERBY CONTENDER'S OWNERS TAKE CAUTIOUS STEPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., La., Ky.)  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ ``It was at Keeneland one day some years
ago,'' Jimmy Stone was saying, ``when this 8-year-old boy I knew
came up to me and asked: `Mr. Stone, can you make a bet for me?
They won't take a bet at the window unless they can see your
face.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Stone remembered. ``that was the first investment that
Arthur Hancock and I ever made together.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jimmy Stone is the chief executive officer of Stone Co.,
which drills for gas in Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico, and he
has raced horses both at home and abroad for nearly half a century.
And Arthur Hancock, the son of Stone's great friend, Bull Hancock
of Claiborne Farm and his wife, Waddell, is the master of Stone
Farm in Paris, Ky., across the road from the Hancock family's
legendary Claiborne spread.
</P>
<P>
   Years after their chance encounter at Keeneland, they have
embarked on the riskiest investment venture in thoroughbred racing,
both emotionally and financially: getting a colt to the Kentucky
Derby and, against all the odds and twists of fortune, winning it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 33,000 foals born three years ago, no more than 20 will
make it to the starting gate at Churchill Downs on May 1 for the
125th Derby, and only one will make the winner's circle. It can be
the most rewarding trip in racing, but it is also certain to be
costly and demanding, and for many people involved in the high-risk
business of Triple Crown ambitions, heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Stone and Arthur Hancock are the owners of a large bay
3-year-old colt named Menifee. He was named for Menifee County in
Kentucky; his sire is named Harlan, for another county in the
state. And Stone and Hancock think they have a winner _ well, they
think they have a colt with a shot at winning.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee had only two races at the age of 2 last year, and won
them both. In his second start, at Saratoga, he even outran the
highly regarded Cat Thief from the D. Wayne Lukas barn and Lemon
Drop Kid, trained by Scotty Schulhofer. But then he was found to
have a slight chip on his right knee, and he hasn't raced in almost
six months.
</P>
<P>
   His exile will end sometime in the next two or three weeks,
which is when his road to the Kentucky Derby will begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a chance,'' Hancock said from his farm in Kentucky.
``But it's one of the toughest things to achieve in sports. He's
already been wounded in battle. You might say he's got one strike
on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Hancock has traveled the Triple Crown route before. In
1982, he won the Kentucky Derby with Gato del Sol; in 1989, he won
it with Sunday Silence. In 1994, he ran second with Strodes Creek.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, though, that Stone Farm did not derive its name from
Jimmy Stone. ``It's just a coincidence,'' he said. ``Maybe it's a
good omen.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who is very likely to express himself in maxims, said
from his office in New Orleans: ``There's nothing worse than being
high on your horse because so much can happen to him. Yet, they say
you'll never kill yourself if you have a horse that's coming on.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee has been gradually coming on, but he is no secret.
Handicappers have been placing him in the top 15 of the Derby
contenders, despite his short experience. And as the 3-year-old
class gets off to a very mixed start, with no dominant horse in
sight, the colt named for a county in Kentucky may have the
ingredients: good breeding, the flair for racing, some distance
potential, an experienced team of handlers and owners with very
deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought him at the Keeneland sale in September two years ago
for $37,000,'' Stone said. ``A giveaway. Arthur, who had been the
breeder, asked in for half, and we were in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that attracted me to him was his dam line. His dam
was Anne Campbell, who is still at Stone Farm. And Steve DiMauro,
the longtime trainer and owner, told me, `This is a kind of special
horse.' After Steve broke him in Florida, we sent him to Elliott
Walden for training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been hand-ridden,'' Stone said, then added with
feeling: ``He lays off the pace. Then he goes like a choo-choo
train.''
</P>
<P>
   The chip in the right knee was their first reminder that the
road to the Kentucky Derby is lined with ambushes. But Stone and
Hancock had been breeding, owning and racing horses long enough to
mix their expectations with the realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided it was a very benign chip,'' Arthur Hancock said.
``So, we gave him some time off. We hand-walked him at the farm for
a couple of months. And finally, we sent him to Elliott's barn at
Payson Park, in the country north of Gulfstream Park, where the air
is clear, the noise level low and the training track deep. You
know, the mental part is as important as the physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden has Triple Crown credentials, too. In fact, last year he
played the spoiler. His colt Victory Gallop ran second to Real
Quiet in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, then scored a
dramatic upset victory over Real Quiet in the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing him along carefully,'' Walden said. ``One work
at a time. I'd say he'll come back in an allowance race at
Gulfstream in the next couple of weeks. One allowance, then one
prep, then the Blue Grass Stakes in Kentucky in April.''
</P>
<P>
   Then? Walden didn't say the magic words, but everybody knows the
story line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Stone said, sharpening his poetic way for the
road ahead, ``your bad luck is your good luck.''

HECTOR ALEJANDRO GALINDO, 93, MEXICAN FILM DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Hector Alejandro Galindo Amezcua, a prolific film
director who created his own genre of movies set in Mexico's urban
underworld, died Feb. 1. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo, who was known in the Mexican film world as Don Alex,
directed or wrote scripts for more than 70 films, virtually all of
them made in Mexico. He was one of the directors, along with Emilio
Fernandez, who pioneered a booming film industry in Mexico in the
1940s and '50s based on movies that portrayed the travails and
heartbreak of workaday Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo was the first Mexican director to place his films in the
streets, bars and factories of tightly knit but tumultuous urban
barrios, especially in Mexico City. His characters were
down-and-out boxers, working-stiff fathers, bus drivers,
accountants, prostitutes and small-time gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   As both scriptwriter and director, he captured the distinctive
broad-toned jargon of a new urban proletariat. Mexicans in the
rapidly growing cities loved to hear their voices echoed in
Galindo's films and flocked loyally to them for over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't pretend that I dedicated any deep study to it,''
Galindo said in a recent interview with La Jornada, the Mexico City
daily. ``It was a matter of watching, observing carefully, opening
my ears and letting the words stick to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always made movies about what I knew and saw, nothing
else,'' Galindo said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his most famous film was the 1945 ``Campeon sin
Corona,'' or ``Champion Without a Crown,'' the melancholy story of
a street kid who rises in the boxing ring only to be defeated by a
corrupt Mafia controlling the sport. The boxer was played by David
Silva, a short, stocky actor on whom Galindo frequently relied to
portray his perpetually failing heroes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948 Galindo directed ``Una Familia de Tantas'' (``One Family
of Many''), a portrait of an urban family troubled by poverty and
feuds between generations. In 1953 he made ``Espaldas Mojadas''
(``Wetbacks''), an early critique of the exploitation of illegal
Mexican workers in the southwestern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo was born in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1906. His sensitivity
to urban surroundings came after he was uprooted as a teen-ager and
moved with his mother to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   He became poisoned, as he put it, by the cinema when he was
still an adolescent. To learn the trade he entered the United
States illegally and became an office boy in Hollywood. In the
1920s he worked with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures,
first writing scripts for silent films and later dubbing their
talking films into Spanish. The crash of 1929 forced him to take
his knowledge back to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Galindo won at least eight Ariels, Mexico's equivalent of the
Oscar, and in recent years he was honored with several national
homages in Mexico. But he never received the National Prize for the
Arts, the country's highest honor. As a result, no wake was held
last week for Galindo in the Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico's most
important theater. Galindo's family protested the theater's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mariela Flores, and four children,
Valentina, Alejandro, Rosa and Lourdes.

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Feb. 10:
</P>
<P>
   For all its economic and technological prowess, Microsoft is
tone-deaf when it comes to public relations. Last week, in the
latest of a string of fiascos, the company was embarrassed at its
antitrust trial by a video demonstration that turned out to have
been clumsily doctored.
</P>
<P>
   But the question before Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in federal
court is not images. It is whether the Justice Department is
correct in arguing that Microsoft has illegally used its monopoly
power to punish rivals and partners and expand its software
business in other areas. So far the trial has demonstrated that the
company faces a tough time challenging the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   The original focus of the Microsoft trial was on whether the
company illegally combined its own Internet Explorer browser with
its basic Windows software in order to muscle aside the rival
browser made by Netscape. It has expanded into a larger government
argument that Microsoft engaged in predatory conduct with rivals.
Microsoft argues that it is not a monopoly because of the fiercely
competitive and fast-changing environment in computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Microsoft repeated its line that special deals with
Intuit and other companies are no different from various exclusive
licensing arrangements throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   As for tying its operating software to a browser, Microsoft
argues that doing so is defensible as long as consumers get a
better product out of it. In the last few weeks, now that Microsoft
is presenting its own case in the trial, several of its witnesses
have tried to show that consumers do indeed benefit from fully
integrated computer and software products. The Justice Department
has repeatedly argued, on the other hand, that the chief advantage
gained from product integration is to Microsoft itself, and that
Microsoft tried to transform its operating system chokehold into a
club, forcing competitors and consumers to choose products they
might not otherwise want.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has a few more weeks to buttress its case. But what is
interesting about the trial is the extent to which the economic and
technological landscape outside the courtroom has changed even
since proceedings began last year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's argument that it is not a monopoly at present seems
questionable. Most experts find that a 95 percent market share in
personal computer operating systems is a monopoly. On the other
hand, many of these same experts speculate that in a matter of
years there may be other products offering access to the Internet
for consumers. It may soon be possible to pick up a telephone, turn
on a television or flip on a hand-held device to get on the
Internet, without using Windows at all.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the real world yet. Right now, the Justice
Department is right to demand that Microsoft not use its current
monopoly to restrict consumer choices.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has had many miscues in this trial, not least the
videotaped testimony of Bill Gates in which he seemed to dodge
about in a performance worthy of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, it is best not to see the drama as one of villains
and heroes but rather one of competitors using every advantage to
go after the competition.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, applying antitrust principles more than
a century old, has a constructive role to play in insuring that
certain basic ground rules of fair competition are observed. In a
rapidly changing environment, the entire industry benefits from
unfettered competition and basic fairness.

MARTIN J. NORRIS, 91, JUDGE AND AUTHORITY ON MARITIME LAW
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin J. Norris, a retired Coast Guard administrative law judge
who wrote widely cited books on maritime law, died Monday at Sound
Shore Hospital in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 91 and lived in
Eastchester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Norris was a judge from 1956 until he retired in 1970, said his
wife, Helen. He sat mostly in the courthouse in Manhattan and heard
cases involving the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Norris applied his maritime expertise to the issue of
salvaging material from the wreck of the Titanic, which had been
located two years earlier. The discoverers had proposed that the
wreck site remain undisturbed as a memorial. Norris disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the French salvaging company recovering
artifacts and equipment from the luxury liner Titanic,'' he wrote
in a letter published in The New York Times, ``feels aggrieved that
there are critics who call the salvors pirates and plunderers. He
stands on firm ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern laws of all maritime countries encourage the
activities of salvors who turn what might be a total loss of
property into a partial loss, or perhaps complete recovery for the
benefit of the owner,'' he wrote. ``While recognizing the
sentimental aspect of the Titanic disaster, I submit that the
Titanic is commercial maritime property and a proper subject of
salvage efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   His writings include the two-volume work ``The Law of Maritime
Personal Injuries'' (West Group) and the three-volume work ``The
Law of Seamen'' (West Group).
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Norris received his law degree in 1930 from
Brooklyn Law School and worked in government in Washington and New
York from 1936 to 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Barbara, of
Wyckoff, N.J., three grandchildren and a great-grandson.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 10:
</P>
<P>
   As the United Nations gropes for a new policy on Iraq and deals
with other dangerous conflicts, U.S. interests are ill served by
the vacancy in Washington's top post at the United Nations. Last
year President Clinton nominated Richard Holbrooke, a seasoned and
forceful diplomat. But his Senate confirmation has been delayed by
a long ethics investigation by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Holbrooke has paid $5,000 to settle the civil case
while admitting no wrongdoing, his nomination should be approved.
But the department was right to defend an important principle,
however technical the issues in this case. The ethical rules
involved must be observed by anyone like Holbrooke who moves back
and forth between jobs in the government and private business. The
government properly limits former officials from seeking assistance
or favors from the agencies where they worked. Holbrooke under
federal law would be barred from contacting State Department
officials for personal or third-party benefit for at least a year
after he left the department.
</P>
<P>
   While the rigidity of the rules may discourage some people from
government service, there is a need to prevent conflicts of
interest and lobbying abuses. The Justice Department maintains that
Holbrooke committed a civil violation of ethics laws when he
contacted the U.S. ambassador to South Korea while working for the
investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston. The case concerns
Holbrooke's trip to Seoul in May 1996, three months after he
resigned from the State Department. He wrote to Ambassador James
Laney, an old friend, to say that he wanted to see President Kim
Young-sam, another friend, and asked Laney to arrange the meeting.
This and two subsequent letters to Laney about his visit did not
mention Credit Suisse business but were written on company
stationery. The company paid for his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke had just negotiated the Bosnia peace accords. Winston
Lord, at the time assistant secretary of state for East Asia, says
he had asked Holbrooke _ who held that post in the Carter
administration _ to brief Korean officials on Bosnia and other
European issues during his trip. Lord reasonably argues that
bypassing the ambassador would have been rude. A luncheon with
Korean officials that Laney arranged did not deal with Credit
Suisse business.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department acknowledged that it was not accusing
Holbrooke of willfully violating the ethics laws or alleging that
he or Credit Suisse benefited financially from his communications
with Laney. But Holbrooke created the appearance of a conflict with
his request on company stationery and the timing of his contacts.
He asserts the communications were proper because of his status at
the time as an unpaid official consultant to the Secretary of
State.
</P>
<P>
   With the $5,000 payment and agreement by both Holbrooke and
Justice to drop the matter, the case has been properly resolved,
and Holbrooke is needed urgently at the United Nations.

LPGA HALL OF FAME ADDS ALCOTT AND DANIEL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla.)  (nk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Alcott and Beth Daniel became the two newest members of the
LPGA Hall of Fame Tuesday, based on a new points system for
induction that was overwhelmingly approved by the tour's
membership. In addition, a veterans committee will be established
to consider retired players for possible induction.
</P>
<P>
   Entry into the LPGA Hall of Fame has long been considered one of
the toughest achievements in sports. Under the old criteria, a
player had to win at least 30 official events including two majors,
or 35 official events and one major, or 40 events excluding majors.
Only 14 players had been inducted since 1950, and none since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, active players will gain Hall of Fame
admittance on the following criteria:
</P>
<P>
   _ They must have been an active LPGA member for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ They must have at least won one of the following _ a major
LPGA championship, the Rolex Player of the Year award, or the Vare
Trophy for lowest-scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   _ Accumulated 27 Hall of Fame points, with 2 points awarded for
winning a major championship, 1 point awarded for winning a
non-major, 1 point for the Vare Trophy and 1 point for player of
the year award.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, both Daniel (39 points) and Alcott (35
points) easily gained entry. It was an honor and a relief for both
players, who had been on the verge of induction for years. Alcott
has 29 victories, including five majors, but she had been seeking
her 30th victory since 1991. Daniel has 32 victories but only one
major, so she needed either three more victories, or another major,
to qualify under the previous requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long road, and even though they meant well, I
really got tired of people telling me, `C'mon on Amy, you can win
one more,''' said Alcott, who will turn 43 later this month. ``In
my heart, I know I will win again. But this is a momentous day in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, who is 42, is a two-time U.S. Amateur champion, and she
won the McDonald's LPGA Championship in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   `` It's an unbelievable honor,'' Daniel said during Tuesday's
news conference in Los Angeles. ``It's amazing to think that since
1950, only 14 players had been inducted. I think the new criteria
will help current players who stand out in their era. It's still a
difficult criteria, but it's more attainable, and I think it will
make our Hall of Fame better.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Caponi and Judy Rankin are two inactive players who are
likely to gain future induction through the veterans committee.
Both Caponi and Rankin accumulated enough points under the new
format, but the veterans committee will not be selected until
March, and players will not be nominated for induction until at
least next year.
</P>
<P>
   With Daniel and Alcott in, Annika Sorenstam becomes the active
player closest to gaining induction. At age 28, Sorenstam has
already earned 24 points, with 14 victories including two majors,
three player of the year awards and three Vare Trophies. Laura
Davies (22 points), Hollis Stacy (22 points) and Juli Inkster (20
points) are the other active players with at least 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has taken the LPGA membership years of evaluation and
discussion to create an objective and fair set of qualifications,''
said Gail Graham, who heads the Hall of Fame committee.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 members of the LPGA Hall of Fame are: Patty Berg, Betty
Jameson, Louise Suggs, Babe Zaharias, Betsy Rawls, Mickey Wright,
Kathy Whitworth, Sandra Haynie, Carol Mann, JoAnne Carner, Nancy
Lopez, Pat Bradley, Patty Sheehan, and Betsy King. Dinah Shore was
inducted as an honorary member in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Seve Ballesteros, the late Lloyd Mangrum and Alcott will be
honored as inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame during a
ceremony March 22, at the World Golf Village in St. Augustine, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel has chosen to defer her induction until next year, the
LPGA's 50th anniversary.

DEVILS, WARRIORS ON THE ROAD, STRUGGLE AT HOME

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New Jersey Devils stumbled at home
once again Tuesday night, suffering a 4-3 loss to the lowly
Vancouver Canucks, and afterward Scott Stevens, the captain, let
his teammates know just how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play together, play harder and play smarter,''
Stevens told reporters as his fellow Devils looked on from their
lockers. ``We love to play teams like the Rangers, but we have to
play with the same desire against teams like Nashville. The thing
is that this team is based on playing good defense, and we didn't
do it tonight, but it's a little early to push the panic button.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens had called a players' meeting after the game, the
Devils' fourth in a row (0-3-1) without a victory at Continental
Arena, where New Jersey's record now is 11-10-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little chat that Scott and some of the older guys
initiated,'' Martin Brodeur said. ``We scored three goals tonight,
but we have to bear down defensively. There were too many
breakdowns on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That is absolutely true, but what is also true is that Brodeur
has been playing poorly at home at a time he has been brilliant on
the road. He faced 33 shots Tuesday night and allowed goals to Brad
May, Dave Scathard, Dave Gagnier and the winner to Todd Bertuzzi,
who broke a 3-3 tie with 8 minutes 36 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a nice play,'' Brodeur said of Bertuzzi's winner, his
sixth goal of the season, which came on a spinaround back-hander in
the slot after a pass by Mark Messier on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Daneyko, Scott Stevens and Bobby Holik scored for the Devils
(29-17-6), who took 41 shots against Garth Snow.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have the best record in the league on the road but
they are becoming easy prey at home. The Canucks (17-28-7) came
into New Jersey with three victories in 19 games and smacked a team
with Stanley Cup aspirations right in the face with the last two
goals in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The game was so full of mistakes at both ends of the ice that
there were 53 shots in the first two periods, 33 by the Devils. The
score was tied at 2-2 as a result of poor goaltending by Snow and
Brodeur and some sluggish defense by both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Four goals came in the first period, with Vancouver scoring the
first two before the game was just over five minutes old. May and
Scathard gave the Canucks the lead, but the Devils tied with with
goals by Daneyko and Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless middle period, Holik broke the tie with his
21st of the season, just 35 seconds into the third, when he gloved
a floated pass by Stevens, pivoted to his right and beat Snow just
inside the left post with a shot from the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   But Gagnier tied it for the Canucks at 2:38 with a soft shot
from close range on the right for his fifth of the season to the
set the stage for Bertuzzi's winer.

STRESS FRACTURE FORCES SPREWELL BACK TO SIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Latrell Sprewell, the controversial player the New
York Knicks risked their image to acquire in an attempt to renovate
their style and improve their chances of winning a championship,
will miss three to six weeks because of a stress fracture of the
right heel.
</P>
<P>
   What was thought to be just a precautionary magnetic resonance
imaging test Tuesday afternoon revealed an injury that could leave
the team without Sprewell for half of the compacted 50-game season
if he is out for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is tough because everyone was excited to see how the talent
would mesh,'' said Dave Checketts , the president and chief
executive officer of Madison Square Garden, who took on the public
relations gamble and made the deal for Sprewell on Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's on hold now. But there is nothing we can do about it.
We can't sit around and mope. This means a bigger role for Dennis
Scott and Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby. I think it's a bump in the
road, albeit a bigger one than we'd like it to be. But this team
has always dealt well with adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of folding when Patrick Ewing crashed down on his wrist
and missed the last four months of last season, Knicks coach Jeff
Van Gundy managed to keep his team together and advance to the
second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly for Latrell,'' Van Gundy said in a statement
released by the team Tuesday night. ``But the reality is, we now
have to get ready and face Washington tomorrow without him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will face an uncertain future without him, too. They
were in the process of finding an identity with Sprewell, and
getting away from the decade-long post-up offense that revolved
around Patrick Ewing. Now, the Knicks will have to regroup and find
a new mix _ or return to the old one _ in order to work themselves
out of the struggles that have left them with an 0-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' said Sprewell, who played in
just two regular season games for the Knicks after sitting out 14
months due to the lockout and his 68-game suspension for choking
Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had every intention of suiting up to play tomorrow, but the
injury was more than I thought,'' he said in a statement. ``I will
do everything I can to remain in the best shape possible while my
heel improves so I can get back on the court with my teammates as
soon as possible. It's going to be frustrating to have to watch
from the sidelines after such a long time away, but we have a great
group of players who I'm confident will be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sprewell's place, Van Gundy could return to a more
traditional approach and start the reserve power forward Kurt
Thomas _ who has played extremely well _ and move Larry Johnson to
small forward.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sprewell's absence leaves the Knicks without a strong source of
offense and a defensive presence. In the trade to acquire Sprewell,
the Knicks gave up depth in John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry
Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks did put together a talented roster before the
training camp ended. Players who have had limited roles so far,
like Camby and Scott, will have their chance to prove themselves
with more playing time. ``I think there is still the unknown for
us,'' Checketts said. ``We were getting to know each other as it
is. This makes it more of a test of our depth and our
character.''Last year, the Knicks survived Ewing's injury by
relying on the progress of Allan Houston and the return to
dominance of Johnson. In many ways, the team thrived and developed
a drive-and-kick style of offense that was expected to be central
in the team's development with Sprewell this year. A veteran core
of Ewing, Johnson and Houston still remains. But with a season
filled with back-to-back-back games and little time for recovery
for the aging Knicks, the resilience of the team will be severely
tested until Sprewell's return.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell is just the latest in a line of stars to go down with
injuries in a season that has had provided little time for player
conditioning after the NBA's six-month lockout.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Sprewell's injury did not appear serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little sore,'' Sprewell said early Tuesday after the
Knicks practiced at SUNY-Purchase. ``It's like a bruise.''
</P>
<P>
   It was much more than that. Although an X-ray and a CAT-scan did
not show damage, the MRI revealed the stress fracture in his right
heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``No surgery will be required,'' the Knicks team physician, Dr.
Norman Scott, said in a statement. ``Latrell will wear a walking
boot, also known as a removable cast, to provide stress relief. He
will continue conditioning on the bike and in the pool. This will
have no long-term effect on his future.''
</P>
<P>
   The short-term effect on the Knicks, however, is far less
certain.

COMMENTARY: MRS. DOLE TAKES A LEAP INTO THE GENDER GAP
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It now seems likely that the first woman to become a really
serious candidate for president of the United States will be
Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Many people might have preferred somebody different _ a woman
less dependent on a famous husband for her name recognition, less
starchy or less implacable in her opposition to abortion. But Mrs.
Dole, who is now showing up at the top of some Republican polls in
New Hampshire, looks like the designated trailblazer.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, that seems logical. Democrats are always worrying
about whether a woman presidential candidate could appear tough
enough to veto bills and bomb other countries. But the Republican
Party's conservative wing already has an agenda with a surplus of
tough. A female candidate from the right might be able to massage
the anti-tax, anti-government, socially conservative agenda into
something that sounds palatable to the moderate majority.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, the former head of the American Red Cross, has not
said a word in public for years about anything more controversial
than blood donations. She made a political coming-out speech in New
Hampshire this week, drawing media from as far away as Japan.
Except for a few well-aimed shots at the Clinton presidency, she
did not take any stands beyond the breathtakingly obvious (``As a
conservative, I hate waste''). But she did a good job of outlining
her marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole is going to sell herself as the Republican who can
close the gender gap while still promoting a core party message.
The Republicans have had a problem with women voters since the
mid-'80s, and it gets worse whenever the party nominates men who
look as if they're going to yell. The gap opened wide when Newt
Gingrich became the GOP standard-bearer, and it hit some sort of
critical mass when Mrs. Dole's husband became the presidential
candidate. Bob Dole has many good qualities, but his public persona
is very close to that of an old guy who won't let the kids come
into his yard to retrieve their ball. Elizabeth Dole, who says ``my
gracious'' a lot and reminds her audiences that ``we are all God's
children,'' is going to be the kindly auntie who settles squabbles
and hands out glasses of lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole made several references to the narcotics problem that
seemed to suggest that its roots lay in Hollywood's glamorization
of drug use. It's a theory much beloved by conservatives, even
though TV programs aimed for the teen-age market now have an
anti-drug hysteria that resembles ``Reefer Madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally her points seemed less like actual thoughts than an
attempt to see how many right-wing buzzwords could be strung into a
single paragraph. ``Do we assume responsibility for our culture and
our choices, or has government wrested that from us, paying for its
power with confiscatory taxation?'' she asked sweetly.
</P>
<P>
   Like any candidate interested in a women's agenda, Mrs. Dole
spent a great deal of time talking about schools. ``We can afford
newer, safer classrooms with smaller classes,'' she said, tossing
in better-trained teachers, longer school days and extended school
years. But the issue, she said, ``is not more or less federal
spending. It's not public schools or private, vouchers or
commitment to public education.'' By now we were practically
falling off our seats waiting to hear what it is, and there has
never been such a thudding letdown since the final episodes of
``Twin Peaks.'' ``The ultimate test of our resolve,'' she
announced, ``is not how much money Washington gives to school
districts, but how much control Washington gives back to parents
and teachers.'' On the list of things about local public schools
that have parents worried, federal control ranks about 33rd.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mere fact that Mrs. Dole seems to wish the public
schools well is a refreshing change from some of her fellow
Republicans. Her New Hampshire address was no barn-raiser, but that
does not mean she is going to be a poor candidate. People who
underestimate her make the mistake of failing to consider how bad
her male opposition can be. She delivers her speeches as written,
word for word, a habit her critics point to as proof she is too
inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   An Elizabeth Dole public appearance does indeed have a sense of
being rehearsed as carefully as a royal wedding. But anybody who
followed Bob Dole or George Bush through their New Hampshire
primaries, trying to make sense of their off-the-cuff remarks,
knows that spontaneity can be a very overrated commodity. Every
sentence of hers may be predictable, but at least they all contain
subjects and verbs.

MAYBE THE LAKERS DO NEED RODMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal must have been a child, knee-high to the Statue
of Liberty, the last time his opinion was taken this lightly.
</P>
<P>
   You !ital!say you want that robot, his mom might have told him
at the toy store. But you don't really want it. You'll grow tired
of it. Now get in the car. Careful of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Today Shaq is an adult. The toy he wants is Dennis Rodman in
Lakers gold and purple. Wind it up and it rebounds, it mixes a mean
drink and its hair changes colors before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But just about everybody with an opinion to peddle on the air or
on paper says Shaq shouldn't want this toy at all.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody's wrong and it might be us.
</P>
<P>
   This started during the short Lakers training camp, when O'Neal
looked around at a practically unaltered roster, declared that it
needed ``a thuggish forward,'' and put in a good word for a certain
ex-Chicago Bull in limbo between free agency and retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' O'Neal was quoted saying, proposing to speak for
his teammates, ``we're not really worried about what (Rodman does)
off the court, just on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Lakers voiced support, however measured, for signing
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox: ``. . . Whatever comes along with that, those 13-14
(rebounds) are pretty nice to have, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper: ``As long as he doesn't dress in drag and sit next
to me, he's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Magic Johnson, a Lakers co-owner and vice president,
suggested they could bring in Rodman and ``not let him wreck what
we've built.'' Johnson harkened back to his playing days, when the
press said Bob McAdoo would ``wreck our chemistry,'' but owner
Jerry Buss took a chance on the big guy and ``he gave us two
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rodman's people and Lakers executive VP Jerry
West have been locked in something resembling negotiations, and the
possibility remains that he'll sign here for a prorated share of
the $1 million NBA veteran's minimum.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's plea can be viewed two ways.
</P>
<P>
   Either he's the latest star player to horn in on the general
manager's job, trying to pick his teammates. Magic did it. Michael
Jordan did it. Wayne Gretzky did it. It's bad, but they get away
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Or he's a star player whose opinion matters in this case. Bingo.
</P>
<P>
   The Rodman question is whether his resume (five NBA
championships, seven all-defensive-team honors, seven consecutive
rebounding titles) are worth the distractions he causes. Who better
to answer it than the distractees _ the players?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and his teammates aren't naive kids (though some of us
treat them as if they were). They know Rodman and they know his
ex-teammates. They know the pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman could improve their rebounding and defense and therefore
their fast break, nonexistent in the first three games. He could
guard Utah's Karl Malone. He could give the Lakers a much bigger
shot at their first NBA championship in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman also could give them a giant headache.
</P>
<P>
   But who knows what's in their heads better than the players
themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, when Lakers players are willing to sacrifice _ their
sanity? _ in pursuit of a title, it's an opportunity too rare to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a Dennis Rodman fan. He's a hedonist, a self-promoter, a
media manipulator. Divide the world into good guys and bad guys and
he's a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan once said, ``I figure he's a shy person and that's the
way he expresses himself.'' That's a good argument for shy people
to stay home. But there's a reason Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Phil
Jackson and the rest of the Chicago Bulls put up with Rodman.
Because they wouldn't have won the last three titles without him.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, in Rodman's years with Detroit, San Antonio and
Chicago, he was such a distraction that those teams went 29-16
against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   To get him on their side, the Lakers have to get him on their
terms. It should be a one-year contract, or whatever fraction of a
normal season we're down to. So they can dump him if it doesn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a simple deal _ Rodman gets $600,000, or whatever
fraction of the $1 million he's down to, plus the $3 million his
shoe company promises for playing in Los Angeles, New York or
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It should happen only after the Lakers see proof Rodman is in
shape at age 37 and hear assurance he still wants to ``work hard at
winning,'' as Jordan once described his teammate's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A dedicated Rodman might be a steal for $600,000. If it doesn't
turn out that way? If Rodman comes in and spoils a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   Then it's one year lost. Then Shaq was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   An adult has the right to be wrong.
