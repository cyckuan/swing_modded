<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Joint Efforts on Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Ambassador in Dhaka Saturday
suggested strong coordinated efforts by Bangladesh, Myanmar and
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to
speed up the repatriation of the Rohingya refugees of Myanmar now
staying in camps of Bangladesh, the United News of Bangladesh (UNB)
reported.
</P>
<P>
"If coordination and cooperation among the three parties are
not in harmony, the process of repatriation cannot be speeded up,
then there will be delays," said Myanmar Ambassador in Dhaka Ohn
Thwin.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with UNB, the ambassador said his country has
already accepted more than 230,000 refugees. Out of the 7,000
cleared refugees, more than 1,500 were repatriated and another 5,
500 are in the process of scrutiny for repatriation, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Bangladesh officials, some 250,877 Rohingyas
entered the country in 1991, 20,964 of which are still awaiting
repatriation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the agreed discussions about the repatriation
among the three parties in September, 1998, the ambassador said
the people to be repatriated must be voluntary at their own will.
</P>
<P>
The issue of repatriation of Rohingya refugees was expected to
come up during the Myanmar Prime Minister Than Shwe's planned
visit to Dhaka on May 29, which was postponed due to his stated
indisposition.
</P>
<P>
Asked about any chance of rescheduling the visit sometime this
year, Thwin said the Chairman of State Peace and Development
Council of Myanmar will visit Bangladesh at a time mutually
convenient for both sides.

<HEADLINE> Slain Sri Lankan Minister, Wife Laid to Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Sri Lankan cabinet
minister and his wife who were among 25 people killed in a Tamil
Tiger suicide bombing in Colombo's suburb earlier this week were
laid to rest Saturday evening here amid tight security and bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industrial Development C. V. Gunaratne and his wife
were accorded state funerals by the government of President
Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 people were also injured in the bombing on Wednesday in
the southern Ratmalana suburb, when the suicide bomber blew
himself up as the minister was leading a procession during the
first War Heroes Day to collect donations for the army.
</P>
<P>
The assassination was blamed on the rebels of Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have been fighting for a separate
homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since
1983.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, the procession carrying the coffins of the
minister and his wife made its way from a municipal office in a
Colombo suburb to a nearby cremation ground.
</P>
<P>
The government had tightened security for the minister's
funeral as many cabinet ministers and diplomats were present.
</P>
<P>
Only the vehicles of cabinet ministers and diplomats were
allowed closer to the funeral grounds.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people from all walks of life gathered to pay
their final tribute the minister. Some were seen weeping openly at
the grounds.
</P>
<P>
Speakers from all parties and religious dignitaries spoke of
the minister's contribution to the island nation. They said
Gunaratne worked tirelessly to bring communal harmony to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Two senior ministers read messages sent by President
Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The
president's message was of a personal nature. It was addressed to
the minister's children who had lost both their parents.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday Kumaratunga had paid her last respect to
the slain minister when his body was brought to the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The president made her way to the Parliament by a helicopter as
security was beefed up in the capital Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bandaranaike's message called for all Sri
Lankans to unite to defeat the fascist LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
A message from His Holiness the Pope condemned the
assassination of the minister.

<HEADLINE> Pierce Wins French Open Singles Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Mary Pierce became the first
Frenchwoman since 1967 to win the French Open singles title by
beating Conchita Martinez 6-2, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Among a capacity crowd of about 15,000 was Francoise Durr, the
last Frenchwoman to win the title at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
The sixth-seeded Pierce, whose only other Grand Slam title came
at the 1995 Australian Open, accepted the first-place trophy from
Martina Navratilova. Durr then kissed Pierce on both cheeks, and
the two French Open champions hugged.
</P>
<P>
Pierce, 25, has had a strained relationship in the past with
French fans, sometimes drawing jeers for lackluster play. But
they warmly embraced her this year, even though she was born in
Canada, lives in Florida and speaks with an American accent.
</P>
<P>
Pierce earned 575,000 U.S. dollars for the title while Martinez,
fifth seed, received 287,500 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the men's final Sunday, fifth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten of
Brazil will try for his second French Open title against third-
seeded Magnus Norman of Sweden.

<HEADLINE> S. African Rule Breakers Offered Indeminity for Coming Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Sacked cricket captain Hansie
Cronje and disgraced team-mates Herschelle Gibbs and Henry
Williams were offered indemnity from criminal prosecution by
public prosecutor Bulelani Ngcuka if they fully disclosed their
alleged involvement in match fixing.
</P>
<P>
Sipho Ngwema, spokesman for the National Directorate of Public
Prosecutions, on Saturday said the gesture was aimed at ending
corruption in South African cricket as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that each person who participated in
match fixing is exposed," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Ngwema said it was hoped that the offer to Cronje, Gibbs and
Williams would result in other people possibly involved, but who
have not been called by the inquiry, being summoned to the
commission.
</P>
<P>
"The condition is that Judge Edwin King must be happy that the
testimonies (of the three) were frank and honest and that they
participated with the commission fully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngwema said if other individuals came forward with information,
their cases would be dealt with individually.
</P>
<P>
Cronje was axed as captain in April after admitting to taking
up to 15,000 U.S. dollars from a bookmaker for forecasting and
predicting matches.
</P>
<P>
At the time he denied match fixing allegations and approaching
his own players.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Gibbs and Williams shocked the cricket world
when they revealed at the King Commission that Cronje offered them
15,000 dollars each, to underperform in the last one-day
international against India earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
They both accepted the offer, but neither received any money.
Gibbs claimed he forgot about the deal and went on to score 74
runs instead of the maximum of 20, while Williams left the field
injured before being able to concede 50 runs from his 10 overs.
</P>
<P>
Gibbs and Williams both face disciplinary action by the United
Cricket Board, with Gibbs already being dropped from the national
cricket team to tour Sri Lanka next month.

Addressing presidents and heads of delegations at the closing

The final declaration of the summit entitled the "Tehran
Declaration" includes crucial points and programs whose

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Committed to Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda and Uganda have agreed to
end their fighting in Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks after he held consultation talks
 respectively with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan
President Paul Kagame earlier Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival from Kagali, the capital of Rwanda, Chiluba
said that he was happy over the outcome of his talks with the two
leaders who reaffirmed their commitment to ceasefire in Kisangani,
the centre of diamond trade of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who left here this morning for Uganda and then for
Rwanda, said that his mission was to find a way to implement the
Lusaka ceasefire agreement signed last year by all the parties
involved in the war, which broke in August in 1998 in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Chiluba, Kagame said that his country is doing
every thing to see to it that the fighting, which resumed in
Kisangani last Monday, will come to an end.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that the continued meeting will bear
fruit soon.
</P>
<P>
But Kagame accused Uganda of wanting his country to listen to
its order despite the fact that his country is sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that after a brief truce arranged by the United
Nations, heavy shelling between Rwandan and Ugandan forces
resumed in Kisangani, killing about 100 civilians and injuring 700
others.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda used to be allies, but now back different
rebel factions fighting in the DRC and have clashed several times
for control of Kisangani.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Build Third Subway Line in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has planned to expand the
capital's subway network by building a third line traversing the
north of the city, the country's Middle East News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed line is designed to link Cairo International
Airport in the northeast and the Imbaba District in the northwest,
Transport Minister Ibrahim el-Demiri said after a meeting of a
working group for the project.
</P>
<P>
The line, which will be built in three phases, is estimated to
cost about 10 billion Egyptian pounds (2.9 billion U.S. dollars),
el-Demiri was quoted as saying by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the cost will be covered by loans to be
provided by international banks and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is considering to build six more subway lines in Cairo as
it is one of the best and fastest ways to accommodate commuters,
el-Demiri added.
</P>
<P>
Cairo's existing two subway lines carry an average of 2 million
people each day, accounting for about 20 percent of the total
commuters.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Negotiators Leave for Peace Talks in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli negotiation team for
talks with the Palestinians on the final-status issues left for
Washington Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The team, headed by Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-
Ami, will resume the talks Monday with their Palestinian
counterparts, led by Palestinian Council Speaker Ahmed Qurei (Abu
Ala), at an undisclosed location near the American capital, Israeli
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the negotiators, including Ben-Ami and Qurei, had
participated in the so-called Stockholm back-channel talks, which
were revealed by media reports in May.
</P>
<P>
They are aiming to resolve thorny issues between them such as
the fate of Jerusalem, the return of Palestinian refugees, the
future of Jewish settlements, border, security and water, hoping to
reach a framework agreement and a final accord by September.
</P>
<P>
The Washington round of negotiations was secured by visiting U.
S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during her meeting with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat himself will go to Washington on June 14 to have a summit
with U.S. President Bill Clinton to prepare for a three-way meeting
between Clinton, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at
the end of June or early July.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and his
Israeli counterpart Oded Eran, who now concentrated their efforts
on the interim issues, were also ready to resume their talks in the
region this week.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio Sunday quoted Erekat as saying that in an
understanding having been reached with Israelis, all remaining 1,
600 Palestinians in Israeli prisons will be released once a
framework agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
In response, however, Barak's spokesman Gadi Baltiansky
clarified that Israel's position remains at the current stage that
all prisoners involved in killing Israelis will not be released.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin also told Israel Radio
that the prisoners issue is still being negotiated and he never
heard a promise to release all Palestinian security prisoners.
</P>
<P>
But the minister suggested the situation may change if the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process reaches a permanent accord on the
final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
Once there is a permanent solution, the prisoners issue will be
dealt with differently than in the interim period, he said.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Export to Iraq Rise to New Level: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's exports to Iraq amounted to
392 million U.S. dollars in the past six months under the United
Nations oil-for-food program, rising to a new level, an Egyptian
assistant foreign minister said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The exports in the seventh stage of the U.N. program increased
by 82 percent compared to the previous phase, setting a record for
exports in one phase, Soliman Awad said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed economic sanctions on Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, banning export of oil, its
main hard currency earner. But the oil-for-food deal, launched in
December 1996, allows Baghdad to sell more than billions dollars
worth of oil in every six months for buying food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The exports included equipment and raw materials worth 160
million dollars, foodstuffs worth 185 million dollars, 42 million
dollars worth of cars, and soap and industrial detergents worth 5
million dollars, Awad said, adding the private sector had the
lion's share of the exports.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the Egyptian exports to Iraq has indicated that
there are wider prospects for economic and trade cooperation
between Egypt and Iraq in the coming period, the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad severed diplomatic relations with Cairo over Egyptian
participation in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait. But the ties have been on the mend over the past three
years, especially in the trade area, due to Egypt's weight in the
Arab world and close relations with Western countries, the United
States in particular.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian exports to Iraq have totalled 1.442 billion dollars
under the U.N. deal, making it Iraq's largest trade partner in the
Arab world and the fifth largest after Russia, China, France and
India in the world.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Regional Cooperation in Facing Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here on Sunday Central Asian and Caucasian countries
should bolster cooperation to face challenges brought about by the
globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Iran believes regional countries should enhance and
institutionalize cooperation to take advantage of the opportunities
and deal with the challenges of globalization, Kharrazi said at an
international seminar on the Central Asian and the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran is the best route to set up a pipeline linking
landlocked countries in Central Asia to the outside world so that
their rich oil and gas resources could be transported to the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the pipeline through Iran is the shortest, the
cheapest and the safest for the Central Asian and the Caucasian
states to the international market, he said.
</P>
<P>
None of the countries in the region has the capability and the
technology that Iran has in shipment and export of oil, he added.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in his speech, the minister reiterated a legal regime
acceptable to all should be established among countries bordering
the Caspian Sea so that these states could cooperate in developing
and utilizing resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran has given number one priority to develop diplomatic
relations with its northern neighbors in the Central Asian region
and will follow the same policy in the future.
</P>
<P>
Over 160 experts from 32 countries are taking part in the two-
day seminar which started Sunday under the sponsorship of the
Institute of Political and International Studies affiliated to the
Iranian Foreign Ministry.

</P>
<P>
Prescott will hold talks with Sierra Leone President Ahmad

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Troops Withdraw From Positions in Kisangani, Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The command of the Uganda People's
Defence Forces (UPDF) has taken a decision to withdraw its troops
from positions it held on June 5 in Kisangani, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, after it reviewed the situation in the
city.
</P>
<P>
James Wapakabulo, chairman of the National Coordination
Committee on the Region, made the remarks at a press conference
here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We are now not in the town, and have withdrawn from
the Tchopo Bridge" back to Kapalata.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. observer team has taken over the bridge, and their
vehicles and U.N. flag were there, said Wapakabulo, adding: "We
hope that the Rwandan Patriotic Army will respect the U.N."
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal aims to dispel the Rwandan worldwide circulated
rumour that in spite of the understanding between Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni and Zambian President Frederick Chiluba,
the UPDF was planning an all out offensive against the Rwandan
Patriotic Army in Kisangani in order to capture the town, said
Wapakabulo.
</P>
<P>
"It is also aimed at concentrating focus on higher national,
regional and international goals enshrined in the Lusaka
Cease-fire Agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government reiterates its earlier concern that once
again the international community has allowed Rwanda to go
unpunished in spite of U.N. presence in Kisangani, a northeast
city of the DRC, said Wapakabulo.
</P>
<P>
"This will create conditions for escalation of instability in
the region, " he added.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government assures that it remains firmly
committed to the demilitarization of Kisangani and the upholding
of Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement, Wapakabulo said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda, the former two allies, have their troops
stationed in Kisangani where they have supported rival rebel
factions fighting the DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The two armies have clashed frequently since early May, and
fighting has caused heavy civilian casualties in the city.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denounces Rwanda for Breaking Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda denounced that Rwanda has
broken various agreements, cease-fires and troop withdrawal from
Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), James
Wapakabulo, chairman of the National Coordinations Committee on
the Region, said here Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Wapakabulo said: "Following six
days of the senseless carnage and mayhem of the Rwandan People
Army (RPA) in Kisangani, it becomes abundantly clear that the RPA
was not interested in a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
He said the RPA had frustrated the bilateral arrangement for
simultaneous withdrawal on Monday and the unilateral cease-fire
and withdrawal proposed by Uganda on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The RPA had also frustrated the multilateral agreement reached
by the presidents of Uganda and Rwanda with the assistance of the
U.N. and the U.S. government on the afternoon of June 8," said
Wapakabulo.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that four officers of the Uganda People's Defence
Forces (UPDF) were killed when they tried to negotiate the
multilateral cease-fire ordered by the June 8 tele-conference,
saying that the murder of the four UPDF officers in the process of
implementing the multilateral cease-fire arrangement lies squarely
at the hands of Rwandan government.
</P>
<P>
The RPA in Kisangani, the third largest city of the DRC, is
insensitive to the massive deaths of civilians and destruction of
property as it is continuously using Congolese people as human
shields in flagrant disregard of all international Conventions,
said Wapakabulo.
</P>
<P>
Wapakabulo accused the governments of Rwanda and the DRC of
undermining and frustrating the implementation of the Lusaka
Cease-fire Agreement, saying that this must be exposed and
condemned.

<HEADLINE> S. African Political Parties Condemn Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South African political
parties on Sunday joined in a chorus in condemning the bomb blast
which injured two people in Cape Town on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The United Democratic Movement (UDM) spokeswoman for safety and
security Annelize van Wyk urged the government to take tough
measures to protect the city from bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
What was needed was real and concerted police work, combined
with community involvement and awareness, she said.
</P>
<P>
No group has claimed responsibility for the blast which ripped
through a restaurant, wounding two people.
</P>
<P>
The Cape Peninsula has been a flashpoint of a series of bomb
blasts recently.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party (DP) safety and security spokesman Douglas
Gibson said parliament must be briefed on Cape bombers.
</P>
<P>
He said the bombing had once again put the spotlight firmly on
the government's inability to bring to book those people
responsible for a series of bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
Gibson said he supported the call by the DP's Western Cape
branch for the public to come forward and give police information
to assist in arresting the bombers.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Launch Investigation Into Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South African police have
launched an investigation into a bomb blast which injured two
people in Cape Town on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The shell of the red Toyota Corolla car carrying the bomb which
 detonated outside a Sea Point restaurant was taken for forensic
testing early on Sunday morning, police said.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Riaan Pool said no one had claimed
responsibility for the blast and that there had been breakthroughs
in the investigation. He refused to give details.
</P>
<P>
Two people, an adult and a five-year-old boy, were injured in
the explosion which occurred around 7.45pm outside the New York
Bagels and Sitdown Deli Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
The victims were taken to City Park hospital. A spokeswoman at
the hospital confirmed that the two had received treatment for
hearing loss, but were not admitted.
</P>
<P>
This is the second incident of a bomb being placed in that
vicinity.
</P>
<P>
On May 22, police deactivated a pipe bomb found by two vagrants
outside the same restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town has been the scene of a spate of bombings over the
past two years in which three people have been killed and 103
injured.
</P>
<P>
The worst of these claimed the lives of two and injured 26 when
a bomb exploded inside the Planet Hollywood restaurant at the
Victoria and Alfred Waterfront last year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in Johannesburg, the Democratic Party called for
 parliament to be briefed on the recent bombings in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament must be informed as to what is going on. The people
of the Western Cape cannot be expected to continue living in fear,
while the criminals remain at large," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Lee Kuan Yew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met with Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew, here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Lee arrived in Beijing earlier today for a working visit to
China and the Conference 2000 -- 21st Century Forum sponsored by
the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li, also honorary chairman of the organizing committee of the
conference, extended a welcome to Lee and said that economic
globalization has become a major trend. There are many views on
what consequences and impact the economic globalization will have
and he added that China needs to deal with globalization in an
energetic and active manner. The main theme of the conference is "
economic globalization -- Asia and China".
</P>
<P>
Calling Lee a man of insight, Li said that he is looking
forward to listening to Lee's speech at the coming conference.
</P>
<P>
Li said "development" is a main theme in China. Promoting
economic growth is a central task facing the Chinese people. If we
are to describe the numerous issues facing China today, they may
be encapsulated in one word -- "development". The key to these
issues is to accelerate China's development. And this will not
change, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lee said it is difficult to predict what the world will look
like in 30 or 40 years from now, as science and technology is
developing rapidly. Economic globalization is really a challenge
for all countries.
</P>
<P>
He believes that rapid development of science and technology
and the use of the Internet will make it easier for China to
access information and engage in numerous economic and
technological exchanges with other countries.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Okays Draft Law to Keep 2 Top Lebanese Guerrillas in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet approved on
Sunday a draft law to extend the detention of two Lebanese
resistance leaders and other guerrillas who fight against Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the cabinet decided
to table the draft legislation in the Knesset (parliament) this
week and work for its rapid enactment, the Prime Minster's Office
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the cabinet that Israel is obligated to
exhaust all chances to find out what happened to air force
navigator Ron Arad and other prisoners of war and those missing in
actions (MIAs), the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The two Lebanese "prisoners" are Mustafa Dirani of the Amal
movement and Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid of Hezbollah, who were held
by Israel for years as "bargaining chips" for Israeli MIAs in
Lebanon, Arad, in particular, whose jet was shot down in south
Lebanon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and the Amal movement are the two
main resistance groups fighting to oust the Israeli occupation
forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Judge Uri Goren of the Tel Aviv District Court said in Tel Aviv
in May that he will issue his verdict on the detention of Dirani
and Obeid on July 12 "unless the state decides to free them in the
meantime."
</P>
<P>
Dirani and Obeid appeared in open court for the first time on
May 29 to hear their case, as all previous hearings into their fate
were held behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
During the court hearing, government prosecutor Dvora Hen said
that Dirani and Obeid, two Shiite Muslim leaders whisked out of
Lebanon by Israeli commandos, pose a threat to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
"They were major leaders of a terrorist movement and there is a
significant risk that they will resume their activities in Lebanon
once they return," Hen added.
</P>
<P>
However, Hen said, that the two men could be freed by July 17 if
Israel decided not to extend their administration detention -- a
method used by Israel to keep people in jail without charge or
trial.
</P>
<P>
"Those people have never attacked an Israeli civilian and can
not be described as terrorists," their lawyer Avi Rish stated.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government and the resistance groups such as
Hezbollah, Party of God, vowed to continue their fight unless
Israel frees all Lebanese detained by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Obeid, a former Hezbollah religious leader, was snatched by
Israeli commandos from his home in south Lebanon in 1989, while
Dirani, the former Amal security chief, was seized by Israel in
1994.
</P>
<P>
In April, the Israeli supreme court ordered the release of 13
Lebanese.

<HEADLINE> Italy Beats Turkey 2-1 with Controversial Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy beat Turkey 2-1 in a Euro
2000 Group B match in the Dutch city of Arnhem on Sunday thanks
only to a controversial penalty awarded to and scored by striker
Filippo Inzaghi in the 70th minute.
</P>
<P>
Inzaghi went down in the penalty area as he and Turkish captain
Temizkenoglu Ogun were chasing a through ball. Scottish referee
Hugh Dallas ruled that Inzaghi had been elbowed before fell.
After the referee had no hesitation in pointing to the spot,
enraged Turkish fans pelted the pitch with plastic bottles and
other objects.
</P>
<P>
Italy had taken the lead in the 52nd minute when Juventus
midfielder Antonio Conte scored with an acrobatic overhead kick
just outside the goal area after a cross by Inzaghi cross was only
partially cleared by Alpay Ozalan.
</P>
<P>
Turkey equalized the score nine minutes later when unmarked
diminutive Galatasary midfielder Okan Buruk headed home a Sergen
Yalcin free kick. It was Turkey's first ever goal at a European
Championship finals. They failed to score in their only other
previous appearance in the finals four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Dino Zoff's side made a furious start to the match and the
Italians won seven corners in the first 14 minutes.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Colin McRae won the Acropolis Rally
on Sunday after Ford team mate Carlos Sainz obeyed team orders and
yielded leadership on the final stage.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Sainz held an advantage of more than 1-1/2 minutes
going into the closing 'Stromi-Inohori 2' run after McRae had
eased off throughout the last day to conserve his car.
</P>
<P>
Ford team bosses met both drivers on Saturday night and told
them to retain their overnight positions -- Sainz was 48.1 seconds
behind the Scot.
</P>
<P>
But Sainz stepped up the pace and finished in the top two on
the first five stages to move ahead.
</P>
<P>
McRae radioed in when he completed the final stage and Sainz
slowed to finish the world championship event in second place, 23.
1 seconds behind his teammate.
</P>
<P>
Subaru driver Juha Kankkunen was a distant third, more than six
minutes off the pace after three incident-filled days on Europe's
toughest rally.
</P>
<P>
World championship leader Richard Burns from Britain was forced
out before stage 14 after his Subaru failed to start following
turbocharger problems on the previous run while running third.
</P>
<P>
Finnish duo Makinen and Gronholm were early casualties of
Greece's unforgiving rocky terrain which allowed McRae to move
second, 14 points behind Burns in the drivers' championship.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Toshihiro Arai claimed his best world championship
finish witn fourth spot in his Subaru. Germany's Armin Schwarz
managed for a fifth spot and claimed three manufacturers' points
for Skoda.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand will host the next round of the championship on
July 13-16.

<HEADLINE> Israel Hopes Border Quiet with Syria, Lebanon Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The death of Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad has dampened Israeli expectation of an early
resumption of peace talks with Syria, but the Jewish state hopes
its borders with Syrian and Lebanon would keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak told his cabinet at its weekly
meeting that it appeared at first glance that the tranquility in
the borders would be maintained in the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
Assad died of a heart attack on Saturday at age 69, as the peace
process of the Middle East was at a crucial stage following
Israel's withdrawal from the south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office on Saturday, Barak expressed
his "understanding of the grief" of the Syrian people and
willingness to resume the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli newspapers said on Sunday that as Damascus focuses
its efforts on ensuring a smooth transfer of power, it seems
unlikely to resume the Israeli-Syrian peace talks early.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the long-time foes of Israel and Syria
resumed in December in the United States after an impasse of almost
four years, but they broke down only weeks later in dispute over
the fate of the occupied Golan Heights, which Syria demands back as
the price of peace.
</P>
<P>
Assad's son and designated heir Bashar, who is expected to be
chosen by parliament later this month to become president, is
unlikely to make concessions to win a deal with Israel, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel was among the first countries to respond to the Assad's
death. It said it will continue along the road of peace with the
new leadership that will emerge in Syria, "while standing firm on
its vital interests."

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
here Sunday rejected war as a solution to the Afghan crisis, and
said that Iran supports peaceful means to end the bloodshed in that
country.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Afghanistan's ousted president Burhanuddin
Rabbani, Khatami stressed the need for the United Nations, the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, and the regional countries
to step up their efforts to solve the Afghan problem, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated Iran's stance that political
negotiations should be held among different Afghan factions and
groups to form a government with the participation of all.
</P>
<P>
On the disaster of drought Afghanistan currently faces, Khatami
expressed hope that more efforts would be made to send relief
supply to the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, who was here for the sixth summit of the regional
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) held on Saturday, briefed
Khatami on latest developments in his country and cooperation among
the Northern Alliance groups which he leads against the ruling
Taliban regime.
</P>
<P>
The ousted president also called on international organizations
to help the drought-stricken people of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's Islamic government was driven out of the capital Kabul
in 1996 by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban militia, which now
controls more than 90 percent of the country.
</P>
<P>
Several Muslim countries have recognized the Taliban regime, but
Iran, as Afghanistan's western neighbor, still supports Rabbani.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Syrian President Hafez Assad, who suffered for years from
ailments that included diabetes, died late Saturday morning,
apparently from heart failure. His death immediately touched off
moves by Syria's political establishment to transfer power to the
president's eldest surviving son, Bashar al-Assad, a 35-year-old
ophthalmologist who is largely untested in politics.
</P>
<P>
-- In a campaign promise made recently, U.S. Vice President
Albert Gore has vowed to ensure that there is a fully qualified,
well-trained teacher in every single classroom in the United
States in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Although Syrian President Hafez al-Assad had long been in
ill health, his death from a heart attack on Saturday casts a
quick cloud of uncertainty over the dynamics of peace and conflict
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
-- Executives at Microsoft, confident that they will prevail on
appeal, say they have not yet discussed how to carry out a judge's
order to split the company. But consultants and veterans of big
corporate breakups warn that Microsoft risks losing employees and
paralyzing its business if it fails to lay plans quickly for a
prospect that it prefers to deny.

<HEADLINE> 2,500 Kosovo Refugees "Disappeared" in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Up to 2,500 refugees from Kosovo
who fled to Britain last summer are now living in the country
illegally and cannot be traced, the Home Office admitted.
</P>
<P>
Some of them are thought to have gone into hiding as their one-
year permits to stay in Britain expire.
</P>
<P>
The situation is potentially embarrassing for Home Secretary
Jack Straw who had promised all Kosovo refugees would be returned
home once their 12-month leave to stay ended.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 Kosovans were given sanctuary in Britain last
April as they escaped the war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Unlike asylum seekers from other countries, they did not have
to register their whereabouts with the authorities but were
expected to return home at the end of their year-long permits.
</P>
<P>
By June 1 this year, the Home Office said 1,527 refugees had
gone back to Kosovo under a government-funded voluntary
repatriation program.
</P>
<P>
A further 410 and their dependants had sought extensions to
their exceptional leave or were claiming asylum.
</P>
<P>
But a Home Office spokesman was unable to say how many of the
remaining 2,409 were in reception centers or refugee accommodation,
only that it was a "significant proportion."
</P>
<P>
The Home Office said: "We very much hope that having enjoyed
the hospitality of this country the remainder will return
voluntarily when their leave expires."
</P>
<P>
However, agencies including the Red Cross and the Refugee
Council say many refugees want to stay in Britain and some will be
working illegally on the black market.

<HEADLINE> 4 Million UK Children live in Poverty: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Up to four million UK children are
trapped in poverty, according to a United Nations report.
</P>
<P>
The report says Britain has one of the worst records on
childhood poverty in the industrialized world, the Observer
newspaper reported on Sunday, quoting the U.N. report as saying.
</P>
<P>
U.N. children's fund UNICEF estimates that nearly 20 percent of
young people live in UK families below the official poverty line --
with the household income below half median earnings.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said the UK's 20 percent of young people living in
families below the poverty line compared to less than 5 percent in
Sweden, Norway and Finland.
</P>
<P>
The UK also falls short of standards in Turkey, Poland and
Hungary, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also remains stuck in the bottom quarter of the world's
child poverty league when it is judged on absolute poverty --
where household income is below the U.S. official poverty line.
</P>
<P>
It came 14th out of 19 inspected countries, just above Italy,
according to the report.

Sen 19-21, 21-17, 21-11, putting the South Korean club in lead.
</P>
<P>
Kim, disputably the best penhold topspin player in the world,

Yan lost his normally tough nerves in the deciding set as Kim
launched a string of heavy loop drives and smashes.

Kong Linghui, China's 1995 world champion, snapped Joo Se Hyuk'
s giant-killing run with placement shots and forehand topspin
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Joo, 20, had upset China's dual Olympic champion Liu Guoliang
and 1992 Olympic gold medalist Jan-Ove Waldner from Sweden early
in the championship, but he could not pose any serious challenge
to world No. 1 Kong, losing 9-21, 18-21.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yong, 1996 Chinese national champion, claimed the lead
for China as he nipped South Korean Park Sang Joon 16-21, 21-14,
21-14.
</P>
<P>
Kong nailed Heilongjiang's victory with a 21-11, 21-17 win over
the 30-year-old Kim.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Treasury Gestures to Avoid General Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister Avraham
Shohat Sunday morning announced a three-week freeze on discussing a
tax reform plan, a gesture aimed to avoid a planned general strike
due to begin Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel Radio, Shohat called upon Amir Peretz, leader
of Histadrut, or Jewish Labor Federation, to return a favor to the
treasury's gesture, and to resume their dialog to cancel the
general strike, which will involve over 1 million unionized Israeli
workers.
</P>
<P>
In response, Peretz said he will review the gesture and consider
the possibility of calling off the strike. He also announced that
Histadrut leaders will convene Sunday night to make final decisions
on whether to carry out the work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli media reports, senior union officials said
Saturday night that if the Finance Ministry postpones
implementation of the tax reforms, the powerful labor union would
consider stopping the strike at the last minute or at least
limiting it to a shorter period of time.
</P>
<P>
The planned strike, announced last Sunday, was against the
government's tax reform plan, which was submitted by the Finance
Ministry to Prime Minister Ehud Barak last month.
</P>
<P>
The major controversial points between the union and the Finance
Ministry are the taxation of continued-education funds of average
workers, the abolishment of a half-point tax exemption for working
women and the canceling of tax breaks for shift workers in the
plan.
</P>
<P>
The planned walkout would in fact shut down the state as it will
affect all government ministries; local authorities; public
hospitals; railways, ports, and airports authorities; the state-
owned airlines, electric company, water company, telephone company,
military Industries; garbage collection; banks; universities and
more.
</P>
<P>
Essential services, such as birth and death certificates,
passports, drivers' licenses, vehicle registration renewals,
unemployment payments and services, will be halted during the
strike.
</P>
<P>
Local economists had estimated that the direct damage from the
strike will be between 600 million shekels (about 145 million U.S.
dollars) to 750 million shekels (about 181 million dollars) per day
-- an amount that will approach 1 billion (about 240 million
dollars) a day if the strike continues.
</P>
<P>
They further warned that the damage will increase as export and
import items begin spoiling at the ports, waiting for longshoremen
to handle the goods.

<HEADLINE> Shas May Remain in Barak's Coalition: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Labor and the religious
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party are close to reaching an agreement on the
continued participation of Shas in government, Israel Radio said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the third largest party with 17 seats in the Knesset
(parliament), has said that if the problem of its school network is
resolved, it would agree to oppose the bill calling for the
dissolution of the 15th Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The powerful Shas party voted for the bill proposed by Knesset
Member Avigdor Lieberman in a preliminary reading on Wednesday. The
initial approval of the bill plunged the 11-month-old coalition
government led by Prime Minister Ehud Barak into an unprecedented
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Shlomo Benziri, from Shas, said all outstanding
issues must be resolved before Shas changes its position on the
early-elections bill.
</P>
<P>
Shas has been demanding millions of shekels to fund its school
system which is debt-ridden due to poor management over the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Sarid from the left-wing Meretz Party refused
to allocate more funds to that system until it improves management
and fires corrupt officials, which resulted in a serious crisis in
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
For months, Barak had invested enormous time and energy in
efforts to settle the dispute, without success. The defection of
Shas, and other two coalition partners, resulted in the passing of
the anti-government bill in the preliminary reading in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Following the defeat, Barak set out to form a new coalition.
There have been reports that he prefers a majority government to a
narrow one without the current ruling partners of Shas, the
National Religious Party and the Yisrael Ba'aliya, all of them cast
favorable votes for the bill aimed to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
A senior Shas official was quoted by the Israeli newspaper
Ha'aretz on Sunday as saying that Shas leader Eli Yishai and
Minister Haim Ramon, a right-hand man of Barak, agreed on Saturday
that Barak will not present a government with the dismissal of Shas
ministers.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the effort to prevent the ousting of Shas from
the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
In another coalition activity, Barak's emissary and confident
Giora Eini met the anti-religious Shinui Party leader Yosef Lapid
on Saturday night to see "the possibility of Shinui joining a
government without Shas."
</P>
<P>
Sources familiar with the coalition negotiations believed that
Barak still prefers Shas over Shinui and hopes that his contacts
with Shinui would pressure Shas back into the coalition, with
increased loyalty.
</P>
<P>
Amid speculations that Barak intends to form a government
similar to the current one, Sarid said on Thursday that the Meretz
party would in no way give up the Education Ministry.

<HEADLINE> East Africa Taxes 25 Percent Common Tariffs on Import Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The East African Community
(EAC) of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have agreed to adopt a 25
percent common external tariffs to be taxed on import goods from
other parts of the world, local newspapers reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industries
and Agriculture Elvis Musiba told a workshop here that the three
countries reached the decision in a recent meeting in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha where EAC Secretariat sits.
</P>
<P>
"The move is geared to protect local manufacturing industries
and agricultural produce within the region," Musiba said when
speaking at a workshop on budget process organized by the Media
Development Association (MDA) in collaboration with Conrad
Foundation and the World Bank Institute.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the main thrust now was the possibility of
the EAC members in a meeting slated for July to waive the current
internal common import tariffs from 25 percent to zero.
</P>
<P>
However, Musiba said that there were some differences among the
EAC members with Tanzania holding that the program be implemented
in a three-year period while Kenya and Uganda proposing to start
immediately.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania suggests that the internal tariffs should stand at 15
percent this year and adopt five percent tariffs next year before
settling for the zero common tariffs in 2002," he added.
"Otherwise the move is likely to disrupt the economy as Tanzania
is yet to develop its manufacturing industries compared to Kenya
and Uganda."
</P>
<P>
The EAC was founded on November 30, 1999 when Kenya, Tanzania
and Uganda signed a treaty to replace the then East African
Cooperation. The EAC will expand and deepen economic, political
and social cooperation among the three neighboring states with a
combined population of about 80 million and territories of 1.8
million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The 153-Article Treaty for the Establishment of the East
African Community says that a Customs Union will be established as
the entry point of the Community, followed by a Common Market,
subsequently a Monetary Union and ultimately a Political
Federation of the East African States.
</P>
<P>
The main organs of the EAC are the Summit of Heads of State,
the Council of Ministers, the Coordination Committee, Sectoral
Committees, the East African Court of Justice, the East African
Legislative Assembly and the Secretariat.

<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
expressed "sincere and deep condolences to the people and
leadership of the Syrian Arab Republic on the unfortunate death of
President Hafez al-Assad," a Kremlin spokesman said Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Putin Blasts U.S. ABM Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
on Sunday strongly denounced the U.S. plan to deploy a national
missile defense (NMD) system and urged Europe to support the
preservation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the national missile shield is a "big
strategic error that will only increase strategic threats to the
United States and Russia, as well as other states," Putin said in
an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag.
</P>
<P>
He said he sees no real missile threat from the so-called "
rogue countries" mentioned by the U.S., and such a threat "is not
going to emerge in the visible future."
</P>
<P>
"The only reasonable and truly responsible approach lies in
another sphere. There is a positive alternative to the deployment
of the national ABM system," he said, stressing that "the powerful
arsenal of political and diplomatic cooperation" should be brought
in to tackle possible missile threats.
</P>
<P>
The Russia's constructive program to create an all-Europe non-
strategic ABM system means further cooperation in the development
of the disarmament process, including further profound reduction
of strategic offensive weapons under the auspices of the Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty-III (START III) and the preservation of the
ABM treaty, said Putin.
</P>
<P>
He urged that non-proliferation regimes should be strengthened
by establishing a global missile and missile technologies non-
proliferation system.
</P>
<P>
If Washington withdraws from the ABM treaty, Russia will
cancel its obligations not only under the START treaties, but also
under the treaty on elimination of medium and shorter-range
missiles, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He called on Europe to maintain the ABM treaty for "
consolidating the stability in the continent and in the world,"
warning Great Britain, Denmark and Norway that they "will risk
getting involved in the process to unpredictable destruction of
the strategic stability if involved in the U.S. missile shield
plan.
</P>
<P>
"The price could be very high," Putin emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He also said Russia is ready to discuss with all European
states, including Germany, "our initiative on setting up a unified
anti-missile defense system for Europe," which can "avoid the
destruction of the balance of power and secure the security of all
European nations."
</P>
<P>
Putin said that during his visit to Germany, scheduled for
Jane 14, he will discuss with German leaders the Russian plan of
developing a pan-European anti-missile system, adding that
relations with Berlin is a priority of Moscow's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He believes that his forthcoming trip to Berlin will give the
bilateral ties a new impetus.

<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- British government warned on Sunday
that unemployed soccer fans would lose their benefits if they were
arrested at the Euro 2000 tournament.
</P>
<P>
"If people are convicted during the competition, then they are
liable to lose their benefits," Social Security Secretary Alistair
Darling told Sky Television.
</P>
<P>
The moves were part of a crackdown on welfare cheats but he
denied reports that all unemployed British fans attending the
tournament faced an end to their benefits.
</P>
<P>
"What we are concerned about is not those fans who watch
football matches and behave themselves, but those who get into
trouble," he said. "If you comply with the conditions of being on
benefit, then there is nothing to worry about."

<HEADLINE> Small Hi-tech Firms Receive Support for Technological Innovations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Small high-tech firms in China are
receiving intensified State support to technological innovation
efforts, an official of the Ministry of Technology said.
</P>
<P>
The special fund set up by the Torch Center of the Ministry of
Technology last year, which is devoted to financing technological
innovations in medium-size and small high-tech firms in China, has
aided 759 such projects since last year with a total of 550
million yuan, said Li Linxi, chief engineer of the Torch Center.
</P>
<P>
Another 300 projects received low-interest loans totaling 260
million yuan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the above projects, mainly in areas such as
electronics, new materials, bio-medicine, and new energy, will
help generate 33 billion yuan in industrial added-value and 1.23
billion US dollars in export turnover, Li said.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,300 projects are still on the waiting list for aid
from the special fund for technological innovations in small and

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Steps up Pollution Reduction in Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The heavy pollution in the
Songhua and Liaohe rivers in northeast China is expected to be
greatly eased in the next five years as more than a half of the
cities in the Songhua-Liaohe river valley build their own sewage
treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
City sewage is a major polluting source for the two river
systems, and the accelerated urbanization in the area makes it an
even more urgent problem.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shenyang, capital of Liaoning, has built such a plant
in its northern area, which handles 400,000 tons of sewage daily.
Changchun, capital of Jilin, is also building a sewage treatment
plant with a daily handling capacity of 390,000 tons. Quite a
number of cities in the Songhua-Liaohe river valley have included
sewage treatment plants into their urban planning.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, more than 80 percent of the medium-size and
big cities in the Liaohe river valley will build sewage treatment
plants, while more than 50 percent of the medium-size and big
cities in the Songhua river valley will have their own sewage
treatment plants, according to Liu Shuying, an official in charge
of pollution control in the Songhua and Liaohe river systems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 277 projects for pollution control in the
two river systems have been launched involving 201 industrial
enterprises, aimed at reducing the discharge of industrial
pollutants in the rivers.

<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
discussed the latest developments on the Palestinian track of the
Mideast peace process early Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reviewed the latest Middle East trip by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and issues surrounding the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, which are expected to restart next
Tuesday in the U.S., the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Albright visited Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas last
Monday and Tuesday in a fresh move to push the Mideast peace
process forward.
</P>
<P>
Palestine and Israel have been working to reach a framework
agreement for a final peace treaty by September on the thorniest
issues of Jerusalem, borders, settlements, refugees and water.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Barak also expressed
condolences on the passing of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad,
adding that Israel is keen to realize a "comprehensive and just"
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Assad died of heart attack Saturday, Israel said
in a statement that it understood the grief of the Syrian people
and will continue to work for a peace agreement with Syria's
succeeding leadership.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two foes were halted last January after
Israel refused to promise in advance a full return of the Golan
Heights it captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.

<HEADLINE> More Developed Countries Open Consulates in Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- As more and more multinational
corporations extend their business to western China, an increasing
number of developed countries have been setting up consular
establishments in the region.
</P>
<P>
To date, Japan, Canada, Britain, the United States and several
Southeast Asian countries have already opened consulates or
consulates-general in the municipality of Chongqing, Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan Province, and Kunming, capital of Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Germany and Australia have recently sent study teams here to
make preparations for setting up their consular establishments.
</P>
<P>
Most of these countries, including Japan, Canada and Britain,
have chosen to set up their consular establishments in Chongqing,
the largest industrial and commercial city in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiao, director of the Chongqing Municipal Foreign Affairs
Office, said that Chongqing is expected to become a consular
center in western China because it is located between the
developed east and the resourceful west and this will be favorable
for foreign consulates to provide services to their multinationals
seeking to invest in the western region.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Chongqing has set aside an area of 80 hectares
for foreign consular establishments, while maintaining the largest
foreign affairs department in the western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
China made Chongqing its fourth municipality in 1997, aiming at
turning it into an economic hub in the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, China's longest, and the southwestern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The city used to attract many foreign consulates before the
People's Republic was founded in 1949. It has now established
economic and trade ties with more than 140 countries regions.
</P>
<P>
The municipality opened an air route to Germany's Munich in
April, the first direct air route between western China and Europe.

592 Upjohn tablets, more than 1,000 Ecstasy and Ice tablets from a
room in a second-storey apartment in a raid named Operation Rumble,
on Friday which netted 16 suspected drug offenders, all
Singaporean men.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sunday Times reported that the CNB has raided
more than 30 nightspots and entertainment outlets in the past two
months to flush out drug offenders and rounded up 97 lounge
hostesses for offenses ranging from possession and consumption of
drugs to trafficking.
</P>
<P>
It has noted that a worrying trend -- syndicates are using KTV
lounge hostesses to push drugs, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Shock As Tories Close Poll Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) - A new opinion poll published Sunday
puts the Tories just three points behind Labor. The astonishing
figure is the closest the Tories have been to Labor for nearly
eight years.
</P>
<P>
It shows Labor on 41 points with the Tories on 38. The Labor
government's ratings have fallen by five points in just three
weeks and a staggering 21 since their peak in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Just over a year ago, 53 percent saw Tony Blair as the most
capable Prime Minister, now that figure is 37. Meanwhile,
Opposition leader Hague's score has doubled from just nine percent
to 18.
</P>
<P>
The MORI poll was carried out in the two days after the Prime
Minister was heckled by the Women's Institute - Tony Blair's worst
day since he came to power.
</P>
<P>
Bob Worcester, head of MORI, said: "The crack in the facade
exposed by the Women's Institute at Wembley has resonated with the
public."
</P>
<P>
He said he expected Labor's lead to bounce back to seven to 10
percent when the "WI effect" wore off and he still expected Labor
to win the next election.
</P>
<P>
However, the MORI survey contained a serious warning for the
Labor Government. Worcester said, voters see Labor as a government
of spin rather than a government of delivery.
</P>
<P>
"If the Opposition was stronger, Blair would be in dead trouble,
" he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Starts Trip to Central Asia to Assert Influence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
is to make a diplomatic offensive in Central Asia, in an effort to
check Russian influence and assert Turkey's "pivotal" role in the
region.
</P>
<P>
His tour of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan will begin on Sunday,
according to local media.
</P>
<P>
This move came amid mounting criticism in Turkey of his foreign
policy, which is seen as too leaning toward Europe while ignoring
what Turkey called "Turkic-speaking states" in Central Asia and
Caucasia.
</P>
<P>
Five countries in the region gained independence after the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Turkey believes most of those
republics have traditional, geographical and cultural ties with it,
and has been trying to expand its influence in those countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey eyes Russia as a rival vying for control of the region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan last month to strengthen ties with the two former Soviet
republics.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Russia signed a deal to increase natural gas
purchase from Turkmenistan, which set alarm to Turkey, the U.S. and
Europe as to Moscow's attempt to reassert its presence in its
traditional sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan suspended gas supplies to Russia after a dispute
over debts, but resumed them this year for a total of 20 billion
cubic meters (700 billion cubic feet). 
</P>
<P>
The latest Russia-Turkmenistan agreement could pose threat to a
U.S.-backed plan to build a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to
Turkey via the Caspian Sea, as so much gas would be transferred to
Russia instead.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that during his visit, Cem will discuss with
leaders of the two countries bilateral and regional issues, energy
cooperation in particular.
</P>
<P>
In an extraordinary luncheon he hosted for the ambassadors of
Central Asian and Caucasian republics at his residence late last
month, Cem declared that Eurasia had "very, very important" place
in Turkey's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
To be a "pivotal player" in Eurasian politics, and to become a
full member of the European Union, are two topping priorities of
Turkey's foreign policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was granted candidacy for membership of the 15-member
European rich-nation club last December after years of strenuous
efforts. But Cem came under fire for his ministry's "too much"
preoccupation with its relations with Europe.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's borders with Lebanon and Syria are unlikely to turn
into battle grounds in the immediate aftermath of the death of
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, according to Middle East Affairs
expert Amatzia Baram.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said the possibility of turmoil could not be
ruled out in the event of a power struggle in Syria.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The peace process between Israel and Syria will be frozen now
for an indefinite period of time, no matter what the outcome of the
power struggle in Damascus is.
</P>
<P>
Whoever Assad's successor may be, he will have to focus efforts
at the start toward consolidating his rule, and ousting domestic
opponents; and, under the circumstances, it is doubtful that he
will take chances by pursuing a compromise agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Under present conditions, Israel must wait, and refrain from
intervening in events in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met late Saturday night
with ruling One Israel's cabinet ministers to discuss his next move
in the coalition crisis.
</P>
<P>
Barak spokesperson said that both the death of Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad and ongoing coalition contacts might delay Sunday's
cabinet vote formalizing the dismissal of six rebel ministers who
supported preliminary votes on early elections in the Knesset
(parliament) last week.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that Barak would still prefer the religious ultra-
Orthodox Shas Party, the third largest party with 17 seats in the
Knesset, to the anti-religious six-seat Shinui Party, which is a
hopeful candidate if Barak is to form a narrow coalition without
Shas.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli Histadrut labor federation has finished its
preparations for the expected strike of the country's public sector
and organized parts of the private sector, set to start Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Senior union officials said Saturday night that if the Finance
Ministry announces an unequivocal and unlimited postponement of the
implementation of the tax reforms, the Histadrut would consider
cancelling the strike or limiting it to a short period of time.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leaders Condole on Assad's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei and President Mohammad Khatami on Saturday night sent
messages to express their condolences over the death of late Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
In his message to Bashar, the favorite son of Assad, Khamenei
said the late Syrian president was one of the most prominent
figures in the Arab and Islamic world, and had rendered great
services during his life to the Syrian nation and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Assad died of a heart attack on Saturday at age 69.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt, President Assad was a pivot of resistance among
frontline states and an important factor in saving the line of
resistance against defeats vis-a-vis the Zionists (Israelis) and
their allies," Khamenei said, quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei praised Assad for his role in consolidating the Arab
and Muslim world and his efforts to expand relations with Iran.
Assad "had rightfully recognized that the establishment of an
Islamic government in Iran had tipped the balance of power in favor
of the revolutionary forces of the Muslim world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also assured that the Iranian government will continue to
stand by the side of the Syrian government and Syrian nation.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami also praised Assad as an outstanding leader in
the Islamic world who had played an important role in resistance
against Israeli expansionist policies and "developments in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Syria was among the few supporters of Iran in its 1980-88 bloody
war with Iraq, in which some 1 million people from both sides died.
</P>
<P>
The government in Tehran is against the peace process with the
Jewish state, which it doesn't recognize, and vows to support the
efforts to liberate all the territories occupied by Israel.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tourism, Both Boon and Bane to Nepal by Zhuang Meijie, Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- While a great influx of foreign
tourists brought to Nepal the much-coveted dollars, they have also
incurred unwanted changes to the otherwise pristine Himalayan
kingdom boasting of unique tradition, culture and ecology.
</P>
<P>
Contributing 24 percent to the country's foreign exchange
income, Nepal's tourism industry is recognized as an important
sector for the upliftment of the country's economy, one of the
least developed economies in the world.
</P>
<P>
With 500,000 tourists coming each year, tourism is providing
jobs to 200,000 Nepali people, accounting for one sixteenths of
the employed in the country.
</P>
<P>
Despite the economic benefits, the tourism has also brought
about some adverse effects, including socio-cultural degradation,
malpractice like drug abuse, child abuse, increasing crimes and
social turbulence, according to a survey conducted recently by
kathmandu University.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that about 40 percent of the respondents felt
that tourism is responsible for deterioration of social values and
changing culture, as unethical behaviors and ideas of some of the
tourists are indenting local traditions and cultures in a
imperceptible way.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the respondents said foreign tourists are
the main cause for the sharp increase of drug abuse among
youngsters, who are allured to imitate foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Criminal cases, such as pickpocketing, fighting, robbery and
even killing, are also on the rise in recent years, said the
survey.
</P>
<P>
"Though crimes in Nepal are much fewer comparing to
metropolitans like New York, they terrify people who are used to
peaceful life and make inroads on our social values," said Dhruba
Adhikary, professor with Nepal Press Institute.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the development of tourism has caused
environmental degradation and threatens the fragile ecology in the
mountainous country.
</P>
<P>
Being the juncture of eastern and western Himalayas, Nepal
possesses a wide range of floral and faunal diversity and boasts
of untouched forests and two natural conservation -- Chitwan and
Qomolangma (also called Everest or Sagarmatha) parks, listed by
UNESCO (U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) as
world heritage.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has also recorded about 75 vegetation types, over 6000
species of flowering plants and ferns, 181 species of fauna and
844 species of birds. But as a result of mountain tourism,
increased demand for fuelwood and timber, increased pollution and
generation of bio-non-degradable garbage as well as lodge
constructions and changes in land use are posing serious threat to
the mountain ecology, according to a recent research.
</P>
<P>
The research conducted by ICIMOD (International Center for
Integrated Mountain Development) showed that 9.2 metric tons of
fuelwood was consumed daily by the lodges in the Qomolangma region
alone. At this speed, forests in the region will be destroyed
within years.
</P>
<P>
"As of 1999, there were 20 settlements in the Qomolangma region
and 43 in the Annapurna region as a result of tourism," said Dr.
Pitamber Sharma with ICIMOD.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, large amount of solid waste left by trekkers and
generated in the lodges are posing alarming environmental problems
and turning scenic trekking areas into dustbins.
</P>
<P>
In view of all these problems, to keep balance between
promoting sustainable tourism and conserving the fragile ecology
is becoming a big challenge for the Nepali government and tourism
entrepreneurs, the research said in conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Waive Duty on Diesel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
considering waiving import duty on diesel for the next six
months, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has said.
</P>
<P>
Moi said Saturday in Nakuru city in central Kenya that the
intended waiver was expected to minimize the effect of the power
shortage, which threatens 300,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The step is to make the fuel affordable during the power
rationing period, the Sunday Standard newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is experiencing a long-spell severe drought nationwide,
which has lead to lowest water levels of major energy reservoirs
affecting the power generation, leaving an electricity shortfall
of between 154 and 360 kilowatts in the off-peak and peak hours
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Due to the introduction of a stricter power rationing by the
government from the beginning of June, diesel is in great demand
by various institutions which have their own power generators.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ruling Party Slams Fuel Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian ruling People's Democratic
Party Saturday criticized the government's decision to raise up
the petrol price, saying that the procedure, timing and margins
of the increase were wrong.
</P>
<P>
Short of blaming President Olusegun Obasanjo for unilaterally
effecting the price increase, the party, which spoke through its
National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Ibeshi in Abuja, deplored
that the increase was not based on consultation.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Sunday quoted him as saying that the new price
regime could not align with the masses's acceptability for such a
hike.
</P>
<P>
He called up the government to restore the price to old level
and make consultations in the future before making such decisions
with national implications.
</P>
<P>
The party also urges the labor to stop the strike and resume
work on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country's umbrella labor organization the National Labor
Congress (NLC) launched the ongoing strike shortly after the
Nigerian government increased the country's petrol price by 50
percent to 30 naira per liter (one U. S. dollar is equal to 100
naira) on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Several people have been reportedly killed, and more wounded in
violence relating to the strike in the last two days. Police have
reportedly arrested hundreds of rioters.
</P>
<P>
Governments at federal and state levels have remained closed
since the start of the strike.
</P>
<P>
The NLC refused to call off the strike, in spite of the fact
that the government last Thursday had announced
five-naira-per-liter reductions for petrol and diesel, and
10-naira-per-liter reduction for kerosine.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Iran's New Parliamentary Speaker Mehdi Karrubi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Mehdi Karrubi, a prominent radical-
turned reformist leader, was elected on Sunday speaker of Iran's
sixth Majlis (parliament) dominated by reformists allied with
President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for Karrubi, 63, to hold the post. He
had been elected as Majlis speaker in 1989. But three years later,
he not only lost the speakership, but also even a seat in the
legislature in the fourth parliamentary elections in 1992, due to
conservative pressures.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi was a member of the first, second and third Majlis. He
was elected vice speaker in the second Majlis, and then took the
post of speaker in 1989 after the then speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani
was elected president.
</P>
<P>
However, he came under fierce criticism from the rightist or
conservative camp and the centralist or moderate camp led by
Rafsanjani, and was ousted with his radical allies from the
parliament in the fourth parliamentary elections in 1992 after
Rafsanjani joined hands with the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi and his allies threw their support behind Mohammad
Khatami, a moderate in the radical Assembly of Combatant Clergy
(ACC) Central Council, in the 1997 presidential election. Khatami
defeated the powerful conservative candidate, former Majlis Speaker
Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri, by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi and his allies support the reformist programs of
President Khatami, but distanced themselves from the newly-grown
reformist camp led by the president's younger brother Mohammad Reza
Khatami and freedom-seeking students.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1979 Islamic revolution, Karrubi had been a radical
leader in the Islamic movement led by late spiritual leader
Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini. He was arrested several times by the
late shah's police and spent four years in prison and a while in
exile.
</P>
<P>
After Khomeini took power in the Islamic revolution, Karrubi
first headed the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee in Tehran, and then
the Martyrs Foundation from 1980-1993.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi obtained a B.A. in divinity and philosophy from Tehran
University and completed seminary studies with a religious title of
Hojatoleslam as confirmed by some religious jurisprudents.
</P>
<P>
Karrubi is a father of four. His wife, Fatemeh, was a member of
the conservative-dominated fifth Majlis.

the two countries have been working on it for some time, a senior
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Romesh Jayasinghe, director general of South Asia in Sri Lanka'
s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Xinhua that Singh's visit to
the island country Sunday afternoon is "a step in a process and
there was no urgency in his visit," dismissing some predictions
that Singh's visit is a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the situation has stabilized in the northern
Jaffna peninsula where government troops have been battling an
offensive by the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels since April.
</P>
<P>
Singh's visit is the first high level one by the Indian
government since April when the civil war in Sri Lanka flared up
between government troops and Tamil Tiger rebels who are fighting
a 17-year war to carve out a separate homeland for minority Tamils
in the island's north and east.
</P>
<P>
India, which has ruled out military involvement in the island
nation's civil war, has been in close contact with the Sri Lankan
government and promised humanitarian assistance if asked.
</P>
<P>
Singh is expected to have talks with his Sri Lankan counterpart
Lakshman Kadirgamar and President Chandrika Kumaratunga on the
current developments in the country's civil war and peace
prospects, before he leaves for New Delhi Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
His visit is also expected to calm apprehensions in Colombo
about the recent statements made by India's Tamil Nadu Chief
Minister Karunanidhi, referring to the division of Sri Lanka as a
solution to the 17-year long ethnic conflict.

CANBERRA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- the United States sealed the
winner of the inaugural Pacific Cup women's soccer tournament on
Sunday by beating Australia 1-0 in Newcastle, Australia.
</P>
<P>
Although tied with China and Canada on 12 points, a superior
goal difference gave the World Cup-champion Americans the triumph
in the six-nation international competition, accroding to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Australia finished in fourth place on nine points, followed by
Japan and winless New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The United States created the best chances, the first as early
as the fourth minute when 200-game veteran Kristine Lilly shot
wide.
</P>
<P>
Australian striker Sunni Hughes broke into the U.S. penalty
area in the 13th minute and went down under a heavy challenge but
the referee ignored a plea for a penalty.
</P>
<P>
Australian goalkeeper Tracey Wheeler had to be at her best,
producing a great double save to deny U.S. midfielder Tiffeny
Milbrett on 20 minutes and moments later Milbrett squandered a
chance, shooting wide when in scoring range.
</P>
<P>
Australia created a half chance in the 57th minute when Hughes
was released behind the U.S. defense, but goalkeeper Siry Mullinix
was quickly out of her area to clear.
</P>
<P>
The winner came after Australian defender Cheryl Salisbury
played at the ball with her arm under pressure from American
substitute striker Cindy Parlow. Shannon MacMillan took the
penalty and calmly sent Wheeler the wrong way.

we respond to each situation as it comes," Mayonda was quoted by
the newspaper as saying on Saturday.

And while the guns amnesty is being intensified to ensure as
many illegal firearms as possible are recovered, the police will
crack down heavily on all those who are found in possession of
such firearms.

<HEADLINE> Economists Predict Narrower East-West Economic Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences (CASS), a government think tank, predicted today that the
disparity in east and west China's economic development will be
substantially narrowed by the year 2030.
</P>
<P>
In a report released today by the Institute of Econometrics and
Techno-economics under the CASS, economists predict that the per
capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in China western areas would
reach 3,000 to 5,000 U.S. dollars between 2020 and 2030.
</P>
<P>
In the coming 30 years, the report said, dramatic changes will
sweep China's vast western areas: infrastructure for industry,
education and information transmission will be perfected; rational
urban planning will give rise to a network of closely and
conveniently linked cities; the current manufacturing industry
that is heavily dependent on natural resources will be transformed
into a technology-intensive one; and modern farming and forestry
will be take shape.
</P>
<P>
In the next ten years, the government will focus on creating
favorable environment for economic take-off in the vast western
region, which will help reverse the widening disparity between the
east and the west in economic development, the report said.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the government-initiated strategy of
prospering the west, poverty will be eliminated between 2006 and
2010 in China's west, which will also see restored ecological
environment, accelerated urbanization, and narrowing per capita
income gap between the east and the west, the report said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, per capita GDP in western China is expected
to reach 1,200 U.S. dollars to 1,500 U.S. dollars, laying a solid
foundation for accelerated growth in the next 30 years, the report
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Some coastal cities in east China's
Shandong Province are restricting water use as a result of serious
shortage in water supply, according to an official at the
provincial headquarters for drought relief and flood control.
</P>
<P>
This is one of Shandong's worst water crises, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In Weihai and Yantai, the hardest-hit areas, residents' water
use has been cut by half, and water use is restricted to
designated times each day. Residents who exceed the water quota
face high fines.
</P>
<P>
Water use is limited to several hours a day in hotels while tap
water use is banned at car washes and some construction sites.
</P>
<P>
Scant rainfall is mainly blamed for the water shortage, which
has resulted in the loss of more than one billion cubic meters of
surface water since last year.

WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Diana Ziliute of Lithuania
extended her race lead over Australia's Anna Wilson on Saturday
night by capturing the 46-kilometer Elkhorn Circuit Race in Idaho,
third stage of the Women's Challenge cycling event.
</P>
<P>
Ziliute, the reigning women's Tour de France champion, beat
defending champion Jeannie Longo of France by completing the 18-
lap course in one hour, 17 minutes and eight seconds.
</P>
<P>
Longo finished second with an identical time. American Karen
Kurren was third, five seconds behind the leading duo.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian, who assumed the overall lead after her second
consecutive second-place finish on Friday, gained a 10-second time
bonus for the stage win and other mid-race bonus time.
</P>
<P>
Because of various lapped riders and complicated bonus time
calculations, officials were unable to immediately produce
official overall standings.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Hits 25 in Police-Guerrillas Clash in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the police-
guerrillas clash that raged on till Saturday in Jajarkot district
of mid-western Nepal had reached 25, including 12 policemen, seven
civilians and six guerrillas, The Kathmandu Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Five children and one woman were among the killed in the fierce
fighting that broke out on Thursday when some 1,600 guerrillas
attacked a police post in a remote village in Jajarkot district,
the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas managed to capture the post after the policemen
ran out of munitions, said Bajgain.
</P>
<P>
Among the 51 policemen and two cooks stationed at the police
post, at least 36 were injured, some of them in critical condition,
according to police sources.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Barak Following Assad's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 10 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton held
phone discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on
Saturday after the death of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, White
house spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was in Minnesota for fundraising, talked with
Barak for about 10 minutes to discuss the peace process in the
Middle East, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"They primarily discussed issues on the Palestinian track but
touched on all areas (including Syria)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously at a very critical part of the process and
they've been talking on a regular basis," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton said he was saddened by the news of President
Assad's death. He said he always respected President Assad despite
their differences.
</P>
<P>
"While we had our disagreements, I always respected him because
I felt that he was open and straightforward with me and because he
meant it when he said he had made a strategic decision for peace,"
Clinton told reporters in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that peace was not achieved in Assad's lifetime. "
I hope that it can still be achieved in no small measure because
of the commitment he made," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton would not make any prediction for the impact that
Assad's death would have on the peace process on Syrian-Israeli
track.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's premature to say," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a period of mourning in Syria, there will be a
period of sorting out, and the Syrian people will make some
decisions, and then we'll see what happens," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton would not attend Assad's funeral on
Tuesday but was sending Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
represent the United States.
</P>
<P>
"The president believed Secretary Albright was the appropriate
person to go," he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Israeli-Palestinian negotiations would come up at
the top of the negotiating table because of the passing of Assad.
And Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will come to Washington
for a framework accord so that the two sides could reach the final
stage of peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to meet with Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat on Wednesday. The meeting is aimed at laying the groundwork
for an eventual three-way Israeli-Palestinian-U.S. peace summit.

<HEADLINE> China's Auto Market Remains in Low Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- In contrast to the craze about the
ongoing Auto China 2000 show, the nation's auto market remains
subdued, reported China Daily Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day auto show held in the China International
Exhibition Center in Beijing attracted more than 40,000 visitors
on its opening day. More than 100,000 admission tickets were sold.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,000 auto makers from 23 countries and regions are
displaying their products in the 70,000-square-meter showplace.
</P>
<P>
Despite domestic car price cuts this year, car sales in January-
April period amounted to only 168,630 units nationwide, a mere 2.3
percent increase from the same 1999 period, said sources with the
State Administration of Machine-Building Industry.
</P>
<P>
With expectations for a car price drop after the country's
accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), many consumers
are biding their time.
</P>
<P>
"I will postpone my car purchase until next year because I
believe prices will slide after China enters the WTO," said Li
Hanchen, a foreign company employee.
</P>
<P>
China will cut tariffs on auto imports from the current 80
percent to 100 percent to 25 percent by mid-2006, with the largest
cuts coming during the first two years after its WTO accession.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate all the luxury cars, but they are distant dream.
WE need more economical models priced at about 100,000 yuan (about
12,000 U.S. dollars)," said the young couple Xu Feng and Zhou
Wenchun, both government employees.
</P>
<P>
Chinese consumers now have few choices in picking an economical
car, but foreign auto markers have recognized the tremendous
potential of the economical car market in China.
</P>
<P>
Toyota, approved by the Chinese Government at the end of May to
set up a joint venture in North China's Tianjin will begin
producing Toyota-brand compact cars in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese auto maker is exhibiting its compact cars
including the Funcoupe, Funcargo and Funtime.
</P>
<P>
"An unfavorable car consumption environment has dampened
consumers' purchasing zeal," said Que Xiaogang, a manager at the
Beijing Asian Games Village Automobile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Central and local governments charge high taxes and assess
numerous arbitrary fees on car consumers.
</P>
<P>
Que's auto exchange sold about 1,400 cars last month, compared
with about 2,000 in April.
</P>
<P>
Six domestic auto-makers recently appealed to the government to
reduce auto consumption taxes and to cancel arbitrary fees.
</P>
<P>
There are indications that the government will heed their
appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance and the State Development Planning
Commission on June 2 announced that 238 administrative fees
imposed on auto consumers will be canceled beginning in July.
</P>
<P>
The move is expected to save consumers 14.5 billion yuan (about
1.75 billion U.S. dollars) per year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Auto Industry Squares up to Foreign Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Reorganization and co-operation
with foreign competitors are the best way out for China's auto
industry which will soon be facing mounting competition from
overseas with the country's impending entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), China Daily Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Only through restructuring can we gain enough strength to deal
with the challenges," said Miao Wei, general manager of the
Dongfeng Motor Corp in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
A majority of domestic auto makers cannot rival foreign
companies in many aspects at present, he said.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 120 auto makers, and only three of them
each have an annual production capacity of 200,000 units. Last
year, domestic auto output amounted to 1.83 million units, half of
a medium-sized global auto maker's output.
</P>
<P>
"Accelerating re-organization and establishing competitive
enterprise groups is a must for China's auto industry to survive
global competition after the nation's WTO entry," Miao said.
</P>
<P>
WTO entry, expected to occur this year, will grant foreign auto
makers free market access to the Chinese auto market.
</P>
<P>
According to a Sino-U.S. WTO access deal signed last November,
China will cut its tariffs on auto imports to 25 percent by mid-
2006 from the original 80 to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The WTO deal between China and European Union (EU) last month
will enable foreign auto makers to freely make marketing decisions
on a purely commercial basis; all restrictions concerning the
categories, types and models of vehicles produced in China will be
lifted within two years.
</P>
<P>
Miao urged the Chinese government to reorganize more than 10
leading auto makers into some giants within the "buffer" period
after the WTO entry.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has decided to support three to five key
auto makers in line with its strategy for the auto industry, a new
growth engine for the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Reorganization has already become a global trend since the
world auto industry suffers a production overcapacity of
approximately 18 million units annually.
</P>
<P>
"WTO entry will speed up reorganization of China's auto
industry and will lead to further cooperation with global auto
makers," said Zhang Suixin, vice president of Volkswagen (China)
Co Ltd.
</P>
<P>
It is also a pressing task for domestic auto makers to
strengthen cooperation with foreign companies and sharpen
competitive edges, said Lin Ganwei, vice president of the First
Automotive Works (FAW) in northeast China's Jilin Province, known
as the cradle of the country's auto industry.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with foreign auto makers should involve investment,
production platforms, technologies and product development, and
sales networks, Lin said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Top General Vows to Prevent Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Army's chief of staff,
General Nebojsa Pavkovic, on Saturday condemned NATO's aggression
against his country last year and warned that his troops will "
prevent civil war at any cost."
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony in Aleksinac, a small city in eastern Yugoslavia,
to mark the first anniversary of the ending of NATO aggression,
Pavkovic said the Yugoslav army is "the army of the people" and
will prevent civil war at any cost and resolutely defend the
homeland and the people.
</P>
<P>
Pavkovic said the U.S.-led NATO continued to sabotage
Yugoslavia after it ended its bombing a year ago.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been trying to overthrow the Yugoslav government by
instigating sabotage by antagonized forces in the country and by
fomenting discord between the two republics, Serbia and Montenegro,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The army ... is united, firm and combat-ready to prevent any
secessionist scenarios."
</P>
<P>
NATO, in disregard of Resolution 1244 of the U.N. Security
Council, connived at the ethnic cleansing by Kosovo Albanian
extremists, said the general.
</P>
<P>
He praised the army for its outstanding performance in
safeguarding the country's sovereignty, independence and
constitutional order in last year's fight against NATO aggression.
The army will continue to honor its constitutional commitments in
case of need, he said.
</P>
<P>
During NATO's 78-day air strikes ended on June 10, 1999,
Aleksinac was hit on seven occasions, including an attack on an
apartment complex that killed 17 civilians.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Starting July 1, northeast China'
s Liaoning Province will ban plastic tableware to cut back on the
pollution produced by such non-degradable products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, bio-degradable materials such as paper, plant fiber,
and starch are officially recommended to replace plastics for
making tableware and degradable plastic bags.
</P>
<P>
About one billion sets of plastic tableware and more than 100,
000 tons of plastic bags are sold in Liaoning annually, accounting
for one tenth of the nation's total. These plastic items seriously
threaten the local environment, since it will take about 200 years
for them to degrade.
</P>
<P>
Environmental problems created by randomly-discarded plastic
products are blamed for China's "white pollution" woes. About a
dozen Chinese municipalities, provinces and autonomous regions are
introducing similar bans on non-degradable products.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 enterprises in Liaoning have passed a review and
been authorized to produce bio-degradable tableware and plastic
bags. Products from enterprises outside Liaoning are banned from
sale in the province without official authorization.

<TEXT>
<P>
Guests living in the compound find the Mosuo lifestyle
fascinating. At night, tourists gather around a fire in the center
of the courtyard to watch Mosuo youth perform ethnic songs and
dances.
</P>
<P>
Tourism has become so profitable that many Mosuo families in
the area who have opened their homes have become wealthy.
Caoshidamu's family has a color TV, stereo, washing machine, and
lots of other modern household conveniences.
</P>
<P>
But they have no plans to relinquish their ties to the ancient
matriarchal system, which is rare in the world.
</P>
<P>
In Mosuo tradition, only daughters can be heirs in a family.
Caoshidamu pays close attention to the healthy growth of the
younger generation in the family, particularly the daughters. Now
all three of her daughters are in school.
</P>
<P>
And Mosuos also have preserved the unusual system of live-apart
marriages. In the Mosuo world, wives and husbands live separately,
in their mothers' homes, during the day, and are permitted to meet
only at night.
</P>
<P>
Curious tourists like to ask about this unique arrangement, and
Mosuos don't shy away from answering intimate details about their
marriages.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen-year-old Arzhou says happily, "My mother has agreed
to let me have such a man to meet beginning from next year."
</P>
<P>
Arzhuo, who lives in a Mosuo courtyard only ten meters from the
lake, rows tourist-filled canoes on the serene water every day.
</P>
<P>
Shi Run, a postgraduate student at Yunnan University who is
conducting research on the Mosuo people, said that Mosuo families
in the villages of Lugu Lake area represent one of the world's
best-preserved matriarchal societies.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A matriarchal community in
southwest China has held fast to its traditions despite being
buffeted by the tides of economic development and modern
civilization.
</P>
<P>
The 30,000 people of the Mosuo minority continue to live in
their generations-old wood-frame houses which ring the 60-sq-km
Lugu lake separating southwest China's Sichuan and Yunnan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Caoshidamu, 38, who is second-in-command of one of the Mosuo
families, has opened an inn for tourists in the residential
compound where she lives, just ten meters away from Lugu Lake.
</P>
<P>
Inside the compound are scripture halls, a central gathering
room, and women's bedrooms. The rest of the family -- the men --
occupy other rooms in the quadrangle, and extra rooms are used for
the steady stream of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Caoshidamu's 71-year-old mother is the highest-ranking
authority of their 11-member family, but Caoshidamu actually runs
day-to-day operations, assigning her brothers and sisters chores
such as catching fish and shrimp from the lake to use for
preparing traditional Mosuo meals for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Since the area opened to the outside in 1988, Lugu Lake has
turned into a destination for international visitors lured by its
crystal clear water high in a spectacular mountain environment.
</P>
<P>
Living at an elevation of 3,000 meters, the Mosuo people have
historically existed on fishing, farming and herding. But the
influx of tourists has given the Mosuos the chance to see what's
what with the outside world, and has created a new and welcome
source of income.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Of China's 60 million disabled
people, 75 percent have obtained jobs, and the Chinese government
pledges to raise their employment rate to 85 percent in five years,
sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities has formulated a number of laws and
regulations to protect the rights of the disabled. Some 5,000
employment centers have been set up across the country to improve
their living standards, said Wang Chenjing, an official with the
China Association for the Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
As the nation's unemployment rate has continued to grow in
recent years, disabled people have faced their own challenges. To
encourage them to start their own businesses, the Chinese
government has offered tax holidays.
</P>
<P>
Tan Ping, a disabled woman in Dingxi County in northwest China'
s Gansu Province, started her own fruit-selling business, which
has become so profitable she can now live comfortably on her
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show there are 1.2 million self-employed disabled
people in the country, 12 times the number a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Li Baohu in Zhengning County is another example. The local
government gave the disabled youth 1,000 yuan to open a private
clinic when he graduated from a medical school. His business has
been successful, and now he lives an independent life.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many organizations have been set up to offer
employment information, vocational training and insurance services
for disabled people.

Pollution has been controlled in the water system of the Liaohe
River in northeast China's Liaoning Province, with 70 percent of
the polluting enterprises in the area meeting pollution control
standards and 11 water treatment plants either completed or under
construction.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Group's Withdrawal From Zimbabwe not to Affect Commonwealth Group: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 10 (Xinhua) -- The withdrawal of the United
Nations group from Zimbabwe will not have any effect on the
Commonwealth Observer Group to monitor Zimbabwe's parliamentary
elections on June 24-25, Commonwealth group chairman Abdusalami
Abubakar said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, former head of Nigeria, said he did not know anything
about the U.N. group's operations and its withdrawal would not
affect his group's operations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. group announced its pulling out of the election
process in Zimbabwe to international press on Friday, saying the
Zimbabwean government had rejected its offer to coordinate
international observers, and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
had demoted the group to participate just as an observer group
monitoring the election.
</P>
<P>
"If we are not coordinating there is no reason for us to stay
there (Zimbabwe)," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told an
international news agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after arriving in the country with his
team of 44 observers on Friday, Abubakar said his group was
constituted by, and would report to Commonwealth
Secretary-general Don Mckinon.

<P>
"Our mandate is to consider the various factors impinging on
the credibility of the electoral process as a whole and to
determine in our own judgement whether the condition exists for a
free expression of will by the electors and the results reflect
their wishes," he said.

Belgian counterparts, he added.

an unprecedented step to ban 36 English fans with convictions for
violence from travelling to the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Maintain Distinguished Ties With Syria: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 10 (Xinhua)-- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh said Saturday that his country was keen to maintain what
he called distinguished ties with Syria after the passing away of
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after an urgent cabinet session on the death of
Assad, Rawabdeh voiced confidence that the Syrian people will
overcome difficulties after the loss of Assad and to achieve his
unfulfilled goals.
</P>
<P>
Assad, 69, died of a heart attack earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh affirmed that Jordan will stand with Syria and keep the
distinguished ties with Syria after a new president comes to power
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein made a
phone call to Bashar al-Assad, the second and favorite son of
Assad, to express his condolences.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian parliament amended the constitution after Assad died
to lower the age threshold for a president from 40 to 34 to pave
the way for Bashar, 35, to become the new president.
</P>
<P>
Assad died at a time when Jordan and Syria are improving ties
after years of tensions over Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with
Israel. Assad had stood against any unilateral Arab peace deal with
Israel and had been at odds with late Jordanian King Hussein Ibn
Talal, King Abdullah's father, over the treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Assad paid a surprising and fence-mending visit to
Amman, his first in years, in Febuary 1999 to attend the funeral of
Hussein who died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
The ties between the two countries thawed after the visit by
Assad.

<HEADLINE> Arafat's Advisor Refutes Barak's Words on Final Peace Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 10 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian official on Saturday
lashed out at a statement made by the Israeli prime minister that a
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians could be
unlikely by September 13.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing Prime Minister Ehud Barak's remarks as "an attempt to
waste time," Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu-
Rudeina said they also sent a "non-positive indication" before the
two sides resume the final-status talks in Washington early next
week.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are opposed to putting off the final-status
talks, especially on the fate of Jerusalem, Abu-Rudeina told
reporters, pointing out that the signed accords between the two
sides involved a final peace agreement by September 13.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the U.S. administration to effectively step in to
stop further infringements by Israel, stressing that a just and
comprehensive peace needed an Israeli compliance with the
international resolutions and withdrawal of Israeli troops from all
territories it occupied in the l967 Middle East war, including
Jerusalem.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Mkapa Chosen to Run for Second Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Dacheng
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian ruling Chama Cha
Mapinduzi (CCM) party chose on Saturday its chairman and Tanzanian
President Benjamin William Mkapa the sole presidential candidate
to run for his second five- year term in the October general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, aged 62, picked again Vice President Dr. Omar Ali Juma,
59, as his running mate, sources from the central town of Dodoma
said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, whose nomination was endorsed on Friday by the CCM
National Executive Committee (NEC), scooped 99.1 percent of votes
cast by some 1,200 delegates at an extraordinary congress of the
CCM in Dodoma.
</P>
<P>
"I am overwhelmed by the great love and confidence you have
bestowed on me," said the visibly moved president in the Chimwaga
hall, some six kilometers from Dodoma town. "I am at loss to know
how to repay you," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday the NEC also named Zanzibar Minister for
Communication and Transport Amani Abeid Karume as the CCM only
candidate for the Zanzibar presidency.
</P>
<P>
Karume, 52, is the eldest son of the late founding president of
Zanzibar following the 1964 revolution Abeid Amani Karume who led
Zanzibar until April 7, 1972 when he was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Karume vowed following the voting that he would defend the
union between Zanzibar and the mainland at any cost and boost the
isles economic development if elected Zanzibar President.
</P>
<P>
The NEC further appointed Ambassador Seif Idd the CCM Deputy
Secretary General for Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the CCM congress also awarded the late founding
President of Tanzania Julius Kambarage Nyerere a medal called the
Great Leader of the 20th Century. Nyerere died of leukaemia in
London last October at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa presented a glittering gold medal to Nyerere's widow
Maria Nyerere, commending Nyerere's leadership qualities and his
contribution to Tanzania' s prosperity.
</P>
<P>
During the congress, the main streets of the Dodoma
Municipality was decorated with CCM flags and banners, which
permeated with a solemn atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by Tanzania's National Electoral
Commission (NEC) on Thursday, a total of 12.5 million of the 30
million population are expected to vote in 232 constituencies
throughout the country in this year' s general elections.
</P>
<P>
The NEC on Tuesday issued a draft code of conduct for the
upcoming general elections, banning government and ruling party
leaders from using their power for political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
According to a timetable issued by the NEC early this year, the
 registration of voters will be conducted between August 1 and 21
while nomination of contestants will be made on August 13, and
election campaigns between August 14 and October 28.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania had been under a single political party (CCM) system
from 1965 until 1992 when the multiparty system was introduced.
</P>
<P>
The October elections will be the second time since 1995, but
the first time in the country's post-independence history for
presidential, parliamentary and civic elections to be held
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
All the 13 fully registered political parties run for the
elections which are likely to be dominated by the ruling CCM, at
least on the mainland as President Mkapa, who won the 1995
elections, is expected to win him the second five-year term.

luckless Hedman.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very difficult game and we worked very hard." Goor
said after the thrilling win.
</P>
<P>
"We did not start too well and we were a little bit nervous. We
had a lot of problems with Sweden's long ball game." Goor added.
</P>
<P>
Sweden looked down and out, but Belgian veteran goalie Filip De
Wilde made a capital blunder in the 54rd minute, failing to
control the simplest of back passes and allowing Johan Mjallby to
steal the ball and tap it into the net.
</P>
<P>
"It was a back pass from Philippe Leonard but the ball bobbled
at it so I tried to control it.
</P>

It was like the whole world collapsed." Widle said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Authority Closes Crossing-Point to Revenge Israeli Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority closed on
Sunday afternoon Karni crossing point, located in eastern Gaza, to
prevent the Israeli goods from entering Palestine self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
This move is to revenge the strike staged by the Israeli
employees working at Erez Crossing point in northern Gaza, which
prohibited Palestinian workers from getting access to the Israeli
ports to get out their imported goods.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said they plan to escalate their measures by
closing Erez, Sufa and Rafah crossings and the security crossing
connecting Gaza Strip with the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian source said the value of the Palestinian goods,
which are now in the Israeli ports and cannot be moved to the
Palestinian self-rule areas because of the strike, are estimated at
70 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Karni crossing point is an exit for the Palestinian goods which
are transported between Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

RIYADH, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz met on Sunday with visiting
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also reviewed the Middle East peace process, Arab
and international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
But diplomatic sources said here earlier that
the Saudi-Yemeni talks will cover the remaining issues of their
borders demarcation.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen need to re-demarcate their land borders
where 300 border signs have disappeared due to denudation and aging
factors.
</P>
<P>
They also have to negotiate a settlement to the demarcation of
their maritime borders in the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Senior Saudi officials said earlier this year that following
several years of work of their joint committees in charge of
specifying the borders signs, the two states have succeeded in
relocating most of the land border posts.
</P>
<P>
Saleh arrived in the western Saudi city of Jeddah earlier in
the day on an official visit, which political observers said took
place amidst the positive atmosphere witnessed in the relations
between the two Arab neighbors resulting from a recent visit to
Yemen by Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah went to Sana'a on May 21 to take part in the 10th
anniversary of Yemen's unity.

<HEADLINE> Mafia's Drug War in Italy Leaves Two Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A violent ambush in Italy's southern
city of Naples Saturday evening which left two local mafiosi dead
and two others injured, including a 12-year-old child, was
probably part of a drug trafficking war between rival Camorra
clans, the local crime organizations, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place in the heart of the Naples, in the so-
called Spanish Quarter, when four or five men burst into a
basement where a party was taking place and opened fire, killing
Giuseppe Di Tommaso, 42, and critically injuring Luigi De Falco,
34, who died Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Another local criminal, Ciro Linardi, was hit in the leg, while
his 12-year-old niece was hit in the foot.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they were increasingly convinced that the
attack was to do with an on-going war between rival clans in the
Camorra, the Naples version of the Mafia, to gain control of the
local drug market.
</P>
<P>
A priest from the neighborhood told the Italian news agency
Ansa that they were all under shock. The shoot-out took place just
as mass was ending. A minute later they would have been firing
among the people as they were coming out of church.
</P>
<P>
There have been 49 Camorra-linked murders in and around Naples
since the beginning of the year.

<P>
Just last week, four suspected Camorra members were shot dead
in four separate incidents.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Claims: Ethiopia's Offensive Foiled on Assab Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's large-scale offensive
on the Assab front in east Eritrea involving three divisions has
been totally foiled after more than 48 hours fighting, the
Eritrean Foreign Ministry said Sunday in a statement available
here.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopian forces have been forced to retreat, with staggering
losses, to their original positions," the statement said, adding
that "fighting has subsided this morning apart from the odd
shelling."
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not give full details of Ethiopian loss on the
Assab front which "were not available."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the fighting in the western part of the
country continued all the day (Saturday) without any change in
the relative positions of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Eritrean forces recaptured the towns of
Tesseney, barentu, Haicota, Tekhombia, Awagaro and Guluj, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said "Ethiopia has missed the OAU (the
 Organization of African Unity) deadline to pronounce
unequivocally its acceptance or rejection of the OAU proposal on
the cessation of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea said on Saturday that it had accepted the OAU proposal
for immediate cease-fire with its Horn of Africa neighbor
Ethiopia. The proposal was presented to the two countries during
their proximity talks in Algiers, Algeria, on Friday.

on the Assab front in east Eritrea involving three divisions has
been totally foiled after more than 48 hours fighting, the
Eritrean Foreign Ministry said Sunday in a statement available

"Ethiopian forces have been forced to retreat, with staggering
losses, to their original positions," the statement said, adding
that "fighting has subsided this morning apart from the odd
shelling."
</P>
<P>
The ministry did not give full details of Ethiopian loss on the
Assab front which "were not available."

The statement said the fighting in the western part of the
country continued all the day (Saturday) without any change in
the relative positions of both sides.

Earlier this week, the Eritrean forces recaptured the towns of
Tesseney, barentu, Haicota, Tekhombia, Awagaro and Guluj, the
ministry said.

 Organization of African Unity) deadline to pronounce
unequivocally its acceptance or rejection of the OAU proposal on
the cessation of hostilities.

Eritrea said on Saturday that it had accepted the OAU proposal
for immediate cease-fire with its Horn of Africa neighbor
Ethiopia. The proposal was presented to the two countries during
their proximity talks in Algiers, Algeria, on Friday.
