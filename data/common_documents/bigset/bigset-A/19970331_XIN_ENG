<HEADLINE> India's UF Government Refuses to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- India's ruling United Front
(UF) government said tonight it will not resign in the wake of
Congress party's withdrawal of support for it, asserting that all
the constituents of the 14-party alliance were "solidly united as
rock."
</P>
<P>
Top UF leaders, who gathered at Prime Minister Deve Gowda's
residence after Congress withdrew its support for it, described
the Congress party's move as "unfortunate," the Press Trust of
India said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders said they were confident of proving their majority
in parliament, and dismissed any possibility of the partnerships
breaking up.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from an emergency meeting chaired by Prime Minister
Deve Gowda, UF leaders told reporters that they would expect
President Shanker Dayal Sharma to allow the government to prove
its majority in the lower house of parliament at the earliest
opportunity on April 21 when parliament reassembles after a
four-week recess.
</P>
<P>
Those UF Leaders who were away from New Delhi were keeping in
constant touch with the prime minister. They expressed their
solidarity with him and pledged to unitedly foil the Congress
party's bid to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
UF sources said those leaders were now rushing to the capital
for a crucial meeting of the Front's steering committee tomorrow
to chalk out their strategy to deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Congress party spokesman V.N. Gadgil said there was
no possibility of a split in the party over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Gadgil said mid-term polls were a possibility in the prevailing
situation as no party was in a position to form the government at
the center.
</P>
<P>
The remarks contradicted Congress party President Sitaram
Kesri's announcement that the party will stake a claim to form a
new government.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the UF had failed to contain the communal
forces and therefore did not deserve the Congress party's support.

<HEADLINE> Arab Ministers: Time to Freeze Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab ministers meeting here today
at the Arab League sent a clear signal that they are ready to
freeze ties with Israel unless it gives up its settlement
activities in Jerusalem and complies with all peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Council meeting opened this afternoon after
League chief Esmat Abdel-Meguid held a closed-door meeting with
12 Arab foreign ministers and permanent representatives of 10
other Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Before the ministerial meeting, Algerian Foreign Minister
Ahmed Attaf told reporters that Arabs should reconsider their
ties with Israel which is responsible for the deadlock in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Suspending moves toward normalizing relations with Israel
would serve as a pressure on it," said Attaf, who is also the
outgoing AL Council chairman.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the resolutions adopted during the recent
Islamabad Islamic summit, Jerusalem Committee and the Gulf
Cooperation Council meetings, he called upon the Arab league to
follow suit and adopt a "firm and clear-cut stance in the face of
Israeli provocation."
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Information Minister Bassem al-Sabaa called on Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to abandon the hard-line policy
to secure the return of the Mideast peace process on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
He said that any AL Council resolution should stress the
importance of unifying Arab stances to face the current sensitive
situation.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab solidarity and the Islamic summit resolutions
on boycotting Israel are the proper basis for dealing with the
Israeli intransigence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem Bin Jaber Al
Thani said that he believes that all the Arabs agree on the
necessity of adopting a unified Arab stance.
</P>
<P>
"In the event of reaching such an agreement, Qatar together
with other Arab countries, will abide by it," he said, adding
that he hopes that an Arab summit will be held.
</P>
<P>
Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Mubarak
al-Khalifa also voiced the necessity to adopt a clear-cut Arab
stance on suspending moves toward normalizing relations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Egypt's views are
identical with other Arab countries, especially as far as
Jerusalem is concerned.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt has no reservations against or proposal to add to the
draft resolutions prepared by the Arab League Secretariat to be
issued at the close of the ministerial meeting," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara told reporters after
the ministerial meeting that Syria will propose to Arab countries
a "clearly-worded" statement that calls for cutting off relations
with Israel. And it has received "clear signals" from other Arab
countries that they are ready to approve it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua learned from sources close to the ongoing Arab meeting
that a resolution on a unified Arab stance in regard to Israel's
settlement construction in East Jerusalem will be issued at the
end of the two-day meetings, together with other seven
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Some of the ministers also mentioned the possibility of
holding an Arab summit to put a seal on the issue but they said
the date and other details are still yet to come out of the
two-day discussions.
</P>
<P>
Among other leading topics on the session's agenda are the
Arab-Israeli conflict and the implications of Israeli violations
of international law and agreements.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Council meeting, though a routine gathering,
is aimed at formulating a common Arab response to Israel's
settlement construction in East Jerusalem, which the Arabs said
has severely challenged the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks have broken down as Israel last
week sent bulldozers to Har Homa, the site of a planned
6,500-unit Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem, where
Palestinians hope to establish their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and wants the
entire city to remain undivided under Israeli
sovereignty. Clashes between Palestinian stone-throwers and
Israeli soldiers plagued the West Bank and Gaza ever since,
including a suicide bombing attack that killed four people in a
Tel Aviv cafe last week.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indo-Pakistan foreign
secretary-level talks continued uninterrupted on the third day
here today.
</P>
<P>
The day-long extensive talks held at an undisclosed venue were
reported to have concentrated on substantive issues of mutual
concern including the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan side was reportedly keen to achieve some progress
on the "core issue" of Kashmir while the Indian delegation has
been trying to make the dialogue broad-based involving trade and
people-to-people contact with a view to reducing the tension
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been reiterating their respective positions on
Kashmir. Pakistan insists that Kashmir is a disputed territory and
calls for a referendum to resolve the issue, while India has ruled
out any compromise, citing the reason of secular unity and
territorial integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have said that the talks were being held in a
cordial atmosphere and at an expected pace -- neither too slow nor
too fast.
</P>
<P>
The four-day comprehensive dialogue on all outstanding issues
between the two countries is scheduled to conclude tomorrow.

<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao Shi said that from an overall point of view, the
construction of China's modernization and its building-up of
democratic politics conform to each other.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware that it is an arduous task to develop
democracy in China, as our country has a vast area and a huge
population, and its level of economic and cultural development is
not high yet. Moreover, it had a feudalistic history of thousands
of years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China, while developing its economy, will
unswervingly push forward the building-up of democracy and a legal
system steadily and from the country's actual conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Through our efforts, a socialist, democratic political system
with Chinese characteristics will definitely be established in
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the 8th NPC will waste no time in the remaining
part of 1997 to shape the framework of a set of laws for
protecting and serving the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the NPC will continue to work on the laws
aimed at pushing forward the building-up of socialist and
democratic political system, including the drafting of a
surveillance code to institutionalize and make into law the
supervision by the legislative bodies at all levels over the
country's administrations, courts, public prosecution bodies and
other state organs.
</P>
<P>
He said that those measures will have an important influence on
the building-up of a democratic political system in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia welcomes Singapore
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's statement seeking to restore and
improve cooperation between the two countries, Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today.
</P>
<P>
Badawi described Goh's statement as positive and said Malaysia
looked forward to such a development.
</P>
<P>
He said diplomatic ties between the two countries had never
ceased, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral ties would return to normal over time once
Malaysians got the better of their feelings over Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew's disparaging remarks on Johor, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would be meeting Singapore leaders on the
matter, the minister said he had no specific plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
But he said he was willing to meet his Singapore counterpart in
New Delhi while attending the forthcoming Non-Aligned Movement
conference there if there was a need for it.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in a statement
yesterday he was saddened that "our bilateral relations have been
upset by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's remarks on Johor".
</P>
<P>
He said Lee had said that it was never his intention to cause
offense and had "immediately apologized to me when the remarks
became public".
</P>
<P>
"He has also apologized to Malaysia. The Malaysian Cabinet has
accepted his apology," said Goh.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that closer cooperation between Malaysia and
Singapore will benefit both countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Goh said Singapore would do its part to restore and improve
cooperation at a pace Malaysia was comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
"We want good relations with Malaysia and my remarks on March
25 were intended to be helpful and to improve relations," he said.

<HEADLINE> Le Pen Re-elected President of French Extreme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie Le Pen was re-elected
today the president of the French extreme-right National Front
(FN) party after presenting himself as the single candidate for
the post at the 10th national congress of FN in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old FN president has been serving as the party's
chief since he founded it in 1972.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that Le Pen was re-elected
at a time when he has never drawn so much loathing and disgust
from the French people because of his racist ideas and demagogy.
</P>
<P>
But the latest victory of FN in the municipal election of the
southern city of Vitrolles has cast a big shadow over the
political life of France.
</P>
<P>
After being elected, Le Pen made a violent and malicious attack
against all those who oppose him, including a bitter personal
attack against the socialist mayor of Strasbourg, Catherine
Trautmann.
</P>
<P>
A former Foreign Legionnaire soldier who fought in Indonesia
and Algeria in the 1950s, Le Pen won 14.38 percent of the votes in
the 1988 presidential election, and 15 percent in the 1995
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that he does not seem to be ready to retire from the
FN presidency before the 2002 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 people protested with what was described by AFP
as an "unprecedented mobilization" in Strasbourg on Saturday
against the holding of the FN congress.

development from throughout Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, jointly organized by the International Labor

to enable them to run enterprises on their own.
</P>
<P>
An ILO official told the workshop that the ILO is actively

<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao Shi said that the leading status and role of the Chinese
Communist Party were established in a long historical process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the leadership role of the party in China's state
affairs includes laying down political principles and orientation
of the country, major decision-making over important issues, and
recommending candidates for the seats of high level government
officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that all the major decisions and policies made by the
party have to go through the legislative process at the NPC or its
standing committee before becoming the state's will, if these
decisions fall within the field covered by the legislative power.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that ever since the founding of the People's Republic
of China, the People's Liberation Army of China has been serving
as the armed forces under the leadership of the Central Military
Commission. The Commission was set up by the state in accordance
with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the chairman of the Central Military Commission
is elected by the NPC and is responsible to the NPC and its
standing committee.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that it is necessary to fix in an appropriate way
like this the status of the army within the state system.
</P>
<P>
He said that this does not change the leadership of the party
over the army, as the Chinese Constitution explicitly confirms the
leading role of the party in the state affairs of China, certainly
including the party's leadership over the army.
</P>
<P>
On the perspective of the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong
after it returns to China on July 1, Qiao Shi said that the rise
of stock index of Hong Kong and the increase of investments in
real estate there indicate that the Chinese compatriots and all
the investors in Hong Kong have confidence in its future.
</P>
<P>
He said that as the historic moment of resuming the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong approaches day by day, China is doing
its best to make all the preparations for guaranteeing the
successful transfer of the Hong Kong government from Britain.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that after the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) is established, China will follow the policy of "One
Country, Two Systems" formulated by Deng Xiaoping, and strictly
observe the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, in order to let Hong
Kong people run their own affairs with full autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that Hong Kong will surely maintain
its lasting prosperity and stability and enter a higher stage of
construction and development.

<HEADLINE> UK Conservatives Urge Scandal-related MPs to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- British Conservative members of
parliament on Sunday urged their colleagues involved in scandals
to quit so as to save the party from a crushing defeat in the
upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
"Every Conservative candidate should examine his conscience and
say 'if I stand, will that make it more likely or less likely that
this election will be fought on policies and that the Conservative
government will get re-elected'," John Townend, a member of the
party's powerful 1922 Committee, told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"If it's less likely, I think there comes a time when we have
got to put the party and the country before our personal
interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another Tory legislator James Spicer said, "This is doing us an
enormous amount of damage and certainly if I were in a position
where I had to put myself or the party first, I know which I would
put first."
</P>
<P>
The Conservative party was around 20 percent behind the
opposition Labor Party in the opinion polls due to split in the
party over Europe policies and scandals of senior Tory official in
sexual indiscretions and financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, resigned
on Saturday over claims he had had a homosexual lover.
</P>
<P>
But two other Conservative MPs, Neil Hamilton and Piers
Merchant, refused to follow suit and quit as candidates.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton was allegedly involved in cash-for-question scandal in
which he received money from Harrods store owner Mohammed Al-Fayed
for asking parliamentary questions. Merchant was in a sexual
scandal and his photograph kissing a 17-year-old nightclub hostess
in a park appeared in a tabloid newspaper last week.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major hinted in a letter to Hirst that he
would like to see Merchant and Hamilton sacrifice themselves for
the wider interests of their party.
</P>
<P>
Major announced two weeks ago the election date was set on May
1, giving an unusually long 6-1/2 weeks' notice of polling day,
which he hoped his party would use to cut into Labor's lead, But
the first two weeks have seen a series of publicity disasters for
his party, which has held power since 1979.
</P>
<P>
A poll in the Mail on Sunday Newspaper gave Labor Party 52
percent support among women against 30 percent for the
Conservatives and 14 percent for the minority Liberal Democrats.

Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, formed last Tuesday, is under the premiership of

The reshuffle had been expected as some ministers held more than
two portfolios and some others were ill.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai, in a rare move, praised the Palestinian police
for preventing escalation of violence during the Land Day protests
today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians held large demonstrations throughout the West
Bank and Gaza Strip to mark the Land Day in protest over
Israeli policies of expanding settlements, but the protests
passed without major violence largely due to the efforts by the
Palestinian police to keep calm.
</P>
<P>
The Land Day is the anniversary of the killing of six Arabs
protesting Israel's confiscation of Arab-owned land in northern
Israel in 1976.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, Palestinian police succeeded in blocking thousands
of protesters from attacking the Israeli soldiers guarding the
Jewish holy site of Joseph's Tomb, the scene of fierce battles in
last September's bloodshed where six Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
Five Palestinian protesters were reportedly wounded when
Palestinian policemen fired warning shots to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
The head of Palestinian security forces Jibial Rajoub today
was in the West Bank town of Hebron to personally direct police
operation of preventing clashes between Palestinian protesters
and Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai praised the events in Nablus as "a good example" for
Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation in preventing
violence. Terming this weekend as a "major test for the peace
process," he said that if the week passed quietly, then it showed
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was generally acting
against terrorism and the time was up to resume top level contacts
to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"When we identify that the Palestinian National Authority was
working seriously (against violence) with all their power, we can
respect that and can come back to continue the peace process with
the Palestinians," he said during a tour of Israeli military
outposts on the West bank.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said despite the PNA's threat of severing security
cooperation with Israel, the security contacts continued
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the escalation of violence, Israel has
deployed tanks, armed personal carriers and snipers around major
Palestinian cities. Israel has warned the PNA that if violence
escalated into major bloodshed like in last September which
killed 75 people, Israeli troops could be sent back into
Palestinian cities to restore order.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israel Radio reported that Miguel Angel
Moratinos, the European Union Middle East peace envoy, relayed a
message to the Israeli government from PNA President Yasser
Arafat, saying that he would fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But Mordechai said the PNA had only partially responded to
Israel's call to crack down on terrorism. He pressed the PNA to
carry out a crackdown on the infrastructure of terrorism so as
to advance the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Typhoid Cases Rise in Ethiopia's Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of typhoid cases
in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, rose to 3,282 in the
first half of the Ethiopian year which started on September 11,
1996 and will end on September 10, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The figure registered stood at 2,929 last year, the Addis
Ababa regional health bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
Ayele Belachew, the head of the Epidemic Diseases Prevention
and Control Unit in the bureau, said the main cause of the
increase is lack of sanitation.
</P>
<P>
He advised the public to refrain from consuming contaminated
food and drink.
</P>
<P>
Strong preventive and control campaigns are being carried out
against the disease, he said, adding that both the professionals
and the public are now relieved much from the threat posed by
typhoid.

<HEADLINE> India Plunged Into Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- India has been plunged into a
sudden political crisis after the Congress party today withdrew
its support for the United Front (UF) government headed by Prime
Minister Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic development, Congress President Sitaram Kesri
today called on Indian President S.D. Sharma and delivered a
letter to him withdrawing support for the UF government.
</P>
<P>
In the strongly worded letter, Kesri said determined efforts by
the UF government to "marginalize" Congress and allow the urgent
national issues to take a back seat compelled the party to
withdraw support for the 14-party minority coalition government.
</P>
<P>
A complete collapse of law and order in the country, failure to
arrest communal and divisive forces and the overall demoralizing
effect on the civil services were among other factors that led to
the party's decision, Kesri said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress Party today announced it was staking a claim to
form a government following its withdrawal of support to the UF
government. Addressing a press conference here this afternoon,
Kesri said that Prime Minister Deve Gowda should resign and
Congress should get an opportunity to form the next government.
</P>
<P>
The top leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the
biggest opposition party in the country, met today to review the
new situation.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen after the meeting, BJP leader and former
prime minister A.B. Vajpayee said no party would be in a position
to form a government on its own and a snap poll was inevitable.
BJP Vice-President Madan Lal Khurana said his party would actively
explore the possibility of forming its own government.
</P>
<P>
An emergency cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Deve
Gowda was held hours after Congress announced withdrawal of
support to the UF government.
</P>
<P>
The UF government is reported to be of the view that instead of
just bowing out of office, Deve Gowda should face a trial of
strength in parliament as was done by V.P. Singh in 1990 after the
BJP withdrew support to his 11-month-old national government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav said the United
Front government will not resign in the wake of withdrawal of
support by Congress. A steering committee of the UF will meet
tomorrow to study the new situation.
</P>
<P>
There have been mixed reactions to the withdrawal of support by
the Congress to the UF government.
</P>
<P>
Some Congress leaders supported the party's decision, while the
leadership of the Communist Party of India held Congress
responsible for sowing seeds of discord in the country. UF
spokesman Jaipal Reddy said, "It is a dirty surprise to the people
of India."
</P>
<P>
The ruling UF coalition government, with a strength of 188
members including 11 outside supporters in parliament, is short by
84 members to be in the majority after the 140-strong Congress
withdrew its support for the 14-party alliance in the lower house
of parliament which currently has 543 seats.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition BJP holds 193 seats in parliament and no
party itself is in a position to form a government.
</P>
<P>
The last general election was held in April-May last year with
no political party gaining a simple majority in parliament. As a
result, the 14-party United Front came to power on June 1 last
year with the Congress's outside support.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10-month rule, the present government has run into
a lot of troubles due to differences among the constituents as
well as with Congress.

<HEADLINE> Salim: Africans Should Travel in Africa with Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Organization of African Unity
(OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahamed Salim has called for the
removal of visa restrictions among African nations as a means to
boost intra-African trade.
</P>
<P>
"If West African countries in ECOWAS (Economic Community of
West African States) could do this successfully all these years,
I do not see the reason why other sub-regional blocs in the
continent cannot do the same," Salim was quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
African states should eliminate administrative and other
barriers to free movement of people and goods on the continent,
Salim said at the opening ceremony of the seventh OAU/AEC
All-Africa Trade and Tourism Fair in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He urged African countries to rationalize their policies to
encourage the development of the private sector, which he said
was in a better shape to direct the economic development efforts
of African economies in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
According to Salim, a research project sponsored by the OAU on
sourcing of pharmaceutical requirements of eastern and southern
African countries has found that 60 percent of their needs could
be sourced locally.
</P>
<P>
He enjoined the African business community to seize the
opportunity of the fair to evolve ways of promoting
intra-continent trade.

<HEADLINE> Greek Defense Minister on Greco-Turkish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The resolution of the Cyprus
problem according to the principles of international law and the
U.N. constitutes a decisive pre-condition for the normalization of
Greco-Turkish relations, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Greek Cypriot weekly Ta Nea (The
News), published here today, Tsohatzopoulos affirmed that his
country will maintain close defense ties with Cyprus if Turkey,
which has deployed 35,000 heavily armed troops in northern Cyprus,
does not change its stance.
</P>
<P>
"The Greek government has undertaken the political
responsibility to guarantee the security of the island, so that
the free areas of the Republic are not under the constant threat
of a new military action by Ankara," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any "hot military incident" created by Turkey in
Cyprus will automatically translate into the mobilization of Greek
forces along the entire Cyprus-Aegean front.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is obliged to take into consideration that the
geographical distance between Greece and Cyprus no longer poses a
problem for Greece to reliably fulfil its defense obligations,"
Tsohatzopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
He added the Greek side's firm stance is that security
guarantees for both the Greek and Turkish communities on the
island can be achieved through the complete demilitarization of
the island, within an overall solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"If Turkey has the political will to accept this, we are
ready to work constructively toward this direction, but this is
impossible before a Cyprus solution can be found," the Greek
Defense Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of
an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense pact in November
1993, which covers Greek military assistance to Cyprus in case of
invasion.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any further advance of the
Turkish troops toward the government-controlled southern part of
the island would mean war between the two countries, both
Nato member states.

According to reports from Belfast, the bomb was planted in a

<HEADLINE> Scientists Urge Further Study of Coral Reef Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists are becoming
increasingly concerned about the coral reef decline throughout the
world and are recommending more research into the serious problem,
a news letter from Johns Hopkins University said today.
</P>
<P>
"The corals are dying all over the world," said Hopkins
biologist and chief researcher Gary Ostrander.
</P>
<P>
Scientists do not know what is causing the coral reef
deterioration, which has accelerated dramatically since early
1980s. But their deaths may signal serious environmental ills,
Ostrander added.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been few studies to detail the phenomenon
at the molecular and cellular levels or to uncover possible
environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
Corals, like jellyfish and sea anemones, are tiny animals that
use their tentacles to catch food particles floating in the water.
Certain types of corals produce calcium carbonate skeletons -- the
coral reefs. The corals are also at the center of a complex food
web. When they die, thousands of other species are in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
An example of the rapidly declining animal populations can be
seen in the shrinking number of sponges living on corals around
San Salvador island. Within three years beginning in 1994, the
number of sponges there declined by about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We now know that San Salvador is not unique and that these
sorts of trends are going on all around the world at the same
time," Ostrander said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Appeals for Arab Solidarity on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
today urged Arab foreign ministers to freeze all steps to
normalize ties with Israel in response to Israel's Judaization
attempt on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a fiery speech to the opening session of the 107th meeting
of the Arab League foreign ministers, Arafat accused Israel of
violating peace accords by tempering the demographic features of
Jerusalem to preempt final talks on the future of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that you'll issue resolutions that will restore the
peace march and help your Palestinian brothers," he told the
diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader throughout his speech made appeals to
the Muslim emotional link to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli settlement policy is a flagrant challenge
to the Arab and Islamic nations as well as the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"Judaization of Jerusalem is a very dangerous attempt by the
Israeli government that reneged on the peace process and wants to
liquidate the city from Arab inhabitants," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli plan is being brazenly implemented in the region
in total disregard of U.N. Security Council and U.N. General
Assembly resolutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Council meeting, though a routine one, came as
a critical timing as Israel broke ground for the 6,500-unit Jewish
neighborhood in East Jerusalem, a move that has sparked
Palestinian rioting on the 10th day running and drawn serious
warnings from Arabs to shelve ties.
</P>
<P>
He described Israel's actions as a "declaration of war against
an unarmed people."
</P>
<P>
Arafat also regretted the United States' double veto on moves
in the U.N. Security Council on condemning Israel's housing plan
in East Jerusalem, saying that the U.S. has backtracked on its
1991 letter of guarantees that bar Israel from changing status quo
of Jerusalem, captured in 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as a future capital, but
Israel insists on keeping the city undivided under Israeli
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have reached a series of agreements
but their talks on a permanent peace accord were stuck following
the Israeli decision on a new settlement and limited withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing Arab foreign ministers' meetings are expected to
approve a Palestinian-sponsored resolution that calls for
sustained Arab and Muslim coordination in taking steps to thwart
any Israeli plans concerning Jerusalem. Most Arab ministers have
voiced readiness to sever ties with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has diplomatic ties with Egypt and Jordan and set up
trade links with Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar and Oman.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Arab World Faces Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid warned today that the Arab world is confronted with
several challenges and problems that threaten to take toll on its
national security.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the League's ministerial council, Meguid took
account of the developments in some hot spots of the Arab world,
such as the Mideast, the Gulf region and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
On the Mideast peace march, Meguid said that the Arab world
cannot give up its rights or territories when seeking for peace.
</P>
<P>
"The maintenance of peace requires an atmosphere of confidence,"
he said, adding that Israel should contribute to building such
confidence by respecting the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Israel should see that gambling with the
region's fate and non-abidance by U.N. resolutions will negatively
reflect on itself and jeopardize the security of the entire region.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief stressed the exigency of bolstering comprehensive
security to guard Arab sovereignty which is threatened by many
problems.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the consequences of the Gulf crisis of 1990,
which he said "still hinders achievement of genuine Arab
solidarity."
</P>
<P>
Another challenge comes from the sanctions imposed on the
Libyan people because they have caused "severe material and human
damages," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Iran of creating headaches for the
Arabs. "Iran's continued occupation of the three islands of the
United Arab Emirates is another challenge that has helped create a
fait accompli," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation on the eastern and southern borders
of Sudan continues to deteriorate, adding that the Arab league
reaffirms its keenness on establishing security and stability in
the nation and the commitment of neighboring states to the
principle of non-interference of others' international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Amid all the dark clouds, he expressed the hope that efforts
toward the solution of the Somali crisis to realize national
reconciliation will succeed.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader concluded by warning that Israel's nuclear
program outside the international framework of non-nuclear
proliferation represents a direct threat to Arab national security
and undermines the stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
He called for international efforts to force Israel to abandon
its weapons of mass destruction to rend the Mideast a nuclear-free
zone.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for "Liberating Palestinian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 30 (Xinhua) - Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan today
called for closer Jordanian-Palestinian economic ties so as to
"liberate Palestinian economy from Israeli domination", Radio
Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
While meeting the press at Jordan Television, Hassan said that
70 percent of Palestinian economy was dependent on Israel. The
situation should be changed through opening to Jordan the Arab
land belonging to the Palestinians, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hassan said this could serve the interests of both Jordanians
and Palestinians and contribute to liberating the Palestinians
from Israeli political and economic "domination."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian question was the central issue to Jordan and
this embodied the kingdom's policies toward peace in the region,
he underlined.
</P>
<P>
A sovereign state for the Palestinians should be established
and various Palestinian rights, including that of
self-determination on their own land, be realized as part of the
comprehensive settlement to the Arab-Israeli dispute, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan rejected the Israeli government's Jewish settlement
policy in Arab East Jerusalem and considered it a breach of
international law and obstacle to peace.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan, accompanied by Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali, is currently in the United States and will
meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other U.S. officials to
seek solutions to the stalemated Arab-Israeli dispute.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Environmental Body to Resume Top-Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environmental Program
(UNEP) was set to resume on Thursday its top-level meeting
suspended last month due to bitter rows between the West and the
third world on reforms of the sole U.N. body of this kind.
</P>
<P>
A source from the Nairobi-based UNEP said this week that the
19th session of UNEP Governing Council will reopen here to
continue to discuss how to reform the UNEP's governing structure
and to raise its budgetary money.
</P>
<P>
Some new plans were expected to be put forward at the resumed
meeting, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
Fierce disputes emerged at the two-week session starting on
January 27 due to the above two issues among the participants
from more than 100 countries, causing the sudden suspension of
the meeting in the end.
</P>
<P>
From a budget of 160 million U.S. Dollars in 1991-92, the UNEP
budget provision fell to 90 million Dollars in 1996-97, with only
62.5 million Dollars actually reaching the place, causing a huge
budget gap.
</P>
<P>
On reforming a money-starved UNEP, the United States, Britain
and some other western countries suggested to set up an
"Intersessional Body" to rule UNEP during the adjourning of the
biennial session of the Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a majority of developing countries favor the
strengthening of the Committee of Permanent Representatives
(CPR), an intersessional subsidiary body of the Governing
Council, so as to keep their enough presence in the UNEP.
</P>
<P>
The western countries finally claimed the hold-back of their
money donation, the main sources of the UNEP budget, because the
session failed to pass a plan for the UNEP reforms.

<HEADLINE> Cement Supplies Improved in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's cement importers have
stopped buying cement abroad as local supplies have proved
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
Some importers today told Zimbabwe News Agency that imports
from Zambia or any other country were only as a result of local
shortages in the past.
</P>
<P>
However, one of Zambia's largest exporters, Chilanga Cement,
said that Zimbabwean companies had stopped importing cement from
Zambia due to high prices resulting from the revised new tariffs
which came into effect on March 1.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Industry and Commerce Ministry
said,"Zambia cement is cheaper than local cement, but when we
include transport costs it comes in line with our local cement.
But the major reason we imported was as a result of shortages
last year."
</P>
<P>
He added that now that the local cement company would be
completing its expansion project in the end of year and increase
production, there is optimism that cement supplies would be
adequate.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Cabinet Approves Customs Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Algerian Council of Ministers
approved today a draft customs law to align the country with its
trading partners of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Algerian official sources said that the law is actually an
extension of the measures being taken to restructure industry and
to liberalize foreign trade. It is a preparatory work for joining
the World Trade Organization and for establishing partnership with
the EU.
</P>
<P>
The law also aims at improving the control of the flow of
commodities and funds for more effective protection of the
Algerian national economy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the cabinet meeting, Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual said the law responds to the need to provide Algeria with
modern and effective legal tools for better movement of
commodities and funds.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the simplification of customs regulations and
measures should not ignore the accommodation of Algerian economy
in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
On the problems facing the Algerian economy, the president
called upon the government to pursue the application of reform
programs and pay particular attention to investments in small and
medium-sized establishments.
</P>
<P>
Special care should be given to combating unemployment and the
restructuring of the industrial sector, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is the principal obstacle in the Algerian
economy. The number of unemployed people has soared to some 1.8
million while the population has reached approximately 28
million. The Algerian government is concerned that the rising
unemployment may turn into a security problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China, on
Sunday hailed the relations between the NPC and the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Paris-based Chinese language newspaper
"Nouvelles d'Europe", Qiao said that the two sides have increased
contacts since China and the European Union (EU) established
official relations in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Qiao hoped that his visit to France and Italy, the first time a
Chinese NPC leader has visited EU members, would deepen the
understanding and promote cooperation between the NPC and the
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and the EU are two important forces on the
world political stage, and that China values the role of the
European Parliament as one of the major EU institutions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NPC hopes to increase exchanges with the
European Parliament as a way of boosting the overall Sino-European
relationship.

On the differences between the two sides over certain issues,
Qiao said that China prefers to have dialogue with the European
Parliament in order to deepen mutual understanding, narrow
differences and enhance cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that the relations between China and
the EU and those between the NPC and the European Parliament will
develop on a steady and healthy basis as long as the two sides
stick to the principles of mutual respect, seeking common ground
while reserving differences, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Efforts must be made to further
ensure agricultural development, higher income for farmers and
stability in rural areas, by closely following the Party's
agriculture-related policies, said a senior official of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, an alternate member of the Political Bureau and
member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, stressed
the point during a recent five-day visit to Shouyang County in
north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The situation in rural areas is getting better, but more
priority should be given to agriculture to get good harvests, he
said, adding that officials at all levels must put agriculture at
the top of the agenda in developing the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The Party has adopted a series of policies to consolidate the
work in agriculture, he said. And effective measures must be taken
to solve serious problems that arise in rural reform and
development, such as the problem in purchasing, marketing and
storage of farm products, he added.
</P>
<P>
Steps also must be taken to lighten the burden on peasants and
make the most of their initiative, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rural infrastructure construction must be quickened to improve
production conditions, and efforts should be made to increase the
contributions of science and technology in promoting rural
economic growth, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called on major grain producers like Shouyang to develop a
diversified economy while holding onto grain production. Work must
be done to increase the added value of farm products, and to boost
agricultural modernization, he said.

<HEADLINE> Writers Discuss Promoting China's Environment Literature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 well-known Chinese
writers gathered here today to discuss the development of China's
literature on the environment, and to celebrate the publication of
the country's first collected works in the field.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siyuan, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress; Zhang Qie, vice-chairman of the
Chinese Writers' Association; and Zhang Kunmin, deputy-director of
the State Bureau of Environmental Protection, attended the forum.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kunmin said that environmental protection is one of the
state's basic policies. Since China determined the policy of
sustainable development last year, the public's awareness of
environmental protection has greatly improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang added that the environment-oriented literature, with its
vivid style, lauds outstanding people and good deeds while
criticizing uncivilized behavior. The literature has an
"irreplaceable role" in upgrading the public's awareness of
environmental protection, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Many writers spoke at the forum, saying that it is urgent to
give full play to the role of literature in improving the public's
awareness of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they expressed the hope that more writers will
devote themselves to the field, pushing forward the development of
China's writings on environment.
</P>
<P>
The new collection includes the works of 140 writers. Xie
Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of Environmental Protection,
wrote the preface for the book.

<HEADLINE> China to Take Tough Measures to Protect Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua
said today that China must take the strictest measures possible to
manage and protect land, in order to correct the imbalance between
the growing population and decreasing farmland.
</P>
<P>
Zou made the remark at a national land administration directors
conference which concluded today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We must adhere to the basic state policy of 'greatly cherish
and make rational use of every inch of land, and effectively
protect farmland,'" he pointed out, adding that a one-year freeze
will be imposed on farmland-use approval, followed by a thorough
check on land use for construction.
</P>
<P>
Lack of comprehensive organization and macro-control in land
utilization has resulted in random use and abuse of farmland, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Vice-Premier stressed that subordinate land use plans must
be formed and carried out, and further use of farmland is
prohibited in principle before a modified overall program for land
utilization is put into effect.
</P>
<P>
Approval of farmland use for construction will be exclusively
validated by provincial and central governments. And the necessity
is great to revise the Land Management Law and bring under control
the entire land supply, the areas designated for urban and rural
construction, and land use purposes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete land management laws and statutes plus weak law
enforcement fall short of exerting effective control over random
use of farmland, thus failing to meet the needs of a socialist
market economy, he said, adding that the toughest land management
laws and regulations must be worked out and enforced.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent land system reforms will be directed at
strengthening the state's function in land management, and setting
up authoritative administration organizations to centralize land
management rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Construction which sacrifices agriculture and cultivated land
will not only seriously affect sustained social and economic
development but also the subsistence of our future generations,
the Vice-Premier warned.

<HEADLINE> Israel Shrugs off Arab League Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy said today that the Arab foreign ministers' decision
Sunday can only be harmful to the peace process, reported the
state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Levy made the remarks when he was speaking to reporters after
attending a Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee session.
</P>
<P>
He declared that Israel will not be deterred by the threats
made in Cairo and Rabat.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, after hearing an emotional appeal by Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat, Arab foreign ministers approved an
Egyptian-sponsored resolution that recommends halting all steps
toward normalizing relations with the Jewish state, in response
to the Israeli construction of a new Jewish settlement at
Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Israel had declared war on the Palestinian people
by surrounding Palestine with tanks in response to protesting
Palestinians throwing stones.
</P>
<P>
On March 27, Moroccan King Hassan convened the meeting of
Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
to discuss the crisis stemming from the settlement project. It
demanded that Israel stop the Har Homa construction.
</P>
<P>
Levy said, however, that Israel will continue on the road
to peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, David Bar-Illan, director for policy planning and
communication at the Prime Minister's office, warned that the
Arab foreign ministers had intended to do damages to
Israel, but the damages done here will harm the Arab countries
most.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Arab economies will suffer more
than Israel's as a result of their "boycotts and hostile
acts" against Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli President Ezer Weizman appears to be more worried
about the developments. He said that relations with the
Palestinians are not in a crisis and the government must work with
Arafat to reach an understanding toward a permanent agreement.
</P>
<P>
The president today urged both sides to make efforts to
put the peace process back on track.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Start Food Distribution to Citizens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 3l (Xinhua) -- Iraq has decided to start food
distribution as of next month in accordance with the
implementation of an oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) today quoted an unnamed Iraqi
Trade Ministry spokesman as announcing that each citizen will
get nine kilograms of flour.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that other food supplies set for each
citizen will start to be distributed from May.
</P>
<P>
The present quota of flour for each citizen in the country is
seven kilograms a month, which is insufficient, so Iraqis are
compelled to buy additional amounts of flour at high prices.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese ship loaded with Thailand rice reached the Umm Qasr
Port in southern Iraq on March 26, the first shipment of food
supplies to arrive in Iraq by sea since the oil-for-food deal
between Iraq and the U.N. was finalized.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was allowed last December to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil to buy food and other necessities over a six-month
period to alleviate the sufferings of its people due to more than
six years of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The INA today quoted an official source at the Iraqi Trade
Ministry as saying that 14 other ships carrying food supplies
will get to Iraq in the coming days.

adopting new economic criminal laws at its latest session, Qiao
Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Paris-based Chinese language daily
"Nouvelles d'Europe", Qiao said that NPC and its standing
committee have drafted and adopted a series of laws on cracking
down on corruption and building clean government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the latest NPC plenary session, ended on March 14,
made major amendments to the Criminal Code, specifying penalties
for corruption committed by state employees.
</P>
<P>
The new criminal law has two new chapters (37 articles)
exclusively dealing with the acts of abusing office, appropriating
public funds and receiving bribes and kickbacks. The law also
stiffens penalties for neglects of duty which had serious
consequences, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from law-making, the NPC has also participated in the
anti-corruption battle by supervising judicial system's
processing of corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
NPC delegates also supervise the investigations of such cases
and handle complaints.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the NPC is now working on a supervision law
which will have a major impact on the building of clean
government.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Pakistan Talks End with No Concrete Results, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The four-day foreign secretary
level talks between India and Pakistan ended here today with no
concrete results announced, but the two sides agreed to continue
their discussions in Islamabad on dates to be mutually decided,
according to Press Trust of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
The talks, suspended in January 1994 due to differences on the
Kashmir issue, were resumed here on March 28 between Indian
Foreign Secretary Salman Haider and his Pakistan counterpart
Shamshad Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
A brief joint statement issued at the end of the talks here
today said "the two foreign secretaries discussed all outstanding
issues of concern to both sides in a frank, cordial and
constructive manner."
</P>
<P>
The statement gave no details except that the foreign
secretaries decided to continue their discussions in Islamabad on
dates to be mutually decided.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen after the talks, Indian Foreign Secretary
Haider said "a great deal of common ground has been identified" on
several substantive issues of mutual concern during the talks
which have helped in "easing" communication between the two
countries and were a first step towards the desire to resolve all
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
Haider said "these talks were useful in a number of ways. We
have a much more detailed understanding of Pakistan's approach to
the talks."
</P>
<P>
The talks were wide-ranging in character, he said, adding that
the two sides had a thorough exchange.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the impact on the talks of the current political
crisis following the Congress party's withdrawal of support to the
14-party coalition government on Sunday, Haider said the dynamics
of the discussions continued during the talks today.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides got down looking at issues in a
comprehensive way on Sunday when the events were unfolding.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Foreign Secretary Ahmad today described the bilateral
parleys as "a new beginning" in relations with India.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to follow up the new beginning with continued
interests," he told PTI at the Delhi airport shortly before
leaving for Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We came here with a constructive and positive
approach. We have no illusions nor expecting any major
breakthrough or quick fixes."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, he said, was aiming at resumption of dialogue on all
outstanding issues including the "core" issue of Jammu and
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The decision of India and Pakistan to continue foreign
secretary level talks in the near future "in itself is a positive
outcome," he added.
</P>
<P>
The four-day closed-door talks were held in eight sessions.
Both sides had agreed not to disclose the details of the talks to
media.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government said today
the sinking of an Albanian refugee boat was not caused by Italy's
policy but the tragedy could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
An Albanian government spokesman said that Albania is satisfied
with the ongoing investigation into the incident by the Italian
judicial bodies.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the outcome of the investigation would help
further improve the friendly ties between the two countries
instead of destroying them.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government asked Italy to try to find all bodies
of the drowned refugees and reconsider its attitude toward
Albanian refugees already there.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, nearly 13,000 Albanian refugees have
thronged into Italy.
</P>
<P>
On March 28, a refugee boat which left the southern Albanian
port of Vlore for Italy with 117 Albanians on board, sank in the
Adriatic Sea after colliding with an Italian warship named Sibilla.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 34 survivors have been found and 79 people on
board confirmed to be dead.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government declared March 31 a "national day of
mourning" for the victims of the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Holds Talks with Australian PM (1) Eds: more details added. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng told
visiting Australian Prime Minister John Howard today that China
and Australia, both influential countries in the Asia-Pacific
region, should join hands to push forward the development of
bilateral relations of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of their talks this afternoon at the Great
Hall of the People, Li extended his welcome to Howard, who is on
his first official visit to China after taking office more than a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the economies of both China and Australia are
highly complementary.
</P>
<P>
He noted that leaders of the two countries have held a number
of meetings to discuss many bilateral and multi-lateral issues,
and that the meeting last year in the Philippines between Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Howard has had a particularly
significant impact on the development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hoped that Howard's current visit can further deepen
the existing friendship between China and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Saying that he is glad to visit China since he assumed office,
Howard recalled his successful meeting with Jiang during APEC's
informal summit, adding that the face-to-face meeting between the
two leaders was especially noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that China is a very important cooperative
partner of Australia, and China's enormous economic progress
offers extremely favorable cooperative opportunities for his
country.
</P>
<P>
Li last visited Australia in 1988, Howard pointed out, adding
that the Australian government formally invites Li to come to
Australia again, an offer which Li accepted with appreciation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that there is vast potential for
bilateral economic and trade cooperation, especially in the fields
of metallurgy, livestock products, minerals and grain, which have
good prospects.

<P>
Li said that both China and Australia are able to provide
products needed by each other, and the two countries should make
concerted efforts to further open their markets, so as to ensure a
healthy development of bilateral trade and promote the common
prosperity of the two economies.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that Australia has taken and is taking measures
that will benefit bilateral trade, and Li welcomed this.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to explore feasibility for bilateral cooperation in
finance, insurance and social guarantee sectors. They also agreed
that the two sides will have an annual economic and trade joint
committee meeting at the vice-ministerial level in the years to
come, as well as a bi-annual meeting at the ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Howard expressed his country's firm support
for China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), saying
that this is conducive to the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the entry into the WTO of China, as a world
trade power, can meet not only China's own needs, but also those
of the WTO, and it will result in profit for China's trade
partners like Australia.
</P>
<P>
Although China has made great economic achievements in its
reform and opening up drive, Li pointed out that China
is still a developing country, is concentrating on its domestic
modernization and constitutes no "threat" to any other country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese side has taken note of the
Australian government's recent repeated pledge to support a "one
China" policy, hoping that Australia can adhere strictly to this
policy in regard to the Taiwan question, which affects China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
He also said he hoped that Australia can act in accordance with
the norms for international relations on the issue of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that Australia does not consider China a threat to
other countries, and hopes China can participate more in regional
and global affairs. He noted that since 1972, the Australian
government has abided by the "one China" policy, adding that on
the Tibet issue, Australia will observe relevant norms governing
international relations.
</P>
<P>
On the international situation, Li said that the current world
situation is speeding toward multi-polarization, and each country
shows an increasing orientation toward independence.
</P>
<P>
He said that China holds that it is up to the people of every
country to conduct their own affairs, and the resolution of
disputes and conflicts between nations be done through dialogue
and consultation -- not confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that his government also holds that the sovereignty
of each country and the people's rights to decide their country's
own affairs should be respected.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Li hosted a dinner in honor of the Australian
visitors.

<HEADLINE> China's Judicial Guarantee for Human Rights Forceful: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable
achievements in safeguarding human rights, and its judicial
guarantees for the legitimate rights and interests of its citizens
have been "comprehensive and forceful," a justice official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiufu, vice-minister of justice, made the remark at a
press conference sponsored by the State Council Information Office
covering the publication of a document on "Progress in China's
Human Rights Cause in 1996."
</P>
<P>
Zhang briefed the press on the country's progress in building
its legal system.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening up, China has concentrated on both
economic development and the legal construction, said the
vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, the country has enacted 31l laws and decisions on
legal issues, as well as over 700 sets of regulations and nearly
4,000 sets of administrative rules.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, there are laws covering virtually all areas of
China's political, economic and social life, and democratic rights
of Chinese citizens have have been effectively protected with the
formulation of these laws, especially the revised Criminal Law and
Criminal Procedure Law," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that while speeding up the pace of legislation, China
attaches great importance to the implementation of laws, and the
enforcement of judicial and administrative law has been steadily
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The dissemination of knowledge of law has been done largely in
a planned and organized way, he noted, explaining that two
five-year law education publicity campaigns have been carried out
and the third five-year plan in this regard was initiated last
year.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were also stepped up to foster legal professionals as
well, Zhang said. To date, there altogether 8,265 law firms and
100,200 practicing lawyers in China; 73 overseas law firms have
been approved to set up their offices in China; and seven Chinese
law firms established their business offices abroad, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that a legal aid system has just been formed,
based on the Criminal Procedure Law and the Lawyers' Law which
went into effect this year, and designed to enable the poor and
the disabled in the community to make full use of their legitimate
rights.
</P>
<P>
To date, 47 legal aid centers have been set up in large and
medium-sized cities throughout country, Zhang said, adding that
they have handled nearly a thousand pro bono cases and had a
wide-ranging and positive influence on society.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement and inspection efforts in the country have also
been successful, he added.
</P>
<P>
As a government body in charge of prisons, the Ministry of
Justice has decided to turn the majority of the country's jails
into "modernized and civilized" facilities with adequate and
modernized equipment and sophisticated management systems.
</P>
<P>
Chinese prisons have their own characteristics, combining
punishment with education as a means of reform, and attempting to
rehabilitate criminals into law-abiding citizens, according to the
vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
The rate of recidivism in China's prisons is currently below 10
percent, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He also answered other questions concerning lawyers and the
punishment for hijackers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges Young Scientists For Bold Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
urged the country's young scientists to open their minds and be
adventurous in their research in order to make greater
contributions to the development of science and technology and
the socialist modernization of the country.
</P>
<P>
Li made the request during a meeting with a group of Chinese
scientists, all under 45, from the Chinese Academy of
Sciences. The group gathered in Beijing to discuss the necessity
of nurturing young scientists and to study ways to perfect
policies in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed his pleasure at discovering that the
scientists, all pioneers in their fields, are so young.
</P>
<P>
"When I saw you are so young, I thought of what Chairman Mao
Zedong once said to us, 'Young people are like the sun at eight or
nine in the morning, our hope rests upon you,'" Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Now I would like to say the same thing to you," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that middle-aged and older scientists are still China's
leading force in scientific research work, but because young
people are naturally adventurous and imaginative, it is mainly up
to young scientists to accelerate the progress of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Li talked to the scientists in the Zhongnanhai compound, the
seat of the State Council. Vice-premier Li Lanqing, State
Councillor Song Jian were also present at the meeting.

<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, executive
vice-president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), met here today with a Taiwan delegation that came
here for exchanges of experience in administrative science.
</P>
<P>
Extending welcome to the Taiwan visitors on behalf of his
association, Tang said the two sides of the Taiwan Straits are
under different social and administrative systems due to
historical reasons.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that sectors of the administrative science
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits will increase
exchanges, cooperations and understanding, and make joint efforts
to put forward the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The delegation president Yu-Bin Chiao also said sectors of the
administrative science between the two sides should increase
exchanges, and make contribution to the reform of the
administrative science as well as the reunification and prosperity
of the country.
</P>
<P>

guests of the ARATS. During their stay in Beijing, the members
attended a seminar on the exchange of the administrative science,

<HEADLINE> Cadre Exchange System Improving Regional Cooperation in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To wisely combine exterior conditions and interior factors, the
state has launched the campaign of mutual exchange of grass-roots
officials and on-job training for east-west cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Huaxi Village led the country in starting on-job training for
cadres from central and western areas in 1994, and sending local
cadres to work in those areas which also sent their local cadres
to work in Huaxi in exchange.
</P>
<P>
Township officials and enterprises directors of the western
poverty-stricken areas, who have neither traveled far nor had a
ride by train, have been given the chances to study market
knowledge, corporate management in eastern areas and later to hold
deputy posts in economic departments. Officials of economic
departments from coastal areas have been sent to work as deputy
mayor or deputy magistrate in western provinces and autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of cadre exchange program with the
regional Party committee of Ningxia claimed that the program is a
new step for reforming cadre administrative system, as such move
has made it possible for grass-roots officials of eastern China to
bring the concept of market economy, advanced technology and
management expertise into poor western areas, and likewise, cadres
of poverty-hit areas have the chance to learn experience and
practise them in the eastern areas.
</P>
<P>
Haijun, a 35-year-old local official of Muslim background from
Ningxia, had been engaged in administrative affairs until he was
sent to work as assistant to the mayor of Tongxiang City, east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Haijun distinguished himself after he returned and was
appointed to be the deputy director of the management committee
for aid-the-poor economic development experimental zone of Xihaigu
Prefecture of Ningxia. Last year, entrepreneurs from eastern China
and overseas businessmen started 130 undertakings in the zone,
with the registered capital amounting to 100 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Many local officials from the western areas said that aid in
kind could be named as cooperation, the exchange of cadres will
serve as a shortcut for east and west areas in economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Officials from eastern areas who have been sent to work in
western areas also believed that they have gained a better
understanding of the western areas through working there in person.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the exchange of cadres has changed from a previous
action directed by the government to a voluntary act of many local
officials from eastern and western areas.
</P>
<P>
Through exchanges of cadres, many counties and cities of
northwest China's Shaanxi Province have been knotted in
cooperation with those from east China's Jiangsu Province, which
has also led to the growth of industrial cooperative undertakings
in Shaanxi, and have introduced 1,000 management and technological
talents and more than 500 items of advanced technologies.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the exchange of cadres is the most effective
measure to implement the economic cooperation between eastern and
western areas, which has expanded the contents of east-west
cooperation from economic sphere to include cultural aspect and
will surely usher this cooperation into a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Eastern coastal areas, mainly the Yangtze River Delta, have
built bases for cadre exchanges between the eastern and western
areas this year, while the central Chinese government departments
have listed cadre exchange as an important task for cadre
education and train in the Ninth Five-Year-Plan Period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Information from the Ministry of Agriculture says the ministry
has launched a program to encourage cooperation of rural
industrial enterprises from the eastern and the western areas and
planned to exchange and train 10,000 directors and technological
workers through such program.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House to Hold Special Sessions on Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine House of
Representatives will hold special sessions beginning April 10 for
the passage of an income tax reform bill, House Speaker Jose de
Venecia said today.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia said the house, originally scheduled to resume on
April 21, will work on the passage of the third phase of the
Comprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP), particularly the increase
in individual income tax exemptions.
</P>
<P>
The house failed to approve the legislation on income tax
reform, the last part of the CTRP to be passed by the Congress,
this month due to heated debates and the lack of quorum.
</P>
<P>
The Congress is now on its Lenten recess which started March
21.
</P>
<P>
The congressional passage of the entire CTRP has been set by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as one of the conditions for
the Philippines to exit from its supervision.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is expected to get free from the IMF's nearly
35-year-long supervision on its economic development this June.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Allows Expansion of Private Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government today
announced that it will allow private groups to provide food aid
including rice for Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
from now on.
</P>
<P>
Seoul will also allow business groups to join the food aid
programs for DPRK through economic organizations, spokesman for
the National Unification Ministry said today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to today's announcement, aid for DPRK can include
food, which must be purchased from abroad. Those non-governmental
business groups contributing aid to DPRK are not permitted to do
so in the name of individuals or to collect donations or provide
cash.
</P>
<P>
It also provides that all food aid to DPRK should go through
the Red Cross of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government said it will not consider providing
large quantities of food aid in the name of government until the
DPRK agrees to participate in the Four-Party Talks with other
three partners of South Korea, the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
However, the government announcement will bring an obvious
increase of food aid to DPRK, local media predicted.
</P>
<P>
Seoul provided 150,000 tons of rice to DPRK in 1995, and since
then shipments of food to DPRK have been banned.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blasts Israeli Middle East Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran today once again attacked
Israel for its Middle East policy, describing it as "compulsive".
</P>
<P>
Hussein Sheikholeslam, Deputy foreign minister for Middle
East-African Affairs was quoted by the state-run Tehran Radio as
saying that it is only now that the international community has
understood the illegitimate essence of the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
"That is why the international community does not succumb to
Israel's diplomacy or propaganda," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the passage of a U.N. Security Council
resolution, which was vetoed by the United States, is an example
of the world's reaction to "the occupying regime's tyrannical
policies."
</P>
<P>
"The Zionist regime is always the same in its illegitimate
essence and the difference between today and yesterday lies in
its change of style," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that the Israeli regime used
arms yesterday and is using diplomacy today to impose itself on
the people of the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Husseini Khamenei earlier this month
indignantly condemned U.S. veto of a U.N. resolution criticizing
Israel over plans for a new Jewish neighborhood in disputed East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also condemned the Israeli plans for new Jewish
homes, describing Israel as "counterfeit, false, occupying,
oppressive and blood-thirsting".
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani also declared that
Iran will continue to provide various kinds of support to the
people of Palestine in their struggle to liberate their occupied
lands.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Communications Successful in Commercialization Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Communications,
which was founded in 1908, dismantled in 1958 and re-established
in 1987, has made remarkable achievements in efforts to
commercialize its operation by focusing on management, quality and
risk-control.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the bank's 10th anniversary of re-founding,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng wrote
inscriptions to encourage the bank to stick to the market-oriented
line.
</P>
<P>
According to its president Wang Mingquan, the Bank of
Communications has adhered to the teaching of the late leader Deng
Xiaoping "to build banks into real banks." Since its rebirth, the
bank has worked diligently to become a modern commercial banking
institution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony held in Shanghai last Friday to mark the
10th anniversary of re-establishment which took place on April 1,
1987, Wang said the bank is the first of its kind in the country
jointly held by central and local governments as well as by a
number of state-owned institutions and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the bank's experience, Wang noted that it has set
up a managerial system in line with the requirements for a
commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank has the final say on its internal affairs, including
management, gains and losses, risk-control and financial balance,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the bank has opened local branches
in 89 major cities and now has over 2,400 offices in these
cities. Meanwhile, the bank has established four overseas branches
and two overseas offices in foreign countries and regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the bank's assets stood at 397.88 billion
yuan, with its deposits and outstanding loans totaling 251.96
billion yuan and 179.16 billion yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bank has generated a total of nearly 40 billion yuan
pre-tax profits and given 12.8 billion yuan of interest to its
share-holders.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange makes up 30 percent of its capital and 25
percent of its profits.

<HEADLINE> Somali Warlords Make Peace Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Somalia's two major warring
factions today made appeals for political and military
reconciliation in capital Mogadishu, paving way for possible
peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Somalia's largest faction leader, Hussein Aidid who controls
most of South Mogadishu, issued a peace appeal to the other
warring factions, calling for an end to the civil war in the Horn
of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in South Mogadishu, his spokesman
said Hussein Aidid is going to open peace dialogues with all the
factions including Osman Ali Atto, another warlord in South
Mogadishu, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of North Mogadishu, and
Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, the faction leader who has declared
Somaliland in the north independent.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid is also trying to establish what he called a
National Reconciliation Council grouping Moslem scholars,
intellectuals, traditional leaders and businessmen from all the
warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ali Mahdi today called on Hussein Mohamed and Osman
Hassan Ali Atto to join him in urgent peace talks for the
pacification of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in North Mogadishu this morning, Ali
Mahdi said the peace initiative should bring about the reopening
of Mogadishu's main seaport closed since October 1995, and the
opening of Mogadishu's international airports which remained
non-functional since the departure of the United Nations
Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi said his earlier meeting with Hussein Aidid in
Nairobi early this month was very encouraging in promoting
Mogadishu's peace process.
</P>
<P>
And his meeting with officials of the Egyptian government and
the Arab League in Cairo later on was also successful. The Arab
League has pledged their full support and facilitation to the
national reconciliation efforts in Somalia, he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Demands Israel's Full Commitment to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Amid amounting Israeli-Arab
hostilities, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said here today all
he wants is full implementation of the peace accords, a commitment
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu fails to keep.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with an Egyptian T.V. program today, Arafat
said Netanyahu has no wish to implement signed agreements. "If
Netanyahu comes to implement what has been agreed upon I would not
mind dealing with him."
</P>
<P>
"I am not asking for the 'moon' but all that I wants is the
implementation of signed agreements," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, a special guest to the ministerial Arab
League Council meeting, said he had requested the Arab countries
to force Israel to comply with its peace commitments.
</P>
<P>
The League approved a draft resolution Sunday night calling for
a freeze of Arab normalization steps in relations with Israel in
response to Israel's ground-breaking for a 6,500-unit Jewish
housing project in East Jerusalem, a move that has jeopardized the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have denounced the project as an attempt to
Judaize Jerusalem, a holy city to Muslims, Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel, through its settlement policy, violated the
American letter of guarantees at the Madrid conference that
forbids any demographical changes in Palestinian lands, especially
in East Jerusalem during peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also regretted the U.S. double veto on
the moves in the UN Security Council resolutions to condemn
Israel's housing plan in disputed East Jerusalem, saying that
the move of the U.S. contradicts its criticism of the Israeli
settlements on Arab lands and the 1991 letter of guarantees,
signed by former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker.
</P>
<P>
"We should consider how to face up to such an attitude by
the U.S. government," he said, but did not mention any
specific measures to tackle U.S. and Israeli contempt for the
commitments they have made in the Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We ask the U.S. as co-sponsors of the peace process to put all
its weight behind Oslo I and II agreements which were signed in
the White House," he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increasingly tense situation in the region, Arafat
expressed belief that peace will be attained even if it is facing
all the difficulties "from those who do not keep their promises."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have been trading accusations over
the peace crisis. Israel charged Arafat of giving green light to
terrorism while the latter denounced Israel for provoking the
violence by launching a Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also dismissed Israel's demand that the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) should control the Islamic militant group
"Hamas" as a pre-condition for resuming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for the March 21 Tel Aviv
suicide bomb attack, killing three Israeli women and injuring
scores of others.
</P>
<P>
Arafat pinned the blame on Israel, saying that the Palestinian
suicide bomber lived inside Israel and lies out of the control of
the PNA.

<HEADLINE> Localities Ordered to Reduce Farmers' Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee and the State Council have issued a
13-point joint decision ordering all localities and departments to
reduce burdens on farmers by canceling all kinds of illegal levies.
</P>
<P>
While the economic situation in the rural areas is enjoying
overall development, the document says, in some places farmers are
still weighed down by rampant unlawful charges by local
departments.
</P>
<P>
This is a serious infringement upon the legal rights of farmers
and has aroused strong resentment among the rural people, it says.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee and the State Council regards the
issue of reducing farmers' burdens as an urgent political task as
well as a long-term policy, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
The decision says that the state will not change its policy on
agricultural taxation, and therefore, during the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000), no new taxes will be charged on farmers
and the rates of existing taxes will not be raised. No localities
have the right to levy new taxes or raise tax rates, the decision
warns.
</P>
<P>
Economic policies regarding charges by villages and local
governments will remain unchanged, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The decision prohibits any means to be used to collect cash and
goods from farmers, who have the right to turn down illegal
charges and to take their cases to the court.
</P>
<P>
Taxation on poor farmers should be reduced, as burdens imposed
on township enterprises, according to the document. Also
prohibited is undue fund-raising in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Town and township governments should cut their staff and
spending, and leading officials at all levels should personally
deal with the issue, the decision says, noting that leading
officials of relevant localities and departments will be hold
responsible where burdens on farmers are found to be increasing.
</P>
<P>
The document requests that the supervisory role of the public
and the media in this regard be strengthened, so as to severely
punish any kind of activities that would increase farmers' burdens.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' properties and legal income must be protected and
their will and democratic rights respected, the document says.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Form Truly Effective Partnership with China: Howard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said here today that Australia wants to form a "truly
effective partnership" with China in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon attended by 1,000 Chinese and Australian
business people in the Great Wall Hotel in eastern Beijing, Howard
said that the Australian government and people want to have a
close relationship with China, that is built on the strength of
the people-to-people exchanges between the two countries in the
past.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that there will be differences, but if we focus
on the common goals that we have -- we complement each other -- we
will have a truly effective partnership in the next 25 years and
beyond," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the two countries are highly
complementary in areas such as economy, trade and high
technology. He said that the Australian government encourages
exchanges and cooperation between enterprises of the two countries
and welcomes Chinese businesses to make investment in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councilor Song Jian echoed Howard, saying that
the two countries have a great number of similarities and great
potential for cooperation in the field of economy and trade. He
said that economic and trade cooperation between the two countries
has been growing at a rapid pace in recent years, and the future
holds bright prospects for cooperation in a range of fields from
commodity trade to hi-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
Song said that Howard's visit to China will greatly promote
Sino-Australian cooperation in all fields, including economy,
trade and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Howard also visited a chocolate factory of the Beijing Cadbury
Food Co. Ltd in the capital city this morning. He expressed
satisfaction over the business achievement of the Sino-Australian
joint venture. Chinese Minister of Metallurgy Liu Qi accompanied
Howard to the factory.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) today expressed
sympathy and concern for the pig producers and people in Taiwan
who have suffered heavy livestock losses as a result of
foot-and-mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Taiwan-based Straits Exchanges Foundation,
ARATS also conveyed the desire of the relevant departments of the
Chinese mainland to offer aid to those financially affected.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the relevant departments of the Chinese
mainland are deeply concerned about Taiwan's outbreak of the
contagious virus that causes open sores around an animal's feet
and mouth.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council
and the Ministry of Agriculture received inquiries from relevant
departments and people who also expressed their worries about the
disease and sympathy for the losses.
</P>
<P>
Some departments also said they are willing to send experts and
offer the newest effective vaccine to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This fully demonstrates the strong feeling the people on the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits have for each other, the spokesman
said, adding that ARATS hopes the spread of the disease will be
under control as soon as possible, so that the economic losses of
the Taiwan people will be minimal.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chen Yaochun, president of the Chinese Society of
Zootechnics and Veterinary Science, also voiced sympathy for the
situation, saying his society is willing to offer the
newly-developed Vaccine Type O, and send experts to aid their
Taiwan counterparts to quickly wipe out the disease.

SANAA, March 3l (Xinhua) -- A Yemeni official announced that
revenues of Yemen's oil exports are estimated at 970 million
U.S. dollars at present, showing a marked increase over that of
1995.
</P>

Minister of Oil and Mineral Wealth Mohammed Said el Attar said
that the export of oil stood at about 650 million dollars in 1995
when then civil war just ended.
</P>
<P>
Attar pointed out that the factors which have caused the
increase of revenues are the rise in the world oil prices, the
drop in the cost of oil products in Yemen and the Yemeni
government's supervision over the oil-producing companies.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni oil minister added that Yemen now produces 380,000
barrels of oil per day, and the output is expected to rise to
420,000 barrels per day by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Cadre Exchange System Improving Regional Cooperation in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- In a desolate part of northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, a new village has taken
shape on what was formerly wasteland, modelled on a village in
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Cadres from Jiangsu's Huaxi Village, dubbed "China's richest
village", have been working in Ningxia as part of an exchange
program with Ningxia's Xihaigu, known nationwide for its extreme
poverty.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, the idea of cadres from eastern
coastal areas working with those from impoverished western areas
has become quite common. The "Huaxia Village in Ningxia" example,
one achievement of this campaign to encourage more
economically-developed areas to help poverty-stricken areas
through economic cooperation to eradicate poverty, has become a
new trend.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, some 10,000 officials at the
grass-roots level from eastern provinces have been sent as part of
the exchange program. Eastern provinces have signed agreements
with central and western areas for more than 10,000 economic
cooperation and mutual aid projects, and have spent two billion
yuan on these projects.
</P>
<P>
The cadre exchange has been praised by State Councillor Chen
Junsheng as an important and outstanding strategic example of
east-west cooperation, and as a "key project", "core project", and
"project hope" for inter-regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The widening economic development gap between the east and the
west, which has a number of causes, has been causing great concern
in the past several years. Industrial output value of an entire
western province or autonomous region amounts to that of only a
county in the eastern part of China, and the gap in per capita GDP
between northwestern provinces and autonomous regions and eastern
coastal areas rose from 70 yuan in 1978 to 2,000 yuan in 1996.
</P>
<P>
To help narrow this gap, the central government has worked out
a series of preferential policies to support development of
western areas and promote an exodus to the west of enterprises in
eastern areas.
</P>
<P>
However, some local officials in the west don't have sufficient
experience in the market economy, and some eastern businesses that
just blindly headed for the west only contributed to setbacks in
east-west cooperation and to failures of projects in the early
years.

<HEADLINE> Key RUF Members Seized by Group Loyal to Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A number of key members of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) have been abducted by elements
supporting ousted leader Foday Sankoh, diplomatic sources here
disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the members of the new RUF and
Sierra Leone's ambassador to Guinea Mohamed Diaby were seized
when they came to a meeting in Sierra Leone to discuss the
"election of a new leader to replace Foday Sankoh" who is now
being detained in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The meeting ended on Saturday and the team traveled to Koindu
in eastern Sierra Leone to ''update'' RUF combatants about the
result, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
''It was there that the group ran into heavy fire and the
capture took place,'' said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement broadcast on national radio and TV
confirmed the abduction but blamed what it called ''misguided
elements'' in the RUF for the action.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Commission for the Consolidation
of Peace (CCP) named only three of those abducted. Ibrahim Deen
Jalloh, Fayia Musa and ambassador Diaby but other sources said
the expected new leader of the RUF Philip Palmer and Dr Mohamed
Barrie were arrested among them.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for the ''immediate release'' of the
abducted officials and condemned the abduction, saying the
''action will be detrimental to the overall peace process.''
</P>
<P>
Mrs Agnes Deen Jalloh, a key RUF member in Freetown, said in
an interview today that ''no demands have been made as yet.''
</P>
<P>
She said it was her understanding that the ''captured men
which include a number of Guinean security officials, would not
be kept in Nongowa and that they would be moved around.''
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that a three-man emissary group of combatants
who were sent ahead to plan the meeting were captured by renegade
RUF fighters earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
They were identified as Sahr James, Steven Kamanda and Abdulai
Mansaray.

<P>
The province will spend three million U.S dollars building the
zones in six wealthy towns in two years to promote water
conservation, modern breeding techniques, multi-purpose
agriculture, higher yields, and wheat and maize growing.
</P>
<P>
They will focus on high-tech agricultural infrastructure
projects and integrating trade, industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Henan began its comprehensive agricultural development in
1988. The central government has put more than two billion yuan
(250 million U.S. dollars) into improving 1.6 million hectares of
low-yield farmland, helping add more than 1,800 kilograms of crops
per hectare.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to previous agricultural zones, the new
demonstration zones will be managed by six independent
agricultural development corporations and will introduce an
investor-owner system.

<HEADLINE> Final Sprint for Damming of the Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- With little more than seven
months left until its target date of completion, the damming of
the Yangtze River for the Three Gorges Project has entered a
critical phase.
</P>
<P>
The construction site of the world's largest hydro-electrical
endeavor is alive with the roar of bulldozers, dump trucks and
cranes. A huge eye-catching billboard reads "Damming of the river
is scheduled for Nov.15, with only 230 days left."
</P>
<P>
The water's edges in mid-river that are controlled by
cofferdams in both the upstream and downstream areas are now 460 m
and 540 m wide, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Work is proceeding smoothly for the damming and the cofferdam
construction, and the first-stage task of sinking rocks into the
water has been completed, said Lu Youmei, president of the China
Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation, overseer of
the project, in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
To ensure river blockage is carried out on schedule, he noted,
the builders are lowering an average 5,500 cu m of rocks into
water daily to provide a floor for the damming -- a feat that has
never been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, the riverbed on the right side of the
upstream cofferdam had been raised to an average height of 40
meters, as a result of the 380,000 cu m of rocks and concrete
blocks placed at the bottom of the river.
</P>
<P>
To keep in step with the damming work, other support projects
are being launched simultaneously, including preparation of
blocking materials on the right bank of the river, construction of
anti-leakage walls, vibration for consolidating the cofferdams,
and the clearing work within the cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 91 percent of the total earth and rock work
volume, that is, 1.6 million cu m out of 1.7 million cu m, has
been finished for the damming and cofferdam construction.
</P>
<P>
Lu, general director of the project, noted that ISO-9000
Standards have been introduced for various damming and cofferdam
projects from the outset of the project to standardize
construction.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project headquarters has set up various
quality control divisions for construction, in a bid to ensure
river-blockage is completed by mid-November.

<HEADLINE> Key RUF Members Seized by Group Loyal to Detained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A number of key members of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) have been abducted by elements
supporting ousted leader Foday Sankoh, diplomatic sources here
disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the members of the new RUF and
Sierra Leone's ambassador to Guinea Mohamed Diaby were seized
when they went to a meeting in Guinea to discuss the election of
a new leader to replace Foday Sankoh who is now being detained in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The meeting ended on Saturday and the team travelled to Koindu
in eastern Sierra Leone to ''update'' RUF combatants about the
result, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
''It was there that the group ran into heavy fire and the
capture took place,'' said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a statement broadcast on national radio and TV
confirmed the abduction but blamed what it called ''misguided
elements'' in the RUF for the action.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Commission for the Consolidation
of Peace (CCP) named only three of those abducted. Ibrahim Deen
Jalloh, Fayia Musa and ambassador Diaby but other sources said
the expected new leader of the RUF Philip Palmer and Dr Mohamed
Barrie were arrested among them.
</P>
<P>
The statement called for the ''immediate release'' of the
abducted officials and condemned the abduction, saying the
''action will be detrimental to the overall peace process.''
</P>
<P>
Mrs Agnes Deen Jalloh, a key RUF member in Freetown, said in
an interview today that ''no demands have been made as yet.''
</P>
<P>
She said it was her understanding that the ''captured men
which include a number of Guinean security officials, would not
be kept in Nongowa and that they would be moved around.''
</P>
<P>
She disclosed that a three-man emissary group of combatants
who were sent ahead to plan the meeting were captured by renegade
RUF fighters earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
They were identified as Sahr James, Steven Kamanda and Abdulai
Mansaray.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress party today
formally staked its claim to form a new government, the Press
Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The letter staking the party's claim "has already gone" to
Rashtrapati Bhawan, the presidential palace of India, Congress
party President Sitaram Kesri told newsmen here.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party's new move came a day after it withdrew
support to the 14-party United Front (UF) coalition government led
by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
Kesri had announced that the party decided to form a new
government soon after he presented a letter to the president
conveying the party's withdrawal of support to the UF government
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted by the party's highest decision making
body, the Congress Working Committee, later that day authorized
Kesri to formally stake the claim.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Delay in Shaping Liberia's Electoral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The delay in the inauguration of
Liberia's electoral commission has aroused concern from the
international community over whether the presidential election
can be held in the country on May 30 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The induction of the commission, widely seen as a land-mark in
the peace process to end Liberia's seven-year-old civil war, has
been delayed twice due to controversy over who holds the
chairmanship of the organ.
</P>
<P>
The latest election of the chairman held in capital Monrovia
10 days ago resulted in a 2-2 tie between Henry Andrew and Gloria
Scott.
</P>
<P>
At that point, chairwoman of the ruling Council of State Ruth
Perry used her constitutional power to interfere and Andrew was
elected.
</P>
<P>
But then displeased Charles Taylor, the former strongest
warlord who presented Scott, claimed the process to be unfair.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha who is also
chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), ordered the Liberian Council of State to "remove any
bottlenecks in inducting and reconstituting" the Independent
Elections Commission and the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Last week, General Abacha gave the Liberian provisional
authorities the deadline of April 2 to induct the two bodies to
ensure a smooth way toward the general elections.
</P>
<P>
A retired Nigerian diplomat, Issac Sagay, has been appointed
as the ECOWAS representative to the Liberian election commission
which also embraces two other representatives from the United
Nations and Organization of African Unity respectively. All the
three international delegates will not enjoy voting power.
</P>
<P>
Concerned about the success of the planned elections in
Liberia, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has also
advised the immediate reconstitution of the two bodies.
</P>
<P>
Describing the present timetable for the conduct of the
elections as "extremely tight", Annan said any delay would
adversely affect the elections.
</P>
<P>
"For the elections to take place as scheduled on May 30, the
Liberian elections commission and its international partners must
undertake myriad complex and meticulous preparations," the U.N.
chief noted.
</P>
<P>
With only two months away from the elections, the slow pace of
preparations for the May 30 polls has also aroused concern of the
West African peace-keeping force, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
To avoid a postponement of the elections, ECOMOG Force
Commander Major-General Victor Malu last week urged the
authorities of ECOWAS to ensure the implementation of the
schedule.
</P>
<P>
All efforts must be made to ensure that elections be held on
May 30 and the new democratic government be sworn in on June 15
as scheduled in the revised Abuja Peace Accord signed in August
1996, Malu said in the ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
With the success in disarming Liberia's formal rival factions
and retrieving hidden weapons, ECOMOG has created necessary
security conditions for the holding of a free and fair election,
he told visiting acting executive secretary of ECOWAS, Mahamadou
Quhounoudou.
</P>
<P>
Malu also allayed any fear of post-election violence or
fighting while assuring the ECOWAS authorities and the
international community that ECOMOG is in position to contain and
effectively tackle anyone who might lose election and try to
cause problem.
</P>
<P>
As Annan put it: "The prospects for peace in Liberia now seem
to be more promising than at any time since the start of the
civil war. Whereas, much remains to be done."

<HEADLINE> Australian Stock Market Expected to Open Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market is
expected to open sharply weaker tomorrow, following Wall Street's
huge sell-off before the Easter break.
</P>
<P>
Australian market players have had four days to ponder the
implications of Wall Street's 140.11 point fall to 6740.59 on
Thursday, which came after the local market had closed on a strong
note ahead of the break.
</P>
<P>
Reports over Easter have indicated that further tightening of
US interest rates is on the cards, pointing to bearish days ahead
for equity markets not only on Wall Street but domestically as
well.
</P>
<P>
The US Federal Reserve pushed short term interest rates a
quarter percentage point higher last week as inflationary
pressures emerge in the US economy.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's move was not a one-off event, it would likely move
again to tighten interest rates by another quarter percentage
point to 5.75 percent, possibly timed after the May 20 open
markets committee meeting, said John Peters, senior economist of
Westpac Bank in his weekly economic report published here today.

PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's outlawed Islamic

<HEADLINE> Weah Threatens to Abandon Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's George Oppong Weah has
threatened to boycott the World Cup tie between his country and
Egypt on April 6 over the country's inability to settle an
outstanding 39,000 U.S. dollars allowances owed him.
</P>
<P>
Unless the arrears was reimbursed by the government, he would
not show up for the World Cup preliminaries against Egypt because
"I want to teach the people some lessons," said the world's top
soccer player and AC Milan marksman, according to a report
reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Weah said the amount was incurred during the African Nations
Cup qualifier against Zaire last October and other unnamed matches.
</P>
<P>
He also advised the government to settle all outstanding
allowances to other professional players incurred over the years.
</P>
<P>
"Once I am not coming, you can be sure what it means. Other
professionals will also boycott the game," he said.
</P>
<P>
Weah said he had made a lot of sacrifices for the growth of
football in Liberia and "it is time government shows the same
appreciation."
</P>
<P>
"We are tired of empty promises. Let the word go forth that we
will not come for the Egypt match, if the government can't meet
its obligations to us," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Team to Climb Mt. Qomolangma for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani mountaineers are
going to make their maiden attempt to conquer the world's highest
Mt. Qomolangma on the border of Nepal and China in May, a renowned
Pakistani climber said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's first Qomolangma expedition, arriving here last
week, will scale the 8,848-meter mountain on the north face in the
Tibet Autonomous Region of China probably by the end of May, team
leader Nariz Ahmad Sabir told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to Sabir, an accomplished climber who made the first
ascent of the west ridge of the 8,611-meter peak K-2 in Pakistan
in 1981, his 10-member team will leave here in early April for
Lhasa and establish the base camp in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
Three Chinese climbers will join the Pakistani team in the base
camp which is expected to be set up at 5,500 meters above sea
level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sabir said the expedition is a unique commemoration of the
golden jubilee of Pakistan's independence.
</P>
<P>
The whole operation, expected to cost 400,000 US dollars, is
mainly sponsored by Hub Power Company Ltd. (HUBCO), Pakistan's
first private sector power plant which provides about one-sixth
supply of electricity in the country, he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Congress Party Dislodges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- In a dramatic development on
Sunday, the Congress party withdrew its support to the
ten-month-old United Front (UF) government headed by Prime
Minister H.D. Deve Gowda in a bid to check the sustaining erosion
of the party's fortune since its debacle in the general elections
held last year.
</P>
<P>
Congress party President Sitaram Kesri, who presented a letter
to President Shanker Dayal Sharma conveying his party's decision
to withdraw support to the government, also announced that the
party staked claim to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
Kesri's move, which took even many in his party by surprise,
put a question mark over the fate of the government with no clear
indication as to what political scenario will emerge at the next
stage.
</P>
<P>
The move came earlier than expected though the relations
between the Congress party and the ruling UF have been
deteriorating over the past few months, especially after the
opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), allied with another local
party, recently formed a popular government in the most populated
Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The 14-party UF and the Congress party entered into a temporary
alliance in the context of a hung parliament arising out of the
general elections held in April and May last year.
</P>
<P>
During the elections, the 112-year-old Congress party suffered
an unprecedented defeat by only garnering about 140 seats in the
543 seats Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Indian parliament).
</P>
<P>
The BJP, which is dubbed as radical "communal forces," won 160
seats, emerging as the largest party in the country. The BJP and
its allies formed a minority coalition government which collapsed
within only two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The UF, with a strength of only 177 seats in the parliament,
formed a new coalition with outside support from the Congress
party on June 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party hoped that its alliance with the UF could
help contain its main rival, the BJP, and in the meantime buy some
time for the party to revitalize itself to face a fresh poll at an
appropriate stage.
</P>
<P>
However, the honey moon between the Congress party and the UF
did not last long and the relations between them began to worsen
after Kesri replaced former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao as
the leader of the Congress party in September last.
</P>
<P>
As the relations between the two groups deteriorated, the
emerging view among the Congress party leaders was that the UF
experiment had failed to checkmate the rise of the BJP, which
emerged victorious in both Uttar Pradesh and Punjab through
manipulative coalition efforts.
</P>
<P>
Thinking that a weak Congress party will help it to stay longer
in power, the UF had not only refused to lend support to the
Congress party in the recent local elections in Uttar Pradesh and
Punjab but also filed its own candidates against those of the
Congress party in a number of by-elections to vacancies in the Lok
Sabha.
</P>
<P>
The BJP benefited from all these discords between the Congress
party and the UF, which stirred lots of grievances within the
Congress party.
</P>
<P>
Apart from failing to contain the BJP, the UF government had
also contributed to the Congress party's loss of image by
launching probes against its leaders in a selective manner and
jeopardizing the party's electoral prospects at different levels
of elections.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party leaders were upset that as many as 100
investigations by law enforcement agencies, including the Central
Bureau of Investigation, had been launched against incumbent and
former senior Congress party leaders and even against Kesri, the
party chief.
</P>
<P>
Four scandals, for example, are under investigation against
former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and two against Kesri.
</P>
<P>
As the Congress leaders saw it, a government surviving on their
support in parliament was out to tarnish them by using the law and
relevant enforcement agencies in a selective manner.
</P>
<P>
What irked Kesri and his supporters most, according to an
editorial published by Indian newspaper The Hindustan Time today,
was that the major UF leaders did not hesitate to fish in the
troubled waters of the Congress party by preferring to talk to
Narasimha Rao even after Kesri had taken over as the Congress
party president.
</P>
<P>
And in recent weeks, the UF leaders preferred to have informal
meetings with Sharad Pawar, the actual leader of the Congress
party's parliamentary group and a known opponent to Kesri, than to
hold consultations with the Congress party president.
</P>
<P>
Disappointed by the UF's handling of its relations with the
Congress party and annoyed by the constant erosion of the party's
fortune, Kesri and other Congress party leaders have repeatedly
warned the Front against taking the party's support for granted
and urged it to take correct measures.
</P>
<P>
In one of such warnings, Kesri told the UF government on
October 6 last year that "if the Congress party becomes weak, this
government will go."
</P>
<P>
The UF, however, has failed to take such warnings seriously. It
has not only ignored them but sometimes even ridiculed them as
nonsense, embarrassing the Congress party with a further damage to
its image.
</P>
<P>
Like the boy in the fable who cried wolf once too often, the
Congress party finds itself alone when it abruptly announced on
Sunday its decision to withdraw support to the Deve Gowda
government after threatening to do so for so many times in the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
As in the fable where the wolf ultimately forced the boy to
tell the truth, it is the UF and its leaders who seem to have made
up the mind of the Congress party.
</P>
<P>
In his strongly-worded letter to the president on the party's
withdrawal of support to the government, Kesri accused the UF
government of making "determined efforts" to marginalize his party
and of serious failure to joint hands with the party to contain
the BJP and other "communal forces" in the country.

against the holding of a national congress there by the
extreme-right National Front (FN) party of Jean-Marie Le Pen.
Strasbourg has never seen such a mobilization of people since its

<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Hundreds of Palestinians demonstrated on Sunday in the West
Bank to mark the annual Day of Land, which commemorated the fight
against colonization of Arab land. Clashes were contained to a
limited scale between Palestinians and Israeli security forces,
thanks to cooperation between Palestinian police and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
-- The Arab League Sunday called for a freezing of the
normalization process of relations between Israel and Arab
countries, to protest Israel's refusal to continue the peace
process with Palestinians. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said

<HEADLINE> Australia To Focus trade On South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister for Trade Tim Fischer will this week lead the first
trade mission to South Asia in more than a decade as part of the
Howard Government's new Asia-focused bilateral trade strategy.
</P>
<P>
Business people from 20 Australian companies involved in
mining, infrastructure, engineering, finance, shipping and the
medical industry are accompanying Fischer on the nine-day trip,
which will include visits to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and
Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said today that the aim of the mission is to
expand trade and investment with the region, where economic
reforms are starting to generate substantial opportunities.
</P>
<P>
According to Official figures, Australia's exports to Pakistan
is growing at annual rates of 30 percent to 35 percent, totaling
260 million Australian dollars (202 million US dollars) in 1996,
while exports to Bangladesh almost doubled to 226 million
Australian dollars (176 million US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan are much smaller markets, but, the sources
said, they also offer some investment possibilities, such as
hydroelectric power generation in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
India is the main South Asian market, taking more than one
billion Australian dollars in the country's exports a year, but
the current mission will not go to India, which was the subject of
last year's New Horizons promotional effort.

PYONGYANG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's

The article said the Western countries, regarding their values
universally applicable, have gone out of the way to impose their

</P>
<P>
This sort of behavior is a brutal violation of internationalism
and the principle of mutual respect, it added.
</P>

The article advises the Western nations to further cooperate
with the developing countries in their economic and social

<HEADLINE> Crimes That Jeopardize State Security Becoming Less Common </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- There is only a very limited
number of criminals in Chinese prisons who have committed crimes
of endangering state security but were sentenced for
counter-revolutionary crimes.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by vice-minister of justice Zhang Xiufu today
when meeting the press here. He disclosed that there are currently
2,026 people serving sentences for jeopardizing state security,
meaning 1.6 per million people, and only 46 of every 10,000
prisoners in the country, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Those serving sentences for counter-revolutionary activities
include people involved in prison riots and terrorist activities
who were convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes under the
previous criminal law, he said.
</P>
<P>
When those people are factored out, the number of people
accused of jeopardizing state security becomes much smaller, the
vice-minister noted, adding that such offences are now defined as
common criminal offences under the revised criminal law.
</P>
<P>
As the standard of living improves and public awareness of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics increases, the
crime of sabotaging state security will become less common, Zhang
explained.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Hail Resolution on Freezing Ties With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries have hailed the
draft resolution approved Sunday night at the meeting of Arab
League Council that called for suspending Arab normalization of
relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The draft proposed by Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and
Syria recommended Arab states reactivate the economic boycott of
Israel, stop normalization steps, close Israeli offices and
missions and pull out of multilateral talks on aspects of Mideast
peace.
</P>
<P>
Egypt said it holds no reservations against the resolution
which is a prime recipe for the ailing peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters after
Sunday's session the resolution is directed to the Arab
countries that have opened offices in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"But when the peace process faces such potential obstacles
owing to the Israeli policy, it is natural enough they reconsider
their stances," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It mirrors the feeling Arabs have now," he said, adding that
the Arabs can never accept the building of settlements or any
manipulation in the Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Israel must act in a way allowing other countries to continue
to push forward relations with it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Farouk Qaddoumi, the head of the PLO political
department, said the resolution is good at the current stage.
</P>
<P>
"The move is premised to have a political impact on the
recalcitrant party that is offering no service to the peace
process," he added, in an allusion to Israel.
</P>
<P>
He noted that what matters is the response to such resolutions,
but he denied that some Arab countries showed reservations about
the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Qaddoumi, asked on how Jordan and Egypt will implement the
resolution, said "we are talking about the steps recently taken by
some Arab countries, not about those who have signed peace
treaties with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Israel has diplomatic ties with Egypt and Jordan and set up
trade links with Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara referred to the tribute
paid by other Arab delegates to the resolution and expressed "full
satisfaction" with the outcome reached by the Arab League Council
meeting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Other Arab countries, such as Qatar, Bahrain, Lebanon and
Algeria have also voiced support to the move and readiness to
implement it as soon as recommendations are fully studied.
</P>
<P>
In the first Israeli reaction Sunday night to the Arab League's
resolution, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu urged Arab countries
to "think of their interests on the long run."
</P>
<P>
"I believe peace is in the interests of Egypt and Jordan, two
countries bound by peace treaties with Israel, as well as other
Arab countries," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Palestinians to think over the "necessity of
achieving peace for the sake of the two sides."
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the 22-member league, during their
evening session, approved the resolution as a joint Arab response
to Israel's Judaization attempt on Jerusalem through building
Jewish settlement on the Arab sector of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Council meeting, though a routine one, came as
the Mideast peace was jeopardized by Israel's ground-breaking for a
6,500-unit Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem. And Palestinian
riots against the settlement has entered the 11th day.

<HEADLINE> Australian Meat Exports Rocked By Disease Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian ban on imports of
meat and live cattle from Victoria and New South Wales (NSW)
following anthrax outbreaks in several parts of the two main meat
export states has rocked the country's 2.75 billion US dollars
meat export industries.
</P>
<P>
A top Indonesian Government official in Jakarta was reported as
saying today that the ban imposed on March 10, would be lifted
three weeks after the last reported case of anthrax.
</P>
<P>
Local officials are concerned that the ban imposed by the
Indonesian Government on meat imports from Victoria may be
extended because of new outbreaks in some parts of NSW.
</P>
<P>
The chief veterinary officer with the NSW Department of
Agriculture, Dick Jane said, the State's animal health officers
had been dealing with wide-spread anthrax outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
They had occurred during the same 42-day quarantine period as a
Victorian outbreak that threatened markets in Korea and Japan and
closed the Indonesian and Thailand markets.
</P>
<P>
Jane said, there had been anthrax outbreaks at Nyngan,
Narrandera and Bourke in NSW State, one of which killed 16 cattle,
and "a couple of cases" at Condobol in last September.
</P>
<P>
However, NSW Agriculture Minister Richard Amery told ABC
Television today that "the Indonesian action was probably a
precautionary one, we believe the ban will be short-lived and the
matter will be resolved."
</P>
<P>
He said, "NSW had eight to 15 outbreaks of anthrax a year, with
only six last year and they were easily handled, it is not that
bad at all, we've learned to live with anthrax and how to handle
the outbreaks for many decades."
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, since the outbreak was reported
on 26 January, the disease killed almost 200 cattle in Victoria,
83 properties were confirmed as being affected by anthrax.
</P>
<P>
Anthrax is a highly infectious cattle disease that leads to
ulcerating nodules, lesions in the lungs and blood poisoning, it
can be transmitted to humans handling infected meat.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Foreign Exchange Reserves Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The foreign exchange reserves of
the Bank of Korea (BOK) have fallen below the 60 billion
U.S. dollars mark for the first time in the 22 months.
</P>
<P>
After hitting a record high of 68 billion dollars at the end of
last June, the central bank's foreign exchange reserves have been
steadly declining mainly due to the widening current account
deficit and slow inflow of foreign capital for direct investment,
senior BOK officials said today.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's current account deficit increased by 51 percent
to 5,581 million dollars during the first two month of 1997 from
the 3,705 million dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Largely affected by the recent depreciation of the Won against
the Dollar, foreign investment in local stocks has been sluggish,
shifting from a net inflow stance in January to a net outflow
situation in February.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Justice Ministry Briefs Press on Bao Tong, Wang Dan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Xiufu, China's
Vice-Minister of Justice, spoke with the press in Beijing today on
the conditions of Bao Tong and Wang Dan.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Bao Tong was released in May of last year after
serving his sentence, but according to the court's verdict, was to
be deprived of political rights for two years during which he is
placed under the watch by relevant departments in accordance with
the law.
</P>
<P>
When asked why Bao Tong has not returned home, the
vice-minister explained that the apartment where Bao had lived is
state property that had been allocated to him as his original
position entitled him to and that departments concerned considered
it inappropriate for him to continue to live in that apartment.
</P>
<P>
He said that the relevant departments have provided Bao with
alternative housing, but Bao's family did not agree with this
arrangement. The matter is still under discussion.
</P>
<P>
These departments have been taking good care of his livelihood,
and have invited top-notched medical experts to treat his
diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bao once held a position in the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Bao was arrested in 1989 for breaking the law by leaking
important state secrets and inciting others to resist and hinder
the implementation of state laws.
</P>
<P>
He was later sentenced to seven years in prison and deprived of
political rights for two years by the Beijing Intermediate
People's Court.
</P>
<P>
In answer to a question about why Wang Dan has not been let out
on bail for medical treatment, Zhang said that it is because Wang
is in a good health and does not meet the requirement for being
released on bail.
</P>
<P>
He said that Wang's parents visited him in jail during Spring
Festival and spent the holiday with him. Wang even joined a
singing contest in prison, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Chinese prisons follow humanitarian
rules. According to the law, prisoners suffering from serious
ailments who meet the requirements are eligible for being freed on
bail for medical treatment. An average of 25,000 prisoners have
been released on probation for medical treatment every year in
China, according to the vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
Wang was sentenced to 11 years and deprived of political rights
for two years by the Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court for
plotting to subvert the government.

inspections this year to standardize the work of certified public
accountants.
</P>
<P>
A circular by the Chinese Institute of Certified Public

<HEADLINE> ABC Sees Sustained Growth of Banking Service in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC), a former state bank mainly for the country's agricultural
sector and farmers, has witnessed a stable growth of its branches
in Shanghai over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
ABC is now one of the four major commercial banks in China. An
ABC official said it is quite challenging for the bank to compete
with other large commercial banks in cities.
</P>
<P>
After years of effort, banking services for urban industrial
projects and international businesses combined have accounted for
two thirds of the bank's total in Shanghai, said Yan Qifen,
director of ABC's Shanghai branch.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the bank has granted loans totalling 244.71 billion
yuan to industrial projects, he said, adding that ABC has been
actively involved in the construction of most infrastructural
projects and key industrial projects in Shanghai over the past
years.
</P>
<P>
The bank has so far established 31 sub-branches and 331 banking
offices under its local branch in Shanghai, the country's largest
city, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also been very successful in the Pudong New Area,
an emerging financial and trade zone separated from downtown
Shanghai by the Huangpu River, he said.
</P>
<P>
It set up a branch in Pudong in August of 1990, and has so far
issued a total of 60 billion yuan in loans to local projects in
the past six years.
</P>
<P>
"Statistics show that ABC has been playing a leading role in
the Pudong New Area over its counterparts in banking businesses,"
Yan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bank will take measures to maintain its growth
of businesses in Shanghai this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China is going to build its
first diamond trading center in the Pudong District in Shanghai,
the country's largest city.
</P>
<P>
The construction work will be undertaken jointly by the
Lujiazui Finance And Trade Zone Development Company from Shanghai
and United Development Incorporated from Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have recently signed an agreement to invest 66
million US dollars for the trading center which will cover a total
area of 35,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the establishment of the Shanghai diamond
trading center will promote China's diamond exchanges and diamond
jewelry manufacturing trade.
</P>
<P>
The world's diamond trading volume stands around 60 billion US
dollars every year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Students Learning About Traffic Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 500,000 primary and middle
schools across the country will soon be issued two million sets of
illustrations on traffic rules to help teach students more about
road safety.
</P>
<P>
Today is the second "Safety Day" for China's more than 200
million primary and middle school students. The illustrations are
being provided by the State Education Commission (SEC) and the
Ministry of Public Security (MPS).
</P>
<P>
The illustrations contain colorful cartoon figures and captions
to teach students how to ride a bicycle and cross the road in a
safe manner and not to read while walking.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bin, vice-minister in charge of the SEC, said that rural
schools are weak in safety education and asked local education
agencies to pay more attention to safety in rural schools,
especially primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Liu is encouraging students to wear yellow hats and to exit
their schools in single file so that the large bright group will
be more obvious to drivers.
</P>
<P>
He has also called on primary and middle schools to organize
fire, earthquake, and flood drills to teach students how to save
each other in emergencies.
</P>
<P>
Seven ministries and commissions including the SEC, the MPS,
the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways
jointly decided last year that the last Monday of March each year
would be "Safety Day" for primary and middle school students.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Li Lanqing spoke on national TV urging all of
society to pay attention to child safety.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, among primary and middle school
students, nearly one in ten thousand is killed annually by
accidents in China, and 4,000 to 5,000 students die in traffic
accidents each year.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Vice-minister Mu Xinsheng said today that the
MPS has asked traffic policemen to watch traffic near school gates
while students are going to or from school.

<HEADLINE> Unleaded Gasoline Used to Reduce Air Pollution in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Tehran, one of the worst air
polluted capital cities in the world, has started distribution of
unleaded gasoline at 44 petrol stations in a bid to reduce
pollution, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Jumhuri Islami reported that the move of the
petrol stations is organized by the Oil Ministry-affiliated
National Refining and Distribution Company.
</P>
<P>
The company said that drivers have easy access to unleaded
petrol over the city and the measure would help to reduce air
pollution as well as contribute to automobile's engine efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Iran is presently producing 4 million liters of unleaded
gasoline a day at Arak refinery in central Iran.
</P>
<P>
The production is anticipated to increase by threefolds or
12 million liters a day upon completion of the Bandar Abbas
refinery in the south this year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The switch from leaded gasoline to unleaded gasoline is
part of the nationwide drive to fight against air pollution in
the country, Tehran in particular.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that Tehran is facing serious air pollution
with two tonnes of lead entering the air every day. About 80 percent
of the air pollution was caused by cars.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the poisonous gas released by automobiles in
the city will cause various disease related with liver, kidney,
spleen, brain, bones and muscles.
</P>
<P>
With a population of about 10 million, there are some three
million cars in the city. The percentage of poisonous gas in the
air of Tehran city is as some six times as the permitted figure.
</P>
<P>
During the past years, the Iranian government has also taken
some specific measures to reduce air pollution in the city, such
as changing the city's gasoline-engine taxis and buses into
gas-engine cars.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Citizens in Guangzhou, capital
of south China's Guangdong Province, are spending more on
household appliances and clothing, and those with higher incomes
have shifted their shopping sights from food to
telecommunications, education and travel.
</P>
<P>
The average living expenses for urban dwellers reached 9,379
yuan (about 1,117 US dollars) last year, an increase of 9.7
percent over 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the local statistics bureau, in 1996, the rise in
the urban dwellers' spending on durable consumer goods and
clothing well-exceeded that on their spending on food.
</P>
<P>
Air conditioners, motorcycles and home video-audio
entertainment systems are becoming the new favorites for families,
replacing color TVs, refrigerators and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1996, on average every 100 families in the city
have 79 air conditioners, 14 motorcycles and 49 stereo systems, up
37.2, 13.2 and 19.7 percent from the previous year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
In this most developed southern city, both men and women now
want to dress well, as evidenced by the 15.5. percent increase in
spending on clothing last year.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications, education and tourism are also luring
more and more money from residents' pockets. By the end of
1996, there were 84 telephones for every 100 families -- who are
now setting their sights on mobile telephones -- while multi-media
computers are making a speedy entrance into ordinary households.
</P>
<P>
Last year, residents' spending on food rose by only 6.9
percent, while that on main food items and cooking oil
fell. Spending on rice and peanut oil dropped by 5.9 and 7.1
percent, respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States has set up a
high-tech monitoring station at Fort Portal town in western
Uganda to keep track of the war in Zaire, The East African
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper quoted sources close to the Ugandan Army
commander in Kampala as saying that the station would enable the
U.S. Military to respond quickly to protect American interests in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The sources stated that the U.S. army was setting up two other
monitoring bases in Brazzaville, Congo, and Kigali, Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses in Fort Portal told the paper that at least four
U.S. Marines are manning the station, which is about two
kilometers from the city center.
</P>
<P>
The Marines which rented two houses and paid 1,500 U.S.
Dollars per month have been in Fort Portal for three months but
have kept a low profile.
</P>
<P>
Two satellite dishes can be seen in the compound and a man
with an AK-47 who is wearing a grey uniform guards the house, the
paper noted.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Army Commander's office of Uganda told the
regional paper that "the Americans regularly brief us on their
monitoring."
</P>
<P>
The Kinshasa government has repeatedly accused both the United
States and Uganda of supporting Banyamulenge rebels now fighting
the government of President Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government denied the accusations, saying that the
only support it gives the rebels is moral.
</P>
<P>
The weekly quoted the Ugandan Military Intelligence sources as
saying that Uganda is suspected by France of being used by
America to promote "Anglophonism" and reduce French influence in
the Great Lakes region.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Ninety percent of Zambia's
sewerage treatment facilities are defective leading to pollution
of most rivers and streams in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to an annual economic report from the Finance
Ministry, the defective city sewerage treatment facilities and
lack of in-house effluent treatment facilities in most industries
lead to discharge of untreated effluents into the rivers and
streams.
</P>
<P>
It cited the Kafue and Kafubu as the two most polluted rivers

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- An unknown number of heavily
armed Zairean government soldiers have been spotted at a fishing
camp along the border near Mwense in Zambia's Luapula Province,
local press reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean soldiers, armed with rifles and grenades, have
grouped at the Manandwe fishing camp and it is not clear where
they are heading, Luapula Permanent Secretary Maybin Mubanga said
on Sunday in Mansa, provincial capital of Luapula.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government officials have rushed to the spot to assess
the situation.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted other sources as saying that the Zairean
soldiers hope to surrender to the advancing rebel forces but it
is unclear whether they intend to do that on Zambian soil.
</P>
<P>
Mubanga said over 1,000 refugees from Kasenga town in Zaire
have entered Zambia following the capture of Kasenga by rebel
forces last Friday. The mass exodus was triggered by reports that
the Zairean army want to launch a major counter offensive to try
to recapture Kasenga.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a crisis at Kashiba primary school where the
refugees are kept because the Zambian authorities do not have
food for them.
</P>
<P>
Fighting continued in Zaire between government troops and
rebel forces though the two sides agreed to negotiate a peaceful
solution at a special summit of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) recently held in Lome, capital of Togo.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province has launched a program to control price rises of consumer
goods, according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Thirty kinds of commodities and service fees, which account for
80 percent of urban citizens' living expenses, were put under
close supervision and control, according to Li Yunlong, director
of the Provincial Bureau of Commodity Prices.
</P>
<P>
The commodities and services include grain, vegetables,
pork, medicines, fuels, electricity, water, chemical fertilizer,
and education charges, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The province has promised to keep the rise in the retail price
index below six percent, and that in the consumer goods price
index below eight percent in 1997, he said..
</P>
<P>
Illicit collections of fees and illicit price hikes will be
banned, he said, adding that the government will curb price
increases and bring down the price level by applying regulating
funds, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Inflation is dropping to normal through coordinated efforts,
but pressure from price increases is still strong and has a great
effect on people's lives, especially those who have low incomes
and displaced workers in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A major heavy industrial production center in China,
Heilongjiang has a large number of state-owned enterprises, many
of which are operating at a loss.
</P>
<P>
The province is now taking legal and economic measures to
maintain basic price stability for its 36 million

SHIJIAZHUANG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The government of Hebei
province, in north China, has worked out concrete measures to
restrict duplicated production.
</P>
<P>
The province is to control the construction of similar projects

many manufactured similar products. Its textile mills have 3.7
million spindles, far exceeding the demand.

unsophisticated equipment and produce heavy pollution have been
developing at a rapid rate in recent years.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan province
has set standards on seeds to help protect farmers' interests.
</P>
<P>
The name, site and date of production, quality, planting
instructions and suitable uses of each variety of seed should be
clearly written on all seed packages, according to a local
regulation to go into effect on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Seed packets that do not bear the information will be
considered sub-standard, the regulation pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hunan, as a major grain producer in the country, has reported
several cases of fake or poor-quality seeds.
</P>
<P>
The local government attributed this partly to the lack of a
well-defined standard.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will help improve management of seed production
and guide farmers choose quality seeds, said the local government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the province worked out standards for asparagus,
which is used as a raw material in paper production.
</P>
<P>
Hunan now has 660,000 ha of land planted with asparagus, with
annual output of 700,000 tons.

ZHENZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has now replaced southwestern Sichuan Province as the most

</P>
<P>
Sichuan can no longer claim in its head count of the people who

directly under the central government.
</P>
<P>
In order to keep in step with local economic development, Henan
will continue its population control efforts by pursing the "one
child per couple" policy.

The natural population growth rate in Henan last year reached
7.84 per thousand -- an addition of about 700,000 people.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the number of couples in which the wife is
aged 23 or above, and the husband is 25 or older, has accounted
for nearly 51 percent of the local total, a substantial increase
from the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
And 88.15 percent of babies born last year were within the
set quota for births, up 23.5 percent from 1991.
</P>
<P>
Promotion of the family-planning policy and the extensive use
of birth control information have helped the province check the
momentum of the local population growth.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of women of child-bearing age in the province
are taking contraceptives to control the number of births. The
practice of marrying and giving birth at an older age has been now
accepted by more local people. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Thirty four persons were sentenced
to death for heinous crimes in March, bringing to 349 the total
number of death row inmates in the Philippines, Philippine News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Senator Ernesto Herrera, an anti-crime

rapists and one was found guilty of robbery with homicide.
</P>
<P>
He said that among all the death row inmates, there are now a

daughters or children under 12 years of age.
</P>
<P>
To fight against heinous crimes which became serious in the
country during the recent years, the Philippines re-adopted
capital punishment in 1994. However, the first convict will not be
lethally injected to death until May this year.

<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Almost 100 rape cases were
reported throughout Zimbabwe last week, The Herald daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Seventy people were arrested in connection with these
dehumanizing offenses, police statistics for the period show.
</P>
<P>
Officer-in-charge police press and public relation inspector
Mario Dube said the increase in reported cases should not be
regarded as an upsurge in the crime but as an ''increase in the
detection rate''.
</P>
<P>
Dube said, ''this has been due to awareness campaigns on the
need to report such cases. A lot of rape cases in the past went
unreported. In this way, the perpetrators escaped unpunished.''
</P>
<P>
He urged members of the public to report all rape cases to the
police to punish the perpetrators.

<HEADLINE> Rural Surplus Labor Forces Getting Prosperous in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Rural surplus labor forces in
northwest China's Gansu Province have stepped out of poverty to
contribute to local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half its four million rural surplus laborers go out of
mountains and produce annually 1.6 billion yuan in other provinces
and regions. They buy their families farm machines, improved
seeds, chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and plastic sheets. They
also apply new concepts, skills, and savings to establishing
economic entities back in their hometown. This has greatly
promoted local agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Migrant farmers attribute their good fortune to labor
management offices at all levels. The province initiated the
orderly migration of rural surplus labor forces in 1986, and set
up labor management agencies in Shanghai, Beijing, Xinjiang,
Guangxi, and some other localities.
</P>
<P>
The offices are engaged in employment registration, information
consultation, job recommendation, and market investigation, while
the agencies are busy collecting information and opening up labor
markets. Now the province has established more than 8,000 labor
bases across the country, and joined north China labor force
information network.
</P>
<P>
To ensure an orderly exodus, the province makes it a rule that
migrant farmers get employment registration cards, which help in
finding jobs. In 18 pilot counties, 40 percent of migrant farmers
got the cards last year, and in the capital city of Lanzhou, the
figure exceeded 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province is making efforts to improve labor force's
quality, by training them in employment centers, agro-science
schools, or vocational schools, to better meet market demands.

<P>
URUMQI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Qi Xinghai, a 56-year-old man of
Xibo ethnic group, handles a number of border trade issues every
day, talking to Kazak, Russian, or inland Chinese businessmen
passing in and out of his office, located near the wire fences
along the border between the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
the villages of Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
Qi, deputy director of the Horgas Port Administrative Committee
of the region, speaks five languages and has become an expert in
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
"We Xibo people once looked down upon businessmen. But now we
do business ourselves, as the reform and opening drive offers us
good opportunities to develop in an all-round way," he says.
</P>
<P>
The Xibos were confined to border areas in the past and could
not live a normal life. But now they enjoy equal rights as other
ethnic groups in China, and are doing well in the market economy.
</P>
<P>
China's western borders have been frequented by traders and
tourists, since military confrontations there with the former
Soviet Union began to relax in the late 1980s. The Xibo people,
accustomed to defending the border areas, embrace the reform
policy with unprecedented open-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
In the 17th century, the Qing Dynasty (1616-1911) reorganized
all the Xibo people into military troops and stationed them along
border areas. Some 4,000 of them made a three-year journey to
Xinjiang and resettled there, charged with opening up wasteland
and guarding the border.
</P>
<P>
The Xibos now have a population of more than 90,000, mainly
distributed over Xinjiang, and northeast China, their
homeland. The group in Xinjiang now numbers over 20,000 people,
mostly living in the Qapqal Xibo Autonomous County. They have
their own spoken and written language, and publish a newspaper
that is said to be the only one of the kind in the world. The
publication, with 1,000 subscriptions, is mainly financed by the
local government
</P>
<P>
Qapqal means granary in the Xibo language. The county has
become a major grain production base since the central government
allowed more freedom for farmland management in the early 1980s.
The Xibo people, expert in farming, are engaged in reclaiming
wasteland, but for quite a different purpose than their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jianxin, 35, a returned student from Japan, is proud of
being a farmer with more than one million yuan worth of fixed
assets. He opened up 200 ha of wasteland two years ago on a loan
of 800,000 yuan. "I like this piece of land and the crops, and I
like to stay at home with my wife and children," he says.

YINCHUAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-German cooperation

</P>
<P>
Kang said that Ningxia has planted 917 ha of trees, which is 11
percent of the planned workload.
</P>
<P>
The project also includes building fences around mountains that
have well-grown trees and constructing water conservation
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Germany has such aid projects in Beijing, Hebei, Shanxi and
five other provinces in China.

Long-term military services have forged in the Xibos a unique
character. They are patriotic, disciplined, family oriented, and
easy-going in getting along with other ethnic groups. China's
autonomy policy has made it possible for them to preserve and
carry on their fine traditions, while the improved economic
situation is pushing them onto a turn for the better.
</P>
<P>
Yong Deguang, a deputy to the National People's Congress, has
submitted 60 proposals over the past four years. "All my proposals
have been dealt with satisfactorily and in particular, our culture
and education are given priority in development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Xibo nationality ranks first for its
biggest percentage of graduate students among China's 56
nationalities. And its living standards are among the best,
according to the UN measurements. The Xibos have an increasing
number of its own scholars with master or doctor degrees, and
those who go and study abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Xibos are really living a happy life today. Bleating of red
deer can be heard occasionally in many cottage courtyards in
Qapqal. Some farmers rely heavily on raising deer. Wu Lingbao is
one of them. The Xibo villager began to breed deer seven years ago
and four years later he set up a deer product processing
factory. Now he becomes a salesman, travelling extensively at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
When asked about their annual income, the hostess Guihua smiled
but said nothing, as a 1.5-metre-high safe and a hand phone beside
in their well-decorated parlour spoke for her. She adopted five
Xibo orphans and a Han child.
</P>
<P>
Her husband says: "success lies mainly in a pioneering spirit
in the market economy. It's out-of-date to live an ordinary life
only by cultivating a small piece of land like our forefathers."
</P>
<P>
Red deer was the Xibo's shooting targets 50 years ago. But now
they show their archery skills at stadia. Qapqal is the cradle of
China's archery, boasting the only county-level shooting gymnasium
in the country. It has trained a number of Xibo athletes, winning
46 national and world championships over the past 20 years.

The Xibo nationality is experiencing its second leap in
development these years. "The founding of new China in 1949
ensured us extensive political rights, first-ever in our
history. The reform and opening policy has allowed us more room
for economic improvement, and now the emancipated productivity is
boosting a fundamental change in our Xibo people," says Ban Jisu,
deputy director of the Xinjiang Nationalities and Religious
Affairs Commission, and a 60-year-old nationalities expert, who is
of great celebrity among his own people.
</P>
<P>
Ban studied in Beijing in the '50s. He is proud of his
experience. "Beijing was the noble and mysterious capital of the
country in my parents' eyes, only our Xibo military commanders had
ever been there down the ages," he says.
</P>
<P>
He has an amicable family and one of his sons-in-law is a
Han. In Xinjiang, it's not unusual for the Xibo people to marry
people of other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The Xibos, known as an "interpreter nationality", are quick at
languages, as they are closely associated with other
nationalities. Primary students are taught in the Xibo language
and standard Chinese, and foreign languages are added in secondary
education. Most of the graduate students know three to four
languages. "This is a breakthrough in China's educational history
and meets the need to train internationally competitive
personnel," says Ban, who is a staunch advocate of the teaching
method.
</P>
<P>
Guli is a 26-year-old Xibo girl. His father married a Uygur
wife. So she knows two languages inherently and picks up Chinese,
Russian and Kazak. Now she finds herself indispensable, working as
an interpreter at the Horgas Port. "I want to go abroad and learn
more languages," she says. enditem

<HEADLINE> Layout of Largest Imperial Palace Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Ministers and foreign guests to be
received by emperors of the Tang Dynasty (618-907) had to climb
70-m-long staircases leading up to each end of the Hanyuan Hall on
a ten-m-high platform.
</P>
<P>
The two cases, called Longwei Dao (Road of the Dragon Tail),
turned toward each other to join together right in front of the
hall.
</P>
<P>
This layout was discovered as a result of recent excavations at
the site of Hanyuan Hall. Previously, it was thought that the road
led directly to the hall.
</P>
<P>
Located one km to the north of the present-day Xi'an Railway
Station in this capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, the
hall was built in 663, where emperors received officials of the
imperial court and foreign guests, issued imperial verdicts,
granted honors, and reviewed troops.
</P>
<P>
It was ruined with the entire imperial palace complex, Daming
Gong, in the peasant war at the end of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Historical documents have shown that the hall was the largest
imperial palace in China, 300 sq m larger than the major hall in
the prestigious Palace Museum in Beijing where emperors of the
Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties worked.
</P>
<P>
Resting on a ten-m-high platform, the foundation of the Hanyuan
Hall measuring 74.9 m by 41.3 m was found with the remains of
twenty pillar bases in two rows.
</P>
<P>
Two corridors each with a length of 40 m were built at each
side of the hall. The ends of the corridors stretched out to make
the whole structure look like a short "H", with the hall in the
middle of the horizontal line.
</P>
<P>
Remains of watch towers were found at each of the four ends of
the two vertical lines of the "H".
</P>
<P>
Conservation of the hall, backed up by the United Nations
Education, Science, and Culture Organization (UNESCO), has drawn
an aid of one million U.S. Dollars from the Japanese
government.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) would like to increase its financial assistance to Nepal in
the future with top priority on agriculture and poverty
alleviation, according to a senior bank official.
</P>
<P>
ADB Vice-President Bong Suk Lee, who is currently here on a
five-day visit to Nepal, said that the bank's programs in Nepal
for 1997 have given priority to the agricultural sector followed
by poverty alleviation in rural areas, official daily the Rising

million US dollars last year with 27 on-going projects and the
bank would like to see the amount of assistance growing over the
coming years.
</P>
<P>
The ADB vice-president met with Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand Sunday to exchange views regarding the bank's

alleviation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the ADB is seriously considering the issue of
financing a major water supply project in Kathmandu as the Nepali
government is very interested in its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali government planned to implement the 185
million-dollar water diversion project, which will bring water to
Kathmandu from a river 30 km away, to solve the problem of water
shortage in the capital.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LAHSA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The central government in China has
allocated more than 20 billion yuan (about 2.4 billion US dollars)
for the sustained and healthy economic development of the Tibet
Autonomous Region since the reform and opening drive was launched
nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The region's GDP reached 6.5 billion yuan last year, with its
annual economic growth rate maintaining ten percent for two years
running.
</P>
<P>
With huge financial support and preferential policies from the
central government, Tibet has made distinct improvement in its
infrastructure construction, especially in the fields of energy,
communications, and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The construction of large power plants, including the
Yangbajing Geothermal Power Plant, located in the largest
geothermal power test base in China, the Chalong Power Plant, and
a group of county-level power plants, has increased the region's
power generating capacity from 60,000 kilowatts in 1990 to the
current 200,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the two airports in Lhasa, capital of the
autonomous region, the reconstruction of highways linking Tibet to
Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan, and the country of Nepal, and the
laying of fiber optical cables connecting Lhasa with Nyingchi and
Xigaze, have given the region full access to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The Tibet Autonomous Region's economy formerly relied solely on
agriculture and animal breeding, and was marked by a low level of
productivity.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the central government implemented the household
responsibilty system for both farmers and hurdsmen in the region,
and preferential treatments such as tax reduction and low-interest
loans have been granted to them.

hit 960 yuan, and 120,000 farmers have been lifted out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises in the fields of electric power,
building materials, textiles, and forestry have improved their
returns, showing new momentum in industrial growth. The total
industrial output rose from 160 million yuan in the early 1980s to
668 million yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
A group of new industrial products have put onto the market,
and the region also has had a number of new industrial sectors
such as foreign trade, tourism, township enterprises, and
mining. The total value of import and export hit 116 million US
dollars last year, a six-fold increase over that of 1980, and the
region received 32,000 tourists last year, scoring a business
income of 238 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the country has strengthened its efforts to assist
the region. As many as 3.7 billion yuan were allocated for the
area in 1994, with 62 projects and a large number of technicians
coming in.
</P>
<P>
The region has opened wider to the outside world, drawing more
than 300 million yuan of investment last year, and it is more and
more capable of supporting itself financially.

<HEADLINE> No Quick End to Hostage Crisis in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
today said he could not foresee a quick end to the 103-day hostage
crisis though negotiations on it at the Japanese ambassador's
residence in Lima have progressed.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, we are hopeful that it will be the soonest
possible, but we do not glimpse a date", said Fujimori in an
interview with local TV Frecuencia Latina.
</P>
<P>
Recent speculations say that face-to-face talks between the
government and Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels
expected on Monday or Tuesday would lead to a break in Latin
America's longest hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said a three-man guarantors commission mediating in
the crisis would continue "preparing the ground" for a
face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
There have been no direct talks between the two sides since
March 12.
</P>
<P>
MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa repeated last Saturday that the MRTA
sticks to the demand its 440 or so jailed comrades be freed.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't foresee a peaceful solution soon. The
positions are still not really drawing close," said Cerpa, who
denied speculation that the MRTA had opened the way for a deal by
accepting a Cuban offer of political asylum.
</P>
<P>
However, Fujimori reiterated his refusal to free jailed MRTA
members, saying that "the framework we are in ... is to not accept
the release of any prisoner."
</P>
<P>
But the president pointed out that a special committee would
continue to study pardons for Peruvians unjustly jailed on
terrorism or treason charges for alleged ties to Peru's two
leftist rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
Recommendations by a special panel formed before the MRTA
stormed the Japanese residence on December 17 last year led to
about 100 pardons.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said the committee would recommend more pardons but he
insisted the hostage crisis have nothing to do with the liberation
of those unjustly condemned.
</P>
<P>
The 72 hostages, including the ambassadors of Japan and
Bolivia, Fujimori's brother Pedro, two cabinet ministers, military
officers and Japanese businessmen and diplomats, Sunday reportedly
held a mass and got chocolate Easter eggs and fresh fruit with
their usual daily supply of meals and refreshments.
</P>
<P>
They also received a visit by the guarantors commission formed
by Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani, Canadian Ambassador Anthony
Vincent and Red Cross representative Michel Minnig. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Shabby Villages Turn Into Urban Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Two-decades of economic reform in
China have turned numerous small rural villages into thriving new
urban centers.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, a family clan with several generations lived in
the same village which was named after the family such as Wang's
village or Zhang's village. Head of the family clan had the final
say for everything in the village.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Anhui province, Wang's village, which was still
a dilapidated place in the early 1970s, has now become an urban
center with crisscross traffic, program-controlled telephone
networks, and foreign-funded factories. Its population has swollen
from several hundred to the present 14,000.
</P>
<P>
The village has established trade ties with all parts of China
since it became the largest peanut market in the country.
</P>
<P>
Wang is no longer the dominant clan in the village where
outsiders have come to settle.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 other villages in Anhui have developed into new
urban centers since 1978. Last year, the provincial government
invested 18 billion yuan in the development of satellite towns.
</P>
<P>
Similar experiences were reported in many other provinces in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Huaxi Village in east China's Jiangsu Province yields an
industrial output value of two billion yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
Daqiu village in rural Tianjin, north China, has turned itself
from an impoverished place into an economic rising star in the
country with its gross annual industrial and agricultural output
topping 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Longgang, China's first Peasant Town, is built on a fishing
village in Zhejiang. Its revenue from industrial production in
1996 made up 40 percent of the total industrial output of its
county.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 new towns have emerged in the Pearl River Delta, a
fast-growing area in southern China. The industrial output value
of some towns exceeded three billion yuan a year each.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics have shown that 50,000 new towns have been
built on the foundations of former villages across China since
1978. They have absorbed a great number of surplus rural laborers.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese sociologist attributed the explosion of new towns to
China's rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The national effort to promote the integration of urban-rural
development has accelerated the economic and social development in
rural China which, in turn, has sped up the urban-rural
integration, he said.

<HEADLINE> Jail Explosion Kills One Prisoner in Columbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- An inmate was killed
in a bomb blast in a high-security jail the capital of Columbia, a
prison spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred late on Saturday in a cell close to the
wing of the La Picota jail where the Cali drug cartel bosses, the
Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, are locked up.
</P>
<P>
The killed man was William Infante, 33, who was handling the
bomb, was a contract killer serving a 24-year term for the murder
of the leader of the left-wing Patriotic Union (UP) party in 1987,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Luis Rodriguez Cuadrado, who was convicted of an assassination
attempt on one of President Ernesto Samper's attorneys, was
seriously injured in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said, "There was an incident in which a prisoner
was handling explosives. We do not yet know exactly what type of
explosive it was." He said it was not yet clear how Infante had
obtained the bomb.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said investigators had ruled out the possibility
that Infante may have died in a bungled escape bid and said there
was no suggestion that the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, the jail's
star convicts, were in any way involved.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper, Infante murdered UP leader Jaime
Pardo Leal on the orders of the late drug trafficker Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, a trusted follower of cocaine kingpin Pablo
Escobar, the late head of the Medellin cartel.

Two. Citizens' Democratic Rights
</P>
<P>
While developing its economy, China has made energetic efforts
to promote the building of a socialist democratic and political
system, consolidated and perfected the people's congress system
and the system of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,
and improved democracy at grass-roots units, thus further
guaranteeing citizens' democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
The people's congress system serves as China's fundamental
political system. The National People's Congress (NPC), the
supreme state power organ, decides fundamental state policies and
principles, and formulates basic national laws.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the NPC heard and deliberated the work reports of the
State Council, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's
Procuratorate; and examined and approved the Ninth Five-Year Plan
for National Economic and Social Development and the Outline for
the Long-Range Objective Through the Year 2010. It also
deliberated and adopted 20 laws and decisions concerning legal
issues, and strengthened legal protection of citizens' rights.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the NPC has tightened inspection of and
supervision over law enforcement. To date, the Eighth NPC Standing
Committee has inspected the enforcement of 17 laws.
</P>
<P>
Various special NPC committees have examined the implementation
of 13 laws. In 1996, led by eight vice-chairmen of the NPC
Standing Committee, 21 law-enforcement inspection groups were
organized to tour the country to supervise and inspect the
enforcement of laws, including the Agriculture Law, the Education
Law, the Environmental Protection Law, the Labor Law and the
Decision on Strengthening Comprehensive Management of Social
Security, thus playing a supervisory role in implementing relevant
laws.
</P>
<P>
The NPC pays close attention to safeguarding the rights of its
deputies, and earnestly and promptly handles proposals and
suggestions made by its deputies. During the Fifth Session of the
Eighth NPC held in 1997, 700 motions proposed by the deputies were
received, 140 of which were submitted to relevant special
committees for examination in accordance with the decision of the
session's presidium.
</P>
<P>
The Other 560 motions and the 1,289 proposals and suggestions
made by the deputies were submitted to relevant departments and
units, which are responsible for replying to the deputies.

<P>
The system of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation led by the Chinese Communist Party is an important
component of China's democratic and political system. Various
non-Communist parties and Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) organizations are playing an increasingly
important role in political consultation, democratic supervision
and the participation in and deliberation of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
From the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee, which was held in 1989, to the end of 1996, the
Party Central Committee conducted more than 100 consultative
activities of various forms on various fundamental state policies
and principles, on the candidates for state leaders, and on
various important policy decisions, laws and regulations with the
central committees of various non-Communist parties, the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce and personages without party
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 41 investigation reports or proposals were made by the
CPPCC National Committee on implementing the fundamental policies
and principles for the Ninth Five-Year Plan, reducing farmers'
financial burdens, developing animal husbandry on grasslands,
reforming public health undertakings, and promoting ethical and
cultural progress and the building of democracy and a legal system.
</P>
<P>
The reports and proposals were adopted either by the Party
Central Committee or the State Council in formulating relevant
policies and regulations. Meanwhile, the CPPCC National Committee
took effective steps to do a better job of putting forward
proposals and actively reflect social conditions and popular
feelings.
</P>
<P>
Members of the CPPCC National Committee have actively aired
views and offered advices, and increased the number of their
proposals year by year, from 1,900 during the First Session of the
Eighth CPPCC National Committee to 2,426 during the Committee's
Fifth Session. Within this period, more than 10,000 proposals were
put forth.
</P>
<P>
During the Fourth Session of the Eighth CPPCC National
Committee, members put forward 2,380 proposals. By February
14, 1997, 2,334 proposals had been handled, or 98.1 percent of the
total. Of those handled, 1,937 proposals, or 83 percent of the
total, have been solved or will be solved according to plan.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the problems that cannot be solved promptly
because of constraints, various executive units have offered
explanations.
</P>
<P>
China has made vigorous efforts to promote the building of
democracy in grass-roots units in urban and rural areas to
guarantee the democratic rights of the residents there. In rural
areas, efforts have been made to continue to conduct rural
grass-roots mass self-management activities that focus on
villagers' democratic elections, democratic policy-making,
democratic management and democratic supervision.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, rural villagers' committees in most provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central
government carried out a new round of elections by adopting the
method by which villagers could directly cast votes to elect the
committees.
</P>
<P>
Many places adopted the method by which every eligible voter in
villages has the right to nominate candidates, and the villagers'
congresses or representatives of villagers select formal
candidates by secret ballot and through preliminary elections.
</P>
<P>
Candidates must run for elections. Voters will mark their
ballots in specially-designated rooms.
</P>
<P>
Villagers' committees regularly or periodically make public the
affairs of the village to the villagers.
</P>
<P>
For example, by the end of 1996 in Hebei Province, 50,191 of
the 50,430 villages throughout the province had made public
village affairs in various forms and to varying extent, including
six items such as financial expenditures at the village level,
grain purchased by the state and the accumulation and retention of
common funds by the collective, the granting of plots for housing
construction, electricity rates and charges, family planning and
objectives of village cadres during their terms.
</P>
<P>
Publicizing village affairs has increased the rights of
villagers to exercise democratic management of and democratic
supervision over villagers affairs.
</P>
<P>
In cities, urban neighborhood committees and their subsidiary
organizations continued to be set up and perfected. More than 98
percent of the residential areas all over the country have
established neighborhood committees in accordance with legal
procedures.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the overwhelming majority of neighborhood committees
carried out, according to law, elections of new committees by
adopting the method of directly casting votes by residents.
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood committees have further perfected the residents'
meeting system. Important affairs concerning the residential areas
are decided by residents' meetings. A sample survey of 127 cities
shows that on average, every neighborhood committee holds at least
ten residents' meetings a year.
</P>
<P>
The building of democracy at grassroots levels serves as an
important reflection of democracy enjoyed by the Chinese
people. All the overseas people who have no prejudice but have a
good understanding of China's actual situation have fully
acknowledged the building of democracy at grassroots levels in
China.

Three. Judicial Guarantee for Human Rights
</P>
<P>
During the past year and more, China has revised its Criminal
Law and Criminal Procedure Law, promulgated and enforced new laws
such as the Lawyer Law and the Law on Administrative Punishment,
and taken many other measures to strengthen the judicial guarantee
for human rights.
</P>
<P>
China has cracked down on serious criminal offences in
accordance with law, and earnestly guaranteed the people's human
rights and safety of lives and property. In 1996, public security
and judicial departments launched, according to law, a severe
nationawide crackdown on criminal offences seriously endangering
public security, such as homicides, robberies, rape, kidnapping
and blackmail, and major theft, with emphasis placed on crimes
involving the use of guns, crimes with gangster connections and
characteristics, and crimes committed by rogues and vicious
social forces.
</P>
<P>
These criminal activities have endangered public security,
gravely infringed on the citizens' personal safety, lives and
property, and are abhored by the people across the country.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with law, public security and judicial
departments have punished a number of criminals guilty of the most
heinous crimes. Statistics show that in 1996, courts throughout
the country sentenced 322,382 criminal offenders who had seriously
endangered public security by committing crimes of violence,
crimes involving the use of guns, and gang-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The severe crackdown on crimes has safeguarded social stability
and the human rights of the people all over the country, and won
the heartfelt support of the general public.

<TEXT>
<P>
In March of 1997, the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress made amendments to the Criminal Law enacted in
1979. The amended Criminal Law has 452 articles, an increase of
260 over the previous 192 articles.
</P>
<P>
The amended Criminal Law has further defined three basic
principles, namely, "conviction and penalty according to law,"
"equality of everyone before the law," and "punishment
commensurate with the crime."
</P>
<P>
It stipulates: "there should be no conviction or penalty if
an act is not explicitly defined as a criminal act by the law,"
"all criminal offenders are equal in applying laws," and that
"the severity of penalty should be commensurate with the
offender's crime and due criminal liabilities."
</P>
<P>
These three principles have further improved China's principle
of rule of law, and are conducive to judicial fairness and to the
protection of the legitimate rights of the litigants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the amended Criminal Law has made explicit
stipulations in accordance with reality on some new crimes not
defined previously. For instance, the previous offence of indecent
activities has now been classified into four crimes, namely,
molestation of women, gang-bang, gang brawls, and provoking fights
and quarrels and making trouble, while new crimes including mafia
crimes, instigation of hatred among people of ethnic groups,
securities frauds, and endangerment of the interests of national
defense have been added into the law.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the "counter-revolutionary crime" has been revised
into "the crime of jeopardizing state security," while it is
stipulated that all those offences, which used to fall under the
category of "counter-revolutionary crime" but virtually have the
nature of ordinary crimes, should be punished as ordinary criminal
offences.
</P>
<P>
The amendment and enforcement of the Criminal Law have provided
a more powerful legal weapon for punishing crimes, safeguarding
national security, and protecting human rights of the people.

<P>
China has paid close attention to standardizing the practice of
administrative and law-enforcement departments, so as to protect
citizens' legitimate rights from any infringement.
</P>
<P>
Following the promulgation and enforcement of the
Administrative Procedure Law and the Law on State Compensation, in
March of 1996 China promulgated the Law on Administrative
Punishment, thus standardizing in terms of system the act of
administrative punishment by the governments.
</P>
<P>
The procuratorial bodies have attached great importance to the
investigation and handling of criminal cases involving leading
organs of the Party and the governments, administrative
law-enforcement departments, judicial departments, and economic
management departments.
</P>
<P>
Statistics reveal that in 1996, the procuratorial bodies put on
record and investigated 34,879 major criminal cases that involved
embezzlement, bribery and misappropriation of public funds, as
well as 4,864 major cases of malfeasance and infringement of
citizens' personal and democratic rights.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the protection of human rights in various links
of the public security and judicial work, China in 1996 made
significant revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law enacted in
1979, thus perfecting the criminal judicial procedure and adding
stipulations on protecting citizens' rights.
</P>
<P>
First, the amended Criminal Procedure Law has protected in a
more specific way innocent people from criminal penalties, by
stipulating that "no one should be convicted guilty before the
people's court passes a ruling according to law," and that the
people's court should pass a ruling of "not guilty" and should
decide that the charges are to be dropped if it doesn't have
sufficient evidence to convict the defendant.
</P>
<P>
Second, the law has abolished the system of detention for
interrogation as mandatory administrative measure, and further
standardized mandatory measures such as summons, summons for
detention and holding in custody.
</P>
<P>
It explicitly stipulates that "the longest time for summons and
summons for detention shall not exceed 12 hours," and that "it is
forbidden to take criminal suspects into custody in disguised
forms through continuous summons or summons for detention."
</P>
<P>
Third, the law has increased lawyers' involvement in the
criminal procedure with the stipulations that "after being
interrogated for the first time or from the date when the
investigative organs take any mandatory measures, criminal
suspects can hire lawyers as their legal consultants and
representatives of appeals and charges," and that "a criminal
suspect in a case of public charge has the right to entrust
defenders from the date when the case is transferred for
examination and prosecution."
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the law has intensified the guarantee for the rights of
the victims, by listing them as the litigants and granting them a
series of rights. These include a certain right of prosecution,
the right to ask for putting their cases on record and
supervision, the right to apply for a withdrawal and to entrust a
legal representative, and the right to plead for an objection to
the court's decision, as well as procedural rights during court
hearings.

<P>
Courts at various levels, focusing on studying the amended
Criminal Procedure Law and promoting the reform of court trial
procedures, have comprehensively reformed and improved the
country's trial system. They have intensified the functions of
court hearings, the duty and responsibilities of intercollegiate
benches and individual jurors in accordance with the law, and
strengthened the protection of legitimate rights and interests of
the people.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, procuratorial bodies have stepped up their
efforts to supervise law enforcement, especially to investigate
and punish a small number of public security and judiciary
personnel who abused power and did not act in accordance with
the law.
</P>
<P>
In the supervision over crime investigation, emphasis has been
placed on redressing the problems of refusing to register existing
cases or to investigate offenses, and of replacing punishments
with fines. In 1996, 15,565 rectification opinions were put forth
against the conduct of violating laws in investigating crimes.
</P>
<P>
In the supervision over criminal proceedings, 2,422 correction
opinions were put forth against the conduct of violating
laws. Procuratorial bodies also protested 2,405 court decisions
and rulings according to law, which they regarded as really wrong.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorial bodies have in their work paid close attention to
the protection of legitimate rights of criminal suspects,
defendants, other litigants and even criminals who are serving a
jail term, and to earnest investigation and punishment of such
crimes as forced confession and illegal custody committed by
judicial and law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorial bodies, in accordance with law, also changed 570
wrong decisions on arrest warrants, exemption from prosecution and
case withdrawal. They handled 379 cases of criminal compensation
according to law, concluded 110 of them, and decided to grant
compensation to the victims in 44 of the cases.
</P>
<P>
China's contingent of lawyers has grown rapidly, and has become
a major force in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests
of citizens. The Lawyers Law of the People's Republic of
China, adopted on May 15, 1996, explicitly stipulates that
"lawyers are professionals who, with a lawyer's license obtained
according to law, provide legal services to society."
</P>
<P>
It contains relevant provisions on the qualifications for
working lawyers, their business lines, rights, obligations and
other areas. The promulgation and implementation of the Lawyers
Law is of great significance to the safeguarding of lawyers'
legitimate rights and their operation according to law, protection
of the legitimate rights and interests of litigants and the
correct implementation of laws.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the number of employees in the lawyers
profession nationwide exceeded 100,000 in 1996, 12,000 or 12.6
percent more than in the previous year; and the number of lawyers'
offices reached 8,265, up 1,065 or 14.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, lawyers across the country served as consultants for
254,000 government institutions and enterprises, 8.7 percent more
than in the previous year; served in 251,000 criminal cases as
defending lawyers or agents ad litem, up 23.1 percent, the biggest
increase in recent years. They also handled 389,000 civil
lawsuits, an increase of 23.2 percent; more than 381,000 economic
lawsuits, up 17.2 percent; 23,000 administrative lawsuits, up 28.4
percent; 455,000 cases involving non-lawsuit legal matters, an
increase of 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with a relatively low crime rate. In 1996,
its crime rate dropped 5.4 percent from the previous year. The
number of major categories of crimes such as homicides, injuries
to human bodies, robberies and thefts all dropped from the
previous year.

Four. Protection of Workers' Rights
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to protection of workers'
rights. In the past the government has made new efforts to
safeguard the rights stipulated by China's Labor Law, such as
equal access for employment, salary, rest and vacations, work
safety and health protection, job training, social security and
welfare.
</P>
<P>
China now has 31,000 employment agencies, 2,716 job service
centers, and more than 2,000 unemployment insurance bodies. And
more than 200,000 labor service enterprises have been established
throughout the country, employing more than nine million
people. In 1996, about ten million people found jobs with the help
of employment agencies, and the unemployment rate in cities and
towns was around three percent.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the minimum wage standard for workers, the government
has in recent years issued the Regulations on Minimum Wages for
Enterprises, and a notice on implementing the system to ensure
minimum wages, which clearly stipulate the fixing and adjusting of
the minimum standards of wages, the payment of the wages, and the
legal liabilities for those who violate the regulations.
</P>
<P>
To date, all the provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities except Tibet have issued and implemented the lowest
standards for wages in their own areas, thus establishing, by and
large, a minimum wage guarantee system that complies with China's
actual conditions.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government has also promulgated the Provisional
Regulations on Wage Payment and a set of additional regulations to
ensure the workers to get their legitimate payment on time and in
full.
</P>
<P>
To protect workers' safety and health, China has issued the
Regulations Regarding the Implementation of the Mine Safety Law,
and the Regulations Regarding Management of Hidden Causes for
Accidents, and increased funding in the improvement of working
conditions. More than 20 million yuan has been invested each year
in upgrading enterprise labor protection techniques, and
in researching and developing new labor protection products.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the government has increased supervision and
management of labor safety by urging enterprises to continuously
improve work conditions to create a safe and hygienic work
environment for laborers.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the incidence of fatal accidents, especially
major and extraordinarily big accidents, has declined.

Five. Citizens' Rights to Receive Education
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Chinese citizens' educational level
has continued to rise. Statistics show that by 1996, there were
646,000 primary schools nationwide, with an enrollment of 136.15
million pupils, an increase of 11.2 percent over 1990; there were
80,000 middle schools with a total enrollment of 57.397 million, a
jump of 25.2 percent over 1990; there were 1,032 universities and
colleges, with a total of 3.021 million students, up 46.4 percent;
universities and colleges for adults numbered 1,138, with the
enrollment standing at 2.656 million, a leap of 59.5 percent; and
the number of secondary vocational schools in various forms at
various levels stood at 18,600, with 10.879 million students, an
increase of 66.7 percent. We may say that China has established
an educational system which can basically guarantee citizens'
rights to receive an education.
</P>
<P>
China has in place a set of legal systems to guarantee
citizens' rights to get an education. After the Education Law of
the People's Republic of China was promulgated in 1995, the Law
for Vocational Education of the People's Republic of China was
promulgated in May of 1996, stipulating that citizens have the
legal right to receive vocational education, thus further
perfecting the legal educational system. Based on this, the
government adopted various measures to ensure that the citizens
enjoy their right to get an education. According to figures from
the State Statistics Bureau, in 1995, there were 18.36 million
children between the ages of six and 14 who did not study in
schools, a decrease of 14.51 million compared with the number in
1990 when a census was taken. The rate of children in the 6-14 age
group who did not study in schools dropped from 18.62 percent in
1990 to 8.38 percent in 1995, a decrease of 10 percentage
points. Primary education is now universal in more than 90 percent
of China's populated area, and the enrollment rate for children at
primary school age is 98.81 percent. The rate of graduates of
primary schools entering junior middle schools is 92.62
percent. By 1995, the number of illiterates had dropped to 145
million, and the rate of adult illiterates had dipped to 16.48
percent. The rate of young and adult illiterates had dropped to
6.14 percent. In 1996, an additional four million young and adult
illiterates learned to read and write.

<P>
The Chinese government puts much emphasis on the development of
workers' job skills and on job training, and vigorously promoted
the development of senior secondary technical training schools. At
present, there are 4,467 secondary technical training schools
across the country, which admit more than 700,000 students each
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, social sectors have been fully mobilized to help
train personnel in various fields. In 1996, more than 1.1 million
people received training, including 18,000 ex-servicemen who were
trained for civil jobs, 169,000 pre-employment trainees, and
45,000 township enterprises employees.
</P>
<P>
The social security work is making constant progress. More than
87.5 million workers and 22.5 million retirees have participated
in pension insurance mutual assistance programs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a mechanism for regular adjustment of basic pensions
has been established nationwide, which has enabled the basic
pension of enterprise retirees to grow for two consecutive years
by 40 to 60 percent of the rate of the salary increase of local
enterprise employees in the previous year, thus helping ensure the
basic livelihood of enterprise retirees.
</P>
<P>
The government has also promulgated the Provisional Measures on
Insurance for Enterprise Employees Suffering from Industrial
Injuries to ensure that workers get due compensation if hurt in
the course of industrial production.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the implementation of various laws and regulations
that protect the legal rights and interests of workers, the
government has increased supervision over enforcement of labor
laws and regulations of work units by carrying out various
forms of supervisory activities.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, labor administration departments at
all levels reviewed 178,000 work units in the first half of 1996,
and dealt with 76,834 cases involving violation of labor laws and
regulations. They also investigated and determined the legal
liabilities of the violators, thereby protecting the legal rights
and interests of the workers.
</P>
<P>
Attaching great importance to the protection of the legal
rights and interests of the elderly, China passed the Law on
Protection of the Rights and Interests of the Elderly in August
1996, which sets clear stipulations for family support and
social security for the elderly, their participation in social
development, and the legal liabilities of activities that infringe
upon their legal rights and interests, standardizing and
legalizing the state protection of this special social group.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the state has established a pension
insurance system to ensure the basic livelihood of the elderly,
and their pension and other treatment are protected by laws. The
government increases the pension in line with economic
development, improvement in people's living standards, and rise in
workers' salaries; in rural areas, local economic organizations
should provide adequate food and clothing, housing and medical
service, and proper funeral arrangements for the elderly people
who are unable to work, who have neither sources of income nor
family support, or whose family supporters do not have the ability
to support them.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, local governments should provide relief for
elderly people who are unable to work, who have neither sources of
income nor family supporters, or whose family supporters are
unable to support them.

The Chinese government attaches great importance to the need to
help university students with financial difficulties complete
their study. It has adopted measures to aid these students through
scholarships, loans, funding for part-time work and part-time
study program, allowances and exemption or reduction of tuition
fees. The central government has allocated special funds to aid
students with financial difficulties. From 1994 to 1996, the
allocation reached more than 440 million yuan. Many regions and
departments have earmarked special funds to aid these students.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee citizens' rights to receive education and improve
the scientific and cultural quality of the nation as a whole, the
country has planned to make the nine-year compulsory education
universal and basically wipe out illiteracy among the young and
adults by the year 2000. To do so, the Chinese government has
actively adopted a number of measures. In 1996, an additional 457
counties, cities and districts in 26 provinces and autonomous
regions, having a population of 190 million, or 16.4 percent of
the population of the whole country, met the demand to make the
nine years of compulsory education universal and basically wipe
out illiteracy among the young and adults. So far, an accumulative
total of 1,482 counties, cities and districts, covering 50 percent
of the population of the whole nation, have reached the goals.

Since 1983, the Chinese government has established, in
succession, four special government subsidy funds to make
compulsory education universal in old revolutionary base areas,
areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups, remote areas and poor
areas, and to support vocational education, teacher-training and
the education of national minorities. In addition to the
government-controlled added city education fund, which is some 300
million yuan each year, the funding has been mainly used to
support the development of education in poor regions. The
government has decided to allocate a special fund of 3.9 billion
yuan from the central budget between 1995 and 2000 to focus on
poor counties recognized by the "1987 National Plan for Poverty
Relief." Also, supplementary government allocations will come from
local budgets at various levels. An estimated 10 billion yuan in
total will be poured into the program. The fund will be mainly
given to poor counties recognized by the Plan and part of the
money will go to provincially recognized counties with economic
difficulties and poor development of primary education. The
priority will be given to ethnic minority regions in using the
fund. Moreover, the "Hope Project," which has been enforced for
many years, showed marked new progress in 1996. Statistics show
that the project received nationwide donations totalling 286
million yuan in 1996, which helped build 1,560 "Hope" primary
schools and aided 290,000 dropouts. Over the past seven years, the
"Hope Project" has received an accumulative total of 978 million
yuan of donations, which has been used to build 3,634 "Hope"
schools and aided 1.549 million dropouts.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made great efforts to develop
education for the disabled. By the end of 1996, the country had
built 1,426 compulsory special education schools, with an
enrollment of some 321,100 blind, deaf and retarded students. The
number of such schools and the number of disabled students
increased by 91.15 percent and 345.97 percent over the a990
figures respectively.

Six. Legitimate Rights and Interests of Women and Children
</P>
<P>
China has made active endeavors in promoting equality between
men and women and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests
of women.
</P>
<P>
Women enjoy equal rights with men in state political life in
accordance with the law. By the end of 1996, the number of women
cadres in government departments, enterprises and institutions had
climbed to 13.28 million, making up 33.8 percent of the total
number of cadres in China. The number was over 200 times that of
women cadres in the early period after the founding of New
China. There are 626 women delegates to the Eighth National
People's Congress, accounting for 21.03 percent of the total. The
number of women holding leading posts at the various government
departments has also increased. The number of female vice
provincial governors increased from 18 in 1994 to 21 in 1996, that
of women mayors and vice mayors grew from 174 to 225, and female
county magistrates and vice magistrates from 1,329 to 1,540.
</P>
<P>
The economic, social and cultural rights of women have also
been guaranteed. In 1995, female employees made up about 44
percent of the total employed people in China, higher than the
world average rate of 34.5 percent. The number of women workers in
cities and towns increased from 54.65 million in 1994 to 57.55
million in 1995, accounting for 38.6 percent of the total
workforce in the country's cities and towns. The number of women
scientists and technicians jumped from 8.097 million in 1993 to
9.881 million in 1995, making up 36.91 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
China implements the principle of men and women enjoying equal
pay for equal work. Women's work is under special
protection: women enjoy special care during the menstrual period,
pregnancy, maternity leave and breast-feeding, and women workers
who give birth can take a three-month leave of absence with pay.
</P>
<P>
Women's rights to receive education have further been
protected. In the four decades and more since the founding of New
China, the country has helped 110 million illiterate women learn
how to read and write, cutting down the ratio of illiterate women
from 90 percent in 1949 to 32 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the ratio of school attendance for girls across China
soared to 98.63 percent from 80 percent in 1990. The gap in the
ratio of school attendance between girls and boys decreased from
2.9 percent in 1991 to 0.35 percent in 1996.

The ratio of female students in middle schools and colleges and
universities increased from 42.2 percent and 33.7 percent
respectively in 1990 to 45.5 percent and 36.4 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, China had built 1,679 women's secondary vocational
schools and three women's vocational universities and opened 60
specialities suitable for women. More than 13 million women had
been enrolled by adult schools across the country.
</P>
<P>
Women's health conditions have improved considerably. Health
care networks for women and children have been built in both urban
and rural areas. By 1995, China had built 349 hospitals and 2,832
clinics for women's and children's health care, 49 obstetrics and
gynecology hospitals and 35 children's hospitals. The mortality
rate of pregnant women and women in labor was reduced from 67.3
per 100,000 in 1993 to 61.9 per 100,000 in 1995. The average life
expectancy of women climbed from 36 years in 1949 to 72 years in
1995, three years longer than average life expectancy for men in
China, and seven years longer than the average life expectancy of
65 years for women set by the United Nations for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to protecting the interests and
rights of children. It has built a relatively complete legal
system for protecting children's rights and interests, with the
Law on Protection of Minors as the mainstay.
</P>
<P>
Since the Outline on Development for Chinese Children in the
1990s was promulgated in February 1992, 30 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities as well as 80 percent of the
prefectures and cities and more than 50 percent of the counties
and districts in China have worked out their own development plans
for children.
</P>
<P>
To effectively guarantee the healthy growth of children, the
legislative, judicial and relevant government departments and
social organizations in China have built institutions which take
charge of coordinating and promoting government departments
concerned to do a good job in safeguarding the interests and
rights of women and children.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has set up the Women and Children Work
Committee. Thirty provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
have also set up committees to work for women and children or
committees for the protection of children and adolescents. The
majority of prefectures, cities, counties and districts have also
established women and children work committees.
</P>
<P>
The conditions for Chinese children's development have been
remarkably improved and the mid-term goals for children's
development in the 1990s set by the State have been
attained. Since 1991, China has been conducting a large-scale
baby-friendly campaign. By the end of 1995, China had built 2,957
baby-friendly hospitals.

The mortality rates of infants and children under five have
declined year by year, dropping to 36.4 per thousand and 44.5 per
thousand, respectively, in 1995. During the 1991-95 period, the
mortality rates of infants and children under five dropped
annually by 7.7 percent and 7.6 percent, respectively, on average.
</P>
<P>
According to a multi-index household survey in 1995, the rate
of malnutrition in the moderate and worst degrees, judging by the
internationally accepted standards, among children under five in
China was 15.8 percent, 23.83 percent lower than the 1990 rate of
20.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
China started a universal immunity program for children in
1978. Reports show that in 1995, 92.3 percent of the children in
China were vaccinated, 92.1 percent inoculated against diphtheria,
whooping cough and tetanus, 93.8 percent against polio and 92.9
percent had measles shots.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the
convalescence needs of disabled children. By 1995, over 2,000
convalescence centers for disabled children had been set up in
large and medium-sized cities throughout the country. By the end
of 1995, more than 60,000 deaf children had received training in
hearing and speech courses, and 100,000 mentally-handicapped
children had improved their abilities to care for themselves and
to learn through training. Over 30,000 children with poor sight
had received eyesight-aiding devices to improve their
vision. Children who suffer from sequelae of infantile paralysis
and congenital cataracts have received medical treatment with more
than 200,000 disabled children restored to health in the 1991-95
period.
</P>
<P>
China's social welfare institutions mainly take in orphans who
have lost their parents and have no legal guardians. To provide
guarantee for the orphans in living and medical care and
convalescence, local governments funded welfare institutions with
a total of 515 million yuan between 1990 and 1994. During the same
period, the central government allocated 740 million yuan of
special funds for improving the living conditions of children in
welfare institutions.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, many children's welfare institutions have
raised funds to have restorative operations for disabled children
in welfare institutions. In 1995, the country launched a
nationwide project for the convalescence of disabled children,
urging hospitals above grade three to operate on disabled children
living in welfare institutions. As a result, over 200 disabled
children in welfare institutions were restored to health.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government devotes energetic efforts to developing
health care undertakings for women and children and raising the
health care and educational levels of nurseries and
kindergartens. At present, there are a total of 187,300
kindergartens throughout the country. The demand for kindergartens
in large and medium-sized cities has been basically
satisfied.

Seven: Guarantee of the Rights of Ethnic Minorities
</P>
<P>
In China, all ethnic groups are equal and the state guarantees
the legal rights and interests of all ethnic minorities, and
safeguards and promotes the relationship of equality, unity and
mutual assistance among all ethnic groups. A national minorities
regional autonomy system is practiced in places where ethnic
minorities gather and live.
</P>
<P>
Minority nationals take the posts of chairmen of the autonomous
regions, commissioners of the autonomous prefectures and the
autonomous counties magistrates. As many as possible of the other
leading posts in the autonomous governments are also taken by the
nationals or other minorities.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic minorities in the autonomous areas are entitled to
use and develop their own languages, keep or reform their folk
customs, and be free in their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The state continues its assistance policy toward the economic
growth in ethnic minority areas, by providing funding, technology
and personnel to accelerate these regions' economic progress and
to upgrade the people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the overall growth rate of the five autonomous regions
of Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Ningxia was
noticeably higher than the country's average, with the GDP rising
by over ten percent and the income of the regions' urban and rural
residents rising markedly. The regions' per capita income of the
farmers was also increasing at a far quicker pace than the
country's average.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia's GNP reached 98.3 billion yuan in 1996, a
12.4 percent increase over 1995. The per capita income of the
region's farmers and herdsmen was 1,602 yuan, a practical increase
of 14.8 percent, while the urban per capita income was 3,101 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tibet's GNP was registered at 6.453 billion yuan,
ten percent higher than in 1995. The per capita income of region's
urban dwellers was 5,036 yuan, 25.9 percent higher than 1995,
while the rural people's per capita income reached 960 yuan, an
increase of 9.3 percent.

<P>
The Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social
Development and the Outline for the Long-Range Objectives through
the Year 2010, passed in March 1996, decided to accelerate the
development in the central and western parts of China, which are
home to most of the country's minority population.
</P>
<P>
Measures in these plans include: giving priority to arrangement
of the resource exploration and infrastructure projects in the
central and western regions; readjusting the locations of
processing industries, and shifting the resource processing and
labor-intensive industries to the central and western regions;
readjusting the prices for products of a resource nature and
enhancing the self-development capability of the central and
western regions; gradually increasing the financial support to the
central and west; accelerating the reform pace of the central and
west; increasing the ratio of the country's policy-oriented loans
in the central and western regions; continuing to organize various
departments of the central government, all walks of life and the
eastern coastal areas to provide more assistance in various forms
to aid Tibet and other minority areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, numerous key projects were completed or launched in
minority areas. For instance, the Liangjiang International Airport
in Guilin, a major city in Guangxi, has been completed and put
into operation. Work on a three-billion-yuan irrigation project
was started last May in Ningxia which aims to give one million
poverty-stricken people of the Hui ethnic group enough food and
clothing, while construction started last September on the western
section of the Southern Xinjiang Railway Line.
</P>
<P>
The state has continued to give Tibet special assistance. In
1996, the 62 aid-Tibet projects designated by the state in 1994
were given another 1.4 billion yuan in funding. The state also
added 151 more relief projects for Tibet, involving a total
investment of 490 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ministries and commissions of the central government and some
provinces and cities sent more than 150 work teams to Tibet on
investigative missions and worked out a 10-year assistance plan
for the region.
</P>
<P>
At present, 56 out of the 62 assistance projects have been
completed and put into operation, involving 3.53 billion
yuan. This has improved the backwardness of transportation,
energy, telecommunications and other infrastructure facilities in
Tibet and directly benefitted the more than one million people
there.

The Chinese government has, as always, paid great attention on
the educational and cultural development of the ethnic minority
areas, and respected and safeguarded the traditional culture of
the minorities.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Tibet focused more of its investment on its
education programs, and set up or renovated 87 primary and middle
schools, with the school enrollment rate reaching 73.5 percent for
school-age children, 3.1 percentage points higher than that of
1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 98.16 percent of the school-age children in Guangxi
entered school, bringing the total number of teh region's primary
school pupils to 6.395 million.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, the large, modern and multi-functional Tibet
Autonomous Region Library, the world's highest in altitude, was
completed and opened to the public. The translation into Chinese
of the "Manass," one of China's three epic writings, and the
lengthiest epic of the Kirgiz people in Xinjiang long known as a
"national treasure", was nearly completed.
</P>
<P>
The progress China made in its human rights undertakings in
1996 has once again proved that China always places top priority
on its people's right to subsistence and development. Under the
conditions of reform, development and stability, strengthening the
democratic and legal systems and giving human rights a
comprehensive push are in line with the Chinese circumstances and
in the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. This has
turned out to be a great success in practice.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of human rights is a continuously developing
process along with the political, economic and cultural
progress. China, as a developing country, is restricted by its
historical and realistic conditions, and the country's human
rights conditions still have room for further improvement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people will continue to try every
means possible to help the people enjoy human rights in a broader
space and at a higher level.

<HEADLINE> Local Elections in Nepal to Be Held on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's major political parties
have agreed on holding local elections throughout the country by
June this year, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
An all-party meeting called by the government Sunday
unanimously decided to hold the local elections, which will elect
chief officers for administration bodies on village, municipality
and district levels, on the schedule announced by the former
government last month, according to the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
The present coalition government under Lokendra Bahadur Chand
came to power earlier this month after the former one led by Sher
Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress (NC) party stepped down
following its failure to win a confidence vote in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a press release of the main opposition NC party said
that the government at the Sunday meeting failed to express its
determination to present a decentralization bill to the on-going
parliament session and hold the local polls after the approval of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
The NC-led government in February decided to postpone the local
elections by two and half months to wait for the introduction of
the decentralization act, which is expected to give more autonomy
to local bodies.
</P>
<P>
The NC party said that it strongly opposed the government's
proposal for concluding the current parliament session soon and
implementing some portion of the decentralization bill through
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
According to Local Development Minister Amrit Bohara, whose
ministry is responsible for conducting the local elections, the
decentralization bill could not be passed before the elections due
to "time constraint and other technical problems".

<HEADLINE> 83 Feared Dead in Albanian Shipwreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 83 people were feared dead
when an Albanian refugee boat capsized last Friday off southern
Italy, the Albanian Embassy in Rome confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
In a list faxed to the police authorities of the southern
Italian port Brindisi, the embassy gave the names of 117 people
who were allegedly aboard the ship, which sank on Friday night
after colliding with an Italian naval boat trying to block influx
of illegal Albanian immigrants to Italy.
</P>
<P>
The list, compiled by Ambassador Pandeli Pasko after talking
with survivors, has been handed over to the Interpol for
verification.
</P>
<P>
So far, 34 people have survived the tragedy and four bodies
have been recovered. Survivors said that over half of the
passengers were women and children.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi today promised to
investigate the shipwreck when visiting a refugee camp housing
about 150 Albanians near central Italian city of Bologna.
</P>
<P>
"I have given orders that everything must be clarified in the
fullest and most complete manner," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister avoided the question of whether Italy will
provide political asylum to Albanian refugees, saying the most
urgent thing is to help the Albanian authorities restore order in
the country by sending an Italian-led protection force authorized
by United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"We want to bring assistance to Albania to help it rebuild
itself", he said. "The country must start to live again."
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 Albanians have flooded into Italy since the
crisis erupted in the Balkan country, triggered by the collapse of
investment schemes that exhausted the savings of thousands of
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Though Italian government has given more than 12,000 Albanians
temporary residence permits this month, it stressed that these
people must be repatriated as soon as the situation in Albanian
returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said today that his country was
not denying anyone's right to asylum, but most of the 13,000
Albanians were not real refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said many of those who have crossed the Adriatic Sea are not
refugees in need of asylum but illegal immigrants hoping to find
jobs in Italy.

COLOMBO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Six Sri Lankan students from
three leading schools in Colombo were arrested by police Sunday
night for an attack on staff at the Colombo National Hospital,
according to police sources here today.

forcibly enter the hospital premises to obtain medical attention
for some other students who were injured on Saturday evening in
clashes between rival schools after a cricket match.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the hospital staff tried to prevent the
students from entering the hospital premises as no vehicles are
allowed to enter due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The students had then become abusive and later assaulted the
hospital staff and security men, injuring five of them.

<HEADLINE> Albania Offers to Probe Boat Accident With Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government said today
that an investigation group should be formed immediately to
investigate the sinking of an Albanian refugee boat in the
Adriatic last Friday, which killed 83 people.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Foreign Minister Arijan Starova put forward the
proposal in a letter to his Italian counterpart Lamberto Dini here
today.
</P>
<P>
Starova said last Friday's tragedy could have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
Albania expressed regret over Italy's decision to use naval
ships for patrol operations before the two countries signed a
protocol on patrol at sea.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government demanded the investigation group should
be made up of Italian, Albanian and international experts.
</P>
<P>
According to Albanian reports, an overloaded Albanian refugee
boat bound for Italy from its southern port of Vlora collided with
an Italian navy vessel about 30 miles away from the Italian
Brindisi port.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 Albanian refugees have reached Italy since
tension escalated in Albania earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Extracts of White Paper on China's Human Rights Cause in 1996 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council released here today a white paper entitled "Progress
in China's Human Rights Cause in 1996," outlining China's
achievements in various domains of its human rights cause in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
The 13,000-character white paper is divided into seven
parts: One: People's Rights to Subsistence and Development;
Two: Citizens' Democratic Rights; Three: Judicial Guarantee for
Human Rights; Four: Protection of Workers' Rights; Five: Citizens'
Rights to Receive Education; Six: Legitimate Rights and Interests
of Women and Children; Seven: Guarantee of Rights of Ethnic
Minorities.
</P>
<P>
The white paper say that the year 1996 was the first year of
implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan for the National
economic and Social Development, and also a year that witnessed
continued advances in China's human rights cause.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's national economy maintained steady, rapid and
sound growth, the efforts to build up democracy and a legal system
were notably strengthened, and the human rights conditions maintained
a good momentum of continuous improvement and promised further
progress.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper, the people's rights to earn a
living and development recorded a marked improvement. In 1996,
China's national economy continued its rapid growth. The gross
domestic product (GDP) reached over 6,779.5 billion yuan,
representing an increased of 9.7 percent over the previous year,
calculated in terms of comparable prices. The standards of living
for urban and rural people improved nationwide with the steady
increase in people's incomes.
</P>
<P>
The "Engel's coefficient," which indicates the ratio between
the expenses of food and other items of consumption, came to 48.6
percent, or 1.3 percentage points lower than the previous
year. The drop in the "Engel's coefficient" signified a new
improvement of people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says that while seeking universal improvement
of the people's overall living standard, China has been paying
close attention to meeting people's basic needs for food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
Since the initiation of reform and opening-up, the Chinese
government launched vigorously a nationwide campaign to seek
development and provide assistance for the people in
poverty-stricken areas, which helped reduce the poverty-stricken
population in great numbers for many successive years.
</P>
<P>
The ratio between China's poverty-stricken people and
the world's total has dropped from one-fourth in the 1970s to less
than one-twentieth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China is the country which has witnessed
the quickest decrease in its poverty-stricken population. Since
1978, China's poverty-stricken population has decreased 10 million
every year. China is also working to enable all of its
poverty-stricken people to shake off poverty by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
China's development-oriented aid-the-poor work and achievements
in poverty-stricken areas have been universally praised by
international organizations and noted figures.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank believes that "the Chinese government has made
painstaking efforts toward poverty alleviation in the most
backward rural areas. These efforts proved to be much more
successful than those made by many other developing countries."

<TEXT>
<P>
The white paper says the people's congress system serves as
China's fundamental political system. The National People's
Congress (NPC), the supreme state power organ, decides fundamental
state policies and principles, and formulates basic natinal laws.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, The NPC heard and deliberated the work report of the
State Council, the Supreme People Court and the Supreme People's
Procuratorate; examined and approved the Ninth Five-Year Plan for
National Economic and Social Development and the Outline for the
Long-Range Objective through the Year 2010.
</P>
<P>
It also deliberated and adopted 20 laws and decisions
concerning legal issues, and strengthened legal protection of
citizens' rights.
</P>
<P>
The white paper emphasizes that China has made vigorous efforts
to promote the building of democracy in grass-roots units in urban
and rural areas to guarantee the democratic rights of the
residents there. In rural areas, efforts have been made to
continue to conduct rural grass-root mass self-management
activities that focus on villagers' democratic elections,
democratic policy-making, democratic management and democratic
supervision.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, rural villagers committees in most provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central
government carried out a new round of elections by adopting the
method by which villagers could directly cast votes to elect the
committees.
</P>
<P>
In cities, the overwhelming majority of neighborhood committees
carried out elections of new committees by adopting the method of
directly casting votes by residents.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the judicial guarantee for human rights, the paper
says during the past year and more, China has revised its Criminal
Law and Criminal Procedure Law, Promulgated and enforced new laws
such as the Lawyers Law and the Law on Administrative Punishment,
and taken many other measures to strengthen the judicial guarantee
for human rights.
</P>
<P>
The amendment and enforcement of the Criminal Law have provided
a more powerful legal weapon for punishing crimes, safeguarding
national security, and protecting human rights of the people.
</P>
<P>
The significant revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law made
in 1996 perfected the criminal judicial procedure and added
stipulations on protecting the citizens' rights.
</P>
<P>
China is a country with a relatively low crime rate. In 1996,
its crime rate dropped 5.4 percent from the previous year. The
number of major categories of crimes such as homicides, injuries
to human bodies, robberies and thefts all dropped from the
previous year.

<P>
The white paper points out that China attaches great importance
to protection of workers' rights. In the past year the government
has made new efforts to safeguard the rights stipulated by the
Labor Law, such as equal access to employment, salary, rest and
vacations, work safety and health protection, job training, social
security and welfare.
</P>
<P>
The paper stresses that attaching great importance to the
protection of the legal rights and interests of the elderly, China
passed the Law on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of
the Elderly in August 1996, which explicitly defines family
support and social security for the elderly, their participation
in social development and the legal liabilities of activities that
infringe upon their legitimate rights and interests, standardizing
and legalizing the state protection of this special social group.
</P>
<P>
As for citizens' rights to receive education, the paper says
that China has in place a set of legal systems to guarantee
citizens' rights to receive an education.
</P>
<P>
After the Education Law of the People's Republic of China was
promulgated in 1995, the Law for Vocational Education of the
People's Republic of China was promulgated in May of 1996. The Law
stipulates that citizens have the legal right to receive
vocational education, thus further perfecting the legal education
system.
</P>
<P>
"We may say that China has instituted an educational system
which can basically guarantee citizens' rights to receive an
education," the document says.
</P>
<P>
The paper adds that in the past year, China has made active
endeavors in promoting equality between men and women and
safeguarding the legitimate rights and interest of women. Women
enjoy equal rights with men in state political life in accordance
with the law.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the number of women cadres in government
departments, enterprises and institutions had climbed to 13.28
million, making up 33.8 percent of the total number of cadres in
China.
</P>
<P>
The economic, social, cultural and educational rights of women
have also been guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The paper says China attaches great importance to protecting
the interests and rights of children. The conditions for Chinese
children's development has been remarkably improved.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches great importance to the
convalescence needs of the disabled children. By 1995, over 2,000
convalescence centers for disabled children had been set up in
large and medium-sized cities throughout the country. More than
200,000 disabled children restored to health during the 1991-95
period.

Albania authorized by the United Nations, said a Romanian Defense
Ministry officer here today.
</P>
<P>
Constantin Degeratu, chief of the general staff of the Romanian
Armed Forces, told reporters that the Romanian government
considered it essential to seek humanitarian and political means
to solve the Albania crisis.
</P>
<P>
Romania is ready to provide humanitarian aid to Albania and

</P>
<P>
He said the Romanian troops in Albania will protect civilian
and military installations, oversee the delivery of humanitarian
aid materials, set up check points on roads and separate the
conflicting Albanian forces when necessary.
</P>
<P>
It will cost the Romania government 80-100 billion leus (about
11.3-14 million U.S. dollars) to participate in the multinational
protection force in Albania, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution last Friday,
authorizing the establishment of a temporary and limited

Concerning the guarantee of rights of ethnic minorities, the
white paper says all ethnic groups in China are equal nd the state
guarantees the legal rights and interests of all ethnic
minorities, and safeguards and promotes the relationship of
equality, unity and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups. An
ethnic minority regional autonomous system is practiced in places
where ethnic minorities gather and live.
</P>
<P>
Minority nationals take the posts of chairmen of the autonomous
regions, commissioners of the autonomous prefectures and the
autonomous counties magistrates. As many as possible of the other
leading posts in the autonomous governments are also taken by or
other minorities.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic minorities in the autonomous areas are entitled to
use and develop their own languages, keep or reform their folk
customs, and be free in their religious reliefs.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the Chinese government continues its
assistance policy towards the economic growth in the ethnic
minority areas, by providing funding, technology and personnel to
accelerate these regions' economic progress and to upgrade the
people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the overall growth rate of the five autonomous regions
of Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, Guangxi and Ningxia was
noticeably higher than the country's average, with the GDP rising
by 10 percent and the income of the regions' urban and rural
residents rising markedly. The region's per-capita income of the
farmers was also increasing at a far quicker pace than the
country's average.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the progress China made in its human rights
cause in 1996 has once again proved that China always gives top
priority to its people's right to subsistence and development.

people improved nationwide with the steady increase of people's
income.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita income for living expenses reached 4,377
yuan for city and township dwellers, an increase of 3.3 percent
over 1995 in real terms. The average per capita net income of
rural residents came to 1,296 yuan, a rise of nine percent over
1995 in real terms -- the biggest increase of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey of the State Statistics Bureau,
the per capita consumption expenses of urban dwellers reached
3,919 yuan in 1996. Of that amount, 1,905 yuan was spent on food.

In 1996, an additional seven million rural poverty-stricken
people met their basic need for food and clothing. The country's
poverty-stricken population had dropped from 250 million in 1978
to 58 million. By the end of 1970s, the number of China's
poverty-stricken people accounted for one-fourth of the world's
total, while the ratio is now less than one-twentieth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China is the country which has witnessed
the quickest decrease in its poverty-stricken population. Since
1978, China's poverty-stricken population has decreased 10 million
every year. China is also working to enable all of its
poverty-stricken people to shake off poverty by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Although China is still facing great difficulties, the Chinese
government and people are determined and confident in their
ability to achieve the goal of lifting all of the nation's poor
people out of poverty on schedule.
</P>
<P>
China's development-oriented aid-the-poor work and achievements
in poverty-stricken areas have been universally praised by
international organization and noted figures concerned. The World
Bank believes that "the Chinese government has made painstaking
efforts toward poverty alleviation in the most backward rural
areas. These efforts proved to be much more successful than those
made by many other developing countries."

<HEADLINE> Citizens' Democratic Rights Further Safeguarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- While developing its economy,
China has made energetic efforts in 1996 to promote the building
of a socialist democratic and political system, thus further
guaranteed citizens' democratic rights, the Chinese government
said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the white paper entitled "Progress on China's
Human Rights Cause in 1996" released today, China has, in the past
year, consolidated and perfected the people's congress system and
the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation
under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and improved
democracy at grass-roots units.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the NPC heard and deliberated the work reports of the
State Council, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's
Procuratorate; and examined and approved the Ninth Five-Year Plan
for National Economic and Social Development and the Outline for
the Long-Range Objective Through the Year 2010, the white paper
states.
</P>
<P>
It also deliberated and adopted 20 laws and decisions
concerning legal issues, and strengthened legal protection of
citizens' rights, it says, adding that, in the meantime, the NPC
has tightened inspection of and supervision over law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Various non-Communist parties and Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference organizations are playing an increasingly
important role in political consultation, democratic supervision
and the participation in and deliberation of state affairs, it
states.
</P>
<P>
The white paper emphasizes on the progress China has made in
promoting the building of democracy in grass-roots units in urban
and rural areas to guarantee the democratic right of the residents
there.
</P>
<P>
It says that in rural areas, efforts have been made to continue
to conduct rural grass-roots mass self-management activities that
focus on villagers' democratic elections, democratic
policy-making, democratic management and democratic supervision.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, rural villagers' committees in most provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central
government carried out a new round of elections by adopting the
method by which villagers could directly cast votes to elect the
committees, the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
In cities, urban neighborhood committees and their subsidiary
organizations continued to be set up and perfected, it says,
explaining that more than 98 percent of the residential areas all
over the country have established neighborhood committees in
accordance with legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the building of democracy at grassroots
levels serves as an important reflection of democracy enjoyed by
the Chinese people, and all the overseas people who have no
prejudice but have a good understanding of China's actual
situation have fully acknowledged the building of democracy at
grassroots levels in China.

<HEADLINE> Judicial Guarantees for Human Rights Strengthened in China: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A white paper released by the
State Council Press Office today says that, during the past year
and more, China has taken many measures to strengthen the judicial
guarantee for human rights.
</P>
<P>
China has revised the Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law,
promulgated and enforced new laws such as the Lawyers' Law and the
Law on Administrative Punishment to strengthen the judicial
guarantee for human rights during that period of time, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
It has cracked down on serious criminal offenses in accordance
with law, and earnestly guaranteed the people's human rights and
safety of lives and property, it states.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, public security and judicial departments launched,
according to law, a severe nationwide crack down on criminal
offenses seriously endangering public security, such as homicides,
robberies, rape, kidnapping and blackmail, and major theft, with
emphasis placed on crimes involving the use of guns, crimes with
gangster connections and characteristics, and crimes committed by
rogue and vicious social forces, it says.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1996, courts throughout the country
sentenced 322,382 criminal offenders who had seriously endangered
public security by committing crimes of violence, crimes involving
the use of guns, and gang-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The severe crackdown on crimes has safeguarded social stability
and the human rights of the people all over the country, and won
the heartfelt support of the general public, the paper claims.
</P>
<P>
The paper notes that in March of 1997, China's Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress made amendments to the
Criminal Law enacted in 1979. The amended Criminal Law has 452
articles, an increase of 260 over the previous 192 articles.
</P>
<P>
The amended Criminal Law has further defined three basic
principles, namely "conviction and penalty according to law,"
"equality of everyone before the law" and "punishment commensurate
with the crime."
</P>
<P>
It stipulates: "there should be no conviction or penalty if an
act is not explicitly defined as a criminal act by the law," "all
criminal offenders are equal in applying laws," and that "the
severity of penalty should be commensurate with the offender's
crime and due criminal liabilities."
</P>
<P>
These three principles have further improved China's principle
of rule of law, and are conducive to judicial fairness and to the
protection of the legitimate rights of the litigants, the white
paper states.
</P>
<P>
It points out that China has paid close attention to
standardizing the practice of administrative and law-enforcement
departments, so as to protect the citizens' legitimate rights from
any infringement.
</P>
<P>
Following the promulgation and enforcement of the
Administrative Procedure Law and the Law on State Compensation, in
March of 1996, China promulgated the Law on Administrative
Punishment, thus standardizing in terms of system the act of
administrative punishment by the governments, the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of employees in the lawyers profession
national exceeded 100,000 in 1996, who have become a major force
in safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of citizens,
the white paper says.

<HEADLINE> China Puts Emphasis on Protection of Workers' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance
to protection of workers' rights, according to the White Paper on
the Progress in China's Human Rights Cause in 1996 issued by the
State Council today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the government has made new efforts to
safeguard the rights stipulated by China's Labor Law, such as
equal access to employment, salary, rest and vacations, work
safety and health protection, job training, social security and
welfare, the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
It adds that China now has 31,000 employment agencies, 2,716
job service centers, and more than 2,000 unemployment insurance
bodies.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 labor service enterprises have been
established throughout the country, employing more than nine
million people. In 1996, about ten million people found jobs with
the help of employment agencies, and the unemployment rate in
cities and towns was around three percent, says the paper.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the minimum wage standard for workers, it notes, the
government has in recent years issued the Regulations on Minimum
Wages for Enterprises, and Notice on Implementing the System to
Ensure Minimum Wages, which clearly stipulate the fixing and
adjusting of the minimum standards of wages, the payment of the
wages, and the legal liabilities for those who violate the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government puts much emphasis on the development of
workers' job skills and on job training, and vigorously promoted
the development of senior secondary technical training schools. At
present, there are 4,467 secondary technical training schools
across the country, which admit more than 700,000 students each
year.
</P>
<P>
Attaching great importance to the protection of the legal
rights and interests of the elderly, the white paper says, China
passed the Law on Protection of the Rights and Interests of the
Elderly in August 1996, which sets clear stipulations for family
support and social security for the elderly, their participation
in social development, and the legal liabilities of activities
that infringe upon their legal rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The law has standardized and legalized the state protection of
this special social group, says the paper.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Citizens' Educational Level Continues to Rise: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
adopted various measures over the past few years to guarantee
citizens' rights to get an education, a human rights white paper
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the "1996 White Paper on Human Rights Conditions
in China" published here today by the Information Office of the
State Council, Chinese citizens' educational level has continued
to rise.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that China has established an educational
system which can basically guarantee citizens' rights to receive
an education.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by 1996, there were 646,000 primary
schools nationwide, with an enrollment of 136.15 million pupils;
there were 80,000 middle schools with a total enrollment of 57.397
million; there were 1,032 universities and colleges, with a total
of 3.021 million students; universities and colleges for adults
numbered 1,138, with the enrollment standing at 2.656 million; and
the number of secondary vocational schools in various forms at
various levels stood at 18,600, with 10.879 million students,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that China has in place a set of legal systems
to guarantee citizens' rights to get an education.
</P>
<P>
After the Education Law of the People's Republic of China was
promulgated in 1995, China promulgated the Law for Vocational
Education of the People's Republic of China in May of 1996,
stipulating that citizens have the legal right to receive
vocational education, thus further perfecting the legal
educational system, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that, to guarantee citizens' rights to receive
education and improve the scientific and cultural quality of the
nation as a whole, the country has planned to make the nine-year
compulsory education universal and basically wipe out illiteracy
among the young and adults by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To do so, the Chinese government has actively adopted a number
of measures, it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, an additional 457 counties, cities and districts in 26
provinces and autonomous regions, having a population of 190
million, or 16.4 percent of the population of the whole country,
met the demand to make the nine-year compulsory education
universal and basically wipe out illiteracy among the young and
adults.
</P>
<P>
So far, an accumulative total of 1,482 counties, cities and
districts, covering 50 percent of the population of the whole
nation, have reached the goals, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper continued that since 1983, the Chinese government has
established, in succession, four special government subsidy funds
to make compulsory education universal in old revolutionary base
areas, areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups, remote areas and
poor areas, and to support vocational education, teacher-training
and the education of people of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the government-controlled added city education
fund, which is some 300 million yuan each year, the funding has
been mainly used to support the development of education in poor
regions, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
And, according to the paper, the Chinese government has made
great efforts to develop education for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the country had built 1,426 special
compulsory education schools, with an enrollment of some 321,100
blind, deaf and retarded students. The number of such schools and
the number of disabled students increased by 91.15 percent and
345.97 percent over the 1990 figures respectively, the paper
noted.

<HEADLINE> White Paper on Women and Children  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- China made active endeavors in
promoting equality between men and women and safeguarding the
legitimate rights and interests of women and children in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
This was stated in the white paper entitled "progress in
China's human rights cause in 1996" released here today by the
Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Women enjoy equal rights with men in state political life in
accordance with law. By the end of 1996, the number of women
cadres in government departments, enterprises and institutions had
climbed to 13.28 million, making up 33.8 percent of the total
number of cadres in China. The number was over 200 times that of
women cadres in the early period after the founding of New China,
the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
There are 626 women delegates to the Eighth National People's
Congress, accounting for 21.03 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The number of women holding leading posts at the various
government departments has also increased. The number of female
vice provincial governors has increased to 21 in 1996, that of
women mayors and vice mayors grew to 225, and female county
magistrates and vice magistrates to 1,540.
</P>
<P>
The economic, social and cultural rights of women have also
been guaranteed. In 1995, female employees made up about 44
percent of the total employed people in China, higher than the
world average rate of 34.5 percent, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
China implements the principle of men and women enjoying equal
pay for equal work. Women's work is under special protection.
Women enjoy special care during the menstrual period, pragnancy,
maternity leave and breast-feeding, and women workers who give
birth can take a three-month leave of absence with pay.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the white paper said, women's rights to receive
education have further been protected. In the four decades and
more since the founding of New China, the country has helped 110
million illiterate women learn how to read and write, cutting down
the ratio of illiterate women from 90 percent in 1949 to 32
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
By 1995, China had built 1,679 women's secondary vocational
schools and three women's conventional universities and opened 60
specialities suitable for women. More than 13 million women had
been enrolled by adult schools across the country, the white paper
said.

China attaches importance to protecting the interests and
rights of children. It has built a relatively complete legal
system for protecting children's rights and interests, with the
Law on Protecting Minors as the mainstay, the white paper said.
</P>
<P>
The legislative, judicial and relevant government departments
and social organizations in China have built institutions which
take charge of coordinating and promoting government departments
concerned to do a good job in safeguarding the interests and
rights of women and children.
</P>
<P>
The conditions for chinese children's development have been
remarkably improved.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, China has been conducting a large-scale
baby-friendly campaign. By the end of 1995, China had built almost
3,000 baby-friendly hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The mortality rates of infants and children under five have
declined year by year, dropping to 36.4 per thousand and 44.5 per
thousand, respectively, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The white paper said that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to the convalescence needs of disabled children. By
1995, over 2,000 convalescence centers for disabled children had
been set up in large and medium-sized cities throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 disabled children restored to health in the
1991-95 period.
</P>
<P>
China's social welfare institutions mainly take in orphans who
have lost their parents and have no legal guardians. To provide
guarantee for the orphans in living and medical care and
convalescence, local governments funded welfare institutions with
a total of 515 million yuan between 1990 and 1994. During the same
period, the central government allocated 740 million yuan of
special funds for improving the living conditions of children in
welfare institutions.

<HEADLINE> China Guarantees Rights of Ethnic Minorities: White Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- All ethnic groups in China are
equal and the state guarantees the legal rights and interests of
all ethnic minorities, safeguards and promotes the relationship of
equality, unity and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups,
says a white paper.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, entitled "Progress in China's Human Rights
Cause in 1996", was released today by the Information Office of
the State Council.
</P>
<P>
It notes that a national minorities regional autonomy system is
practiced in places where ethnic minorities gather and live.
</P>
<P>
Minority nationals take the posts of chairmen of the autonomous
regions, commissioners of the autonomous prefectures and the
autonomous county magistrates, the white paper says, adding that
as many as possible of the other leading posts in the autonomous
governments are also taken by the nationals or other minorities.
</P>
<P>
It says that the ethnic minorities in the autonomous areas are
entitled to use and develop their own languages, keep or reform
their folk customs, and be free in their religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
The state continues its assistance policy toward the economic
growth in ethnic minority areas, by providing funding, technology
and personnel to accelerate these regions' economic progress and
to upgrade the people's living standard, the white paper says.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, it goes on, the overall growth rate of the five
autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, Guangxi and
Ningxia was noticeably higher than the country's average, with the
GNP rising by over ten percent and the income of the regions'
urban and rural residents rising markedly. The regions' per capita
income of the farmers was also increasing at a far quicker pace
than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
The paper says the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic
and Social Development and the Outline for the Long-Range
Objectives Through the Year 2010, passed in March 1996, decided to
accelerate the development in the central and western parts of
China, which are home to most of the country's minority population.
</P>
<P>
Measures in these plans include: giving priority to arrangement
of the resource exploration and infrastructure projects in the
central and western regions; readjusting the locations of
processing industries, and shifting the resource processing and
labor-intensive industries to the central and western regions, the
paper says.
</P>
<P>
It says that the state has continued to give Tibet special
assistance. In 1996, the 62 aid-Tibet projects designated by the
state in 1994 were given another 1.4 billion yuan in funding. The
state also added 151 more relief projects for Tibet, involving a
total investment of 490 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that ministries and commissions of the central
government and some provinces and cities sent more than 150 work
teams to Tibet on investigative missions and worked out a 10-year
assistance plan for the region.
</P>
<P>
At present, it continues, 56 out of the 62 assistance projects
have been completed and put into operation, involving 3.53 billion
yuan. This has improved transportation, energy, telecommunications
and other infrastructure facilities in Tibet and directly
benefited the more than one million people there.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has, as always, paid great attention to
educational and cultural development of the ethnic minority areas,
and respected and safeguarded the traditional culture of the
minorities, the paper explains.
</P>
<P>
Last year, it says, Tibet focused more of its investment on its
education programs, and set up or renovated 87 primary and middle
schools, with the school enrollment rate reaching 73.5 percent for
school-age children.
</P>
<P>
The white paper says in 1996, 98.16 percent of the school-age
children entered school in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
bringing the total number of the region's primary school pupils to
6.395 million.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, the large, modern and multi-functional Tibet
Autonomous Regional Library, the world's highest in altitude, was
completed and opened to the public. The translation into Chinese
of the "Manass," one of China's three great epics and an epic of
the Kirgiz people in Xinjiang long known as a "national treasure",
was nearly completed, the white paper adds.

<HEADLINE> White Paper on China's Human Rights Conditions in 1996 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full text of
a white paper entitled "Progress in China's Human Rights Cause in
1996," released here today by the Information Office of the State
Council:
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 was the first year of implementation of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development,
and also a year that witnessed continued advances in China's human
rights cause.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's national economy maintained steady, rapid
and sound growth, the efforts to build up democracy and a legal
system were notably strengthened, and the human rights conditions
maintained a good momentum of continuous improvement and promised
further progress.
</P>
<P>
One: People's Rights to Subsistence and Development
</P>
<P>
In 1996, China's national economy continued its rapid
growth. The gross domestic product (GDP) reached over 6,779.5
billion yuan, representing an increase of 9.7 percent over the
previous year, calculated in terms of comparable prices. Based on
this, the people's rights to earn a living and develop recorded a
marked improvement.
</P>
<P>
The standards of living for urban and rural people improved
nationwide with the steady increase of people's income. In 1996,
the average per capita income for living expenses reached 4,377
yuan for city and township dwellers, an increase of 3.3 percent
over 1995 in real terms. The average per capita net income of
rural residents came to 1,926 yuan, a rise of nine percent over
1995 in real terms -- the biggest increase of the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Savings deposits of urban and rural residents topped 3,850
billion yuan at the end of 1996, over 880 billion yuan more than
the year before. New housing for urban and rural residents
totaling 1.1 billion square meters of floor space was completed,
and people's housing conditions were significantly improved.
</P>
<P>
The market was brisk, with the supply of a wide variety of
consumer goods at fairly stable prices. The volume of total retail
sales of consumer goods reached 2,461.4 billion yuan, increasing
by 12.5 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey of the State Statistics Bureau,
the per capita consumption expenses of urban dwellers reached
3,919 yuan in 1996. Of that amount, 1,905 yuan was spent on
food. The "Engel's coefficient," which indicates the ratio between
the expenses of food and other items of consumption, came to 48.6
percent, or 1.3 percentage points lower than the previous year and
a step closer to the goal of 45 percent set for the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The drop of the "Engel's coefficient" signified a new
improvement in people's quality of life.

<P>
While seeking universal improvement of the people's overall
living standard, China has been paying great attention to meeting
people's basic need for food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Since the initiation of reform and opening-up, the Chinese
government launched vigorously a nationwide operation to seek
development and provide assistance for the people in
poverty-stricken areas, which helped reduce the poverty-stricken
population in great numbers for many successive years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, an additional seven million rural poverty-stricken
people met their basic need for food and clothing. The country's
total poverty-stricken population had dropped from 250 million in
1978 to 58 million. In the past 18 years, nearly 200 million rural
people had shaken off poverty.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 1970s, the number of China's poverty-stricken
people accounted for one-fourth of the world's total, while the
ratio is now less than one-twentieth.
</P>
<P>
After more than 10 years' efforts in development-oriented
poverty-relief programs in the underdeveloped areas, the drinking
water problems for 39.61 million people and 46.29 million head of
cattle have been solved in the poverty-stricken areas. In
addition, 258,000 kilometers of highways have been built, 274,000
kilometers of power transmission lines installed, and more than
50,000 rural enterprises established.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the poverty-stricken areas also made
substantial progress in cultural, educational and public health
undertakings. In 1995 alone, 2,504 primary schools and 587 clinics
were built in these areas.
</P>
<P>
A number of poverty-relief campaigns were launched by people in
all walks of life and have played big roles in proverty
relief. They include the "Happiness Project," designed to help
poverty-stricken mothers; the "Hope Project," aimed at helping
dropouts in poverty-stricken areas; the "Spring Bud Program,"
specially to aid the girl dropouts; and the "Love of Humanity
Project," meant to improve health care for children in the
poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China is the country which has witnessed
the quickest decrease in its poverty-stricken population. In the
past 20 years, however, the number of seriously underdeveloped
countries in the world has increased from 27 to 48. In the past
five years, the total number of the world's poorest population has
risen from 1 billion to 1.3 billion, and the figure is climbing by
25 million each year.
</P>
<P>
In the developing countries, more than 10 million people die
from hunger or malnutrition every year. In contrast, China's
poverty-stricken population decreases by 10 million every
year. China is also working to enable all of its poverty-stricken
people to shake off poverty by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Although China is still facing great difficulties, the Chinese
government and people are determined and confident of their
ability to achieve the goal of lifting all of the nation's poor
people out of poverty on schedule.
</P>
<P>
China's development-oriented aid-the-poor work and achievements
in poverty-stricken areas have been universally praised by
international organizations and noted figures concerned. The World
Bank believes that "the Chinese government has made painstaking
efforts toward poverty alleviation in the most backward rural
areas. These efforts proved to be much more successful than those
made by many other developing countries."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police to Eliminate Kidnappings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Police
(PNP) has launched a two-pronged strategy to eliminate kidnappings
in the country, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a plan submitted to President Fidel Ramos, Interior and
Local Government Secretary Robert Barbers said the first strategy
requires a sustained education and information drive to heighten
public awareness of the crime.
</P>
<P>
The public information campaign would inform the citizens about
the kidnapping gangs' modus operandi, their organizational network
and their damaging effects on national development, and seek the
citizens' support in the war against kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
The second strategy calls for intensified action and
strengthening of capabilities of the law enforcement, prosecution
and other main pillars of the criminal justice system, Barbers
said, adding the PNP has begun to acquire new surveillance and
communications equipment for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
The new PNP plan came after President Ramos declared an all-out
war led by Barbers against kidnappings earlier this month,
following a Fortune Magazine report that some 241 people were
kidnapped for ransoms in the country last year.
</P>
<P>
According to crime watchdogs, kidnappers came more vehemently
this year and had taken at least 40 people as hostages in the
first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Some anti-crime groups said some policemen and military
soldiers were kidnappers or protectors of kidnappers. A
Presidential Task Force also reported that more than 114 policemen
and soldiers in active duty were involved in the recent rash of
kidnappings nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Bank of China Finances Seed Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
has decided to set aside one billion yuan from its credit funds to
support the "Seed Project," sources here say.
</P>
<P>
China needs 8.7 billion kilograms of various strains annually,
but has a processing capacity of only two billion kilograms,
falling far short of the domestic demand. Therefore top priority
must be given to upgrade technology used in producing seeds.
</P>
<P>
The loans, aimed at boosting the country's agriculture and
grain output, will be used mainly to finance seed improvement
projects approved by the State Council and undertaken by seed
companies in breeding, introducing new strains, processing and
packing, as well as importing new technology to update existing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
China lags far behind developed countries in terms of seed
cultivation, production and processing. Backward seed technology
and poor quality plus small-scale production have long
bottlenecked the country's agriculture development, especially
grain production.

<HEADLINE> Gold Prices Expected to Rise in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Towards the end of 1997, gold
prices are expected to rise after it was traded between 380 and
415 US dollars per oz from 1994 to 1996 and even fell to a
three-year low of just over 340 dollars in early 1997, according
to a forecast by bankers.
</P>
<P>
The forecast, which appeared in Market Insights monthly today,
said the main causes of the price fall have been weak demand due
to slower growth in Asian incomes, disinvestment out of gold in
response to the strong equities markets, the benign world
inflation outlook, and investors fears of a rise in central bank
sales as European governments reduced debt to meet EMU (European
Monetary Union) entry criteria.
</P>
<P>
However, the bankers said, "towards the end of 1997, the key
date for EMU eligibility, fears of central bank sales will fade.
We also expect to see a rebound in Asian demand and shifts in
investor sentiment back to gold as world growth strengthens and
inflation expectations rise."
</P>
<P>
"While we expect gold to rally to a probable peak of 385
dollars by late 1997, gold prices are more likely to stay below
the old trading range of 380 to 415 dollars and around 370 dollars
per oz over the next several years," they said.

<HEADLINE> Yan'an Shakes off Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Economically-undeveloped Yan'an in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province has strengthened its campaign
against poverty, having helped 430,000 farmers and nearly 20
townships achieving prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an was the most important base where Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee was headquartered during the War of
Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the Liberation War.
</P>
<P>
Located in the inner part of the Loess Plateau, the city's
natural conditions are harsh. But Yan'an has concentrated on
developing its agricultural sector, and providing local farmers
with comprehensive services including those for technology,
information and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Preferential policies were also formulated to promote the
development of agriculture, and more than 1,000 cadres went to
over 500 villages to direct the drive against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at all levels all pay close attention to the
efforts to upgrade farmers' quality of life. More than 300 city
technicians have been working in rural areas, providing farmers
with services such as technological contracting and training in
farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 rural households have learned one or two of
the new skills, and 80 percent of farmers are engaged in business
which brings them stable income.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have also strengthened the building of
infrastructure in the rural areas. By the end of 1996,
the city had completed a 6.5 billion yuan (about 790 million US
dollars) project to provide each village with highways,
electricity, and telephones.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the per capita net income of the city's farmers was
1,120 yuan, and the poverty-stricken population had decreased from
670,000 in 1986 to 240,000.

<HEADLINE> More Historical Sites in Hebei Placed under State Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
added 21 new historical sites to the state protection list early
this year, bringing the total number of local sites to 58.
</P>
<P>
The province and northwest China's Shaanxi Province, frequently
used as capital sites in Chinese history, boast the most historical
sites under state protection.
</P>
<P>
China now has 750 such sites.
</P>
<P>
The newly-added sites in Hebei include a site with human
traces from one million years ago, remains of an imperial resort of
the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC), and a headquarters of the Eight Route
Army.
</P>
<P>
Rich in religious buildings, Buddhist sculptures, and a long
part of the Great Wall, the province saw many temples and two
passages of the Great Wall added to the recent list.
</P>
<P>
The sites, known to only a few, will be open to the public soon.
</P>
<P>
Previously, sites under state protection in Hebei included an
imperial summer resort in Chengde and imperial tombs from the Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911), city remains of the Zhao State in the Warring
States period (475-221 BC), and a tomb for a king of the Zhongshan
state from which a jade burial suit with gold threads was
unearthed.
</P>
<P>
The sites are now tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
The province has some 720,000 cultural relics, many of which
were unearthed in the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, for instance, local archaeologists
excavated a total area of 80,000 sq m and more than 1,000 ancient
tombs, unearthing nearly 100,000 cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Henan Protects Large Historical Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A special committee has been
set up in Luoyang City in central China's Henan Province to
protect a capital site of the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) and the
Wei State during the Three Kingdoms period (220-280).
</P>
<P>
The site is just one of some 200 large historical sites in the
province, which include remains of tribes, cities, pottery, and
porcelain kilns, building groups, imperial mausoleum, and other
tomb groups.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "most complete proof of ancient culture", the
sites, however, usually cover an area of several to tens of
kilometers and are easily damaged by rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, the province promulgated regulations on
conservation of the sites in 1995, which stipulate that
conservation plans are included in urban planning and allocated
funds accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Local experts are now busy drawing up plans for conserving a
dozen major historical sites, designating the areas within the
sites into places of different importance for more effective
protection.

<HEADLINE> More, Better Lawyers in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital now has 3,700
full-time lawyers, three times the number in 1991, according to a
report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Hired by 280 law firms, they handled 16,500 criminal, civil,
economic and administrative cases last year, and 7,200 cases
settled out-of-court, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they acted as legal consultants for 4,700
enterprises and recovered 11 billion yuan (1.3 billion US dollars)
in economic losses for their clients, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the country's reform and opening policy and the more
stringent standards for lawyers, many highly qualified people are
attracted to the profession," Jia Wuguang, deputy director of the
Beijing Municipal Justice Bureau, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
About 50-60 percent of Beijing's lawyers have a bachelor's
degree in law and 13 percent a master's degree or above. Many of
them have worked with law firms in other countries, Jia said.
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 20 Beijing lawyers are sent to other countries
for professional training, he said, adding that a Beijing law firm
even opened a New York branch in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign branches offer good opportunities for Chinese lawyers
to strengthen contacts with foreign lawyers," he said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 73 law firms of Britain, the United States, France,
Hong Kong, Australia, Japan, Germany, Canada, Italy and Singapore
have been allowed to open offices in China, 34 of which are in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of offices in Beijing by overseas law firms helps
promote the quality and supervision of Beijing lawyers," Jia noted.
</P>
<P>
He also called for self-discipline of the law firms, adding
that local judicial authorities should tighten macro-control over
management of lawyers and law firms.

<HEADLINE> Albania Adopts Law to Accept Multinational Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian parliament today
passed a law to welcome deployment of a multinational force to
protect humanitarian relief operations and help restore order in
the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The law, passed with 97 votes for and one against, became
effective immediately from March 30.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the parliament said the law has paved a way for
the relief operations of the European-dominated multinational
force approved by the United Nations last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last Friday passed resolution 1101 to
authorize the dispatch of a multinational force led by Italy,
which is expected to consist of 2,500 troops and will enjoy a
three-month mandate for relief operations in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Foreign Minister Arjan Starova today said it was
essential that the multinational force be deployed quickly to
oversee relief operations and help stabilize the country.
</P>
<P>
Albania has repeatedly asked for foreign military assistance
since massive protests, sparked by the collapse of pyramid savings
schemes that made thousands of Albanians penniless, turned into
armed revolt earlier this month. More than 150 people were killed
in violence.

SHENYANG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Eleven tons of waste ammunition
left by the Japanese troops some 50 years ago have been destroyed
in Fushun city in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
It took four days to destroy the ammunition -- 1,205 shells,

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 30 (AFP) - Jacques Villeneuve survived an off
course trip in his Williams-Renault to take the Brazilian Grand
Prix in Sao Paolo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Gerhard Berger in a Benetton-Renault was second and
Olivier Panis in the newly-formed Prost team third.
</P>
<P>
It was a dramatic win for the 25-year-old Canadian who, despite
being in pole position, made a mess of the start and went off on
the first bend as he tried to go round the outside of Michael
Schumacher's Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve managed to get his car back onto the circuit after
ploughing across a sand trap but the front nose was damaged and a
trip back to the pits for repairs was certain.
</P>
<P>
But several other drivers had problems at the first bend,
including Ireland's Eddie Irvine in the second Ferrari. Irvine,
invloved in a first bend tussle in the Australian Grand Prix three
weeks ago, clashed with Jan Magnussen's Stewart.
</P>
<P>
With wreckage on the track and Rubens Barrichello in the second
Stewart stuck on the grid, organisers stopped the race and ordered
a restart.
</P>
<P>
A relieved Villeneuve was able to repair his damaged Williams
and get back on to pole spot for the restart, 20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Despite losing out to Schumacher for a second time in the dash
to the first bend, Villeneuve snatched the lead at the end of the
start-finish straight on the first lap and ran a faultless race.
</P>
<P>
Only Berger, four seconds back, remained in sight of the flying
Villeneuve who went on to collect his fifth grand prix victory in
only his second season.
</P>
<P>
The win put him on top, along with Australian winner David
Coulthard, in the driver's championship. Both men have 10
points. Berger moved into third place, only a point behind, with
Schumacher in fourth, on eight points.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard, who had been struggling all weekend with the
handling of his McLaren Mercedes finished in tenth place, a lap
behind the Canadian.
</P>
<P>
Damon Hill, who failed to even start the opening race of the
season in Australia when his Arrows suffered mechanical trouble,
managed to last 68 of the 72 laps until his engine caught fire as
he drove into the pits.
</P>
<P>
Mika Hakkinen in a McLaren-Mercedes finished fourth ahead of
Michael Schumacher and Jean Alesi in the second Benneton finished
sixth.
</P>
<P>
Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who took Hill's place in the Williams
team, could only finish in ninth spot, well out of the points.

In his 12-year career, Muster had won only one hardcourt title,
in 1990 at Adelaide. Muster has won 43 career ATP titles,
including the 1995 French Open.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera, who had slipped to 81st in the world last year with
injuries, will jump into the ATP top 20 on Monday when the new
ranking was released.
</P>
<P>
The win earned Muster 360,000 U.S. dollars top prize and
Bruguera got 190,000.
</P>
<P>
Muster has a 12-3 lifetime record against Bruguera, the 1993
and 1994 winner of the French Open.

<HEADLINE> US to Review Its  Role in Disbursing Nazi Victims' Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration has
agreed to review whether the U.S. government unfairly confiscated
funds deposited in New York banks by European Jews who may have
perished in the Holocaust, the Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to shine the spotlight of history on the role
of other countries, then we have an equal obligation to be willing
to shine the spotlight of history on our own involvement," the
Post quoted Commerce Undersecretary Stuart Eizenstat as saying.
</P>
<P>
The issue of U.S. involvement was raised earlier this month in
a letter to Eizenstat from Seymour Rubin, a former State
Department lawyer who served as chief U.S. negotiator during
post-war negotiations with Switzerland over looted Nazi gold
deposited in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
Rubin asserted that at least six million dollars -- equivalent
to 39 million dollars today -- in unclaimed New York bank deposits
may have belonged to Jews murdered by the Germans.
</P>
<P>
The six million dollar estimate may be a small fraction of the
money deposited in the United States by Europeans who later
perished, Rubin said. For one thing, the figure included only sums
deposited in New York, not other U.S. cities. Furthermore, it does
not include all deposits in U.S. branches of Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
The study headed by Eizenstat, now scheduled for release next
month and intended to examine what the U.S. government knew about
the movement of money in Europe before and during the war "will
not complete" without scrutinizing the ultimate fate of such
funds, Rubin said in the letter.

<HEADLINE> Albanian PM Stresses Good Relations with Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Baschim
Fino, who is expected in Athens on Wednesday at the invitation of
the Greek government, stressed today that the good relations
between the two neighboring countries can not be harmed by
midunderstanding caused by statements of certain Albanian
parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) in
Tirana, which was released here this evening, Fino reiterated the
position of his government regarding the state of Greek-Albanian
relations. He said the parliamentarians can say whatever they
please within the the freedom offered by the institution of
parliament but such statements cannot influence the Greek and
Albanian governments.
</P>
<P>
Some Albanian parliamentarians, including the outgoing Albanian
secret service chief, accused Greece last week of interfering in
the country's internal affairs and plotting to "liberate" southern
Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government rejected such accusations, saying such
claims were "not even worthy of being denied."
</P>
<P>
On his forthcoming visit to Greece, Fino said he believed that
Greece together with Italy have assisted in solving the Albania's
problems, something that the Albanian people are grateful for.
</P>
<P>
"By making contacts and presenting the chaotic situation which
exists in my country, I hope to secure more humanitarian and
financial aid and, at the same time, as the leader of a national
reconciliation government, to stress that we are open and prepared
to co-operate with the Greek government", Fino said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said
today that Greece would be ready by the end of the week to
contribute an army battalion to the multinational force that will
oversee aid distribution in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Although the minister did not say how many troops Greece would
send to Albania, local press reported that number of such troops
would be around 600-800.

<HEADLINE> Arab Resolution Suggests Suspension of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Council tonight
called for suspending normalization steps between Arab states and
Israel in a significant move designed to force Israel to back down
from its hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the 22-member league, during their
evening session, approved a resolution proposed by Syria calling
for freezing all steps to normalize ties with Israel in response
to Israel's Judaization attempt on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution envisages the closures of legations and
bureaus until Israel abides by the Madrid conference principles,
the land-for-peace principle, and all agreements reached during
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also recommended the suspension of Arab
participation in the multilateral peace talks on the achievement
of full-fledged peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Council meeting, though a routine one, came as
a critical timing as Israel broke ground for the 6,500-unit Jewish
neighborhood in East Jerusalem, a move that has sparked
Palestinian rioting on the 10th day running and put the peace
process in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Israel has diplomatic ties with Egypt and Jordan and set up
trade links with Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers, at their evening session, also approved
the draft resolutions they examined earlier in the day on
developments of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Palestinian cause,
Jerusalem, development on Palestinian lands, the Palestinian
Intifada (uprising), settlement activities in occupied lands and
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will meet tomorrow morning to discuss a number of
draft resolutions on other political issues on their
agenda.
